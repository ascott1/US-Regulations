                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2012), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

INQUIRIES

    For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this 
volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at

    Source: 68 FR 19090, Apr. 17, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.8980  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) and work practice standards for hazardous air 
pollutants (HAP) emitted from hydrochloric acid (HCl) production. This 
subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and 
continuous compliance with the emission limitations and work practice 
standards.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8985  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an HCl 
production facility that produces a liquid HCl product at a 
concentration of 30 weight percent or greater during its normal 
operations and is located at, or is part of, a major source of HAP. This 
does not include HCl production facilities that only produce 
occasionally liquid HCl product at a concentration of 30 weight percent 
or greater.
    (1) An HCl production facility is the collection of unit operations 
and equipment associated with the production of liquid HCl product. The 
HCl production facility begins at the point where a gaseous stream 
containing HCl enters the HCl production unit. The HCl production 
facility includes all HCl storage tanks that contain liquid HCl product 
that is produced in the HCl production unit, with the exceptions noted 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The HCl production facility also 
includes all HCl transfer operations that load

[[Page 21]]

HCl product produced in the HCl production unit into a tank truck, rail 
car, ship, or barge, along with the piping and other equipment in HCl 
service used to transfer liquid HCl product from the HCl production unit 
to the HCl storage tanks and/or HCl transfer operations. The HCl 
production facility ends at the point that the liquid HCl product 
produced in the HCl production unit is loaded into a tank truck, rail 
car, ship, or barge, at the point the HCl product enters another process 
on the plant site, or at the point the HCl product leaves the plant site 
via pipeline.
    (2) Storage tanks that are dedicated feedstock tanks for another 
process and storage tanks that store HCl dedicated for use in wastewater 
treatment are not considered part of an HCl production facility.
    (3) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or 
group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common 
control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate 
of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP 
at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
    (b) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it 
is also subject to NESHAP under one of the subparts listed in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) 40 CFR part 63, subpart S, National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry.
    (2) 40 CFR part 63, subpart CCC, National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants for Steel Pickling--HCl Process Facilities and

Standards for Closed Vent Systems, Control Devices, Recovery Devices and 
Routing to a Fuel Gas System or a Process.
    (5) 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, National Emission Standards for 
Pharmaceuticals Production.
    (c) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it 
is located following the incineration of chlorinated waste gas streams, 
waste liquids, or solid wastes, and the emissions from the HCl 
production facility are subject to section 63.113(c), subpart G, 
National Emission Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from 
the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry for Process Vents, 
Storage Vessels, Transfer Operations, and Wastewater.
    (d) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it 
produces HCl through the direct synthesis of hydrogen and chlorine and 
is part of a chlor-alkali facility.
    (e) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it 
is a research and development facility.
    (f) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if all 
of the gaseous streams containing HCl and chlorine (Cl<INF>2</INF>) from 
HCl process vents, HCl storage tanks, and HCl transfer operations are 
recycled or routed to another process prior to being discharged to the 
atmosphere.

    Source: 68 FR 28785, May 27, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.9280  What is the purpose of subpart PPPPP?

    This subpart PPPPP establishes national emission standards for 
hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for engine test cells/stands located 
at major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions. This 
subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and 
continuous compliance with the emission limitations contained in this 
NESHAP.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9285  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an engine test 
cell/stand that is located at a major source of HAP emissions.
    (a) An engine test cell/stand is any apparatus used for testing 
uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) engines.
    (b) An uninstalled engine is an engine that is not installed in, or 
an integrated part of, the final product.
    (c) A major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or 
has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 
megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 
tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9290  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source.

[[Page 39]]

    (a) Affected source. An affected source is the collection of all 
equipment and activities associated with engine test cells/stands used 
for testing uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) 
engines located at a major source of HAP emissions.
    (1) Existing affected source. An affected source is existing if you 
commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or 
before May 14, 2002. A change in ownership of an existing affected 
source does not make that affected source a new or reconstructed 
affected source.
    (2) New affected source. An affected source is new if you commenced 
construction of the affected source after May 14, 2002.
    (3) Reconstructed affected source. An affected source is 
reconstructed if you meet the definition of reconstruction in Sec. 63.2 
of subpart A of this part and reconstruction is commenced after May 14, 
2002. Changes made to an existing affected source primarily for the 
purpose of complying with revisions to engine testing requirements under 
40 CFR parts 80, 86, 89, 90, 91, or 92 are not considered a modification 
or reconstruction. In addition, passive measurement and control 
instrumentation and electronics are not included as part of any affected 
source reconstruction evaluation.
    (b) Existing affected sources do not have to meet the requirements 
of this subpart and of subpart A of this part.
    (c) Any portion of a new or reconstructed affected source located at 
a major source that is used exclusively for testing internal combustion 
engines with rated power of less than 25 horsepower (hp) (19 
kilowatts(kW)) does not have to meet the requirements of this subpart 
and of subpart A of this part except for the initial notification 
requirements of Sec. 63.9345(b).
    (d) Any portion of a new or reconstructed affected source located at 
a major source that meets any of the criteria specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (4) of this section does not have to meet the 
requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part.
    (1) Any portion of the affected source used exclusively for testing 
combustion turbine engines.
    (2) Any portion of the affected source used exclusively for testing 
rocket engines.
    (3) Any portion of the affected source used in research and teaching 
activities at facilities that are not engaged in the development of 
engines or engine test services for commercial purposes.
    (4) Any portion of the affected source operated to test or evaluate 
fuels (such as knock engines), transmissions, or electronics.

[68 FR 28785, May 27, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 20470, Apr. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 63.9306  What are my continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) 

installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?

    (a) General. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS 
specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section according to 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section. You must install, 
operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section according to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section.
    (1) The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for 
each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four 
equally spaced successive cycles of CPMS operation in 1 hour.
    (2) You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each 
successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on 
control device operation.
    (3) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and 
validation check of the CPMS.
    (4) You must maintain the CPMS at all times and have available 
necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
    (5) You must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system 
and add-on control device parameter data at all times that an engine 
test cell/stand is operating, except during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities 
(including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span 
adjustments).
    (6) You must not use emission capture system or add-on control 
device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality 
assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must 
use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the 
data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture 
system and add-on control device operating limits.
    (7) A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not 
reasonably preventable failure of the CPMS to provide valid data. 
Monitoring failures

[[Page 41]]

that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are 
not malfunctions. Any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-
control and data are not available for required calculations is a 
deviation from the monitoring requirements.
    (b) Capture system bypass line. You must meet the requirements of 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture 
system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from 
the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
    (1) You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism 
controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way 
that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a 
record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure 
the valve or closure mechanism must meet one of the requirements 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) Flow control position indicator. Install, calibrate, maintain, 
and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow 
control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 
minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are 
directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on 
control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be 
recorded, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow 
control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any 
bypass line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control 
device to the atmosphere.
    (ii) Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures. Secure any bypass line 
valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type 
configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism 
at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the 
closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on 
control device to the atmosphere.
    (iii) Valve closure monitoring. Ensure that any bypass line valve is 
in the closed (nondiverting) position through monitoring of valve 
position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring 
system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will 
indicate valve position.
    (iv) Automatic shutdown system. Use an automatic shutdown system in 
which the engine testing operation is stopped when flow is diverted by 
the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere 
when an engine test cell/stand is operating. You must inspect the 
automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it 
will detect diversions of flow and shut down the engine test cell/stand 
in operation.
    (2) If any bypass line is opened, you must include a description of 
why the bypass line was opened and the length of time it remained open 
in the semiannual compliance reports required in Sec. 63.9350.
    (c) Thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers. If you are using a 
thermal oxidizer or catalytic oxidizer as an add-on control device, you 
must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of 
this section.
    (1) For a thermal oxidizer, install a gas temperature monitor in the 
firebox of the thermal oxidizer or in the duct immediately downstream of 
the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
    (2) For a catalytic oxidizer, you must install a gas temperature 
monitor in the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed, and if 
you established operating limits according to Sec. 63.9324(b)(1) and 
(2), also install a gas temperature monitor in the gas stream 
immediately after the catalyst bed.
    (i) If you establish operating limits according to Sec. 
63.9324(b)(1) and (2), then you must install the gas temperature 
monitors both upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed. The 
temperature monitors must be in the gas stream immediately before and 
after the catalyst bed to measure the temperature difference across the 
bed.
    (ii) If you establish operating limits according to Sec. 
63.9324(b)(3) and (4), then you must install a gas temperature monitor 
upstream of the catalyst bed. The temperature monitor must be in the gas 
stream immediately before the catalyst bed to measure the temperature.
    (3) For all thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers, you must meet 
the

[[Page 42]]

requirements in paragraphs (a) and (c)(3)(i) through (vii) of this 
section for each gas temperature monitoring device.
    (i) Locate the temperature sensor in a position that provides a 
representative temperature.
    (ii) Use a temperature sensor with a measurement sensitivity of 4 
degrees Fahrenheit or 0.75 percent of the temperature value, whichever 
is larger.

interference and chemical contaminants.
    (iv) If a gas temperature chart recorder is used, it must have a 
measurement sensitivity in the minor division of at least 20 degrees 
Fahrenheit.
    (v) Perform an electronic calibration at least semiannually 
according to the procedures in the manufacturer's owner's manual. 
Following the electronic calibration, you must conduct a temperature 
sensor validation check in which a second or redundant temperature 
sensor placed near the process temperature sensor must yield a reading 
within 30 degrees Fahrenheit of the process temperature sensor reading.
    (vi) Conduct calibration and validation checks anytime the sensor 
exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating temperature range 
or install a new temperature sensor.
    (vii) At least monthly, inspect components for integrity and 
electrical connections for continuity, oxidation, and galvanic 
corrosion.
    (d) Emission capture systems. The capture system monitoring system 
must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (1) For each flow measurement device, you must meet the requirements 
in paragraphs (a) and (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) Locate a flow sensor in a position that provides a 
representative flow measurement in the duct from each capture device in 
the emission capture system to the add-on control device.
    (ii) Reduce swirling flow or abnormal velocity distributions due to 
upstream and downstream disturbances.
    (iii) Conduct a flow sensor calibration check at least semiannually.
    (iv) At least monthly, inspect components for integrity, electrical 
connections for continuity, and mechanical connections for leakage.
    (2) For each pressure drop measurement device, you must comply with 
the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this 
section.
    (i) Locate the pressure sensor(s) in or as close to a position that 
provides a representative measurement of the pressure drop across each 
opening you are monitoring.
    (ii) Minimize or eliminate pulsating pressure, vibration, and 
internal and external corrosion.
    (iii) Check pressure tap pluggage daily.
    (iv) Using an inclined manometer with a measurement sensitivity of 
0.0002 inch water, check gauge calibration quarterly and transducer 
calibration monthly.
    (v) Conduct calibration checks any time the sensor exceeds the 
manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range or install a 
new pressure sensor.
    (vi) At least monthly, inspect components for integrity, electrical 
connections for continuity, and mechanical connections for leakage.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9307  What are my continuous emissions monitoring system installation, 

operation, and maintenance requirements?

    (a) You must install, operate, and maintain each CEMS to monitor 
carbon monoxide (CO) or total hydrocarbons (THC) and oxygen 
(O<INF>2</INF>) at the outlet of the exhaust system of the engine test 
cell/stand or at the outlet of the emission control device.
    (b) To comply with the CO or THC percent reduction emission 
limitation, you may install, operate, and maintain a CEMS to monitor CO 
or THC and O<INF>2</INF> at both the inlet and the outlet of the 
emission control device.
    (c) To comply with either emission limitations, the CEMS must be 
installed and operated according to the requirements described in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) You must install, operate, and maintain each CEMS according to 
the applicable Performance Specification (PS) of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix B (PS-3 or PS-4A).
    (2) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according 
to

[[Page 43]]

the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to PS-3 of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix B, using Reference Method 3A or 3B for the O<INF>2</INF> CEMS, 
and according to PS-4A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, using Reference 
Method 10 or 10B for the CO CEMS. If the fuel used in the engines being 
tested is natural gas, you may use ASTM D 6522-00, Standard Test Method 
for Determination of Nitrogen Oxides, Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen 
Concentrations in Emissions from Natural Gas Fired Reciprocating 
Engines, Combustion Turbines, Boilers, and Process Heaters Using 
Portable Analyzers (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14). As an 
alternative to Method 3B, you may use ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, ``Flue 
and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus],'' 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14).
    (3) As specified in Sec. 63.8(c)(4)(ii), each CEMS must complete a 
minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data 
recording) for each successive 15-minute period. You must have at least 
two data points, each representing a different 15-minute period within 
the same hour, to have a valid hour of data.
    (4) All CEMS data must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2) 
and recorded as CO concentration in parts per million by volume, dry 
basis (ppmvd), corrected to 15 percent O<INF>2</INF> content.
    (d) If you have CEMS that are subject to paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this section, you must properly maintain and operate the monitors 
continuously according to the requirements described in paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Proper maintenance. You must maintain the monitoring equipment 
at all times that the engine test cell/stand is operating, including but 
not limited to, maintaining necessary parts for routine repairs of the 
monitoring equipment.
    (2) Continued operation. You must operate your CEMS according to 
paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) You must conduct all monitoring in continuous operation at all 
times that the engine test cell/stand is operating, except for, as 
applicable, monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required 
quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, 
calibration drift checks and required zero and high-level adjustments). 
Quality assurance or control activities must be performed according to 
procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.
    (ii) Data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated 
repairs, out-of-control periods, and required quality assurance or 
control activities must not be used for purposes of calculating data 
averages. You must use all of the data collected from all other periods 
in assessing compliance. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, 
infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring 
equipment to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in 
part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Any 
period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are 
not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the 
monitoring requirements.

               Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9310  By what date must I conduct the initial compliance 

demonstrations?

    You must conduct the initial compliance demonstrations that apply to 
you in Table 3 to this subpart within 180 calendar days after the 
compliance date that is specified for your new or reconstructed affected 
source in Sec. 63.9295 and according to the provisions in Sec. 
63.7(a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 63.9320  What procedures must I use?

    (a) You must conduct each initial compliance demonstration that 
applies to you in Table 3 to this subpart.
    (b) You must conduct an initial performance evaluation of each 
capture and control system according to Sec. Sec. 63.9321, 63.9322, 
63.9323 and 63.9324, and each CEMS according to the requirements in 40 
CFR 63.8 and according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix B (PS-3 or PS-4A).
    (c) The initial demonstration of compliance with the carbon monoxide 
(CO) or total hydrocarbon (THC) concentration limitation consists of the 
first 4-

[[Page 44]]

hour rolling average CO or THC concentration recorded after completion 
of the CEMS performance evaluation. You must correct the CO or THC 
concentration at the outlet of the engine test cell/stand or the 
emission control device to a dry basis and to 15 percent O<INF>2</INF> 
content according to Equation 1 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MY03.002

Where:

C<INF>c</INF> = concentration of CO or THC, corrected to 15 percent 
oxygen, ppmvd
C<INF>unc</INF> = total uncorrected concentration of CO or THC, ppmvd
%O<INF>2d</INF> = concentration of oxygen measured in gas stream, dry 
basis, percent by volume.

    (d) The initial demonstration of compliance with the CO or THC 
percent reduction emission limitation consists of the first 4-hour 
rolling average percent reduction in CO or THC recorded after completion 
of the performance evaluation of the capture/control system and/or CEMS. 
You must complete the actions described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (2) 
of this section.
    (1) Correct the CO or THC concentrations at the inlet and outlet of 
the emission control device to a dry basis and to 15 percent 
O<INF>2</INF> content using Equation 1 of this section.
    (2) Calculate the percent reduction in CO or THC using Equation 2 of 
this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MY03.003

Where:

R = percent reduction in CO or THC
C<INF>i</INF> = corrected CO or THC concentration at inlet of the 
emission control device
C<INF>o</INF> = corrected CO or THC concentration at the outlet of the 
emission control device.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9321  What are the general requirements for performance tests?

    (a) You must conduct each performance test required by Sec. 63.9310 
according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7(e)(1) and under the 
conditions in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance 
test according to the provisions in Sec. 63.7(h).
    (1) Representative engine testing conditions. You must conduct the 
performance test under representative operating conditions for the test 
cell/stand. Operations during periods of SSM, and during periods of 
nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions. You must 
record the process information that is necessary to document operating 
conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent 
normal operation.
    (2) Representative emission capture system and add-on control device 
operating conditions. You must conduct the performance test when the 
emission capture system and add-on control device are operating at a 
representative flow rate, and the add-on control device is operating at 
a representative inlet concentration. You must record information that 
is necessary to document emission capture system and add-on control 
device operating conditions during the test and explain why the 
conditions represent normal operation.
    (b) You must conduct each performance test of an emission capture 
system according to the requirements in Sec. 63.9322. You must conduct 
each performance test of an add-on control device according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.9323.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9322  How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?

    You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to 
determine capture efficiency as part of the performance test required by 
Sec. 63.9310.
    (a) Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency. You may assume the 
capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both conditions in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:
    (1) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix 
M to 40 CFR part 51 for a potential to emit (PTE) and directs all the 
exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.
    (2) All engine test operations creating exhaust gases for which the 
test is applicable are conducted within the capture system.
    (b) Measuring capture efficiency. If the capture system does not 
meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you 
must use one of the

[[Page 45]]

two protocols described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to 
measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency measurements use 
total volatile hydrocarbon (TVH) capture efficiency as a surrogate for 
organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocol in paragraph (c) of 
this section, the capture efficiency measurement must consist of three 
test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours in duration or the 
length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 hours. For the 
purposes of this test, a production run means the time required for a 
single engine test to go from the beginning to the end.
    (c) Gas-to-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or a 
building enclosure. The gas-to-gas protocol compares the mass of TVH 
emissions captured by the emission capture system to the mass of TVH 
emissions not captured. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building 
enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this 
section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the gas-to-
gas protocol.
    (1) Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around 
the engine test cell/stand and all areas where emissions from the engine 
testing subsequently occur. The enclosure must meet the applicable 
definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in 
Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
    (2) Use Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to 
measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions captured by the emission 
capture system during each capture efficiency test run as measured at 
the inlet to the add-on control device. To make the measurement, 
substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
    (i) The sampling points for the Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 
40 CFR part 51 measurement must be upstream from the add-on control 
device and must represent total emissions routed from the capture system 
and entering the add-on control device.
    (ii) If multiple emission streams from the capture system enter the 
add-on control device without a single common duct, then the emissions 
entering the add-on control device must be simultaneously measured in 
each duct, and the total emissions entering the add-on control device 
must be determined.
    (3) Use Method 204D or 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to 
measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by 
the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the 
temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture 
efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each 
occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
    (i) Use Method 204D of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the enclosure 
is a temporary total enclosure.
    (ii) Use Method 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the 
enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency 
measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the 
building enclosure, other than the engine test cell/stand operation for 
which capture efficiency is being determined, must be shut down, but all 
fans and blowers must be operating normally.
    (4) For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent 
capture efficiency of the emission capture system using Equation 1 of 
this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MY03.004

Where:

CE = capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the 
add-on control device, percent
TVH<INF>captured</INF> = total mass of TVH captured by the emission 
capture system as measured at the inlet to the add-on control device 
during the emission capture efficiency test

[[Page 46]]

run, kg, determined according to paragraph (c)(2) of this section
TVH<INF>uncaptured</INF> = total mass of TVH that is not captured by the 
emission capture system and that exits from the temporary total 
enclosure or building enclosure during the capture efficiency test run, 
kg, determined according to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

    (5) Determine the capture efficiency the emission capture system as 
the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.
    (d) Alternative capture efficiency protocol. As an alternative to 
the procedure specified in paragraph (c) of this section, you may 
determine capture efficiency using any other capture efficiency protocol 
and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the data quality 
objective or lower control limit approach as described in appendix A to 
subpart KK of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9323  How do I determine the add-on control device emission 

destruction or removal efficiency?

    You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to 
determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal 
efficiency as part of the performance test required by Sec. 63.9310. 
You must conduct three test runs as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(3), and 
each test run must last at least 1 hour.
    (a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) Use Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as 
appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.
    (2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 
60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
    (3) Use Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as 
appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. The 
ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 Part 10 is an acceptable alternative to Method 
3B (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14).
    (4) Use Method 4 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, to determine stack 
gas moisture.
    (5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular 
weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during 
each test run.
    (b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon at the 
inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously, using 
either Method 25 or 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. You must use the same 
method for both the inlet and outlet measurements.
    (1) Use Method 25 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on 
control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic 
concentration as carbon to be more than 50 parts per million at the 
control device outlet.
    (2) Use Method 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on 
control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic 
concentration as carbon to be 50 ppm or less at the control device 
outlet.
    (c) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions 
mass flow rates for the inlet and the outlet of the add-on control 
device, using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one 
inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the 
total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section 
for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions 
and total all of the outlet emissions.

Sec. 63.9324  How do I establish the emission capture system and add-on 

control device operating limits during the performance test?

    During the performance test required by Sec. 63.9310, you must 
establish the operating limits required by Sec. 63.9302 according to 
this section, unless you have received approval for alternative 
monitoring and operating limits under Sec. 63.8(f) as specified in 
Sec. 63.9302.
    (a) Thermal oxidizers. If your add-on control device is a thermal 
oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the 
combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the 
three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the 
thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any 
substantial heat exchange occurs.
    (2) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate 
and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the 
performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum 
operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
    (b) Catalytic oxidizers. If your add-on control device is a 
catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) or paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
    (1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the 
temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference 
across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of 
the three test runs.
    (2) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate 
and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the 
average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during 
the performance test. These are the minimum operating limits for your 
catalytic oxidizer.
    (3) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference 
across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to 
the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and 
maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor 
and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once 
every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data 
collected during the performance test to calculate and record the 
average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance 
test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
    (4) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance 
plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor 
according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The plan must address, at 
a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) 
of this section.
    (i) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (i.e., 
conversion

[[Page 48]]

efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's 
recommended procedures.
    (ii) Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner 
assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust 
the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.
    (iii) Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the 
catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If 
problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the 
manufacturer's recommendation and conduct a new performance test to 
determine destruction efficiency according to Sec. 63.9323.
    (c) Emission capture system. For each capture device that is not 
part of a PTE that meets the criteria of Sec. 63.9322(a), establish an 
operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static 
pressure, as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. The 
operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 3 to this subpart.
    (1) During the capture efficiency determination required by Sec. 
63.9310, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate 
or the duct static pressure for each separate capture device in your 
emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of 
the three test runs at a point in the duct between the capture device 
and the add-on control device inlet.
    (2) Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or 
duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device. 
This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the 
minimum operating limit for that specific capture device.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9330  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission 

limitation?

    (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with the emission

adjustments of the monitoring system), you must conduct all monitoring 
in continuous operation at all times the engine test cell/stand is 
operating.
    (b) Do not use data recorded during monitor malfunctions, associated 
repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities 
for meeting the requirements of this subpart, including data averages 
and calculations. You must use all the data collected during all other 
periods in assessing the performance of the emission control device or 
in assessing emissions from the new or reconstructed affected source.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9340  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 

limitations?

this section. These instances are deviations from the emission 
limitation in this subpart and must be reported according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.9350.
    (1) You must report each instance in which you did not meet the 
emission limitation that applies to you.
    (2) You must report each instance in which you did not meet the 
requirements in Table 7 to this subpart that apply to you.
    (c) Startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (1) Consistent with 
Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period 
of SSM of control devices and associated monitoring equipment are not 
violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1).

[[Page 49]]

    (2) The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur 
during a period of SSM of control devices and associated monitoring 
equipment are violations, according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).

combusted. Fuel may enter the combustion chamber with the air or be 
injected into the combustion chamber. Expansion of the hot combustion 
gases in the chamber rotates a shaft, either through a reciprocating or 
rotary action. For purposes of this subpart, this definition does not 
include combustion turbine engines.
    Major source, as used in this subpart, shall have the same meaning 
as in Sec. 63.2.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process 
equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner which 
causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in an 
applicable standard to be exceeded. Failures that are caused in part by 
poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
    Rated power means the maximum power output of an engine in use.
    Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source 
to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any 
physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the stationary 
source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment 
and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of 
material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of 
its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is 
federally enforceable.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined by 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Rocket engine means a device consisting of a combustion chamber in 
which materials referred to as propellants, which provide both the fuel 
and the oxygen for combustion, are burned. Combustion gases escape 
through a nozzle, providing thrust.
    Uninstalled engine means an engine not installed in, or an 
integrated part of, the final product.

             for Friction Materials Manufacturing Facilities

    Source: 67 FR 64506, Oct. 18, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.9480  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) for friction materials manufacturing facilities 
that use

[[Page 63]]

a solvent-based process. This subpart also establishes requirements to 
demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with all applicable 
emission limitations in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9485  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a friction 
materials manufacturing facility (as defined in Sec. 63.9565) that is 
(or is part of) a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) 
emissions on the first compliance date that applies to you, as specified 
in Sec. 63.9495. Your friction materials manufacturing facility is a 
major source of HAP if it emits or has the potential to emit any single 
HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any 
combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per 
year.
    (b) The requirements in this subpart do not apply to research and 
development facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the Clean Air 
Act.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9490  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source at your friction materials manufacturing facility.
    (b) The affected source covered by this subpart is each new, 
reconstructed, or existing solvent mixer (as defined in Sec. 63.9565) 
at your friction materials manufacturing facility.
    (c) A solvent mixer at your friction materials manufacturing 
facility is new if you commence construction of the solvent mixer after 
October 18, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the 
definition of ``reconstruction'' in Sec. 63.2, and reconstruction is 
commenced after October 18, 2002.
    (d) A solvent mixer at your friction materials manufacturing 
facility is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9495  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have an existing solvent mixer, you must comply with each 
of the requirements for existing sources no later than October 18, 2005.
    (b) If you have a new or reconstructed solvent mixer and its initial 
startup date is after October 18, 2002, you must comply with the 
requirements for new and reconstructed sources upon initial startup.
    (c) If your friction materials manufacturing facility is an area 
source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that 
it becomes a (or part of a) major source of HAP emissions, then 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section apply.
    (1) For any portion of the area source that becomes a new or 
reconstructed affected source, you must comply with the requirements for 
new and reconstructed sources upon startup or no later than October 18, 
2002, whichever is later.
    (2) For any portion of the area source that becomes an existing 
affected source, you must comply with the requirements for existing 
sources no later than 1 year after the area source becomes a major 
source or no later than October 18, 2005, whichever is later.
    (d) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in 
Sec. 63.9535. Several of the notifications must be submitted before the 
compliance date for your affected source.

                          Emission Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 63.9500  What emission limitations must I meet?

    (a) For each new, reconstructed, or existing large solvent mixer at 
your friction materials manufacturing facility, you must limit HAP 
solvent emissions to the atmosphere to no more than 30 percent of that 
which would otherwise be emitted in the absence of solvent recovery and/
or solvent substitution, based on a 7-day block average.
    (b) For each new, reconstructed, or existing small solvent mixer at 
your friction materials manufacturing facility, you must limit HAP 
solvent emissions to the atmosphere to no more than 15 percent of that 
which would otherwise be emitted in the absence of solvent recovery and/
or solvent substitution, based on a 7-day block average.

[[Page 64]]

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9505  What are my general requirements for complying with this 

subpart?

    (a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitation in this 
subpart at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction.
    (b) You must always operate and maintain your affected source, 
including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, according to 
the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i).
    (c) You must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e)(3).

[67 FR 64506, Oct. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 20470, Apr. 20, 2006]

              Initial Compliance Demonstration Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9510  By what date must I conduct my initial compliance demonstration?

    (a) If you use a solvent recovery system and/or solvent 
substitution, you must conduct your initial compliance demonstration 
within 7 calendar days after the compliance date that is specified for 
your source in Sec. 63.9495.
    (b) If you use a control technique other than a solvent recovery 
system and/or solvent substitution, you must comply with the provisions 
in Sec. 63.9570.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9515  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission 

limitation that applies to me?

    (a) You have demonstrated initial compliance for each new, 
reconstructed, or existing large solvent mixer subject to the emission 
limitation in Sec. 63.9500(a) if the HAP solvent discharged to the 
atmosphere during the first 7 days after the compliance date, determined 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.9520, does not exceed a 7-day 
block average of 30 percent of that which would otherwise be emitted in 
the absence of solvent recovery and/or solvent substitution.
    (b) You have demonstrated initial compliance for each new, 
reconstructed, or existing small solvent mixer subject to the emission 
limitation in Sec. 63.9500(b) if the HAP solvent discharged to the 
atmosphere during the first 7 days after the compliance date, determined 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.9520, does not exceed a 7-day 
block average of 15 percent of that which would otherwise be emitted in 
the absence of solvent recovery and/or solvent substitution.
    (c) You must submit a notification of compliance status containing 
the results of the initial compliance demonstration according to Sec. 
63.9535(e).


<R05>
Sec. 63.9520  What procedures must I use to demonstrate initial compliance?

    (a) If you use a solvent recovery system, you must use the 
procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section to 
demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations in Sec. 
63.9500(a) and (b).
    (1) Record the date and time of each mix batch.
    (2) Record the identity of each mix batch using a unique batch ID, 
as defined in Sec. 63.9565.
    (3) Measure and record the weight of HAP solvent loaded into the 
solvent mixer for each mix batch.
    (4) Measure and record the weight of HAP solvent recovered for each 
mix batch.
    (5) If you use a solvent recovery system, you must determine the 
percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere for each mix batch 
according to Equation 1 of this section as follows:

(Eq. 1)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18OC02.002

Where:

P<INF>b</INF> = Percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere for 
each mix batch, percent;
S<INF>rec</INF> = Weight of HAP solvent recovered for each mix batch, 
lb;
S<INF>mix</INF> = Weight of HAP solvent loaded into the solvent mixer 
for each mix batch, lb.

    (6) If you use solvent substitution for a mix batch, you must record 
the use of a non-HAP material as a substitute for a HAP solvent for that 
mix batch and assign a value of 0 percent to the percent of HAP solvent 
discharged to the atmosphere for that mix batch (Pb).
    (7) Determine the 7-day block average percent of HAP solvent 
discharged

[[Page 65]]

to the atmosphere according to Equation 2 of this section as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18OC02.003

Where:

%P<INF>7</INF> = 7-day block average percent of HAP solvent discharged 
to the atmosphere, percent;
i = mix batch;
n = number of mix batches in 7-day block average.

    (8) Have valid data for at least 90 percent of the mix batches over 
the 7-day averaging period.
    (b) If you use a control technique other than a solvent recovery 
system and/or solvent substitution, you may apply to EPA for approval to 
use an alternative method of demonstrating compliance with the emission 
limitations for solvent mixers in Sec. 63.9500(a) and (b), as provided 
in Sec. 63.9570.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9525  What are the installation, operation, and maintenance 

requirements for my weight measurement device?

    (a) If you use a solvent recovery system, you must install, operate, 
and maintain a weight measurement device to measure the weight of HAP 
solvent loaded into the solvent mixer and the weight of HAP solvent 
recovered for each mix batch.
    (b) For each weight measurement device required by this section, you 
must develop and submit for approval a site-specific monitoring plan 
that addresses the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this 
section:
    (1) Procedures for installing the weight measurement device;
    (2) The minimum accuracy of the weight measurement device in pounds

                 Operation and Maintenance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9600  What are my operation and maintenance requirements?

    (a) As required by Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i), you must always operate and 
maintain your affected source, including air pollution control and 
monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution 
control practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels 
required by this subpart.
    (b) You must prepare, and at all times operate according to, a 
written operation and maintenance plan for each control device applied 
to meet any particulate matter emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart 
and to meet the requirement of each indurating furnace subject to good 
combustion practices (GCP). Each site-specific operation and maintenance 
plan must be submitted to the Administrator on or before the compliance 
date that is specified in Sec. 63.9583 for your affected source. The 
plan you submit must explain why the chosen practices (i.e., quantified 
objectives) are effective in performing corrective actions or GCP in 
minimizing the formation of formaldehyde (and other products of 
incomplete combustion). The Administrator will review the adequacy of 
the site-specific practices and objectives you will follow and the 
records you will keep to demonstrate compliance with your Plan. If the 
Administrator determines that any portion of your operation and 
maintenance plan is not adequate, we can reject those portions of the 
plan, and request that you provide additional information addressing the 
relevant issues. In the interim of this process, you will continue to 
follow your current site-specific practices and objectives, as 
submitted, until your revisions are accepted as adequate by the 
Administrator. You must maintain a current copy of the operation and 
maintenance plan onsite, and it must be available for inspection upon 
request. You must keep the plan for the life of the affected source or 
until the affected source is no longer subject to the requirements of 
this subpart. Each operation and maintenance plan must address the 
elements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) Preventative maintenance for each control device, including a 
preventative maintenance schedule that is consistent with the 
manufacturer's instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.
    (2) Corrective action procedures for bag leak detection systems. In 
the event a bag leak detection system alarm is triggered, you must 
initiate corrective action to determine the cause of the alarm within 1 
hour of the alarm, initiate corrective action to correct the cause of 
the problem within 24 hours of the alarm, and complete the

[[Page 74]]

corrective action as soon as practicable. Corrective actions may 
include, but are not limited to, the actions listed in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
    (i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or 
filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
emissions.
    (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
    (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise 
repairing the control device.
    (iv) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment.
    (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe, or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system.
    (vi) Adjusting the process operation producing the particulate 
emissions.
    (3) Corrective action procedures for continuous parameter monitoring 
systems (CPMS) for all air pollution control devices except for 
baghouses. In the event you exceed an established operating limit for an 
air pollution control device except for a baghouse, you must initiate 
corrective action to determine the cause of the operating limit 
exceedance and complete the corrective action within 10 calendar days. 
The corrective action procedures you take must be consistent with the 
installation, operation, and maintenance procedures listed in your site-
specific CPMS monitoring plan in accordance with Sec. 63.9632(b).
    (4) Good combustion practices for indurating furnaces. You must 
identify and implement a set of site-specific GCP for each type of 
indurating furnace at your plant. These GCP should correspond to your 
standard operating procedures for maintaining the proper and efficient 
combustion within each indurating furnace. Good combustion practices 
include, but are not limited to, the elements listed in paragraphs 
(b)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) Proper operating conditions for each indurating furnace (e.g., 
minimum combustion temperature, maximum carbon monoxide concentration in 
the furnace exhaust gases, burner alignment, or proper fuel-air 
distribution/mixing).
    (ii) Routine inspection and preventative maintenance and 
corresponding schedules of each indurating furnace.
    (iii) Performance analyses of each indurating furnace.
    (iv) Keeping applicable operator logs.
    (v) Keeping applicable records to document compliance with each 
element.

meets the emission limit, determine the opacity value corresponding to 
the 99 percent upper confidence level of a normal distribution of the 6-
minute opacity averages.

average secondary voltage and secondary current value for each dry 
electrostatic precipitator field corresponding to any of the three test 
runs.
    (d) For a wet electrostatic precipitator subject to performance 
testing in Sec. 63.9620 and operating limit in Sec. 63.9590(b)(4), you 
must establish a site-specific operating limit according to the 
procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Using the CPMS required in Sec. 63.9631(e), measure and record

whether each deviation occurred during a period of startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction or during another period.
    (v) A summary of the total duration of the deviation during the 
reporting period and the total duration as a percent of the total source 
operating time during that reporting period.
    (vi) A breakdown of the total duration of the deviations during the 
reporting period including those that are due to startup, shutdown, 
control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and 
other unknown causes.
    (vii) A summary of the total duration of continuous monitoring

semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 
CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the compliance report includes all the 
required information concerning deviations from any emission limitation 
or operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart, submission of 
the compliance report satisfies any obligation to report the same 
deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a 
compliance report does not otherwise affect any obligation you may have 
to report deviations from permit requirements for an affected source to 
your permitting authority.
    (e) Immediate corrective action report. If you had three 
unsuccessful attempts of applying corrective action as described in 
Sec. 63.9634(j) on an emission unit or group of emission units, then

hoppers) of taconite ore or taconite pellets prior to further processing 
or loading.
    Straight grate indurating furnace means a furnace system that 
consists of a traveling grate that carries the taconite pellets through 
different furnace temperature zones. In the straight grate indurating 
furnace a layer of fired pellets, called the hearth layer, is placed on 
the traveling grate prior to the addition of unfired pellets. The 
straight grate indurating furnace begins at the point where the grate 
feed conveyor discharges the green balls onto the furnace traveling 
grate and ends where the hardened pellets drop off of the traveling 
grate.
    Taconite iron ore processing means the separation and concentration 
of iron ore from taconite, a low-grade iron ore, to produce taconite

<R05>
Sec. 63.9780  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) for refractory products manufacturing 
facilities. This

[[Page 96]]

subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and 
continuous compliance with the emission limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9782  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a refractory 
products manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of, a 
major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions according to the 
criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) A refractory products manufacturing facility is a plant site 
that manufactures refractory products (refractory bricks, refractory 
shapes, monolithics, kiln furniture, crucibles, and other materials used 
for lining furnaces and other high temperature process units), as 
defined in Sec. 63.9824. Refractory products manufacturing facilities 
typically process raw material by crushing, grinding, and screening; 
mixing the processed raw materials with binders and other additives; 
forming the refractory mix into shapes; and drying and firing the 
shapes.
    (b) A major source of HAP is a plant site that emits or has the 
potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) 
or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams 
(25 tons) or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9784  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source at a refractory products manufacturing facility.
    (b) The existing affected sources are shape dryers, curing ovens, 
and kilns that are used to manufacture refractory products that use 
organic HAP; shape preheaters, pitch working tanks, defumers, and coking 
ovens that are used to produce pitch-impregnated refractory products; 
kilns that are used to manufacture chromium refractory products; and 
kilns that are used to manufacture clay refractory products.
    (c) The new or reconstructed affected sources are shape dryers, 
curing ovens, and kilns that are used to manufacture refractory products 
that use organic HAP; shape preheaters, pitch working tanks, defumers, 
and coking ovens used to produce pitch-impregnated refractory products; 
kilns that are used to manufacture chromium refractory products; and 
kilns that are used to manufacture clay refractory products.
    (d) Shape dryers, curing ovens, kilns, coking ovens, defumers, shape 
preheaters, and pitch working tanks that are research and development 
(R&D) process units are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. 
(See definition of research and development process unit in Sec. 
63.9824).
    (e) A source is a new affected source if you began construction of 
the affected source after June 20, 2002, and you met the applicability 
criteria at the time you began construction.
    (f) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as 
defined in Sec. 63.2.
    (g) An affected source is existing if it is not new or 
reconstructed.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9786  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have a new or reconstructed affected source, you must 
comply with this subpart according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (1) If the initial startup of your affected source is before April 
16, 2003, then you must comply with the emission limitations for new and 
reconstructed sources in this subpart no later than April 16, 2003.
    (2) If the initial startup of your affected source is after April 
16, 2003, then you must comply with the emission limitations for new and 
reconstructed sources in this subpart upon initial startup of your 
affected source.
    (b) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with 
the emission limitations for existing sources no later than April 17, 
2006.
    (c) You must be in compliance with this subpart when you conduct a 
performance test on an affected source.
    (d) If you have an existing area source that increases its emissions 
or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP, you 
must be in compliance with this subpart according to paragraphs (d)(1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) Any portion of the existing facility that is a new affected 
source or a new reconstructed source must be in

[[Page 97]]

compliance with this subpart upon startup.
    (2) All other parts of the existing facility must be in compliance 
with this subpart by 3 years after the date the area source becomes a 
major source.
    (e) If you have a new area source (i.e., an area source for which 
construction or reconstruction was commenced after June 20, 2002) that 
increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a 
major source of HAP, you must be in compliance with this subpart upon 
initial startup of your affected source as a major source.
    (f) You must meet the notification requirements in Sec. 63.9812 
according to the schedule in Sec. 63.9812 and in 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A. Some of the notifications must be submitted before you are 
required to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart.

            Emission Limitations and Work Practice Standards


<R05>
Sec. 63.9788  What emission limits, operating limits, and work practice 

standards must I meet?

    (a) You must meet each emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart 
that applies to you.
    (b) You must meet each operating limit in Table 2 to this subpart 
that applies to you.
    (c) You must meet each work practice standard in Table 3 to this 
subpart that applies to you.


<R05>

required overall accuracy of the CPMS, as specified in paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.
    (ii) If your pH CPMS does not include a redundant pH sensor, perform 
a single point calibration using an NIST-certified buffer solution that 
is accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.02 pH units at 25 [deg]C 
(77 [deg]F). If the expected pH of the liquid that is monitored lies in 
the acidic range (less than 7 pH), use a buffer solution with a pH value 
of 4.00. If the expected pH of the liquid that is monitored is neutral 
or lies in the basic range (equal to or greater than 7 pH), use a buffer 
solution with a pH value of 10.00. Place the electrode of the pH CPMS in 
the container of buffer solution. Record the pH measured by your CPMS. 
Using the certified buffer solution as the reference, the pH measured by 
your CPMS must be within the accuracy specified in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (iii) Perform any of the accuracy audit methods for pH CPMS 
specified in QA procedures for CPMS established in 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix F.
    (5) If your CPMS is not equipped with a redundant pH sensor, perform 
at least monthly a visual inspection of all components of the CPMS for 
integrity, oxidation, and galvanic corrosion.
    (f) For each bag leak detection system, you must meet the 
requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (11) of this section.
    (1) Each triboelectric bag leak detection system must be installed, 
calibrated, operated, and maintained according to the ``Fabric Filter 
Bag Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). That 
document is available from the U.S. EPA; Office of Air Quality Planning 
and Standards; Emissions, Monitoring and Analysis Division; Emission 
Measurement Center (D205-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. It is 
also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) at the following 
address: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc/cem.html. Other types of bag leak 
detection systems must be installed, operated, calibrated, and 
maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written 
specifications and recommendations.
    (2) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter (PM) 
emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter 
(0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
    (3) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide an output of 
relative PM loadings.
    (4) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to 
continuously record the output signal from the sensor.
    (5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will be engaged automatically when an increase in relative 
PM emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located 
where it is easily recognized by plant operating personnel.
    (6) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detector 
must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.
    (7) For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag 
leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter.
    (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (9) The baseline output must be established by adjusting the range 
and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set 
points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the ``Fabric 
Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance.''
    (10) Following initial adjustment of the system, the owner or 
operator must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, 
alarm set points, or alarm delay time except as detailed in the OM&M 
plan. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 
percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period 
unless such adjustment follows a complete fabric filter inspection that 
demonstrates that the fabric filter is in good operating condition. You 
must record each adjustment of your bag leak detection system.

[[Page 107]]

    (11) Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and 
validation check.
    (g) For each lime feed rate measurement device that is used to 
monitor the lime feed rate of a dry injection fabric filter (DIFF) or 
dry lime scrubber/fabric filter (DLS/FF), or the chemical feed rate of a 
wet scrubber, you must meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (h) For each affected source that is subject to the emission limit 
specified in item 3, 4, 7, or 8 of Table 1 to this subpart, you must 
satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) through (3) of this 
section.
    (1) Install a THC CEMS at the outlet of the control device or in the 
stack of the affected source.
    (2) Meet the requirements of PS-8 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
    (3) Meet the requirements of Procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
F.
    (i) Requests for approval of alternate monitoring methods must meet 
the requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.9800(i)(2) and 63.8(f).


<R05>
Sec. 63.9806  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission 

limits, operating limits, and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emission limit 
that applies to you according to the requirements specified in Table 5 
to this subpart.
    (b) You must establish each site-specific operating limit in Table 2 
to this subpart that applies to you according to the requirements 
specified in Sec. 63.9800 and Table 4 to this subpart.
    (c) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each work practice 
standard that applies to you according to the requirements specified in 
Table 6 to this subpart.
    (d) You must submit the Notification of Compliance Status containing 
the results of the initial compliance demonstration according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.9812(e).

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9808  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous 

compliance?

    (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
    (b) At all times, you must maintain your monitoring systems 
including, but not limited to, maintaining necessary parts for routine 
repairs of the monitoring equipment.
    (c) Except for, as applicable, monitoring system malfunctions, 
associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control 
activities, you must monitor continuously whenever your affected process 
unit is operating. For purposes of calculating data averages, you must 
not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, associated 
repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities. 
You must use all the data collected during all other periods in 
assessing compliance. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, 
infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system 
to provide valid data. Monitoring system malfunctions include out of 
control continuous monitoring systems (CMS), such as a CPMS. Any 
averaging period for which you do not have valid monitoring data as a 
result of a monitoring system malfunction and for which such data are 
required constitutes a deviation, and you must notify the Administrator 
in accordance with Sec. 63.9814(e). Monitoring system failures are 
different from monitoring system malfunctions in that they are caused in 
part by poor maintenance or careless operation. Any period for which 
there is a monitoring system failure and data are not available for 
required calculations constitutes a deviation and you must notify the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 63.9814(e).


<R05>
Sec. 63.9810  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 

limits, operating limits, and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission 
limit specified in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you according 
to the requirements specified in Table 7 to this subpart.
    (b) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating 
limit specified in Table 2 to this subpart that applies to you according 
to the requirements specified in Table 8 to this subpart.

[[Page 108]]

    (c) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each work 
practice standard specified in Table 3 to this subpart that applies to 
you according to the requirements specified in Table 9 to this subpart.
    (d) For each affected source that is equipped with an add-on APCD 
that is not addressed in Table 2 to this subpart or that is using 
process changes as a means of meeting the emission limits in Table 1 to 
this subpart, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with each 
emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart and each operating limit 
established as required in Sec. 63.9800(i)(3) according to the methods 
specified in your approved alternative monitoring methods request as 
described in Sec. 63.9800(i)(2).
    (e) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each 
emission limit and each operating limit in this subpart that applies to 
you. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. These 
instances are deviations from the emission limitations in this subpart. 
These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in Sec. 
63.9814.
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations 
that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not 
violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1) and your OM&M 
plan. The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur 
during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).

binders, and additives in the refractory mix; and the rate at which the 
refractory shapes formed from the refractory mix are processed in an 
affected thermal process unit. For continuous process units, the organic 
HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP per

of the rate at which the temperature of the refractory shapes is 
increased, the mass and loading configuration of the shapes in the 
process unit, the constituents of the refractory mix, and the type of 
pollutants emitted.

Subpart UUUUU_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: 

       Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units

    Source: 77 FR 9464, Feb. 16, 2012, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.9980  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission limitations and work 
practice standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from coal- 
and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGUs) as defined 
in Sec. 63.10042 of this subpart. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the 
emission limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9981  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a coal-fired 
EGU or an oil-fired EGU as defined in Sec. 63.10042 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9982  What is the affected source of this subpart?

    (a) This subpart applies to each individual or group of two or more 
new, reconstructed, and existing affected source(s) as described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section within a contiguous area and 
under common control.
    (1) The affected source of this subpart is the collection of all 
existing coal- or oil-fired EGUs, as defined in Sec. 63.10042, within a 
subcategory.

[[Page 157]]

    (2) The affected source of this subpart is each new or reconstructed 
coal- or oil-fired EGU as defined in Sec. 63.10042.
    (b) An EGU is new if you commence construction of the coal- or oil-
fired EGU after May 3, 2011, and you meet the applicability criteria at 
the time you commence construction.
    (c) An EGU is reconstructed if you meet the reconstruction criteria 
as defined in Sec. 63.2, you commence reconstruction after May 3, 2011, 
and you meet the applicability criteria at the time you commence 
reconstruction.
    (d) An EGU is existing if it is not new or reconstructed. An 
existing electric steam generating unit that meets the applicability 
requirements after the effective date of this final rule due to a change 
in process (e.g., fuel or utilization) is considered to be an existing 
source under this subpart.

[77 FR 9464, Feb. 16, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 23402, Apr. 19, 2012]


<R05>
Sec. 63.9983  Are any EGUs not subject to this subpart?

    The types of electric steam generating units listed in paragraphs 
(a) through (d) of this section are not subject to this subpart.
    (a) Any unit designated as a stationary combustion turbine, other 
than an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) unit, covered by 
40 CFR part 63, subpart YYYY.
    (b) Any electric utility steam generating unit that is not a coal- 
or oil-fired EGU and combusts natural gas for more than 10.0 percent of 
the average annual heat input during any 3 calendar years or for more 
than 15.0 percent of the annual heat input during any calendar year.
    (c) Any electric utility steam generating unit that has the 
capability of combusting more than 25 MW of coal or oil but did not fire 
coal or oil for more than 10.0 percent of the average annual heat input 
during any 3 calendar years or for more than 15.0 percent of the annual 
heat input during any calendar year. Heat input means heat derived from 
combustion of fuel in an EGU and does not include the heat derived from 
preheated combustion air, recirculated flue gases or exhaust gases from 
other sources (such as stationary gas turbines, internal combustion 
engines, and industrial boilers).
    (d) Any electric steam generating unit combusting solid waste is a 
solid waste incineration unit subject to standards established under 
sections 129 and 111 of the Clean Air Act.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9984  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have a new or reconstructed EGU, you must comply with 
this subpart by April 16, 2012 or upon startup of your EGU, whichever is 
later, and as further provided for in Sec. 63.10005(g).
    (b) If you have an existing EGU, you must comply with this subpart 
no later than April 16, 2015.
    (c) You must meet the notification requirements in Sec. 63.10030 
according to the schedule in Sec. 63.10030 and in subpart A of this 
part. Some of the notifications must be submitted before you are 
required to comply with the emission limits and work practice standards 
in this subpart.
    (d) An electric steam generating unit that does not meet the 
definition of an EGU subject to this subpart on April 16, 2012 for new 
sources or April 16, 2015 for existing sources must comply with the 
applicable existing source provisions of this subpart on the date such 
unit meets the definition of an EGU subject to this subpart.
    (e) If you own or operate an electric steam generating unit that is 
exempted from this subpart under Sec. 63.9983(d), if the manner of 
operating the unit changes such that the combustion of waste is 
discontinued and the unit becomes a coal-fired or oil-fired EGU (as 
defined in Sec. 63.10042), you must be in compliance with this subpart 
on April 16, 2015 or on the effective date of the switch from waste 
combustion to coal or oil combustion, whichever is later.
    (f) You must demonstrate that compliance has been achieved, by 
conducting the required performance tests and other activities, no later 
than 180 days after the applicable date in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), 
or (e) of this section.

[[Page 158]]


<R05>
Sec. 63.9985  What is a new EGU?

    (a) A new EGU is an EGU that meets any of the criteria specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) An EGU that commenced construction after May 3, 2011.
    (2) An EGU that commenced reconstruction after May 3, 2011.

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.10000  What are my general requirements for complying with this 

subpart?

    (a) You must be in compliance with the emission limits and operating 
limits in this subpart. These limits apply to you at all times except 
during periods of startup and shutdown; however, for coal-fired, liquid 
oil-fired, or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGUs, you are required to 
meet the work practice requirements in Table 3 to this subpart during 
periods of startup or shutdown.
    (b) At all times you must operate and maintain any affected source, 
including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring 
equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution 
control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether 
such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based 
on information available to the EPA Administrator which may include, but 
is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and 
maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and 
inspection of the source.
    (c)(1) For coal-fired units, IGCC units, and solid oil-derived fuel-
fired

[[Page 159]]

units, initial performance testing is required for all pollutants, to 
demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits.
    (i) For a coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU or IGCC 
EGU, you may conduct the initial performance testing in accordance with 
Sec. 63.10005(h), to determine whether the unit qualifies as a low 
emitting EGU (LEE) for one or more applicable emissions limits, with two 
exceptions:
    (A) You may not pursue the LEE option if your coal-fired, IGCC, or 
solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU is equipped with an acid gas scrubber 
and has a main stack and bypass stack exhaust configuration, and
    (B) You may not pursue the LEE option for Hg if your coal-fired, 
solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU or IGCC EGU is new.
    (ii) For a qualifying LEE for Hg emissions limits, you must conduct 
a 30-day performance test using Method 30B at least once every 12 
calendar months to demonstrate continued LEE status.
    (iii) For a qualifying LEE of any other applicable emissions limits, 
you must conduct a performance test at least once every 36 calendar 
months to demonstrate continued LEE status.
    (iv) If your coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU or IGCC 
EGU does not qualify as a LEE for total non-mercury HAP metals, 
individual non-mercury HAP metals, or filterable particulate matter 
(PM), you must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance 
test and you must monitor continuous performance through either use of a 
particulate matter continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS), a 
PM CEMS, or compliance performance testing repeated quarterly.
    (A) If you elect to use PM CPMS, you will establish a site-specific 
operating limit corresponding to the results of the performance test 
demonstrating compliance with the pollutant with which you choose to 
comply: total non-mercury HAP metals, individual non-mercury HAP metals 
or filterable PM. You will use the PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous 
compliance with this operating limit. If you elect to use a PM CPMS, you 
must repeat the performance test annually for the selected pollutant 
limit and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in 
accordance with the results of the performance test.
    (B) You may also opt to install and operate a particulate matter 
CEMS certified in accordance with Performance Specification 11 and 
Procedure 2 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendices B and F, respectively, in 
accordance with Sec. 63.10010(i).
    (v) If your coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU does not 
qualify as a LEE for hydrogen chloride (HCl), you may demonstrate 
initial and continuous compliance through use of an HCl CEMS, installed 
and operated in accordance with Appendix B to this subpart. As an 
alternative to HCl CEMS, you may demonstrate initial and continuous 
compliance by conducting an initial and periodic quarterly performance 
stack test for HCl. If your EGU uses wet or dry flue gas desulfurization 
technology (this includes limestone injection into a fluidized bed 
combustion unit), you may apply a second alternative to HCl CEMS by 
installing and operating a sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) CEMS 
installed and operated in accordance with part 75 of this chapter to 
demonstrate compliance with the applicable SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
limit.
    (vi) If your coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU does not 
qualify as a LEE for Hg, you must demonstrate initial and continuous 
compliance through use of a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap monitoring system, 
in accordance with appendix A to this subpart.
    (2) For liquid oil-fired EGUs, except limited use liquid oil-fired 
EGUs, initial performance testing is required for all pollutants, to 
demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits.
    (i) For an existing liquid oil-fired unit, you may conduct the 
performance testing in accordance with Sec. 63.10005(h), to determine 
whether the unit qualifies as a LEE for one or more pollutants. For a 
qualifying LEE for Hg emissions limits, you must conduct a 30-day 
performance test using Method 30B at least once every 12 calendar months 
to demonstrate continued LEE status. For a qualifying LEE of any other 
applicable emissions limits, you must conduct a performance test at 
least

[[Page 160]]

once every 36 calendar months to demonstrate continued LEE status.
    (ii) If your existing liquid oil-fired unit does not qualify as a 
LEE for total HAP metals (including mercury), individual metals 
(including mercury), or filterable PM you must demonstrate compliance 
through an initial performance test and you must monitor continuous 
performance through either use of a PM CPMS, a PM CEMS, or performance 
testing conducted quarterly.
    (A) If you elect to use PM CPMS, you will establish a site-specific 
operating limit corresponding to the results of the performance test 
demonstrating compliance with the pollutant with which you choose to 
comply: total HAP metals, individual HAP metals, or filterable PM. You 
will use the PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous compliance with this 
operating limit. If you elect to use a PM CPMS, you must repeat the 
performance test at least annually for the selected pollutant limit and 
reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with 
the results of the performance test.
    (B) If you elect to use a PM CEMS, you will use the CEMS in 
accordance with Sec. 63.10010(i) to demonstrate initial and continuous 
compliance with the filterable PM emission limit.
    (iii) If your existing liquid oil-fired unit does not qualify as a 
LEE for hydrogen chloride (HCl) or for hydrogen fluoride (HF), you may 
demonstrate initial and continuous compliance through use of an HCl 
CEMS, an HF CEMS, or an HCl and HF CEMS, installed and operated in 
accordance with Appendix B to this rule. As an alternative to HCl CEMS, 
HF CEMS, or HCl and HF CEMS, you may demonstrate initial and continuous 
compliance by conducting periodic quarterly performance stack tests for 
HCl and HF. If you elect to demonstrate compliance through quarterly 
performance testing, then you must also develop a site-specific 
monitoring plan to ensure that the operations of the unit remain 
consistent with those during the performance test. As another 
alternative, you may measure or obtain, and keep records of, fuel 
moisture content; as long as fuel moisture does not exceed 1.0 percent 
by weight, you need not conduct other HCl or HF monitoring or testing.
    (iv) If your unit qualifies as a limited-use liquid oil-fired as 
defined in Sec. 63.10042, then you are not subject to the emission 
limits in Tables 1 and 2, but you must comply with the performance tune-
up work practice requirements in Table 3.
    (d)(1) If you demonstrate compliance with any applicable emissions 
limit through use of a continuous monitoring system (CMS), where a CMS 
includes a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) as well as a 
continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS), you must develop a site-
specific monitoring plan and submit this site-specific monitoring plan, 
if requested, at least 60 days before your initial performance 
evaluation (where applicable) of your CMS. This requirement also applies 
to you if you petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring 
parameters under Sec. 63.8(f). This requirement to develop and submit a 
site-specific monitoring plan does not apply to affected sources with 
existing monitoring plans that apply to CEMS and CPMS prepared under 
Appendix B to part 60 or part 75 of this chapter, and that meet the 
requirements of Sec. 63.10010. Using the process described in Sec. 
63.8(f)(4), you may request approval of monitoring system quality 
assurance and quality control procedures alternative to those specified 
in this paragraph of this section and, if approved, include those in 
your site-specific monitoring plan. The monitoring plan must address the 
provisions in paragraphs (d)(2) through (5) of this section.
    (2) The site-specific monitoring plan shall include the information 
specified in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (d)(5)(vii) of this section. 
Alternatively, the requirements of paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through 
(d)(5)(vii) are considered to be met for a particular CMS or sorbent 
trap monitoring system if:
    (i) The CMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is installed, 
certified, maintained, operated, and quality-assured either according to 
part 75 of this chapter, or appendix A or B to this subpart; and
    (ii) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter,

[[Page 161]]

or appendix A or B to this subpart, that pertain to the CMS are met.
    (3) If requested by the Administrator, you must submit the 
monitoring plan (or relevant portion of the plan) at least 60 days 
before the initial performance evaluation of a particular CMS, except 
where the CMS has already undergone a performance evaluation that meets 
the requirements of Sec. 63.10010 (e.g., if the CMS was previously 
certified under another program).
    (4) You must operate and maintain the CMS according to the site-
specific monitoring plan.
    (5) The provisions of the site-specific monitoring plan must address 
the following items:
    (i) Installation of the CMS or sorbent trap monitoring system 
sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to 
each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative 
of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last 
control device). See Sec. 63.10010(a) for further details. For PM CPMS 
installations, follow the procedures in Sec. 63.10010(h).
    (ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample 
interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, 
and the data collection and reduction systems.
    (iii) Schedule for conducting initial and periodic performance 
evaluations.
    (iv) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria 
(e.g., calibrations), including the quality control program in 
accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(d).
    (v) On-going operation and maintenance procedures, in accordance 
with the general requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.8(c)(1)(ii), (c)(3), and 
(c)(4)(ii).
    (vi) Conditions that define a CMS that is out of control consistent 
with Sec. 63.8(c)(7)(i) and for responding to out of control periods 
consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.8(c)(7)(ii) and (c)(8).
    (vii) On-going recordkeeping and reporting procedures, in accordance 
with the general requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.10(c), (e)(1), and 
(e)(2)(i), or as specifically required under this subpart.
    (e) As part of your demonstration of continuous compliance, you must 
perform periodic tune-ups of your EGU(s), according to Sec. 
63.10021(e).
    (f) You are subject to the requirements of this subpart for at least 
6 months following the last date you met the definition of an EGU 
subject to this subpart (e.g., 6 months after a cogeneration unit 
provided more than one third of its potential electrical output capacity 
and more than 25 megawatts electrical output to any power distribution 
system for sale). You may opt to remain subject to the provisions of 
this subpart beyond 6 months after the last date you met the definition 
of an EGU subject to this subpart, unless you are a solid waste 
incineration unit subject to standards under CAA section 129 (e.g., 40 
CFR Part 60, Subpart CCCC (New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for 
Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units, or Subpart 
DDDD (Emissions Guidelines (EG) for Existing Commercial and Industrial 
Solid Waste Incineration Units). Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
subpart, an EGU that starts combusting solid waste is immediately 
subject to standards under CAA section 129 and the EGU remains subject 
to those standards until the EGU no longer meets the definition of a 
solid waste incineration unit consistent with the provisions of the 
applicable CAA section 129 standards.
    (g) If you no longer meet the definition of an EGU subject to this 
subpart you must be in compliance with any newly applicable standards on 
the date you are no longer subject to this subpart. The date you are no 
longer subject to this subpart is a date selected by you, that must be 
at least 6 months from the date that you last met the definition of an 
EGU subject to this subpart or the date you begin combusting solid 
waste, consistent with Sec. 63.9983(d). Your source must remain in 
compliance with this subpart until the date you select to cease 
complying with this subpart or the date you begin combusting solid 
waste, whichever is earlier.
    (h)(1) If you own or operate an EGU that does not meet the 
definition of an EGU subject to this subpart on April 16, 2015, and you 
commence or recommence operations that cause you to meet the definition 
of an EGU subject to this subpart, you are subject to the provisions of 
this subpart, including,

[[Page 162]]

but not limited to, the emission limitations and the monitoring 
requirements, as of the first day you meet the definition of an EGU 
subject to this subpart. You must complete all initial compliance 
demonstrations for this subpart applicable to your EGU within 180 days 
after you commence or recommence operations that cause you to meet the 
definition of an EGU subject to this subpart.
    (2) You must provide 30 days prior notice of the date you intend to 
commence or recommence operations that cause you to meet the definition 
of an EGU subject to this subpart. The notification must identify:
    (i) The name of the owner or operator of the EGU, the location of 
the facility, the unit(s) that will commence or recommence operations 
that will cause the unit(s) to meet the definition of an EGU subject to 
this subpart, and the date of the notice;
    (ii) The 40 CFR part 60, part 62, or part 63 subpart and subcategory 
currently applicable to your unit(s), and the subcategory of this 
subpart that will be applicable after you commence or recommence 
operation that will cause the unit(s) to meet the definition of an EGU 
subject to this subpart;
    (iii) The date on which you became subject to the currently 
applicable emission limits;
    (iv) The date upon which you will commence or recommence operations 
that will cause your unit to meet the definition of an EGU subject to 
this subpart, consistent with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (i)(1) If you own or operate an EGU subject to this subpart, and it 
has been at least 6 months since you operated in a manner that caused 
you to meet the definition of an EGU subject to this subpart, you may, 
consistent with paragraph (g) of this section, select the date on which 
your EGU will no longer be subject to this subpart. You must be in 
compliance with any newly applicable section 112 or 129 standards on the 
date you selected.
    (2) You must provide 30 days prior notice of the date your EGU will 
cease complying with this subpart. The notification must identify:
    (i) The name of the owner or operator of the EGU(s), the location of 
the facility, the EGU(s) that will cease complying with this subpart, 
and the date of the notice;
    (ii) The currently applicable subcategory under this subpart, and 
any 40 CFR part 60, part 62, or part 63 subpart and subcategory that 
will be applicable after you cease complying with this subpart;
    (iii) The date on which you became subject to this subpart;
    (iv) The date upon which you will cease complying with this subpart, 
consistent with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (j) All air pollution control equipment necessary for compliance 
with any newly applicable emissions limits which apply as a result of 
the cessation or commencement or recommencement of operations that cause 
your EGU to meet the definition of an EGU subject to this subpart must 
be installed and operational as of the date your source ceases to be or 
becomes subject to this subpart.
    (k) All monitoring systems necessary for compliance with any newly 
applicable monitoring requirements which apply as a result of the 
cessation or commencement or recommencement of operations that cause 
your EGU to meet the definition of an EGU subject to this subpart must 
be installed and operational as of the date your source ceases to be or 
becomes subject to this subpart. All calibration and drift checks must 
be performed as of the date your source ceases to be or becomes subject 
to this subpart. You must also comply with provisions of Sec. Sec. 
63.10010, 63.10020, and 63.10021 of this subpart. Relative accuracy 
tests must be performed as of the performance test deadline for PM CEMS, 
if applicable. Relative accuracy testing for other CEMS need not be 
repeated if that testing was previously performed consistent with CAA 
section 112 monitoring requirements or monitoring requirements under 
this subpart.

Sec. 63.10001  Affirmative defense for exceedence of emission limit during 

malfunction.

    In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in Sec. 
63.9991 you

[[Page 163]]

may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for 
exceedances of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined 
at 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you 
fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the 
affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for 
claims for injunctive relief.
    (a) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce 
such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in 
paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of 
evidence that:
    (1) The excess emissions:
    (i) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of 
air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a 
process to operate in a normal or usual manner, and
    (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper 
design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
    (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been 
foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
    (iv) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate 
design, operation, or maintenance; and
    (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the 
applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and 
overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these 
repairs; and
    (3) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions 
(including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable 
during periods of such emissions; and
    (4) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control 
equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss 
of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
    (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the 
excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human 
health; and
    (6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in 
operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air 
pollution control practices; and
    (7) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were 
documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
    (8) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner 
consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
    (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of 
which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the 
malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction 
event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring 
methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that 
were the result of the malfunction.
    (b) Notification. The owner or operator of the affected source 
experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction 
shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) 
transmission as soon as possible, but no later than two business days 
after the initial occurrence of the malfunction or, if it is not 
possible to determine within two business days whether the malfunction 
caused or contributed to an exceedance, no later than two business days 
after the owner or operator knew or should have known that the 
malfunction caused or contributed to an exceedance, but, in no event 
later than two business days after the end of the averaging period, if 
it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties 
for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an 
affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the 
Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance 
of the standard in Sec. 63.9991 to demonstrate, with all necessary 
supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an 
extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a 
written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day 
period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the 
Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to 
submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the 
exceedance.

               Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.10005  What are my initial compliance requirements and by what date 

must I conduct them?

    (a) General requirements. For each of your affected EGUs, you must 
demonstrate initial compliance with each applicable emissions limit in 
Table 1 or 2 of this subpart through performance testing. Where two 
emissions limits are specified for a particular pollutant (e.g., a heat 
input-based limit in lb/MMBtu and an electrical output-based limit in 
lb/MWh), you may demonstrate compliance with either emission limit. For 
a particular compliance demonstration, you may be required to conduct 
one or more of the following activities in conjunction with performance 
testing: collection of hourly electrical load data (megawatts); 
establishment of operating limits according to Sec. 63.10011 and Tables 
4 and 7 to this subpart; and CMS performance evaluations. In all cases, 
you must demonstrate initial compliance no later than the applicable 
date in paragraph (f) of this section for tune-up work practices for 
existing EGUs, in Sec. 63.9984 for other requirements for existing 
EGUs, and in paragraph (g) of this section for all requirements for new 
EGUs.
    (1) To demonstrate initial compliance with an applicable emissions 
limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart using stack testing, the initial 
performance test generally consists of three runs at specified process 
operating conditions using approved methods. If you are required to 
establish operating limits (see paragraph (d) of this section and Table 
4 to this subpart), you must collect all applicable parametric data 
during the performance test period. Also, if you choose to comply with 
an electrical output-based emission limit, you must collect hourly 
electrical load data during the test period.
    (2) To demonstrate initial compliance using either a CMS that 
measures HAP concentrations directly (i.e., an Hg, HCl, or HF CEMS, or a 
sorbent trap monitoring system) or an SO<INF>2</INF> or PM CEMS, the 
initial performance test consists of 30 boiler operating days of data 
collected by the initial compliance demonstration date specified in 
Sec. 63.10005 with the certified monitoring system.
    (i) The 30-boiler operating day CMS performance test must 
demonstrate compliance with the applicable Hg, HCl, HF, PM, or 
SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
    (ii) If you choose to comply with an electrical output-based 
emission limit, you must collect hourly electrical load data during the 
performance test period.
    (b) Performance testing requirements. If you choose to use 
performance testing to demonstrate initial compliance with the 
applicable emissions limits in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart for your 
EGUs, you must conduct the tests according to Sec. 63.10007 and Table 5 
to this subpart. For the purposes of the initial compliance 
demonstration, you may use test data and results from a performance test 
conducted prior to the date on which compliance is required as specified 
in Sec. 63.9984, provided that the following conditions are fully met:
    (1) For a performance test based on stack test data, the test was 
conducted no more than 12 calendar months prior to the date on which 
compliance is required as specified in Sec. 63.9984;
    (2) For a performance test based on data from a certified CEMS or 
sorbent trap monitoring system, the test consists of all valid CMS data 
recorded in the 30 boiler operating days immediately preceding that 
date;
    (3) The performance test was conducted in accordance with all 
applicable requirements in Sec. 63.10007 and Table 5 to this subpart;
    (4) A record of all parameters needed to convert pollutant 
concentrations to units of the emission standard (e.g., stack flow rate, 
diluent gas concentrations, hourly electrical loads) is available for 
the entire performance test period; and
    (5) For each performance test based on stack test data, you certify, 
and keep documentation demonstrating, that the EGU configuration, 
control devices, and fuel(s) have remained consistent with conditions 
since the prior performance test was conducted.
    (c) Operating limits. In accordance with Sec. 63.10010 and Table 4 
to this subpart, you may be required to establish operating limits using 
PM CPMS and

[[Page 165]]

using site-specific monitoring for certain liquid oil-fired units as 
part of your initial compliance demonstration.
    (d) CMS requirements. If, for a particular emission or operating 
limit, you are required to (or elect to) demonstrate initial compliance 
using a continuous monitoring system, the CMS must pass a performance 
evaluation prior to the initial compliance demonstration. If a CMS has 
been previously certified under another state or federal program and is 
continuing to meet the on-going quality-assurance (QA) requirements of 
that program, then, provided that the certification and QA provisions of 
that program meet the applicable requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.10010(b) 
through (h), an additional performance evaluation of the CMS is not 
required under this subpart.
    (1) For an affected coal-fired, solid oil-derived fuel-fired, or 
liquid oil-fired EGU, you may demonstrate initial compliance with the 
applicable SO<INF>2</INF>, HCl, or HF emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to 
this subpart through use of an SO<INF>2</INF>, HCl, or HF CEMS installed 
and operated in accordance with part 75 of this chapter or appendix B to 
this subpart, as applicable. You may also demonstrate compliance with a 
filterable PM emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart through use 
of a PM CEMS installed, certified, and operated in accordance with Sec. 
63.10010(i). Initial compliance is achieved if the arithmetic average of 
30-boiler operating days of quality-assured CEMS data, expressed in 
units of the standard (see Sec. 63.10007(e)), meets the applicable 
SO<INF>2</INF>, PM, HCl, or HF emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to this 
subpart. Use Equation 19-19 of Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of 
this chapter to calculate the 30-boiler operating day average emissions 
rate. (Note: For this calculation, the term E<INF>hj</INF> in Equation 
19-19 must be in the same units of measure as the applicable HCl or HF 
emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart).
    (2) For affected coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGUs 
that demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits for 
total non-mercury HAP metals, individual non-mercury HAP metals, total 
HAP metals, individual HAP metals, or filterable PM listed in Table 1 or 
2 to this subpart using initial performance testing and continuous 
monitoring with PM CPMS:
    (i) You must demonstrate initial compliance no later than the 
applicable date specified in Sec. 63.9984(f) for existing EGUs and in 
paragraph (g) of this section for new EGUs.
    (ii) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the PM CPMS 
site-specific operating limit that corresponding to the results of the 
performance test demonstrating compliance with the pollutant with which 
you choose to comply.
    (iii) You must repeat the performance test annually for the selected 
pollutant emissions limit and reassess and adjust the site-specific 
operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.
    (3) For affected EGUs that are either required to or elect to 
demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable Hg emission limit in 
Table 1 or 2 of this subpart using Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring 
systems, initial compliance must be demonstrated no later than the 
applicable date specified in Sec. 63.9984(f) for existing EGUs and in 
paragraph (g) of this section for new EGUs. Initial compliance is 
achieved if the arithmetic average of 30-boiler operating days of 
quality-assured CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) data, expressed 
in units of the standard (see section 6.2 of appendix A to this 
subpart), meets the applicable Hg emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this 
subpart.
    (4) For affected liquid oil-fired EGUs that demonstrate compliance 
with the applicable emission limits for HCl or HF listed in Table 1 or 2 
to this subpart using quarterly testing and continuous monitoring with a 
CMS:
    (i) You must demonstrate initial compliance no later than the 
applicable date specified in Sec. 63.9984 for existing EGUs and in 
paragraph (g) of this section for new EGUs.
    (ii) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the CMS site-
specific operating limit that corresponds to the results of the 
performance test demonstrating compliance with the HCl or HF emissions 
limit.
    (iii) You must repeat the performance test annually for the HCl or 
HF

[[Page 166]]

emissions limit and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating 
limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.
    (e) Tune-ups. All affected EGUs are subject to the work practice 
standards in Table 3 of this subpart. As part of your initial compliance 
demonstration, you must conduct a performance tune-up of your EGU 
according to Sec. 63.10021(e).
    (f) For existing affected sources a tune-up may occur prior to April 
16, 2012, so that existing sources without neural networks have up to 42 
calendar months (3 years from promulgation plus 180 days) or, in the 
case of units employing neural network combustion controls, up to 54 
calendar months (48 months from promulgation plus 180 days) after the 
date that is specified for your source in Sec. 63.9984 and according to 
the applicable provisions in Sec. 63.7(a)(2) as cited in Table 9 to 
this subpart to demonstrate compliance with this requirement. If a tune-
up occurs prior to such date, the source must maintain adequate records 
to show that the tune-up met the requirements of this standard.
    (g) If your new or reconstructed affected source commenced 
construction or reconstruction between May 3, 2011, and July 2, 2011, 
you must demonstrate initial compliance with either the proposed 
emission limits or the promulgated emission limits no later than 180 
days after April 16, 2012 or within 180 days after startup of the 
source, whichever is later, according to Sec. 63.7(a)(2)(ix).
    (1) For the new or reconstructed affected source described in this 
paragraph (g), if you choose to comply with the proposed emission limits 
when demonstrating initial compliance, you must conduct a second 
compliance demonstration for the promulgated emission limits within 3 
years after April 16, 2012 or within 3 years after startup of the 
affected source, whichever is later.
    (2) If your new or reconstructed affected source commences 
construction or reconstruction after April 16, 2012, you must 
demonstrate initial compliance with the promulgated emission limits no 
later than 180 days after startup of the source.
    (h) Low emitting EGUs. The provisions of this paragraph (h) apply to 
pollutants with emissions limits from new EGUs except Hg and to all 
pollutants with emissions limits from existing EGUs. You may not pursue 
this compliance option if your existing EGU is equipped with an acid gas 
scrubber and has a main stack and bypass stack exhaust configuration.
    (1) An EGU may qualify for low emitting EGU (LEE) status for Hg, 
HCl, HF, filterable PM, total non-Hg HAP metals, or individual non-Hg 
HAP metals (or total HAP metals or individual HAP metals, for liquid 
oil-fired EGUs) if you collect performance test data that meet the 
requirements of this paragraph (h), and if those data demonstrate:
    (i) For all pollutants except Hg, performance test emissions results 
less than 50 percent of the applicable emissions limits in Table 1 or 2 
to this subpart for all required testing for 3 consecutive years; or
    (ii) For Hg emissions from an existing EGU, either:
    (A) Average emissions less than 10 percent of the applicable Hg 
emissions limit in Table 2 to this subpart (expressed either in units of 
lb/TBtu or lb/GWh); or
    (B) Potential Hg mass emissions of 29.0 or fewer pounds per year and 
compliance with the applicable Hg emission limit in Table 2 to this 
subpart (expressed either in units of lb/TBtu or lb/GWh).
    (2) For all pollutants except Hg, you must conduct all required 
performance tests described in Sec. 63.10007 to demonstrate that a unit 
qualifies for LEE status.
    (i) When conducting emissions testing to demonstrate LEE status, you 
must increase the minimum sample volume specified in Table 1 or 2 
nominally by a factor of two.
    (ii) Follow the instructions in Sec. 63.10007(e) and Table 5 to 
this subpart to convert the test data to the units of the applicable 
standard.
    (3) For Hg, you must conduct a 30-boiler operating day performance 
test using Method 30B in appendix A-8 to part 60 of this chapter to 
determine whether a unit qualifies for LEE status. Locate the Method 30B 
sampling

[[Page 167]]

probe tip at a point within the 10 percent centroidal area of the duct 
at a location that meets Method 1 in appendix A-1 to part 60 of this 
chapter and conduct at least three nominally equal length test runs over 
the 30-boiler operating day test period. Collect Hg emissions data 
continuously over the entire test period (except when changing sorbent 
traps or performing required reference method QA procedures), under all 
process operating conditions. You may use a pair of sorbent traps to 
sample the stack gas for no more than 10 days.
    (i) Depending on whether you intend to assess LEE status for Hg in 
terms of the lb/TBtu or lb/GWh emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart 
or in terms of the annual Hg mass emissions limit of 29.0 lb/year, you 
will have to collect some or all of the following data during the 30-
boiler operating day test period (see paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this 
section):
    (A) Diluent gas (CO<INF>2</INF> or O<INF>2</INF>) data, using either 
Method 3A in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter or a diluent gas 
monitor that has been certified according to part 75 of this chapter.
    (B) Stack gas flow rate data, using either Method 2, 2F, or 2G in 
appendices A-1 and A-2 to part 60 of this chapter, or a flow rate 
monitor that has been certified according to part 75 of this chapter.
    (C) Stack gas moisture content data, using either Method 4 in 
appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter, or a moisture monitoring system 
that has been certified according to part 75 of this chapter. 
Alternatively, an appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value from 
Sec. 75.11(b) of this chapter may be used in the calculations or you 
may petition the Administrator under Sec. 75.66 of this chapter for use 
of a default moisture value for non-coal-fired units.
    (D) Hourly electrical load data (megawatts), from facility records.
    (ii) If you use CEMS to measure CO<INF>2</INF> (or O<INF>2</INF>) 
concentration, and/or flow rate, and/or moisture, record hourly average 
values of each parameter throughout the 30-boiler operating day test 
period. If you opt to use EPA reference methods rather than CEMS for any 
parameter, you must perform at least one representative test run on each 
operating day of the test period, using the applicable reference method.
    (iii) Calculate the average Hg concentration, in [micro]g/m\3\ (dry 
basis), for the 30-boiler operating day performance test, as the 
arithmetic average of all Method 30B sorbent trap results. Also 
calculate, as applicable, the average values of CO<INF>2</INF> or 
O<INF>2</INF> concentration, stack gas flow rate, stack gas moisture 
content, and electrical load for the test period. Then:
    (A) To express the test results in units of lb/TBtu, follow the 
procedures in Sec. 63.10007(e). Use the average Hg concentration and 
diluent gas values in the calculations.
    (B) To express the test results in units of lb/GWh, use Equations A-
3 and A-4 in section 6.2.2 of appendix A to this subpart, replacing the 
hourly values ``C<INF>h</INF>'', ``Q<INF>h</INF>'', ``B<INF>ws</INF>'' 
and ``(MW)<INF>h</INF>'' with the average values of these parameters 
from the performance test.
    (C) To calculate pounds of Hg per year, use one of the following 
methods:
    (1) Multiply the average lb/TBtu Hg emission rate (determined 
according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section) by the maximum 
potential annual heat input to the unit (TBtu), which is equal to the 
maximum rated unit heat input (TBtu/hr) times 8,760 hours. If the 
maximum rated heat input value is expressed in units of MMBtu/hr, 
multiply it by 10 <SUP>-6</SUP> to convert it to TBtu/hr; or
    (2) Multiply the average lb/GWh Hg emission rate (determined 
according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section) by the maximum 
potential annual electricity generation (GWh), which is equal to the 
maximum rated electrical output of the unit (GW) times 8,760 hours. If 
the maximum rated electrical output value is expressed in units of MW, 
multiply it by 10 <SUP>-3</SUP> to convert it to GW; or
    (3) If an EGU has a federally-enforceable permit limit on either the 
annual heat input or the number of annual operating hours, you may 
modify the calculations in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(C)(1) of this section 
by replacing the maximum potential annual heat input or 8,760 unit 
operating hours with the permit limit on annual heat input or operating 
hours (as applicable).

[[Page 168]]

    (4) For a group of affected units that vent to a common stack, you 
may either assess LEE status for the units individually by performing a 
separate emission test of each unit in the duct leading from the unit to 
the common stack, or you may perform a single emission test in the 
common stack. If you choose the common stack testing option, the units 
in the configuration qualify for LEE status if:
    (i) The emission rate measured at the common stack is less than 50 
percent (10 percent for Hg) of the applicable emission limit in Table 1 
or 2 to this subpart; or
    (ii) For Hg from an existing EGU, the applicable Hg emission limit 
in Table 2 to this subpart is met and the potential annual mass 
emissions, calculated according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section 
(with some modifications), are less than or equal to 29.0 pounds times 
the number of units sharing the common stack. Base your calculations on 
the combined heat input capacity of all units sharing the stack (i.e., 
either the combined maximum rated value or, if applicable, a lower 
combined value restricted by permit conditions or operating hours).
    (5) For an affected unit with a multiple stack or duct configuration 
in which the exhaust stacks or ducts are downstream of all emission 
control devices, you must perform a separate emission test in each stack 
or duct. The unit qualifies for LEE status if:
    (i) The emission rate, based on all test runs performed at all of 
the stacks or ducts, is less than 50 percent (10 percent for Hg) of the 
applicable emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart; or
    (ii) For Hg from an existing EGU, the applicable Hg emission limit 
in Table 2 to this subpart is met and the potential annual mass 
emissions, calculated according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this 
section, are less than or equal to 29.0 pounds. Use the average Hg 
emission rate from paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section in your 
calculations.
    (i) Liquid-oil fuel moisture measurement. If your EGU combusts 
liquid fuels, if your fuel moisture content is no greater than 1.0 
percent by weight, and if you would like to demonstrate initial and 
ongoing compliance with HCl and HF emissions limits, you must meet the 
requirements of paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) Measure fuel moisture content of each shipment of fuel if your 
fuel arrives on a batch basis; or
    (2) Measure fuel moisture content daily if your fuel arrives on a 
continuous basis; or
    (3) Obtain and maintain a fuel moisture certification from your fuel 
supplier.
    (4) Use one of the following methods to determine fuel moisture 
content:
    (i) ASTM D95-05 (Reapproved 2010), ``Standard Test Method for Water 
in Petroleum Products and Bituminous Materials by Distillation,'' or
    (ii) ASTM D4006-11, ``Standard Test Method for Water in Crude Oil by 
Distillation,'' including Annex A1 and Appendix A1, or
    (iii) ASTM D4177-95 (Reapproved 2010), ``Standard Practice for 
Automatic Sampling of Petroleum and Petroleum Products,'' including 
Annexes A1 through A6 and Appendices X1 and X2, or
    (iv) ASTM D4057-06 (Reapproved 2011), ``Standard Practice for Manual 
Sampling of Petroleum and Petroleum Products,'' including Annex A1.
    (5) Should the moisture in your liquid fuel be more than 1.0 percent 
by weight, you must
    (i) Conduct HCl and HF emissions testing quarterly (and monitor 
site-specific operating parameters as provided in Sec. 
63.10000(c)(2)(iii) or
    (ii) Use an HCl CEMS and/or HF CEMS.
    (j) Startup and shutdown for coal-fired or solid oil derived-fired 
units. You must follow the requirements given in Table 3 to this 
subpart.
    (k) You must submit a Notification of Compliance Status summarizing 
the results of your initial compliance demonstration, as provided in 
Sec. 63.10030.

Sec. 63.10006  When must I conduct subsequent performance tests or tune-ups?

    (a) For liquid oil-fired, solid oil-derived fuel-fired and coal-
fired EGUs and IGCC units using PM CPMS to monitor continuous 
performance with

[[Page 169]]

an applicable emission limit as provided for under Sec. 63.10000(c), 
you must conduct all applicable performance tests according to Table 5 
to this subpart and Sec. 63.10007 at least every year.
    (b) For affected units meeting the LEE requirements of Sec. 
63.10005(h), you must repeat the performance test once every 3 years 
(once every year for Hg) according to Table 5 and Sec. 63.10007. Should 
subsequent emissions testing results show the unit does not meet the LEE 
eligibility requirements, LEE status is lost. If this should occur:
    (1) For all pollutant emission limits except for Hg, you must 
conduct emissions testing quarterly, except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. 63.10021(d)(1).
    (2) For Hg, you must install, certify, maintain, and operate a Hg 
CEMS or a sorbent trap monitoring system in accordance with appendix A 
to this subpart, within 6 calendar months of losing LEE eligibility. 
Until the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is installed, 
certified, and operating, you must conduct Hg emissions testing 
quarterly, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 63.10021(d)(1). You 
must have 3 calendar years of testing and CEMS or sorbent trap 
monitoring system data that satisfy the LEE emissions criteria to 
reestablish LEE status.
    (c) Except where paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section apply, or 
where you install, certify, and operate a PM CEMS to demonstrate 
compliance with a filterable PM emission limit, for liquid oil-fired 
EGUs, you must conduct all applicable periodic emissions tests for 
filterable PM, or individual or total HAP metals emissions according to 
Table 5 to this subpart and Sec. 63.10007 at least quarterly, except as 
otherwise provided in Sec. 63.10021(d)(1).
    (d) Except where paragraph (b) of this section applies, for solid 
oil-derived fuel- and coal-fired EGUs that do not use either an HCl CEMS 
to monitor compliance with the HCl limit or an SO<INF>2</INF> CEMS to 
monitor compliance with the alternate equivalent SO<INF>2</INF> emission 
limit, you must conduct all applicable periodic HCl emissions tests 
according to Table 5 to this subpart and Sec. 63.10007 at least 
quarterly, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 63.10021(d)(1).
    (e) Except where paragraph (b) of this section applies, for liquid 
oil-fired EGUs without HCl CEMS, HF CEMS, or HCl and HF CEMS, you must 
conduct all applicable emissions tests for HCl, HF, or HCl and HF 
emissions according to Table 5 to this subpart and Sec. 63.10007 at 
least quarterly, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 63.10021(d)(1), 
and conduct site-specific monitoring under a plan as provided for in 
Sec. 63.10000(c)(2)(iii).
    (f) Unless you follow the requirements listed in paragraphs (g) and 
(h) of this section, performance tests required at least every 3 
calendar years must be completed within 35 to 37 calendar months after 
the previous performance test; performance tests required at least every 
year must be completed within 11 to 13 calendar months after the 
previous performance test; and performance tests required at least 
quarterly must be completed within 80 to 100 calendar days after the 
previous performance test, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 
63.10021(d)(1).
    (g) If you elect to demonstrate compliance using emissions averaging 
under Sec. 63.10009, you must continue to conduct performance stack 
tests at the appropriate frequency given in section (c) through (f) of 
this section.
    (h) If a performance test on a non-mercury LEE shows emissions in 
excess of 50 percent of the emission limit and if you choose to reapply 
for LEE status, you must conduct performance tests at the appropriate 
frequency given in section (c) through (e) of this section for that 
pollutant until all performance tests over a consecutive 3-year period 
show compliance with the LEE criteria.
    (i) If you are required to meet an applicable tune-up work practice 
standard, you must conduct a performance tune-up according to Sec. 
63.10021(e).
    (1) For EGUs not employing neural network combustion optimization 
during normal operation, each performance tune-up specified in Sec. 
63.10021(e) must be no more than 36 calendar months after the previous 
performance tune-up.
    (2) For EGUs employing neural network combustion optimization 
systems during normal operation, each performance tune-up specified in 
Sec. 63.10021(e) must be no more than 48 calendar months after the 
previous performance tune-up.

[[Page 170]]

    (j) You must report the results of performance tests and performance 
tune-ups within 60 days after the completion of the performance tests 
and performance tune-ups. The reports for all subsequent performance 
tests must include all applicable information required in Sec. 
63.10031.

[77 FR 9464, Feb. 16, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 23403, Apr. 19, 2012]


<R05>
Sec. 63.10007  What methods and other procedures must I use for the 

performance tests?

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, you must conduct 
all required performance tests according to Sec. 63.7(d), (e), (f), and 
(h). You must also develop a site-specific test plan according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.7(c).
    (1) If you use CEMS (Hg, HCl, SO<INF>2</INF>, or other) to determine 
compliance with a 30-boiler operating day rolling average emission 
limit, you must collect data for all nonexempt unit operating conditions 
(see Sec. 63.10011(g) and Table 3 to this subpart).
    (2) If you conduct performance testing with test methods in lieu of 
continuous monitoring, operate the unit at maximum normal operating load 
conditions during each periodic (e.g., quarterly) performance test. 
Maximum normal operating load will be generally between 90 and 110 
percent of design capacity but should be representative of site specific 
normal operations during each test run.
    (3) For establishing operating limits with particulate matter 
continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS) to demonstrate 
compliance with a PM or non Hg metals emissions limit, operate the unit 
at maximum normal operating load conditions during the performance test 
period. Maximum normal operating load will be generally between 90 and 
110 percent of design capacity but should be representative of site 
specific normal operations during each test run.
    (b) You must conduct each performance test (including traditional 3-
run stack tests, 30-boiler operating day tests based on CEMS data (or 
sorbent trap monitoring system data), and 30-boiler operating day Hg 
emission tests for LEE qualification) according to the requirements in 
Table 5 to this subpart.
    (c) If you choose to comply with the filterable PM emission limit 
and demonstrate continuous performance using a PM CPMS for an applicable 
emission limit as provided for in Sec. 63.10000(c), you must also 
establish an operating limit according to Sec. 63.10011(b) and Tables 4 
and 6 to this subpart. Should you desire to have operating limits that 
correspond to loads other than maximum normal operating load, you must 
conduct testing at those other loads to determine the additional 
operating limits.
    (d) Except for a 30-boiler operating day performance test based on 
CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) data, where the concept of test 
runs does not apply, you must conduct a minimum of three separate test 
runs for each performance test, as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(3). Each 
test run must comply with the minimum applicable sampling time or volume 
specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart. Sections 63.10005(d) and (h), 
respectively, provide special instructions for conducting performance 
tests based on CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring systems, and for 
conducting emission tests for LEE qualification.
    (e) To use the results of performance testing to determine 
compliance with the applicable emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this 
subpart, proceed as follows:
    (1) Except for a 30-boiler operating day performance test based on 
CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) data, if measurement results 
for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection level 
(e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components 
are below the method defined analytical detection level), you must use 
the method detection level as the measured emissions level for that 
pollutant in calculating compliance. The measured result for a multiple 
component analysis (e.g., analytical values for multiple Method 29 
fractions both for individual HAP metals and for total HAP metals) may 
include a combination of method detection level data and analytical data 
reported above the method detection level.

[[Page 171]]

    (2) If the limits are expressed in lb/MMBtu or lb/TBtu, you must use 
the F-factor methodology and equations in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of EPA 
Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter. In cases where an 
appropriate F-factor is not listed in Table 19-2 of Method 19, you may 
use F-factors from Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of 
this chapter, or F-factors derived using the procedures in section 3.3.6 
of appendix to part 75 of this chapter. Use the following factors to 
convert the pollutant concentrations measured during the initial 
performance tests to units of lb/scf, for use in the applicable Method 
19 equations:
    (i) Multiply SO<INF>2</INF> ppm by 1.66 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP>;
    (ii) Multiply HCl ppm by 9.43 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>;
    (iii) Multiply HF ppm by 5.18 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>;
    (iv) Multiply HAP metals concentrations (mg/dscm) by 6.24 x 
10<SUP>-8</SUP>; and
    (v) Multiply Hg concentrations ([micro]g/scm) by 6.24 x 
10<SUP>-11</SUP>.
    (3) To determine compliance with emission limits expressed in lb/MWh 
or lb/GWh, you must first calculate the pollutant mass emission rate 
during the performance test, in units of lb/h. For Hg, if a CEMS or 
sorbent trap monitoring system is used, use Equation A-2 or A-3 in 
appendix A to this subpart (as applicable). In all other cases, use an 
equation that has the general form of Equation A-2 or A-3, replacing the 
value of K with 1.66 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> lb/scf-ppm for SO<INF>2</INF>, 
9.43 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> lb/scf-ppm for HCl (if an HCl CEMS is used), 5.18 
x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> lb/scf-ppm for HF (if an HF CEMS is used), or 6.24 x 
10<SUP>-8</SUP> lb-scm/mg-scf for HAP metals and for HCl and HF (when 
performance stack testing is used), and defining C<INF>h</INF> as the 
average SO<INF>2</INF>, HCl, or HF concentration in ppm, or the average 
HAP metals concentration in mg/dscm. This calculation requires stack gas 
volumetric flow rate (scfh) and (in some cases) moisture content data 
(see Sec. Sec. 63.10005(h)(3) and 63.10010). Then, if the applicable 
emission limit is in units of lb/GWh, use Equation A-4 in appendix A to 
this subpart to calculate the pollutant emission rate in lb/GWh. In this 
calculation, define (M)<INF>h</INF> as the calculated pollutant mass 
emission rate for the performance test (lb/h), and define 
(MW)<INF>h</INF> as the average electrical load during the performance 
test (megawatts). If the applicable emission limit is in lb/MWh rather 
than lb/GWh, omit the 10\3\ term from Equation A-4 to determine the 
pollutant emission rate in lb/MWh.
    (f) Upon request, you shall make available to the EPA Administrator 
such records as may be necessary to determine whether the performance 
tests have been done according to the requirements of this section.

Sec. 63.10008  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 63.10009  May I use emissions averaging to comply with this subpart?

    (a) General eligibility. (1) You may use emissions averaging as 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section as an alternative to 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 63.9991 for filterable PM, 
SO<INF>2</INF>, HF, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg on an EGU-specific 
basis if:
    (i) You have more than one existing EGU in the same subcategory 
located at one or more contiguous properties, belonging to a single 
major industrial grouping, which are under common control of the same 
person (or persons under common control); and
    (ii) You use CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring systems for 
determining Hg emissions) or quarterly emissions testing for 
demonstrating compliance.
    (2) You may demonstrate compliance by emissions averaging among the 
existing EGUs in the same subcategory, if your averaged Hg emissions for 
EGUs in the ``unit designed for coal <ls-thn-eq>= 8,300 Btu/lb'' 
subcategory are equal to or less than 1.0 lb/TBtu or 1.1E-2 lb/GWh or if 
your averaged emissions of individual, other pollutants from other 
subcategories of such EGUs are equal to or less than the applicable 
emissions limit in Table 2, according to the procedures in this section. 
Note that except for Hg emissions from EGUs in the ``unit designed for 
coal <ls-thn-eq>= 8,300 Btu/lb'' subcategory, the averaging time for 
emissions averaging for pollutants is 30 days (rolling daily) using data 
from CEMS or a combination of data from CEMS and manual performance 
testing. The averaging time for emissions averaging for Hg from EGUs in 
the ``unit designed for coal <ls-thn-eq>= 8,300 Btu/lb'' subcategory is 
90 days (rolling daily)

[[Page 172]]

using data from CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring, or a combination of 
monitoring data and data from manual performance testing. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, 30- (or 90-day) group boiler operating days 
is defined as a period during which at least one unit in the emissions 
averaging group has operated 30 (or 90) days. You must calculate the 
weighted average emissions rate for the group in accordance with the 
procedures in this paragraph using the data from all units in the group 
including any that operate fewer than 30 (or 90) days during the 
preceding 30 (or 90) group boiler days.
    (i) You may choose to have your EGU emissions averaging group meet 
either the heat input basis (MMBtu or TBtu, as appropriate for the 
pollutant) or gross electrical output basis (MWh or GWh, as appropriate 
for the pollutant).
    (ii) You may not mix bases within your EGU emissions averaging 
group.
    (iii) You may use emissions averaging for affected units in 
different subcategories if the units vent to the atmosphere through a 
common stack (see paragraph (m) of this section).
    (b) Equations. Use the following equations when performing 
calculations for your EGU emissions averaging group:

    (c) Separate stack requirements. For a group of two or more existing 
EGUs in the same subcategory that each vent to a separate stack, you may 
average filterable PM, SO<INF>2</INF>, HF, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg 
emissions to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Table 2 to this 
subpart if you satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (j) of 
this section.
    (d) For each existing EGU in the averaging group:
    (1) The emissions rate achieved during the initial performance test 
for the HAP being averaged must not exceed the emissions level that was 
being achieved 180 days after April 16, 2015, or the date on which 
emissions testing done to support your emissions averaging plan is 
complete (if the Administrator does not require submission and approval 
of your emissions averaging plan), or the date that you begin emissions 
averaging, whichever is earlier; or
    (2) The control technology employed during the initial performance 
test must not be less than the design efficiency of the emissions 
control technology employed 180 days after April 16, 2015 or the date 
that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier.
    (e) The weighted-average emissions rate from the existing EGUs 
participating in the emissions averaging option must be in compliance 
with the limits in Table 2 to this subpart at all times following the 
compliance date specified 180 days after April 16, 2015, or the date on 
which you complete the emissions measurements used to support your 
emissions averaging plan (if the Administrator does not require 
submission and approval of your emissions averaging plan), or the date 
that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier.
    (f) Emissions averaging group eligibility demonstration. You must 
demonstrate the ability for the EGUs included in the emissions averaging 
group to demonstrate initial compliance according to paragraph (f)(1) or 
(2) of this section using the maximum normal operating load of each EGU 
and the results of the initial performance tests. For this demonstration 
and prior to submitting your emissions averaging plan, if requested, you 
must conduct required emissions monitoring for 30 days of boiler 
operation and any required manual performance testing to calculate an 
initial weighted average emissions rate in accordance with this section. 
Should the Administrator require approval, you must submit your proposed 
emissions averaging plan and supporting data at least 120 days before 
April 16, 2015. If the Administrator requires approval of your plan, you 
may not begin using emissions averaging until the Administrator approves 
your plan.
    (1) You must use Equation 1a in paragraph (b) of this section to 
demonstrate that the maximum weighted average emissions rates of 
filterable PM, HF, SO<INF>2</INF>, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg 
emissions from the existing units participating in the emissions 
averaging option do not exceed the emissions limits in Table 2 to this 
subpart.

[[Page 175]]

    (2) If you are not capable of monitoring heat input or gross 
electrical output, and the EGU generates steam for purposes other than 
generating electricity, you may use Equation 1b of this section as an 
alternative to using Equation 1a of this section to demonstrate that the 
maximum weighted average emissions rates of filterable PM, HF, 
SO<INF>2</INF>, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions from the 
existing units participating in the emissions averaging group do not 
exceed the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart.
    (g) You must determine the weighted average emissions rate in units 
of the applicable emissions limit on a 30 day rolling average (90 day 
rolling average for Hg) basis according to paragraphs (g)(1) through (2) 
of this section. The first averaging period begins on 30 (or 90 for Hg) 
days after February 16, 2015 or the date that you begin emissions 
averaging, whichever is earlier.
    (1) You must use Equation 2a or 3a of paragraph (b) of this section 
to calculate the weighted average emissions rate using the actual heat 
input or gross electrical output for each existing unit participating in 
the emissions averaging option.
    (2) If you are not capable of monitoring heat input or gross 
electrical output, you may use Equation 2b or 3b of paragraph (b) of 
this section as an alternative to using Equation 2a of paragraph (b) of 
this section to calculate the average weighted emission rate using the 
actual steam generation from the units participating in the emissions 
averaging option.
    (h) CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring) use. If an EGU in your 
emissions averaging group uses CEMS (or a sorbent trap monitor for Hg 
emissions) to demonstrate compliance, you must use those data to 
determine the 30 (or 90) group boiler operating day rolling average 
emissions rate.
    (i) Emissions testing. If you use manual emissions testing to 
demonstrate compliance for one or more EGUs in your emissions averaging 
group, you must use the results from the most recent performance test to 
determine the 30 (or 90) day rolling average. You may use CEMS or 
sorbent trap data in combination with data from the most recent manual 
performance test in calculating the 30 (or 90) group boiler operating 
day rolling average emissions rate.
    (j) Emissions averaging plan. You must develop an implementation 
plan for emissions averaging according to the following procedures and 
requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) You must include the information contained in paragraphs 
(j)(1)(i) through (v) of this section in your implementation plan for 
all the emissions units included in an emissions averaging:
    (i) The identification of all existing EGUs in the emissions 
averaging group, including for each either the applicable HAP emission 
level or the control technology installed as of 180 days after February 
16, 2015, or the date on which you complete the emissions measurements 
used to support your emissions averaging plan (if the Administrator does 
not require submission and approval of your emissions averaging plan), 
or the date that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier; 
and the date on which you are requesting emissions averaging to 
commence;
    (ii) The process weighting parameter (heat input, gross electrical 
output, or steam generated) that will be monitored for each averaging 
group;
    (iii) The specific control technology or pollution prevention 
measure to be used for each emission EGU in the averaging group and the 
date of its installation or application. If the pollution prevention 
measure reduces or eliminates emissions from multiple EGUs, you must 
identify each EGU;
    (iv) The means of measurement (e.g., CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring, 
manual performance test) of filterable PM, SO<INF>2</INF>, HF, HCl, 
individual or total non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions in accordance 
with the requirements in Sec. 63.10007 and to be used in the emissions 
averaging calculations; and
    (v) A demonstration that emissions averaging can produce compliance 
with each of the applicable emission limit(s) in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (2) If the Administrator requests you to submit the plan for review 
and approval, you must submit a complete

[[Page 176]]

implementation plan at least 120 days before April 16, 2015. If the 
Administrator requests you to submit the plan for review and approval, 
you must receive approval before initiating emissions averaging.
    (i) The Administrator shall use following criteria in reviewing and 
approving or disapproving the plan:
    (A) Whether the content of the plan includes all of the information 
specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and
    (B) Whether the plan presents information sufficient to determine 
that compliance will be achieved and maintained.
    (ii) The Administrator shall not approve an emissions averaging 
implementation plan containing any of the following provisions:
    (A) Any averaging between emissions of different pollutants or 
between units located at different facilities; or
    (B) The inclusion of any emissions unit other than an existing unit 
in the same subcategory.
    (k) Common stack requirements. For a group of two or more existing 
affected units, each of which vents through a single common stack, you 
may average emissions to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Table 
2 to this subpart if you satisfy the requirements in paragraph (l) or 
(m) of this section.
    (l) For a group of two or more existing units in the same 
subcategory and which vent through a common emissions control system to 
a common stack that does not receive emissions from units in other 
subcategories or categories, you may treat such averaging group as a 
single existing unit for purposes of this subpart and comply with the 
requirements of this subpart as if the group were a single unit.
    (m) For all other groups of units subject to paragraph (k) of this 
section, you may elect to conduct manual performance tests according to 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.10007 in the common stack. If emissions 
from affected units included in the emissions averaging and from other 
units not included in the emissions averaging (e.g., in a different 
subcategory) or other nonaffected units all vent to the common stack, 
you must shut down the units not included in the emissions averaging and 
the nonaffected units or vent their emissions to a different stack 
during the performance test. Alternatively, you may conduct a 
performance test of the combined emissions in the common stack with all 
units operating and show that the combined emissions meet the most 
stringent emissions limit. You may also use a CEMS or sorbent trap 
monitoring to apply this latter alternative to demonstrate that the 
combined emissions comply with the most stringent emissions limit on a 
continuous basis.
    (n) Combination requirements. The common stack of a group of two or 
more existing EGUs in the same subcategory subject to paragraph (k) of 
this section may be treated as a single stack for purposes of paragraph 
(c) of this section and included in an emissions averaging group subject 
to paragraph (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 63.10010  What are my monitoring, installation, operation, and 

maintenance requirements?

    (a) Flue gases from the affected units under this subpart exhaust to 
the atmosphere through a variety of different configurations, including 
but not limited to individual stacks, a common stack configuration or a 
main stack plus a bypass stack. For the CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap 
monitoring systems used to provide data under this subpart, the 
continuous monitoring system installation requirements for these exhaust 
configurations are as follows:
    (1) Single unit-single stack configurations. For an affected unit 
that exhausts to the atmosphere through a single, dedicated stack, you 
shall either install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap 
monitoring systems in the stack or at a location in the ductwork 
downstream of all emissions control devices, where the pollutant and 
diluents concentrations are representative of the emissions that exit to 
the atmosphere.
    (2) Unit utilizing common stack with other affected unit(s). When an 
affected unit utilizes a common stack with one or more other affected 
units, but no non-affected units, you shall either:

[[Page 177]]

    (i) Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring 
systems in the duct leading to the common stack from each unit; or
    (ii) Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring 
systems in the common stack.
    (3) Unit(s) utilizing common stack with non-affected unit(s). (i) 
When one or more affected units shares a common stack with one or more 
non-affected units, you shall either:
    (A) Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring 
systems in the ducts leading to the common stack from each affected 
unit; or
    (B) Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring 
systems described in this section in the common stack and attribute all 
of the emissions measured at the common stack to the affected unit(s).
    (ii) If you choose the common stack monitoring option:
    (A) For each hour in which valid data are obtained for all 
parameters, you must calculate the pollutant emission rate and
    (B) You must assign the calculated pollutant emission rate to each 
unit that shares the common stack.
    (4) Unit with a main stack and a bypass stack. If the exhaust 
configuration of an affected unit consists of a main stack and a bypass 
stack, you shall install CEMS on both the main stack and the bypass 
stack, or, if it is not feasible to certify and quality-assure the data 
from a monitoring system on the bypass stack, you shall install a CEMS 
only on the main stack and count bypass hours of deviation from the 
monitoring requirements.
    (5) Unit with a common control device with multiple stack or duct 
configuration. If the flue gases from an affected unit, which is 
configured such that emissions are controlled with a common control 
device or series of control devices, are discharged to the atmosphere 
through more than one stack or are fed into a single stack through two 
or more ducts, you may:
    (i) Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring 
systems in each of the multiple stacks;
    (ii) Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring 
systems in each of the ducts that feed into the stack;
    (iii) Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring 
systems in one of the multiple stacks or ducts and monitor the flows and 
dilution rates in all multiple stacks or ducts in order to determine 
total exhaust gas flow rate and pollutant mass emissions rate in 
accordance with the applicable limit; or
    (iv) In the case of multiple ducts feeding into a single stack, 
install CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the single 
stack as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (6) Unit with multiple parallel control devices with multiple 
stacks. If the flue gases from an affected unit, which is configured 
such that emissions are controlled with multiple parallel control 
devices or multiple series of control devices are discharged to the 
atmosphere through more than one stack, you shall install the required 
CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems described in each of 
the multiple stacks. You shall calculate hourly flow-weighted average 
pollutant emission rates for the unit as follows:
    (i) Calculate the pollutant emission rate at each stack or duct for 
each hour in which valid data are obtained for all parameters;
    (ii) Multiply each calculated hourly pollutant emission rate at each 
stack or duct by the corresponding hourly stack gas flow rate at that 
stack or duct;
    (iii) Sum the products determined under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this 
section; and
    (iv) Divide the result obtained in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this 
section by the total hourly stack gas flow rate for the unit, summed 
across all of the stacks or ducts.
    (b) If you use an oxygen (O<INF>2</INF>) or carbon dioxide 
(CO<INF>2</INF>) CEMS to convert measured pollutant concentrations to 
the units of the applicable emissions limit, the O<INF>2</INF> or 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations shall be monitored at a location that 
represents emissions to the atmosphere, i.e., at the outlet of the EGU, 
downstream of all emission control devices. You must install, certify, 
maintain, and operate the CEMS according

[[Page 178]]

to part 75 of this chapter. Use only quality-assured O<INF>2</INF> or 
CO<INF>2</INF> data in the emissions calculations; do not use part 75 
substitute data values.
    (c) If you are required to use a stack gas flow rate monitor, either 
for routine operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system or to convert 
pollutant concentrations to units of an electrical output-based emission 
standard in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must install, certify, 
operate, and maintain the monitoring system and conduct on-going 
quality-assurance testing of the system according to part 75 of this 
chapter. Use only unadjusted, quality-assured flow rate data in the 
emissions calculations. Do not apply bias adjustment factors to the flow 
rate data and do not use substitute flow rate data in the calculations.
    (d) If you are required to make corrections for stack gas moisture 
content when converting pollutant concentrations to the units of an 
emission standard in Table 1 of 2 to this subpart, you must install, 
certify, operate, and maintain a moisture monitoring system in 
accordance with part 75 of this chapter. Alternatively, for coal-fired 
units, you may use appropriate fuel-specific default moisture values 
from Sec. 75.11(b) of this chapter to estimate the moisture content of 
the stack gas or you may petition the Administrator under Sec. 75.66 of 
this chapter for use of a default moisture value for non-coal-fired 
units. If you install and operate a moisture monitoring system, do not 
use substitute moisture data in the emissions calculations.
    (e) If you use an HCl and/or HF CEMS, you must install, certify, 
operate, maintain, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring 
system in accordance with appendix B to this subpart. Calculate and 
record a 30-boiler operating day rolling average HCl or HF emission rate 
in the units of the standard, updated after each new boiler operating 
day. Each 30-boiler operating day rolling average emission rate is the 
average of all the valid hourly HCl or HF emission rates in the 
preceding 30 boiler operating days (see section 9.4 of appendix B to 
this subpart).
    (f)(1) If you use an SO<INF>2</INF> CEMS, you must install the 
monitor at the outlet of the EGU, downstream of all emission control 
devices, and you must certify, operate, and maintain the CEMS according 
to part 75 of this chapter.
    (2) For on-going QA, the SO<INF>2</INF> CEMS must meet the 
applicable daily, quarterly, and semiannual or annual requirements in 
sections 2.1 through 2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, with 
the following addition: You must perform the linearity checks required 
in section 2.2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter if the 
SO<INF>2</INF> CEMS has a span value of 30 ppm or less.
    (3) Calculate and record a 30-boiler operating day rolling average 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate in the units of the standard, updated after 
each new boiler operating day. Each 30-boiler operating day rolling 
average emission rate is the average of all of the valid SO<INF>2</INF> 
emission rates in the preceding 30 boiler operating days.
    (4) Use only unadjusted, quality-assured SO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration values in the emissions calculations; do not apply bias 
adjustment factors to the part 75 SO<INF>2</INF> data and do not use 
part 75 substitute data values.
    (g) If you use a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap monitoring system, you 
must install, certify, operate, maintain and quality-assure the data 
from the monitoring system in accordance with appendix A to this 
subpart. You must calculate and record a 30- (or, if alternate emissions 
averaging is used, 90-) boiler operating day rolling average Hg emission 
rate, in units of the standard, updated after each new boiler operating 
day. Each 30- (or, if alternate emissions averaging is used, 90-) boiler 
operating day rolling average emission rate, calculated according to 
section 6.2 of appendix A to the subpart, is the average of all of the

<R05>
Sec. 63.10011  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emissions 

limits and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emissions 
limit that applies to you by conducting performance testing.
    (b) If you are subject to an operating limit in Table 4 to this 
subpart, you demonstrate initial compliance with HAP metals or 
filterable PM emission limit(s) through performance stack tests and you 
elect to use a PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous performance, or if, for 
a liquid oil-fired unit, and you use quarterly stack testing for HCl and 
HF plus site-specific parameter monitoring to demonstrate continuous 
performance, you must also establish a site-specific operating limit, in 
accordance with Table 4 to this subpart, Sec. 63.10007, and Table 6 to 
this subpart. You may use only the parametric data recorded during 
successful performance tests (i.e., tests that demonstrate compliance 
with the applicable emissions limits) to establish an operating limit.
    (c)(1) If you use CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring systems to measure 
a HAP (e.g., Hg or HCl) directly, the first 30-boiler operating day (or, 
if alternate emissions averaging is used for Hg, the 90-boiler operating 
day) rolling average emission rate obtained with certified CEMS after 
the applicable date in Sec. 63.9984 (or, if applicable, prior to that 
date, as described in Sec. 63.10005(b)(2)), expressed in units of the 
standard, is the initial performance test. Initial compliance is 
demonstrated if the results of the performance test meet the applicable 
emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
    (2) For a unit that uses a CEMS to measure SO<INF>2</INF> or PM 
emissions for initial compliance, the first 30 boiler operating day 
average emission rate obtained with certified CEMS after the applicable 
date in Sec. 63.9984 (or, if applicable, prior to that date, as 
described in Sec. 63.10005(b)(2)), expressed in units of the standard, 
is the initial performance test. Initial compliance is demonstrated if 
the results of the performance test meet the applicable SO<INF>2</INF> 
or filterable PM emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.

[[Page 182]]

    (d) For candidate LEE units, use the results of the performance 
testing described in Sec. 63.10005(h) to determine initial compliance 
with the applicable emission limit(s) in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart 
and to determine whether the unit qualifies for LEE status.
    (e) You must submit a Notification of Compliance Status containing 
the results of the initial compliance demonstration, according to Sec. 
63.10030(e).
    (f)(1) You must determine the fuel whose combustion produces the 
least uncontrolled emissions, i.e., the cleanest fuel, either natural 
gas or distillate oil, that is available on site or accessible nearby 
for use during periods of startup or shutdown.
    (2) Your cleanest fuel, either natural gas or distillate oil, for 
use during periods of startup or shutdown determination may take safety 
considerations into account.
    (g) You must follow the startup or shutdown requirements given in 
Table 3 for each coal-fired, liquid oil-fired, and solid oil-derived 
fuel-fired EGU.

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.10020  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous 

compliance?

    (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section and 
the site-specific monitoring plan required by Sec. 63.10000(d).
    (b) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all 
required intervals at all times that the affected EGU is operating, 
except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control 
periods (see Sec. 63.8(c)(7) of this part), and required monitoring 
system quality assurance or quality control activities, including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments. 
You are required to affect monitoring system repairs in response to 
monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to 
operation as expeditiously as practicable.
    (c) You may not use data recorded during EGU startup or shutdown or 
monitoring system malfunctions or monitoring system out-of-control 
periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or 
monitoring system out-of-control periods, or required monitoring system 
quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report 
emissions or operating levels. You must use all the data collected 
during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control 
device and associated control system.
    (d) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or 
monitoring system out-of-control periods, repairs associated with 
monitoring system malfunctions or monitoring system out-of-control 
periods, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality 
control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and 
required zero and span adjustments), failure to collect required data is 
a deviation from the monitoring requirements.

[77 FR 9464, Feb. 16, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 23404, Apr. 19, 2012]


<R05>
Sec. 63.10021  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 

limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emissions 
limit, operating limit, and work practice standard in Tables 1 through 4 
to this subpart that applies to you, according to the monitoring 
specified in Tables 6 and 7 to this subpart and paragraphs (b) through 
(g) of this section.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 63.10020(c), if you use a 
CEMS to measure SO<INF>2</INF>, PM, HCl, HF, or Hg emissions, or using a 
sorbent trap monitoring system to measure Hg emissions, you must 
demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly 
data recorded by the CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) and the 
other required monitoring systems (e.g., flow rate, CO<INF>2</INF>, 
O<INF>2</INF>, or moisture systems) to calculate the arithmetic average 
emissions rate in units of the standard on a continuous 30-boiler 
operating day (or, if alternate emissions

[[Page 183]]

averaging is used for Hg, 90-boiler operating day) rolling average 
basis, updated at the end of each new boiler operating day. Use Equation 
8 to determine the 30- (or, if applicable, 90-) boiler operating day 
rolling average.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19AP12.002

Where:

Her<INF>i</INF> is the hourly emissions rate for hour i and n is the 
          number of hourly emissions rate values collected over 30- (or, 
          if applicable, 90-) boiler operating days.

    (c) If you use a PM CPMS data to measure compliance with an 
operating limit in Table 4 to this subpart, you must record the PM CPMS 
output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM 
CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance 
by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM 
CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average 
operating parameter in units of the operating limit (e.g., milliamps, PM 
concentration, raw data signal) on a 30 operating day rolling average 
basis, updated at the end of each new boiler operating day. Use Equation 
9 to determine the 30 boiler operating day average.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE12.010

Where:

Hpv<INF>i</INF> is the hourly parameter value for hour i and n is the 
          number of valid hourly parameter values collected over 30 
          boiler operating days.

    (d) If you use quarterly performance testing to demonstrate 
compliance with one or more applicable emissions limits in Table 1 or 2 
to this subpart, you
    (1) May skip performance testing in those quarters during which less 
than 168 boiler operating hours occur, except that a performance test 
must be conducted at least once every calendar year.
    (2) Must conduct the performance test as defined in Table 5 to this 
subpart and calculate the results of the testing in units of the 
applicable emissions standard; and
    (3) Must conduct site-specific monitoring for a liquid oil-fired 
unit to ensure compliance with the HCl and HF emission limits in Tables 
1 and 2 to this subpart, in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 
63.10000(c)(2)(iii). The monitoring must meet the general operating 
requirements provided in Sec. 63.10020(a).
    (e) If you must conduct periodic performance tune-ups of your 
EGU(s), as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (9) of this section, 
perform the first tune-up as part of your initial compliance 
demonstration. Notwithstanding this requirement, you may delay the first 
burner inspection until the next scheduled unit outage provided you meet 
the requirements of Sec. 63.10005. Subsequently, you must perform an 
inspection of the burner at least once every 36 calendar months unless 
your EGU employs neural network combustion optimization during normal 
operations in which case you must perform an inspection of the burner 
and combustion controls at least once every 48 calendar months.
    (1) As applicable, inspect the burner and combustion controls, and 
clean or replace any components of the burner or combustion controls as 
necessary upon initiation of the work practice program and at least once 
every required inspection period. Repair of a

[[Page 184]]

burner or combustion control component requiring special order parts may 
be scheduled as follows:
    (i) Burner or combustion control component parts needing replacement 
that affect the ability to optimize NO<INF>X</INF> and CO must be 
installed within 3 calendar months after the burner inspection,
    (ii) Burner or combustion control component parts that do not affect 
the ability to optimize NO<INF>X</INF> and CO may be installed on a 
schedule determined by the operator;
    (2) As applicable, inspect the flame pattern and make any 
adjustments to the burner or combustion controls necessary to optimize 
the flame pattern. The adjustment should be consistent with the 
manufacturer's specifications, if available, or in accordance with best 
combustion engineering practice for that burner type;
    (3) As applicable, observe the damper operations as a function of 
mill and/or cyclone loadings, cyclone and pulverizer coal feeder 
loadings, or other pulverizer and coal mill performance parameters, 
making adjustments and effecting repair to dampers, controls, mills, 
pulverizers, cyclones, and sensors;
    (4) As applicable, evaluate windbox pressures and air proportions, 
making adjustments and effecting repair to dampers, actuators, controls, 
and sensors;
    (5) Inspect the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio and ensure 
that it is correctly calibrated and functioning properly. Such 
inspection may include calibrating excess O<INF>2</INF> probes and/or 
sensors, adjusting overfire air systems, changing software parameters, 
and calibrating associated actuators and dampers to ensure that the 
systems are operated as designed. Any component out of calibration, in 
or near failure, or in a state that is likely to negate combustion 
optimization efforts prior to the next tune-up, should be corrected or 
repaired as necessary;
    (6) Optimize combustion to minimize generation of CO and 
NO<INF>X</INF>. This optimization should be consistent with the 
manufacturer's specifications, if available, or best combustion 
engineering practice for the applicable burner type. NO<INF>X</INF> 
optimization includes burners, overfire air controls, concentric firing 
system improvements, neural network or combustion efficiency software, 
control systems calibrations, adjusting combustion zone temperature 
profiles, and add-on controls such as SCR and SNCR; CO optimization 
includes burners, overfire air controls, concentric firing system 
improvements, neural network or combustion efficiency software, control 
systems calibrations, and adjusting combustion zone temperature 
profiles;
    (7) While operating at full load or the predominantly operated load, 
measure the concentration in the effluent stream of CO and 
NO<INF>X</INF> in ppm, by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, before 
and after the tune-up adjustments are made (measurements may be either 
on a dry or wet basis, as long as it is the same basis before and after 
the adjustments are made). You may use portable CO, NO<INF>X</INF> and 
O<INF>2</INF> monitors for this measurement. EGU's employing neural 
network optimization systems need only provide a single pre- and post-
tune-up value rather than continual values before and after each 
optimization adjustment made by the system;
    (8) Maintain on-site and submit, if requested by the Administrator, 
an annual report containing the information in paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(e)(9) of this section including:
    (i) The concentrations of CO and NO<INF>X</INF> in the effluent 
stream in ppm by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, measured before 
and after an adjustment of the EGU combustion systems;
    (ii) A description of any corrective actions taken as a part of the 
combustion adjustment; and
    (iii) The type(s) and amount(s) of fuel used over the 12 calendar 
months prior to an adjustment, but only if the unit was physically and 
legally capable of using more than one type of fuel during that period; 
and
    (9) Report the dates of the initial and subsequent tune-ups as 
follows:
    (i) If the first required tune-up is performed as part of the 
initial compliance demonstration, report the date of the tune-up in hard 
copy (as specified in Sec. 63.10030) and electronically (as specified 
in Sec. 63.10031). Report the date of

[[Page 185]]

each subsequent tune-up electronically (as specified in Sec. 63.10031).
    (ii) If the first tune-up is not conducted as part of the initial 
compliance demonstration, but is postponed until the next unit outage, 
report the date of that tune-up and all subsequent tune-ups 
electronically, in accordance with Sec. 63.10031.
    (f) You must submit the reports required under Sec. 63.10031 and, 
if applicable, the reports required under appendices A and B to this 
subpart. The electronic reports required by appendices A and B to this 
subpart must be sent to the Administrator electronically in a format 
prescribed by the Administrator, as provided in Sec. 63.10031. CEMS 
data (except for PM CEMS and any approved alternative monitoring using a 
HAP metals CEMS) shall be submitted using EPA's Emissions Collection and 
Monitoring Plan System (ECMPS) Client Tool. Other data, including PM 
CEMS data, HAP metals CEMS data, and CEMS performance test detail 
reports, shall be submitted in the file format generated through use of 
EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool, the Compliance and Emissions Data 
Reporting Interface, or alternate electronic file format, all as 
provided for under Sec. 63.10031.
    (g) You must report each instance in which you did not meet an 
applicable emissions limit or operating limit in Tables 1 through 4 to 
this subpart or failed to conduct a required tune-up. These instances 
are deviations from the requirements of this subpart. These deviations 
must be reported according to Sec. 63.10031.
    (h) You must keep records as specified in Sec. 63.10032 during 
periods of startup and shutdown.
    (i) You must provide reports as specified in Sec. 63.10031 
concerning activities and periods of startup and shutdown.

purpose or effect is to remove at least 50 percent of the SO<INF>2</INF> 
in the exhaust gas stream.
    Fossil fuel means natural gas, oil, coal, and any form of solid, 
liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material.
    Fossil fuel-fired means an electric utility steam generating unit 
(EGU) that is capable of combusting more than 25 MW of fossil fuels. To 
be ``capable of combusting'' fossil fuels, an EGU would need to have 
these fuels allowed in its operating permit and have the appropriate 
fuel handling facilities on-site or otherwise available (e.g., coal 
handling equipment, including coal storage area, belts and conveyers, 
pulverizers, etc.; oil storage facilities). In addition, fossil fuel-
fired means any EGU that fired fossil fuels for more than 10.0 percent

generated and, for an IGCC electric utility steam generating unit, the 
work performed by the stationary combustion turbines. For a unit 
generating only electricity, the gross useful work performed is the 
gross electrical output from the unit's turbine/generator sets. For a 
cogeneration unit, the gross useful work performed is the gross 
electrical output, including any such electricity used in the power 
production process (which process includes, but is not limited to, any 
on-site processing or treatment of fuel combusted at the unit and any 
on-site emission controls), or mechanical output plus 75 percent of the 
useful thermal output measured relative to ISO conditions that is not 
used to generate additional electrical or mechanical output or to 
enhance the performance of the unit (i.e., steam delivered to an 
industrial process).
    Heat input means heat derived from combustion of fuel in an EGU 
(synthetic gas for an IGCC) and does not include the heat input from

purpose. Shutdown begins either when none of the steam from the boiler 
is used to generate electricity for sale over the grid or for any other 
purpose (including on-site use), or at the point of no fuel being fired 
in the boiler, whichever is earlier. Shutdown ends when there is both no 
electricity being generated and no fuel being fired in the boiler.
    Startup means either the first-ever firing of fuel in a boiler for 
the purpose of producing electricity, or the firing

[[Page 195]]

of fuel in a boiler after a shutdown event for any purpose. Startup ends 
when any of the steam from the boiler is used to generate electricity 
for sale over the grid or for any other purpose (including on-site use).
    Stationary combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not 
limited to the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas

turbine itself and the turbine is not being used to power other 
applications at the research or laboratory facility.
    Steam generating unit means any furnace, boiler, or other device 
used for combusting fuel for the purpose of producing steam (including 
fossil-fuel-fired steam generators associated with integrated 
gasification combined cycle gas turbines; nuclear steam generators are 
not included).
    Stoker means a unit consisting of a mechanically operated fuel 
feeding mechanism, a stationary or moving grate to support the burning 
of fuel and admit undergrate air to the fuel, an overfire air system to 
complete combustion, and an ash discharge system. There are two general 
types of stokers: underfeed and overfeed. Overfeed stokers include mass 
feed and spreader stokers.

English. Examples of VCS bodies are: American Society of Testing and 
Materials (ASTM), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), 
International Standards Organization (ISO), Standards Australia (AS), 
British Standards (BS), Canadian Standards (CSA), European Standard (EN 
or CEN) and German Engineering Standards (VDI). The types of standards 
that are not considered VCS are standards developed by: the U.S. states, 
e.g., California (CARB) and Texas (TCEQ); industry groups, such as 
American Petroleum Institute (API), Gas Processors Association (GPA), 
and Gas Research Institute (GRI); and other branches of the U.S. 
government, e.g., Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of 
Transportation (DOT). This does not preclude EPA from using standards 
developed by groups that are not VCS bodies within an EPA rule. When 
this occurs, EPA has done searches and reviews for VCS equivalent to 
these non-VCS methods.
    Wet flue gas desulfurization technology, or wet FGD, or wet scrubber 
means any add-on air pollution control device that is located downstream 
of the steam generating unit that mixes an aqueous stream or slurry with

       Sec. Appendix A to Subpart UUUUU--Hg Monitoring Provisions

                          1. General Provisions

    1.1 Applicability. These monitoring provisions apply to the 
measurement of total vapor phase mercury (Hg) in emissions from electric 
utility steam generating units, using either a mercury continuous 
emission monitoring system (Hg CEMS) or a sorbent trap monitoring 
system. The Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system must be capable of 
measuring the total vapor phase mercury in units of the applicable 
emissions standard (e.g., lb/TBtu or lb/GWh), regardless of speciation.
    1.2 Initial Certification and Recertification Procedures. The owner 
or operator of an affected unit that uses a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap 
monitoring system together with other necessary monitoring components to 
account for Hg emissions in units of the applicable emissions standard 
shall comply with the initial certification and recertification 
procedures in section 4 of this appendix.
    1.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Requirements. The owner or 
operator of an affected unit that uses a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap 
monitoring system together with other necessary monitoring components to 
account for Hg emissions in units of the applicable emissions standard 
shall meet the applicable quality assurance requirements in section 5 of 
this appendix.
    1.4 Missing Data Procedures. The owner or operator of an affected 
unit is not required to substitute for missing data from Hg CEMS or 
sorbent trap monitoring systems. Any process operating hour for which 
quality-assured Hg concentration data are not obtained is counted as an 
hour of monitoring system downtime.

                      2. Monitoring of Hg Emissions

    2.1 Monitoring System Installation Requirements. Flue gases from the 
affected units under this subpart vent to the atmosphere through a 
variety of exhaust configurations including single stacks, common stack 
configurations, and multiple stack configurations. For each of these 
configurations, Sec. 63.10010(a) specifies the appropriate location(s) 
at which to install continuous monitoring systems (CMS). These CMS 
installation provisions apply to the Hg CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring 
systems, and other continuous monitoring systems that provide data for 
the Hg emissions calculations in section 6.2 of this appendix.
    2.2 Primary and Backup Monitoring Systems. In the electronic 
monitoring plan described in section 7.1.1.2.1 of this appendix, you 
must designate a primary Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system. The 
primary system must be used to report hourly Hg concentration values 
when the system is able to provide quality-assured data, i.e., when the 
system is ``in control''. However, to increase data availability in the 
event of a primary monitoring system outage, you may install, operate, 
maintain, and calibrate backup monitoring systems, as follows:
    2.2.1 Redundant Backup Systems. A redundant backup monitoring system 
may be either a separate Hg CEMS with its own probe, sample interface, 
and analyzer, or a separate sorbent trap monitoring system. A redundant 
backup system is one that is permanently installed at the unit or stack 
location, and is kept on ``hot standby'' in case the primary monitoring 
system is unable to provide quality-assured data. A redundant

[[Page 211]]

backup system must be represented as a unique monitoring system in the 
electronic monitoring plan. Each redundant backup monitoring system must 
be certified according to the applicable provisions in section 4 of this 
appendix and must meet the applicable on-going QA requirements in 
section 5 of this appendix.
    2.2.2 Non-redundant Backup Monitoring Systems. A non-redundant 
backup monitoring system is a separate Hg CEMS or sorbent trap system 
that has been certified at a particular unit or stack location, but is 
not permanently installed at that location. Rather, the system is kept 
on ``cold standby'' and may be reinstalled in the event of a primary 
monitoring system outage. A non-redundant backup monitoring system must 
be represented as a unique monitoring system in the electronic 
monitoring plan. Non-redundant backup Hg CEMS must complete the same 
certification tests as the primary monitoring system, with one 
exception. The 7-day calibration error test is not required for a non-
redundant backup Hg CEMS. Except as otherwise provided in section 
2.2.4.5 of this appendix, a non-redundant backup monitoring system may 
only be used for 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack 
location.
    2.2.3 Temporary Like-kind Replacement Analyzers. When a primary Hg 
analyzer needs repair or maintenance, you may temporarily install a 
like-kind replacement analyzer, to minimize data loss. Except as 
otherwise provided in section 2.2.4.5 of this appendix, a temporary 
like-kind replacement analyzer may only be used for 720 hours per year 
at a particular unit or stack location. The analyzer must be represented 
as a component of the primary Hg CEMS, and must be assigned a 3-
character component ID number, beginning with the prefix ``LK''.
    2.2.4 Quality Assurance Requirements for Non-redundant Backup 
Monitoring Systems and Temporary Like-kind Replacement Analyzers. To 
quality-assure the data from non-redundant backup Hg monitoring systems 
and temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzers, the following 
provisions apply:
    2.2.4.1 When a certified non-redundant backup sorbent trap 
monitoring system is brought into service, you must follow the 
procedures for routine day-to-day operation of the system, in accordance 
with Performance Specification (PS) 12B in appendix B to part 60 of this 
chapter.
    2.2.4.2 When a certified non-redundant backup Hg CEMS or a temporary 
like-kind replacement Hg analyzer is brought into service, a calibration 
error test and a linearity check must be performed and passed. A single 
point system integrity check is also required, unless a NIST-traceable 
source of oxidized Hg was used for the calibration error test.
    2.2.4.3 Each non-redundant backup Hg CEMS or temporary like-kind 
replacement Hg analyzer shall comply with all required daily, weekly, 
and quarterly quality-assurance test requirements in section 5 of this 
appendix, for as long as the system or analyzer remains in service.
    2.2.4.4 For the routine, on-going quality-assurance of a non-
redundant backup Hg monitoring system, a relative accuracy test audit 
(RATA) must be performed and passed at least once every 8 calendar 
quarters at the unit or stack location(s) where the system will be used.
    2.2.4.5 To use a non-redundant backup Hg monitoring system or a 
temporary like-kind replacement analyzer for more than 720 hours per 
year at a particular unit or stack location, a RATA must first be 
performed and passed at that location.

                3. Mercury Emissions Measurement Methods

    The following definitions, equipment specifications, procedures, and 
performance criteria are applicable to the measurement of vapor-phase Hg 
emissions from electric utility steam generating units, under relatively 
low-dust conditions (i.e., sampling in the stack or duct after all 
pollution control devices). The analyte measured by these procedures and 
specifications is total vapor-phase Hg in the flue gas, which represents 
the sum of elemental Hg (Hg<SUP>0,</SUP> CAS Number 7439-97-6) and 
oxidized forms of Hg.
    3.1 Definitions.
    3.1.1 Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System or Hg CEMS means 
all of the equipment used to continuously determine the total vapor 
phase Hg concentration. The measurement system may include the following 
major subsystems: sample acquisition, Hg<SUP>+2</SUP> to Hg<SUP>0</SUP> 
converter, sample transport, sample conditioning, flow control/gas 
manifold, gas analyzer, and data acquisition and handling system (DAHS). 
Hg CEMS may be nominally real-time or time-integrated, batch sampling 
systems that sample the gas on an intermittent basis and concentrate on 
a collection medium before intermittent analysis and reporting.
    3.1.2 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System means the equipment required to 
monitor Hg emissions continuously by using paired sorbent traps 
containing iodated charcoal (IC) or other suitable sorbent medium. The 
monitoring system consists of a probe, paired sorbent traps, an 
umbilical line, moisture removal components, an airtight sample pump, a 
gas flow meter, and an automated data acquisition and handling system. 
The system samples the stack gas at a constant proportional rate 
relative to the stack gas volumetric flow rate. The sampling is a batch 
process. The average Hg concentration in the

[[Page 212]]

stack gas for the sampling period is determined, in units of micrograms 
per dry standard cubic meter ([micro]g/dscm), based on the sample volume 
measured by the gas flow meter and the mass of Hg collected in the 
sorbent traps.
    3.1.3 NIST means the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 
located in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
    3.1.4 NIST-Traceable Elemental Hg Standards means either: compressed 
gas cylinders having known concentrations of elemental Hg, which have 
been prepared according to the ``EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and 
Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards''; or calibration gases 
having known concentrations of elemental Hg, produced by a generator 
that meets the performance requirements of the ``EPA Traceability 
Protocol for Qualification and Certification of Elemental Mercury Gas 
Generators'' or an interim version of that protocol.
    3.1.5 NIST-Traceable Source of Oxidized Hg means a generator that is 
capable of providing known concentrations of vapor phase mercuric 
chloride (HgCl<INF>2</INF>), and that meets the performance requirements 
of the ``EPA Traceability Protocol for Qualification and Certification 
of Mercuric Chloride Gas Generators'' or an interim version of that 
protocol.
    3.1.6 Calibration Gas means a NIST-traceable gas standard containing 
a known concentration of elemental or oxidized Hg that is produced and 
certified in accordance with an EPA traceability protocol.
    3.1.7 Span Value means a conservatively high estimate of the Hg 
concentrations to be measured by a CEMS. The span value of a Hg CEMS 
should be set to approximately twice the concentration corresponding to 
the emission standard, rounded off as appropriate (see section 3.2.1.4.2 
of this appendix).
    3.1.8 Zero-Level Gas means calibration gas containing a Hg 
concentration that is below the level detectable by the Hg gas analyzer 
in use.
    3.1.9 Low-Level Gas means calibration gas with a concentration that 
is 20 to 30 percent of the span value.
    3.1.10 Mid-Level Gas means calibration gas with a concentration that 
is 50 to 60 percent of the span value.
    3.1.11 High-Level Gas means calibration gas with a concentration 
that is 80 to 100 percent of the span value.
    3.1.12 Calibration Error Test means a test designed to assess the 
ability of a Hg CEMS to measure the concentrations of calibration gases 
accurately. A zero-level gas and an upscale gas are required for this 
test. For the upscale gas, either a mid-level gas or a high-level gas 
may be used, and the gas may either be an elemental or oxidized Hg 
standard.
    3.1.13 Linearity Check means a test designed to determine whether 
the response of a Hg analyzer is linear across its measurement range. 
Three elemental Hg calibration gas standards (i.e., low, mid, and high-
level gases) are required for this test.
    3.1.14 System Integrity Check means a test designed to assess the 
transport and measurement of oxidized Hg by a Hg CEMS. Oxidized Hg 
standards are used for this test. For a three-level system integrity 
check, low, mid, and high-level calibration gases are required. For a 
single-level check, either a mid-level gas or a high-level gas may be 
used.
    3.1.15 Cycle Time Test means a test designed to measure the amount 
of time it takes for a Hg CEMS, while operating normally, to respond to 
a known step change in gas concentration. For this test, a zero gas and 
a high-level gas are required. The high-level gas may be either an 
elemental or an oxidized Hg standard.
    3.1.16 Relative Accuracy Test Audit or RATA means a series of nine 
or more test runs, directly comparing readings from a Hg CEMS or sorbent 
trap monitoring system to measurements made with a reference stack test 
method. The relative accuracy (RA) of the monitoring system is expressed 
as the absolute mean difference between the monitoring system and 
reference method measurements plus the absolute value of the 2.5 percent 
error confidence coefficient, divided by the mean value of the reference 
method measurements.
    3.1.17 Unit Operating Hour means a clock hour in which a unit 
combusts any fuel, either for part of the hour or for the entire hour.
    3.1.18 Stack Operating Hour means a clock hour in which gases flow 
through a particular monitored stack or duct (either for part of the 
hour or for the entire hour), while the associated unit(s) are 
combusting fuel.
    3.1.19 Operating Day means a calendar day in which a source combusts 
any fuel.
    3.1.20 Quality Assurance (QA) Operating Quarter means a calendar 
quarter in which there are at least 168 unit or stack operating hours 
(as defined in this section).
    3.1.21 Grace Period means a specified number of unit or stack 
operating hours after the deadline for a required quality-assurance test 
of a continuous monitor has passed, in which the test may be performed 
and passed without loss of data.
    3.2 Continuous Monitoring Methods.
    3.2.1 Hg CEMS. A typical Hg CEMS is shown in Figure A-1. The CEMS in 
Figure A-1 is a dilution extractive system, which measures Hg 
concentration on a wet basis, and is the most commonly-used type of Hg 
CEMS. Other system designs may be used, provided that the CEMS meets the 
performance specifications in section 4.1.1 of this appendix.

[[Page 213]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE12.012

    3.2.1.1 Equipment Specifications.
    3.2.1.1.1 Materials of Construction. All wetted sampling system 
components, including probe components prior to the point at which the 
calibration gas is introduced, must be chemically inert to all Hg 
species. Materials such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) Teflon\TM\, quartz, and 
treated stainless steel (SS) are examples of such materials.
    3.2.1.1.2 Temperature Considerations. All system components prior to 
the Hg<SUP>+2</SUP> to Hg\0\ converter must be maintained at a sample 
temperature above the acid gas dew point.
    3.2.1.1.3 Measurement System Components.
    3.2.1.1.3.1 Sample Probe. The probe must be made of the appropriate 
materials as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section, heated when 
necessary, as described in paragraph 3.2.1.1.3.4 of this section, and 
configured with ports for introduction of calibration gases.
    3.2.1.1.3.2 Filter or Other Particulate Removal Device. The filter 
or other particulate removal device is part of the measurement system, 
must be made of appropriate materials, as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 
of this section, and must be included in all system tests.
    3.2.1.1.3.3 Sample Line. The sample line that connects the probe to 
the converter, conditioning system, and analyzer must be made of 
appropriate materials, as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section.
    3.2.1.1.3.4 Conditioning Equipment. For wet basis systems, such as 
the one shown in Figure A-1, the sample must be kept above its dew point 
either by: heating the sample line and all sample transport components 
up to the inlet of the analyzer (and, for hot-wet extractive systems, 
also heating the analyzer); or diluting the sample prior to analysis 
using a dilution probe system. The components required for these 
operations are considered to be conditioning equipment. For dry basis 
measurements, a condenser, dryer or other suitable device is required to 
remove moisture continuously from the sample gas, and any equipment 
needed to heat the probe or sample line to avoid condensation prior to 
the moisture removal component is also required.
    3.2.1.1.3.5 Sampling Pump. A pump is needed to push or pull the 
sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the 
response time of the measurement system. If a mechanical sample pump is 
used and its surfaces are in contact with the sample gas prior to 
detection, the pump must be leak free and must be constructed of a 
material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled (see paragraph 
3.2.1.1.1 of this section). For dilution-type measurement systems, such 
as the system shown in Figure A-1, an ejector pump (eductor) may be used 
to create a sufficient vacuum that sample gas will be drawn through a 
critical orifice at a constant rate. The ejector pump must be 
constructed of any material that is non-reactive to the gas being 
sampled.
    3.2.1.1.3.6 Calibration Gas System(s). Design and equip each Hg CEMS 
to permit the introduction of known concentrations of elemental Hg and 
HgCl<INF>2</INF> separately, at a point

[[Page 214]]

preceding the sample extraction filtration system, such that the entire 
measurement system can be checked. The calibration gas system(s) must be 
designed so that the flow rate exceeds the sampling system flow 
requirements and that the gas is delivered to the CEMS at atmospheric 
pressure.
    3.2.1.1.3.7 Sample Gas Delivery. The sample line may feed directly 
to either a converter, a by-pass valve (for Hg speciating systems), or a 
sample manifold. All valve and/or manifold components must be made of 
material that is non-reactive to the gas sampled and the calibration 
gas, and must be configured to safely discharge any excess gas.
    3.2.1.1.3.8 Hg Analyzer. An instrument is required that continuously 
measures the total vapor phase Hg concentration in the gas stream. The 
analyzer may also be capable of measuring elemental and oxidized Hg 
separately.
    3.2.1.1.3.9 Data Recorder. A recorder, such as a computerized data 
acquisition and handling system (DAHS), digital recorder, or data 
logger, is required for recording measurement data.
    3.2.1.2 Reagents and Standards.
    3.2.1.2.1 NIST Traceability. Only NIST-certified or NIST-traceable 
calibration gas standards and reagents (as defined in paragraphs 3.1.4 
and 3.1.5 of this section) shall be used for the tests and procedures 
required under this subpart. Calibration gases with known concentrations 
of Hg<SUP>0</SUP> and HgCl<INF>2</INF> are required. Special reagents 
and equipment may be needed to prepare the Hg<SUP>0</SUP> and 
HgCl<INF>2</INF> gas standards (e.g., NIST-traceable solutions of 
HgCl<INF>2</INF> and gas generators equipped with mass flow 
controllers).
    3.2.1.2.2 Required Calibration Gas Concentrations.
    3.2.1.2.2.1 Zero-Level Gas. A zero-level calibration gas with a Hg 
concentration below the level detectable by the Hg analyzer is required 
for calibration error tests and cycle time tests of the CEMS.
    3.2.1.2.2.2 Low-Level Gas. A low-level calibration gas with a Hg 
concentration of 20 to 30 percent of the span value is required for 
linearity checks and 3-level system integrity checks of the CEMS. 
Elemental Hg standards are required for the linearity checks and 
oxidized Hg standards are required for the system integrity checks.
    3.2.1.2.2.3 Mid-Level Gas. A mid-level calibration gas with a Hg 
concentration of 50 to 60 percent of the span value is required for 
linearity checks and for 3-level system integrity checks of the CEMS, 
and is optional for calibration error tests and single-level system 
integrity checks. Elemental Hg standards are required for the linearity 
checks, oxidized Hg standards are required for the system integrity 
checks, and either elemental or oxidized Hg standards may be used for 
the calibration error tests.
    3.2.1.2.2.4 High-Level Gas. A high-level calibration gas with a Hg 
concentration of 80 to 100 percent of the span value is required for 
linearity checks, 3-level system integrity checks, and cycle time tests 
of the CEMS, and is optional for calibration error tests and single-
level system integrity checks. Elemental Hg standards are required for 
the linearity checks, oxidized Hg standards are required for the system 
integrity checks, and either elemental or oxidized Hg standards may be 
used for the calibration error and cycle time tests.
    3.2.1.3 Installation and Measurement Location. For the Hg CEMS and 
any additional monitoring system(s) needed to convert Hg concentrations 
to the desired units of measure (i.e., a flow monitor, CO<INF>2</INF> or 
O<INF>2</INF> monitor, and/or moisture monitor, as applicable), install 
each monitoring system at a location: that is consistent with 
63.10010(a); that represents the emissions exiting to the atmosphere; 
and where it is likely that the CEMS can pass the relative accuracy 
test.
    3.2.1.4 Monitor Span and Range Requirements. Determine the 
appropriate span and range value(s) for the Hg CEMS as described in 
paragraphs 3.2.1.4.1 through 3.2.1.4.3 of this section.
    3.2.1.4.1 Maximum Potential Concentration. There are three options 
for determining the maximum potential Hg concentration (MPC). Option 1 
applies to coal combustion. You may use a default value of 10 [micro]g/
scm for all coal ranks (including coal refuse) except for lignite; for 
lignite, use 16 [micro]g/scm. If different coals are blended as part of 
normal operation, use the highest MPC for any fuel in the blend. Option 
2 is to base the MPC on the results of site-specific Hg emission 
testing. This option may be used only if the unit does not have add-on 
Hg emission controls or a flue gas desulfurization system, or if testing 
is performed upstream of all emission control devices. If Option 2 is 
selected, perform at least three test runs at the normal operating load, 
and the highest Hg concentration obtained in any of the tests shall be 
the MPC. Option 3 is to use fuel sampling and analysis to estimate the 
MPC. To make this estimate, use the average Hg content (i.e., the weight 
percentage) from at least three representative fuel samples, together 
with other available information, including, but not limited to the 
maximum fuel feed rate, the heating value of the fuel, and an 
appropriate F-factor. Assume that all of the Hg in the fuel is emitted 
to the atmosphere as vapor-phase Hg.
    3.2.1.4.2 Span Value. To determine the span value of the Hg CEMS, 
multiply the Hg concentration corresponding to the applicable emissions 
standard by two. If the result of this calculation is an exact multiple 
of 10 [micro]g/scm, use the result as the span value. Otherwise, round 
off the result to either: the

[[Page 215]]

next highest integer; the next highest multiple of 5 [micro]g/scm; or 
the next highest multiple of 10 [micro]g/scm.
    3.2.1.4.3 Analyzer Range. The Hg analyzer must be capable of reading 
Hg concentration as high as the MPC.
    3.2.2 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System. A sorbent trap monitoring 
system (as defined in paragraph 3.1.2 of this section) may be used as an 
alternative to a Hg CEMS. If this option is selected, the monitoring 
system shall be installed, maintained, and operated in accordance with 
Performance Specification (PS) 12B in Appendix B to part 60 of this 
chapter. The system shall be certified in accordance with the provisions 
of section 4.1.2 of this appendix.
    3.2.3 Other Necessary Data Collection. To convert measured hourly Hg 
concentrations to the units of the applicable emissions standard (i.e., 
lb/TBtu or lb/GWh), additional data must be collected, as described in 
paragraphs 3.2.3.1 through 3.2.3.3 of this section. Any additional 
monitoring systems needed for this purpose must be certified, operated, 
maintained, and quality-assured according to the applicable provisions 
of part 75 of this chapter (see Sec. Sec. 63.10010(b) through (d)). The 
calculation methods for the types of emission limits described in 
paragraphs 3.2.3.1 and 3.2.3.2 of this section are presented in section 
6.2 of this appendix.
    3.2.3.1 Heat Input-Based Emission Limits. For a heat input-based Hg 
emission limit (i.e., in lb/TBtu), data from a certified CO<INF>2</INF> 
or O<INF>2</INF> monitor are needed, along with a fuel-specific F-factor 
and a conversion constant to convert measured Hg concentration values to 
the units of the standard. In some cases, the stack gas moisture content 
must also be considered in making these conversions.
    3.2.3.2 Electrical Output-Based Emission Rates. If the applicable Hg 
limit is electrical output-based (i.e., lb/GWh), hourly electrical load 
data and unit operating times are required in addition to hourly data 
from a certified stack gas flow rate monitor and (if applicable) 
moisture data.
    3.2.3.3 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System Operation. Routine operation 
of a sorbent trap monitoring system requires the use of a certified 
stack gas flow rate monitor, to maintain an established ratio of stack 
gas flow rate to sample flow rate.

            4. Certification and Recertification Requirements

    4.1 Certification Requirements. All Hg CEMS and sorbent trap 
monitoring systems and the additional monitoring systems used to 
continuously measure Hg emissions in units of the applicable emissions 
standard in accordance with this appendix must be certified in a timely 
manner, such that the initial compliance demonstration is completed no 
later than the applicable date in Sec. 63.10005(g).
    4.1.1 Hg CEMS. Table A-1, below, summarizes the certification test 
requirements and performance specifications for a Hg CEMS. The CEMS may 
not be used to report quality-assured data until these performance 
criteria are met. Paragraphs 4.1.1.1 through 4.1.1.5 of this section 
provide specific instructions for the required tests. All tests must be 
performed with the affected unit(s) operating (i.e., combusting fuel). 
Except for the RATA, which must be performed at normal load, no 
particular load level is required for the certification tests.
    4.1.1.1 7-Day Calibration Error Test. Perform the 7-day calibration 
error test on 7 consecutive source operating days, using a zero-level 
gas and either a high-level or a mid-level calibration gas standard (as 
defined in sections 3.1.8, 3.1.10, and 3.1.11 of this appendix). Either 
elemental or oxidized NIST-traceable Hg standards (as defined in 
sections 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 of this appendix) may be used for the test. If 
moisture and/or chlorine is added to the calibration gas, the dilution 
effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas 
concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Operate 
the Hg CEMS in its normal sampling mode during the test. The 
calibrations should be approximately 24 hours apart, unless the 7-day 
test is performed over nonconsecutive calendar days. On each day of the 
test, inject the zero-level and upscale gases in sequence and record the 
analyzer responses. Pass the calibration gas through all filters, 
scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal 
sampling, and through as much of the sampling probe as is practical. Do 
not make any manual adjustments to the monitor (i.e., resetting the 
calibration) until after taking measurements at both the zero and 
upscale concentration levels. If automatic adjustments are made 
following both injections, conduct the calibration error test such that 
the magnitude of the adjustments can be determined, and use only the 
unadjusted analyzer responses in the calculations. Calculate the 
calibration error (CE) on each day of the test, as described in Table A-
1. The CE on each day of the test must either meet the main performance 
specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1.
    4.1.1.2 Linearity Check. Perform the linearity check using low, mid, 
and high-level concentrations of NIST-traceable elemental Hg standards. 
Three gas injections at each concentration level are required, with no 
two successive injections at the same concentration level. Introduce the 
calibration gas at the gas injection port, as specified in section 
3.2.1.1.3.6 of this appendix. Operate the CEMS at its normal operating 
temperature and conditions. Pass the calibration gas through all 
filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other components used during 
normal sampling, and through as much of the sampling probe

[[Page 216]]

as is practical. If moisture and/or chlorine is added to the calibration 
gas, the dilution effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the 
calibration gas concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate 
manner. Record the monitor response from the data acquisition and 
handling system for each gas injection. At each concentration level, use 
the average analyzer response to calculate the linearity error (LE), as 
described in Table A-1. The LE must either meet the main performance 
specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1.
    4.1.1.3 Three-Level System Integrity Check. Perform the 3-level 
system integrity check using low, mid, and high-level calibration gas 
concentrations generated by a NIST-traceable source of oxidized Hg. 
Follow the same basic procedure as for the linearity check. If moisture 
and/or chlorine is added to the calibration gas, the dilution effect of 
the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas 
concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Calculate 
the system integrity error (SIE), as described in Table A-1. The SIE 
must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative 
specification in Table A-1. (Note: This test is not required if the CEMS 
does not have a converter).

\1\ Note that [verbarlm]R - A [verbarlm] is the absolute value of the difference between the reference gas value
  and the analyzer reading. [verbarlm]R - Aavg, [verbarlm] is the absolute value of the difference between the
  reference gas concentration and the average of the analyzer responses, at a particular gas level.
\2\ Use either elemental or oxidized Hg standards; a mid-level or high-level upscale gas may be used. This test
  is not required for Hg CEMS that use integrated batch sampling; however, those monitors must be capable of
  recording at least one Hg concentration reading every 15 minutes.
\3\ Use elemental Hg standards.
\4\ Use oxidized Hg standards. Not required if the CEMS does not have a converter.
\5\ Stability criteria--Readings change by <2.0% of span or by <=0.5 [micro]g/scm, for 2 minutes.
** Note that [verbarlm]RMavg-Cavg [verbarlm] is the absolute difference between the mean reference method value
  and the mean CEMS value from the RATA. The arithmetic difference between RMavg and Cavg can be either + or -.

    4.1.1.4 Cycle Time Test. Perform the cycle time test, using a zero-
level gas and a high-level calibration gas.
    Either an elemental or oxidized NIST-traceable Hg standard may be 
used as the high-level gas. Perform the test in two stages--upscale and 
downscale. The slower of the upscale and downscale response times is the 
cycle time for the CEMS. Begin each stage of the test by injecting 
calibration gas after achieving a stable reading of the stack emissions. 
The cycle time is the amount of time it takes for the analyzer to 
register a reading that is 95 percent of the way between the stable 
stack emissions reading and the final, stable reading of the calibration 
gas concentration. Use the following criterion to determine when a 
stable reading of stack emissions or calibration gas has been attained--
the reading is stable if it changes by no more than 2.0 percent of the 
span value or 0.5 [micro]g/scm (whichever is less restrictive) for two 
minutes, or a reading with a change of less than 6.0 percent from the 
measured average concentration over 6 minutes. Integrated batch sampling 
type Hg CEMS are exempted from this test; however, these systems must be 
capable of delivering a measured Hg concentration reading at least once 
every 15 minutes. If necessary to increase measurement sensitivity of a 
batch sampling type Hg CEMS for a specific application, you may petition 
the Administrator for approval of a time longer than 15 minutes between 
readings.
    4.1.1.5 Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). Perform the RATA of the 
Hg CEMS at normal load. Acceptable Hg reference methods for the RATA 
include ASTM D6784-02 (Reapproved 2008), ``Standard Test Method for 
Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas 
Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method)'' 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14) and Methods 29, 30A, and 
30B in appendix A-8 to part 60. When Method 29 or

[[Page 217]]

ASTM D6784-02 is used, paired sampling trains are required. To validate 
a Method 29 or ASTM D6784-02 test run, calculate the relative deviation 
(RD) using Equation A-1 of this section, and assess the results as 
follows to validate the run. The RD must not exceed 10 percent, when the 
average Hg concentration is greater than 1.0 [micro]g/dscm. If the 
average concentration is <= 1.0 [micro]g/dscm, the RD must not exceed 20 
percent. The RD results are also acceptable if the absolute difference 
between the two Hg concentrations does not exceed 0.2 [micro]g/dscm. If 
the RD specification is met, the results of the two samples shall be 
averaged arithmetically.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE12.013

Where:

RD = Relative deviation between the Hg concentrations of samples ``a'' 
          and ``b'' (percent)
C<INF>a</INF> = Hg concentration of Hg sample ``a'' ([micro]g/dscm)
C<INF>b</INF> = Hg concentration of Hg sample ``b'' ([micro]g/dscm)

    4.1.1.5.1 Special Considerations. A minimum of nine valid test runs 
must be performed, directly comparing the CEMS measurements to the 
reference method. More than nine test runs may be performed. If this 
option is chosen, the results from a maximum of three test runs may be 
rejected so long as the total number of test results used to determine 
the relative accuracy is greater than or equal to nine; however, all 
data must be reported including the rejected data. The minimum time per 
run is 21 minutes if Method 30A is used. If Method 29, Method 30B, or 
ASTM D6784-02 (Reapproved 2008), ``Standard Test Method for Elemental, 
Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from 
Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method)'' (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 63.14) is used, the time per run must be long 
enough to collect a sufficient mass of Hg to analyze. Complete the RATA 
within 168 unit operating hours, except when Method 29 or ASTM D6784-02 
is used, in which case up to 336 operating hours may be taken to finish 
the test.
    4.1.1.5.2 Calculation of RATA Results. Calculate the relative 
accuracy (RA) of the monitoring system, on a [micro]g/scm basis, as 
described in section 12 of Performance Specification (PS) 2 in Appendix 
B to part 60 of this chapter (see Equations 2-3 through 2-6 of PS2). For 
purposes of calculating the relative accuracy, ensure that the reference 
method and monitoring system data are on a consistent moisture basis, 
either wet or dry. The CEMS must either meet the main performance 
specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1.
    4.1.1.5.3 Bias Adjustment. Measurement or adjustment of Hg CEMS data 
for bias is not required.
    4.1.2 Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems. For the initial certification 
of a sorbent trap monitoring system, only a RATA is required.
    4.1.2.1 Reference Methods. The acceptable reference methods for the 
RATA of a sorbent trap monitoring system are the same as those listed in 
paragraph 4.1.1.5 of this section.
    4.1.2.2 ``The special considerations specified in paragraph 
4.1.1.5.1 of this section apply to the RATA of a sorbent trap monitoring 
system. During the RATA, the monitoring system must be operated and 
quality-assured in accordance with Performance Specification (PS) 12B in 
Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter with the following exceptions for 
sorbent trap section 2 breakthrough:
    4.1.2.2.1 For stack Hg concentrations <ls-thn-eq>1 [micro]g/dscm, 
<=10% of section 1 Hg mass;
    4.1.2.2.2 For stack Hg concentrations <=1 [micro]g/dscm and 
<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [micro]g/dscm, <= 20% of section 1 Hg mass;
    4.1.2.2.3 For stack Hg concentrations <=0.5 [micro]g/dscm and 
<ls-thn-eq>0.1 [micro]g/dscm, <= 50% of section 1 Hg mass; and
    4.1.2.2.4 For stack Hg concentrations <=0.1[micro]g/dscm, no 
breakthrough criterion assuming all other QA/QC specifications are met.
    4.1.2.3 The type of sorbent material used by the traps during the 
RATA must be the same as for daily operation of the monitoring system; 
however, the size of the traps used for the RATA may be smaller than the 
traps used for daily operation of the system.
    4.1.2.4 Calculation of RATA Results. Calculate the relative accuracy 
(RA) of the sorbent trap monitoring system, on a [micro]g/scm basis, as 
described in section 12 of Performance Specification (PS) 2 in appendix 
B to part 60 of this chapter (see Equations 2-3 through 2-6 of PS2). For 
purposes of calculating the relative accuracy, ensure that the reference 
method and monitoring system data are on a consistent moisture basis, 
either wet or dry.The main and alternative RATA performance 
specifications in Table A-1 for Hg CEMS also apply to the sorbent trap 
monitoring system.

[[Page 218]]

    4.1.2.5 Bias Adjustment. Measurement or adjustment of sorbent trap 
monitoring system data for bias is not required.
    4.1.3 Diluent Gas, Flow Rate, and/or Moisture Monitoring Systems. 
Monitoring systems that are used to measure stack gas volumetric flow 
rate, diluent gas concentration, or stack gas moisture content, either 
for routine operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system or to convert 
Hg concentration data to units of the applicable emission limit, must be 
certified in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 75 of 
this chapter.
    4.2 Recertification. Whenever the owner or operator makes a 
replacement, modification, or change to a certified CEMS or sorbent trap 
monitoring system that may significantly affect the ability of the 
system to accurately measure or record pollutant or diluent gas 
concentrations, stack gas flow rates, or stack gas moisture content, the 
owner or operator shall recertify the monitoring system. Furthermore, 
whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or 
change to the flue gas handling system or the unit operation that may 
significantly change the concentration or flow profile, the owner or 
operator shall recertify the monitoring system. The same tests performed 
for the initial certification of the monitoring system shall be repeated 
for recertification, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. 
Examples of changes that require recertification include: replacement of 
a gas analyzer; complete monitoring system replacement, and changing the 
location or orientation of the sampling probe.

          5. Ongoing Quality Assurance (QA) and Data Validation

    5.1 Hg CEMS.
    5.1.1 Required QA Tests. Periodic QA testing of each Hg CEMS is 
required following initial certification. The required QA tests, the 
test frequencies, and the performance specifications that must be met 
are summarized in Table A-2, below. All tests must be performed with the 
affected unit(s) operating (i.e., combusting fuel). Except for the RATA, 
which must be performed at normal load, no particular load level is 
required for the tests. For each test, follow the same basic procedures 
in section 4.1.1 of this appendix that were used for initial 
certification.
    5.1.2 Test Frequency. The frequency for the required QA tests of the 
Hg CEMS shall be as follows:
    5.1.2.1 Calibration error tests of the Hg CEMS are required daily, 
except during unit outages. Use either NIST-traceable elemental Hg 
standards or NIST-traceable oxidized Hg standards for these 
calibrations. Both a zero-level gas and either a mid-level or high-level 
gas are required for these calibrations.
    5.1.2.2 Perform a linearity check of the Hg CEMS in each QA 
operating quarter, using low-level, mid-level, and high-level NIST-
traceable elemental Hg standards. For units that operate infrequently, 
limited exemptions from this test are allowed for ``non-QA operating 
quarters''. A maximum of three consecutive exemptions for this reason 
are permitted, following the quarter of the last test. After the third 
consecutive exemption, a linearity check must be performed in the next 
calendar quarter or within a grace period of 168 unit or stack operating 
hours after the end of that quarter. The test frequency for 3-level 
system integrity checks (if performed in lieu of linearity checks) is 
the same as for the linearity checks. Use low-level, mid-level, and 
high-level NIST-traceable oxidized Hg standards for the system integrity 
checks.
    5.1.2.3 If required, perform a single-level system integrity check 
weekly, i.e., once every 7 operating days (see the third column in Table 
A-2).
    5.1.2.4 The test frequency for the RATAs of the Hg CEMS shall be 
annual, i.e., once every four QA operating quarters. For units that 
operate infrequently, extensions of RATA deadlines are allowed for non-
QA operating quarters. Following a RATA, if there is a subsequent non-QA 
quarter, it extends the deadline for the next test by one calendar 
quarter. However, there is a limit to these extensions; the deadline may 
not be extended beyond the end of the eighth calendar quarter after the 
quarter of the last test. At that point, a RATA must either be performed 
within the eighth calendar quarter or in a 720 hour unit or stack 
operating hour grace period following that quarter. When a required 
annual RATA is done within a grace period, the deadline for the next 
RATA is three QA operating quarters after the quarter in which the grace 
period test is performed.
    5.1.3 Grace Periods.
    5.1.3.1 A 168 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available 
for quarterly linearity checks and 3-level system integrity checks of 
the Hg CEMS.
    5.1.3.2 A 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available 
for RATAs of the Hg CEMS.
    5.1.3.3 There is no grace period for weekly system integrity checks. 
The test must be completed once every 7 operating days.
    5.1.4 Data Validation. The Hg CEMS is considered to be out-of-
control, and data from the CEMS may not be reported as quality-assured, 
when any one of the acceptance criteria for the required QA tests in 
Table A-2 is not met. The CEMS is also considered to be out-of-control 
when a required QA test is not performed on schedule or within an 
allotted grace period. To end an out-of-control period, the QA test that 
was either failed or not done on time must be performed and

[[Page 219]]

passed. Out-of-control periods are counted as hours of monitoring system 
downtime.
    5.1.5 Conditional Data Validation. For certification, 
recertification, and diagnostic testing of Hg monitoring systems, and 
for the required QA tests when non-redundant backup Hg monitoring 
systems or temporary like-kind Hg analyzers are brought into service, 
the conditional data validation provisions in Sec. Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(ii) 
through (b)(3)(ix) of this chapter may be used to avoid or minimize data 
loss. The allotted window of time to complete 7-day calibration error 
tests, linearity checks, cycle time tests, and RATAs shall be as 
specified in Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter. Required system 
integrity checks must be completed within 168 unit or stack operating 
hours after the probationary calibration error test.

    5.2 Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems.
    5.2.1 Each sorbent trap monitoring system shall be continuously 
operated and maintained in accordance with Performance Specification 
(PS) 12B in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. The QA/QC criteria 
for routine operation of the system are summarized in Table 12B-1 of PS 
12B. Each pair of

[[Page 220]]

sorbent traps may be used to sample the stack gas for up to 14 operating 
days.
    5.2.2 For ongoing QA, periodic RATAs of the system are required.
    5.2.2.1 The RATA frequency shall be annual, i.e., once every four QA 
operating quarters. The provisions in section 5.1.2.4 of this appendix 
pertaining to RATA deadline extensions also apply to sorbent trap 
monitoring systems.
    5.2.2.2 The same RATA performance criteria specified in Table A-4 
for Hg CEMS shall apply to the annual RATAs of the sorbent trap 
monitoring system.
    5.2.2.3 A 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available 
for RATAs of the monitoring system.
    5.2.3 Data validation for sorbent trap monitoring systems shall be 
done in accordance with Table 12B-1 in Performance Specification (PS) 
12B in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. All periods of invalid 
data shall be counted as hours of monitoring system downtime.
    5.3 Flow Rate, Diluent Gas, and Moisture Monitoring Systems. The on-
going QA test requirements for these monitoring systems are specified in 
part 75 of this chapter (see Sec. Sec. 63.10010(b) through (d)).
    5.4 QA/QC Program Requirements. The owner or operator shall develop 
and implement a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program for 
the Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring systems that are used to 
provide data under this subpart. At a minimum, the program shall include 
a written plan that describes in detail (or that refers to separate 
documents containing) complete, step-by-step procedures and operations 
for the most important QA/QC activities. Electronic storage of the QA/QC 
plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available 
in hard copy to auditors and inspectors. The QA/QC program requirements 
for the diluent gas, flow rate, and moisture monitoring systems 
described in section 3.2.1.3 of this appendix are specified in section 1 
of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.
    5.4.1 General Requirements.
    5.4.1.1 Preventive Maintenance. Keep a written record of procedures 
needed to maintain the Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring system(s) 
in proper operating condition and a schedule for those procedures. 
Include, at a minimum, all procedures specified by the manufacturers of 
the equipment and, if applicable, additional or alternate procedures 
developed for the equipment.
    5.4.1.2 Recordkeeping and Reporting. Keep a written record 
describing procedures that will be used to implement the recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements of this appendix.
    5.4.1.3 Maintenance Records. Keep a record of all testing, 
maintenance, or repair activities performed on any Hg CEMS or sorbent 
trap monitoring system in a location and format suitable for inspection. 
A maintenance log may be used for this purpose. The following records 
should be maintained: date, time, and description of any testing, 
adjustment, repair, replacement, or preventive maintenance action 
performed on any monitoring system and records of any corrective actions 
associated with a monitor outage period. Additionally, any adjustment 
that may significantly affect a system's ability to accurately measure 
emissions data must be recorded (e.g., changing the dilution ratio of a 
CEMS), and a written explanation of the procedures used to make the 
adjustment(s) shall be kept.
    5.4.2 Specific Requirements for Hg CEMS.
    5.4.2.1 Daily Calibrations, Linearity Checks and System Integrity 
Checks. Keep a written record of the procedures used for daily 
calibrations of the Hg CEMS. If moisture and/or chlorine is added to the 
Hg calibration gas, document how the dilution effect of the moisture 
and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas concentration is 
accounted for in an appropriate manner. Also keep records of the 
procedures used to perform linearity checks of the Hg CEMS and the 
procedures for system integrity checks of the Hg CEMS. Document how the 
test results are calculated and evaluated.
    5.4.2.2 Monitoring System Adjustments. Document how each component 
of the Hg CEMS will be adjusted to provide correct responses to 
calibration gases after routine maintenance, repairs, or corrective 
actions.
    5.4.2.3 Relative Accuracy Test Audits. Keep a written record of 
procedures used for RATAs of the Hg CEMS. Indicate the reference methods 
used and document how the test results are calculated and evaluated.
    5.4.3 Specific Requirements for Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems.
    5.4.3.1 Sorbent Trap Identification and Tracking. Include procedures 
for inscribing or otherwise permanently marking a unique identification 
number on each sorbent trap, for chain of custody purposes. Keep records 
of the ID of the monitoring system in which each sorbent trap is used, 
and the dates and hours of each Hg collection period.
    5.4.3.2 Monitoring System Integrity and Data Quality. Document the 
procedures used to perform the leak checks when a sorbent trap is placed 
in service and removed from service. Also Document the other QA 
procedures used to ensure system integrity and data quality, including, 
but not limited to, gas flow meter calibrations, verification of 
moisture removal, and ensuring air-tight pump operation. In addition, 
the QA plan must include the data acceptance and quality control 
criteria in Table 12B-1 in section 9.0 of Performance Specification (PS) 
12B in Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. All reference meters used 
to calibrate the gas flow

[[Page 221]]

meters (e.g., wet test meters) shall be periodically recalibrated. 
Annual, or more frequent, recalibration is recommended. If a NIST-
traceable calibration device is used as a reference flow meter, the QA 
plan must include a protocol for ongoing maintenance and periodic 
recalibration to maintain the accuracy and NIST-traceability of the 
calibrator.
    5.4.3.3 Hg Analysis. Explain the chain of custody employed in 
packing, transporting, and analyzing the sorbent traps. Keep records of 
all Hg analyses. The analyses shall be performed in accordance with the 
procedures described in section 11.0 of Performance Specification (PS) 
12B in Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.
    5.4.3.4 Data Collection Period. State, and provide the rationale 
for, the minimum acceptable data collection period (e.g., one day, one 
week, etc.) for the size of sorbent trap selected for the monitoring. 
Address such factors as the Hg concentration in the stack gas, the 
capacity of the sorbent trap, and the minimum mass of Hg required for 
the analysis. Each pair of sorbent traps may be used to sample the stack 
gas for up to 14 operating days.
    5.4.3.5 Relative Accuracy Test Audit Procedures. Keep records of the 
procedures and details peculiar to the sorbent trap monitoring systems 
that are to be followed for relative accuracy test audits, such as 
sampling and analysis methods.

                   6. Data Reduction and Calculations

    6.1 Data Reduction.
    6.1.1 Reduce the data from Hg CEMS to hourly averages, in accordance 
with Sec. 60.13(h)(2) of this chapter.
    6.1.2 For sorbent trap monitoring systems, determine the Hg 
concentration for each data collection period and assign this 
concentration value to each operating hour in the data collection 
period.
    6.1.3 For any operating hour in which valid data are not obtained, 
either for Hg concentration or for a parameter used in the emissions 
calculations (i.e., flow rate, diluent gas concentration, or moisture, 
as applicable), do not calculate the Hg emission rate for that hour. For 
the purposes of this appendix, part 75 substitute data values are not 
considered to be valid data.
    6.1.4 Operating hours in which valid data are not obtained for Hg 
concentration are considered to be hours of monitor downtime. The use of 
substitute data for Hg concentration is not required.
    6.2 Calculation of Hg Emission Rates. Use the applicable calculation 
methods in paragraphs 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of this section to convert Hg 
concentration values to the appropriate units of the emission standard.
    6.2.1 Heat Input-Based Hg Emission Rates. Calculate hourly heat 
input-based Hg emission rates, in units of lb/TBtu, according to 
sections 6.2.1.1 through 6.2.1.4 of this appendix.
    6.2.1.1 Select an appropriate emission rate equation from among 
Equations 19-1 through 19-9 in EPA Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 
of this chapter.
    6.2.1.2 Calculate the Hg emission rate in lb/MMBtu, using the 
equation selected from Method 19. Multiply the Hg concentration value by 
6.24 x 10<SUP>-11</SUP> to convert it from [micro]g/scm to lb/scf. In 
cases where an appropriate F-factor is not listed in Table 19-2 of 
Method 19, you may use F-factors from Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of 
appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, or F-factors derived using the 
procedures in section 3.3.6 of appendix to part 75 of this chapter. 
Also, for startup and shutdown hours, you may calculate the Hg emission 
rate using the applicable diluent cap value specified in section 3.3.4.1 
of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, provided that the diluent gas 
monitor is not out-of-control and the hourly average O<INF>2</INF> 
concentration is above 14.0% O<INF>2</INF> (19.0% for an IGCC) or the 
hourly average CO<INF>2</INF> concentration is below 5.0% CO<INF>2</INF> 
(1.0% for an IGCC), as applicable.
    6.2.1.3 Multiply the lb/MMBtu value obtained in section 6.2.1.2 of 
this appendix by 10\6\ to convert it to lb/TBtu.
    6.2.1.4 The heat input-based Hg emission rate limit in Table 2 to 
this subpart must be met on a 30 boiler operating day rolling average 
basis, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 63.10009(a)(2). Use 
Equation 19-19 in EPA Method 19 to calculate the Hg emission rate for 
each averaging period. The term E<INF>hj</INF> in Equation 19-19 must be 
in the units of the applicable emission limit. Do not include non-
operating hours with zero emissions in the average.
    6.2.2 Electrical Output-Based Hg Emission Rates. Calculate 
electrical output-based Hg emission limits in units of lb/GWh, according 
to sections 6.2.2.1 through 6.2.2.3 of this appendix.
    6.2.2.1 Calculate the Hg mass emissions for each operating hour in 
which valid data are obtained for all parameters, using Equation A-2 of 
this section (for wet-basis measurements of Hg concentration) or 
Equation A-3 of this section (for dry-basis measurements), as 
applicable:

    7.1.7.1 When a heat input-based Hg mass emissions limit must be met, 
in units of lb/TBtu, hourly measurements of CO<INF>2</INF> or 
O<INF>2</INF> concentration are required to convert Hg concentrations to 
units of the standard.
    7.1.7.2 If hourly measurements of diluent gas concentration are 
needed, use a certified CO<INF>2</INF> or O<INF>2</INF> monitor that 
meets the requirements of part 75 of this chapter to record the required 
data. You must keep hourly CO<INF>2</INF> or O<INF>2</INF> concentration 
records, as specified in Sec. 75.57(g) of this chapter.
    7.1.8 Hg Emission Rate Records. For applicable Hg emission limits in 
units of lb/TBtu or lb/GWh, record the following information for each 
affected unit or common stack:
    7.1.8.1 The date and hour;
    7.1.8.2 The hourly Hg emissions rate (lb/TBtu or lb/GWh, as 
applicable, calculated according to section 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 of this 
appendix, rounded to three significant figures), if valid values of Hg 
concentration and all other required parameters (stack gas volumetric 
flow rate, diluent gas concentration, electrical load, and moisture 
data, as applicable) are obtained for the hour;
    7.1.8.3 An identification code for the formula (either the selected 
equation from Method 19 in section 6.2.1 of this appendix or Equation A-
4 in section 6.2.2 of this appendix) used to derive the hourly Hg 
emission rate from Hg concentration, flow rate, electrical load, diluent 
gas concentration, and moisture data (as applicable); and
    7.1.8.4 A code indicating that the Hg emission rate was not 
calculated for the hour, if valid data for Hg concentration and/or any 
of the other necessary parameters are not obtained for the hour. For the 
purposes of this appendix, the substitute data values required under 
part 75 of this chapter for diluent gas concentration, stack gas flow 
rate and moisture content are not considered to be valid data.
    7.1.9 Certification and Quality Assurance Test Records. For any Hg 
CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems used to provide data under this 
subpart, record the following certification and quality-assurance 
information:
    7.1.9.1 The reference values, monitor responses, and calculated 
calibration error (CE) values, and a flag to indicate whether the test

   Sec. Appendix B to Subpart UUUUU---HCl and HF Monitoring Provisions

                            1. Applicability

    These monitoring provisions apply to the measurement of HCl and/or 
HF emissions from electric utility steam generating units, using CEMS. 
The CEMS must be capable of measuring HCl and/or HF in the appropriate 
units of the applicable emissions standard (e.g., lb/MMBtu, lb/MWh, or 
lb/GWh).

                2. Monitoring of HCl and/or HF Emissions

    2.1 Monitoring System Installation Requirements. Install HCl and/or 
HF CEMS and any additional monitoring systems needed to convert 
pollutant concentrations to units of the applicable emissions limit in 
accordance with Performance Specification 15 for extractive Fourier 
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) continuous emissions monitoring 
systems in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter and Sec. 63.10010(a).
    2.2 Primary and Backup Monitoring Systems. The provisions pertaining 
to primary and redundant backup monitoring systems in section 2.2 of 
appendix A to this subpart apply to HCl and HF CEMS and any additional 
monitoring systems needed to convert pollutant concentrations to units 
of the applicable emissions limit.
    2.3 FTIR Monitoring System Equipment, Supplies, Definitions, and 
General Operation. The provisions of Performance Specification 15 
Sections 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 10.0 apply.

                   3. Initial Certification Procedures

    The initial certification procedures for the HCl or HF CEMS used to 
provide data under this subpart are as follows:
    3.1 The HCl and/or HF CEMS must be certified according to 
Performance Specification 15 using the procedures for gas auditing and 
comparison to a reference method (RM) as specified in sections 3.1.1 and 
3.1.2 below. (Please Note: EPA plans to publish a technology neutral 
performance specification and appropriate on-going quality-assurance 
requirements for HCl CEMS in the near future along with amendments to 
this appendix to accommodate their use.)
    3.1.1 You must conduct a gas audit of the HCl and/or HF CEMS as 
described in section 9.1 of Performance Specification 15, with the 
exceptions listed in sections 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.2 below.
    3.1.1.1 The audit sample gas does not have to be obtained from the 
Administrator; however, it must be (1) from a secondary source of 
certified gases (i.e., independent of any calibration gas used for the 
daily calibration assessments) and (2) directly traceable to National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or VSL Dutch Metrology 
Institute (VSL) reference materials through an unbroken chain of 
comparisons. If audit gas traceable to NIST or VSL reference materials 
is not available, you may use a gas with a concentration certified to a 
specified uncertainty by the gas manufacturer.
    3.1.1.2 Analyze the results of the gas audit using the calculations 
in section 12.1 of Performance Specification 15. The calculated 
correction factor (CF) from Eq. 6 of Performance Specification 15 must 
be between 0.85 and 1.15. You do not have to test the bias for 
statistical significance.
    3.1.2 You must perform a relative accuracy test audit or RATA 
according to section 11.1.1.4 of Performance Specification 15 and the 
requirements below. Perform the RATA of the HCl or HF CEMS at normal 
load. Acceptable HCl/HF reference methods (RM) are Methods 26 and 26A in 
appendix A-8 to part 60 of this chapter, Method 320 in Appendix A to 
this part, or ASTM D6348-03 (Reapproved 2010) ``Standard Test Method for 
Determination of Gaseous Compounds by Extractive Direct Interface 
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy'' (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 63.14), each applied based on the criteria set 
forth in Table 5 of this subpart.
    3.1.2.1 When ASTM D6348-03 is used as the RM, the following 
conditions must be met:
    3.1.2.1.1 The test plan preparation and implementation in the 
Annexes to ASTM D6348-03, Sections A1 through A8 are mandatory;
    3.1.2.1.2 In ASTM D6348-03 Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the 
percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (see Equation 
A5.5);
    3.1.2.1.3 For the ASTM D6348-03 test data to be acceptable for a 
target analyte, %R must be 70% <ls-thn-eq>= R <= 130%; and
    3.1.2.1.4 The %R value for each compound must be reported in the

    3.1.2.2 The relative accuracy (RA) of the HCl or HF CEMS must be no 
greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the RM test data in units 
of ppm on the same moisture basis. Alternatively, if the mean RM value 
is less than 1.0 ppm, the RA results are acceptable if the absolute 
value of the difference between the mean RM and CEMS values does not 
exceed 0.20 ppm.
    3.2 Any additional stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture 
monitoring system(s) needed to express pollutant concentrations in units 
of the applicable emissions limit must be certified according to part 75 
of this chapter.

                      4. Recertification Procedures

    Whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or 
change to a certified CEMS that may significantly affect the ability of 
the system to accurately measure or record pollutant or diluent gas 
concentrations, stack gas flow rates, or stack gas moisture content, the 
owner or operator shall recertify the monitoring system. Furthermore, 
whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or 
change to the flue gas handling system or the unit operation that may 
significantly change the concentration or flow profile, the owner or 
operator shall recertify the monitoring system. The same tests performed 
for the initial certification of the monitoring system shall be repeated 
for recertification, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. 
Examples of changes that require recertification include: Replacement of 
a gas analyzer; complete monitoring system replacement, and changing the 
location or orientation of the sampling probe.

               5. On-Going Quality Assurance Requirements

    5.1 For on-going QA test requirements for HCl and HF CEMS, implement 
the quality assurance/quality control procedures of Performance 
Specification 15 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter as set forth 
in sections 5.1.1 through 5.1.3 and 5.3.2 of this appendix.
    5.1.1 On a daily basis, you must assess the calibration error of the 
HCl or HF CEMS using either a calibration transfer standard as specified 
in Performance Specification 15 Section 10.1 which references Section 
4.5 of the FTIR Protocol or a HCl and/or HF calibration gas at a 
concentration no greater than two times the level corresponding to the 
applicable emission limit. A calibration transfer standard is a 
substitute calibration compound chosen to ensure that the FTIR is 
performing well at the wavelength regions used for analysis of the 
target analytes. The measured concentration of the calibration transfer 
standard or HCl and/or HF calibration gas results must agree within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 5 percent of the reference gas value after 
correction for differences in pressure.
    5.1.2 On a quarterly basis, you must conduct a gas audit of the HCl 
and/or HF CEMS as described in section 3.1.1 of this appendix. For the 
purposes of this appendix, ``quarterly'' means once every ``QA operating 
quarter'' (as defined in section 3.1.20 of appendix A to this subpart). 
You have the option to use HCl gas in lieu of HF gas for conducting this 
audit on an HF CEMS. To the extent practicable, perform consecutive 
quarterly gas audits at least 30 days apart. The initial quarterly audit 
is due in the first QA operating quarter following the calendar quarter 
in which certification testing of the CEMS is successfully completed. Up 
to three consecutive exemptions from the quarterly audit requirement are 
allowed for ``non-QA operating quarters'' (i.e., calendar quarters in 
which there are less than 168 unit or stack operating hours). However, 
no more than four consecutive calendar quarters may elapse without 
performing a gas audit, except as otherwise provided in section 
5.3.3.2.1 of this appendix.
    5.1.3 You must perform an annual relative accuracy test audit or 
RATA of the HCl or HF CEMS as described in section 3.1.2 of this 
appendix. Perform the RATA at normal load. For the purposes of this 
appendix, ``annual'' means once every four ``QA operating quarters'' (as 
defined in section 3.1.20 of appendix A to this subpart). The first 
annual RATA is due within four QA operating quarters following the 
calendar quarter in which the initial certification testing of the HCl 
or HF CEMS is successfully completed. The provisions in section 5.1.2.4 
of appendix A to this subpart pertaining to RATA deadline extensions 
also apply.
    5.2 Stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring 
systems must meet the applicable on-going QA test requirements of part 
75 of this chapter.
    5.3 Data Validation.
    5.3.1 Out-of-Control Periods. A HCl or HF CEMS that is used to 
provide data under this appendix is considered to be out-of-control, and 
data from the CEMS may not be reported as quality-assured, when any 
acceptance criteria for a required QA test is not met. The HCl or HF 
CEMS is also considered to be out-of-control when a required QA test is 
not performed on schedule or within an allotted grace period. To end an 
out-of-control period, the QA test that was either failed or not done on 
time must be performed and passed. Out-of-control periods are counted as 
hours of monitoring system downtime.
    5.3.2 Grace Periods. For the purposes of this appendix, a ``grace 
period'' is defined as a specified number of unit or stack operating 
hours after the deadline for a required quality-assurance test of a 
continuous monitor has passed, in which the test may be performed and 
passed without loss of data.

[[Page 228]]

    5.3.2.1 For the flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring 
systems described in section 5.2 of this appendix, a 168 unit or stack 
operating hour grace period is available for quarterly linearity checks, 
and a 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available for 
RATAs, as provided, respectively, in sections 2.2.4 and 2.3.3 of 
appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.
    5.3.2.2 For the purposes of this appendix, if the deadline for a 
required gas audit or RATA of a HCl or HF CEMS cannot be met due to 
circumstances beyond the control of the owner or operator:
    5.3.2.2.1 A 168 unit or stack operating hour grace period is 
available in which to perform the gas audit; or
    5.3.2.2.2 A 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is 
available in which to perform the RATA.
    5.3.2.3 If a required QA test is performed during a grace period, 
the deadline for the next test shall be determined as follows:
    5.3.2.3.1 For a gas audit or RATA of the monitoring systems 
described in section 5.1 of this appendix, determine the deadline for 
the next gas audit or RATA (as applicable) in accordance with section 
2.2.4(b) or 2.3.3(d) of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; treat a 
gas audit in the same manner as a linearity check.
    5.3.2.3.2 For the gas audit of a HCl or HF CEMS, the grace period 
test only satisfies the audit requirement for the calendar quarter in 
which the test was originally due. If the calendar quarter in which the 
grace period audit is performed is a QA operating quarter, an additional 
gas audit is required for that quarter.
    5.3.2.3.3 For the RATA of a HCl or HF CEMS, the next RATA is due 
within three QA operating quarters after the calendar quarter in which 
the grace period test is performed.
    5.3.4 Conditional Data Validation. For recertification and 
diagnostic testing of the monitoring systems that are used to provide 
data under this appendix, and for the required QA tests when non-
redundant backup monitoring systems or temporary like-kind replacement 
analyzers are brought into service, the conditional data validation 
provisions in Sec. Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this 
chapter may be used to avoid or minimize data loss. The allotted window 
of time to complete calibration tests and RATAs shall be as specified in 
Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter; the allotted window of time to 
complete a gas audit shall be the same as for a linearity check (i.e., 
168 unit or stack operating hours).

                      6. Missing Data Requirements

    For the purposes of this appendix, the owner or operator of an 
affected unit shall not substitute for missing data from HCl or HF CEMS. 
Any process operating hour for which quality-assured HCl or HF 
concentration data are not obtained is counted as an hour of monitoring 
system downtime.

                           7. Bias Adjustment

    Bias adjustment of hourly emissions data from a HCl or HF CEMS is 
not required.

                      8. QA/QC Program Requirements

    The owner or operator shall develop and implement a quality 
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program for the HCl and/or HF CEMS 
that are used to provide data under this subpart. At a minimum, the 
program shall include a written plan that describes in detail (or that 
refers to separate documents containing) complete, step-by-step 
procedures and operations for the most important QA/QC activities. 
Electronic storage of the QA/QC plan is permissible, provided that the 
information can be made available in hard copy to auditors and 
inspectors. The QA/QC program requirements for the other monitoring 
systems described in section 5.2 of this appendix are specified in 
section 1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.
    8.1 General Requirements for HCl and HF CEMS.
    8.1.1 Preventive Maintenance. Keep a written record of procedures 
needed to maintain the HCl and/or HF CEMS in proper operating condition 
and a schedule for those procedures. This shall, at a minimum, include 
procedures specified by the manufacturers of the equipment and, if 
applicable, additional or alternate procedures developed for the 
equipment.
    8.1.2 Recordkeeping and Reporting. Keep a written record describing 
procedures that will be used to implement the recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements of this appendix.
    8.1.3 Maintenance Records. Keep a record of all testing, 
maintenance, or repair activities performed on any HCl or HF CEMS in a 
location and format suitable for inspection. A maintenance log may be 
used for this purpose. The following records should be maintained: Date, 
time, and description of any testing, adjustment, repair, replacement, 
or preventive maintenance action performed on any monitoring system and 
records of any corrective actions associated with a monitor outage 
period. Additionally, any adjustment that may significantly affect a 
system's ability to accurately measure emissions data must be recorded 
and a written explanation of the procedures used to make the 
adjustment(s) shall be kept.
    8.2 Specific Requirements for HCl and HF CEMS. The following 
requirements are specific to HCl and HF CEMS:
    8.2.1 Keep a written record of the procedures used for each type of 
QA test required for each HCl and HF CEMS. Explain how the results of 
each type of QA test are calculated and evaluated.

[[Page 229]]

    8.2.2 Explain how each component of the HCl and/or HF CEMS will be 
adjusted to provide correct responses to calibration gases after routine 
maintenance, repairs, or corrective actions.

                   9. Data Reduction and Calculations

    9.1 Design and operate the HCl and/or HF CEMS to complete a minimum 
of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for 
each successive 15-minute period.
    9.2 Reduce the HCl and/or HF concentration data to hourly averages 
in accordance with Sec. 60.13(h)(2) of this chapter.
    9.3 Convert each hourly average HCl or HF concentration to an HCl or 
HF emission rate expressed in units of the applicable emissions limit.
    9.3.1 For heat input-based emission rates, select an appropriate 
emission rate equation from among Equations 19-1 through 19-9 in EPA 
Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter, to calculate the 
HCl or HF emission rate in lb/MMBtu. Multiply the HCl concentration 
value (ppm) by 9.43 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> to convert it to lb/scf, for use 
in the applicable Method 19 equation. For HF, the conversion constant 
from ppm to lb/scf is 5.18 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>.
    9.3.2 For electrical output-based emission rates, first calculate 
the HCl or HF mass emission rate (lb/h), using an equation that has the 
general form of Equation A-2 or A-3 in appendix A to this subpart (as 
applicable), replacing the value of K with 9.43 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> lb/
scf-ppm (for HCl) or 5.18 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> (for HF) and defining 
C<INF>h</INF> as the hourly average HCl or HF concentration in ppm. 
Then, use Equation A-4 in appendix A to this subpart to calculate the 
HCl or HF emission rate in lb/GWh. If the applicable HCl or HF limit is 
expressed in lb/MWh, divide the result from Equation A-4 by 10\3\.
    9.4 Use Equation A-5 in appendix A of this subpart to calculate the 
required 30 operating day rolling average HCl or HF emission rates. 
Round off each 30 operating day average to two significant figures. The 
term E<INF>ho</INF> in Equation A-5 must be in the units of the 
applicable emissions limit.

                     10. Recordkeeping Requirements

    10.1 For each HCl or HF CEMS installed at an affected source, and 
for any other monitoring system(s) needed to convert pollutant 
concentrations to units of the applicable emissions limit, the owner or 
operator must maintain a file of all measurements, data, reports, and 
other information required by this appendix in a form suitable for 
inspection, for 5 years from the date of each record, in accordance with 
Sec. 63.10033. The file shall contain the information in paragraphs 
10.1.1 through 10.1.8 of this section.
    10.1.1 Monitoring Plan Records. For each affected unit or group of 
units monitored at a common stack, the owner or operator shall prepare 
and maintain a monitoring plan for the HCl and/or HF CEMS and any other 
monitoring system(s) (i.e, flow rate, diluent gas, or moisture systems) 
needed to convert pollutant concentrations to units of the applicable 
emission standard. The monitoring plan shall contain essential 
information on the continuous monitoring systems and shall explain how 
the data derived from these systems ensure that all HCl or HF emissions 
from the unit or stack are monitored and reported.
    10.1.1.1 Updates. Whenever the owner or operator makes a 
replacement, modification, or change in a certified continuous HCl or HF 
monitoring system that is used to provide data under this subpart 
(including a change in the automated data acquisition and handling 
system or the flue gas handling system) which affects information 
reported in the monitoring plan (e.g., a change to a serial number for a 
component of a monitoring system), the owner or operator shall update 
the monitoring plan.
    10.1.1.2 Contents of the Monitoring Plan. For HCl and/or HF CEMS, 
the monitoring plan shall contain the applicable electronic and hard 
copy information in sections 10.1.1.2.1 and 10.1.1.2.2 of this appendix. 
For stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems, 
the monitoring plan shall include the electronic and hard copy 
information required for those systems under Sec. 75.53 (g) of this 
chapter. The electronic monitoring plan shall be evaluated using the 
ECMPS Client Tool.

monitoring location(s); the HCl or HF monitoring methodology used (i.e., 
CEMS); HCl or HF monitoring system information, including, but not 
limited to: unique system and component ID numbers; the make, model, and 
serial number of the monitoring equipment; the sample acquisition 
method; formulas used to calculate emissions; monitor span and range 
information (if applicable).
    10.1.1.2.2 Hard Copy. Keep records of the following: schematics and/
or blueprints showing the location of the monitoring system(s) and test 
ports; data flow diagrams; test protocols; monitor span and range 
calculations (if applicable); miscellaneous technical justifications.
    10.1.2 Operating Parameter Records. For the purposes of this 
appendix, the owner or operator shall record the following information 
for each operating hour of each affected unit or group of units 
utilizing a common stack, to the extent that these data are needed to 
convert pollutant concentration data to the units of the emission 
standard. For non-operating hours, record only the items in paragraphs 
10.1.2.1 and 10.1.2.2 of this section. If there is heat input to the 
unit(s), but no electrical load, record only the items in

[[Page 230]]

paragraphs 10.1.2.1, 10.1.2.2, and (if applicable) 10.1.2.4 of this 
section.
    10.1.2.1 The date and hour;
    10.1.2.2 The unit or stack operating time (rounded up to the nearest 
fraction of an hour (in equal increments that can range from one 
hundredth to one quarter of an hour, at the option of the owner or 
operator);
    10.1.2.3 The hourly gross unit load (rounded to nearest MWge); and
    10.1.2.4 If applicable, the F-factor used to calculate the heat 
input-based pollutant emission rate.

provided in the electronic monitoring plan, for each hour in which the 
CEMS provides a quality-assured value of HCl or HF concentration (as 
applicable);
    10.1.3.3 The pollutant concentration, for each hour in which a 
quality-assured value is obtained. For HCl and HF, record the data in 
parts per million (ppm), rounded to three significant figures.
    10.1.3.4 A special code, indicating whether or not a quality-assured 
HCl or HF concentration value is obtained for the hour. This code may be 
entered manually when a temporary like-kind replacement HCl or HF 
analyzer is used for reporting; and
    10.1.3.5 Monitor data availability, as a percentage of unit or stack 
operating hours, calculated according to Sec. 75.32 of this chapter.
    10.1.4 Stack Gas Volumetric Flow Rate Records.
    10.1.4.1 Hourly measurements of stack gas volumetric flow rate 
during unit operation are required to demonstrate compliance with 
electrical output-based HCl or HF emissions limits (i.e., lb/MWh or lb/
GWh).
    10.1.4.2 Use a flow rate monitor that meets the requirements of part 
75 of this chapter to record the required data. You must keep hourly 
flow rate records, as specified in Sec. 75.57(c)(2) of this chapter.
    10.1.5 Records of Stack Gas Moisture Content.
    10.1.5.1 Correction of hourly pollutant concentration data for 
moisture is sometimes required when converting concentrations to the 
units of the applicable Hg emissions limit. In particular, these 
corrections are required:
    10.1.5.1.1 To calculate electrical output-based pollutant emission 
rates, when using a CEMS that measures pollutant concentrations on a dry 
basis; and
    10.1.5.1.2 To calculate heat input-based pollutant emission rates, 
when using certain equations from EPA Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 
60 of this chapter.
    10.1.5.2 If hourly moisture corrections are required, either use a 
fuel-specific default moisture percentage for coal-fired units from 
Sec. 75.11(b)(1) of this chapter, an Administrator approved default 
moisture value for non-coal-fired units (as per paragraph 63.10010(d) of 
this subpart), or a certified moisture monitoring system that meets the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, to record the required data. If 
you elect to use a moisture monitoring system, you must keep hourly 
records of the stack gas moisture content, as specified in Sec. 
75.57(c)(3) of this chapter.
    10.1.6 Records of Diluent Gas (CO2 or O<INF>2</INF>) Concentration.
    10.1.6.1 To assess compliance with a heat input-based HCl or HF 
emission rate limit in units of lb/MMBtu, hourly measurements of 
CO<INF>2</INF> or O<INF>2</INF> concentration are required to convert 
pollutant concentrations to units of the standard.
    10.1.6.2 If hourly measurements of diluent gas concentration are 
needed, you must use a certified CO<INF>2</INF> or O<INF>2</INF> monitor 
that meets the requirements of part 75 of this chapter to record the 
required data. For all diluent gas monitors, you must keep hourly 
CO<INF>2</INF> or O<INF>2</INF> concentration records, as specified in 
Sec. 75.57(g) of this chapter.
    10.1.7 HCl and HF Emission Rate Records. For applicable HCl and HF 
emission limits in units of lb/MMBtu, lb/MWh, or lb/GWh, record the 
following information for each affected unit or common stack:
    10.1.7.1 The date and hour;
    10.1.7.2 The hourly HCl and/or HF emissions rate (lb/MMBtu, lb/MWh, 
or lb/GWh, as applicable, rounded to three significant figures), for 
each hour in which valid values of HCl or HF concentration and all other 
required parameters (stack gas volumetric flow rate, diluent gas 
concentration, electrical load, and moisture data, as applicable) are 
obtained for the hour;
    10.1.7.3 An identification code for the formula used to derive the 
hourly HCl or HF emission rate from HCl or HF concentration, flow rate, 
electrical load, diluent gas concentration, and moisture data (as 
applicable); and
    10.1.7.4 A code indicating that the HCl or HF emission rate was not 
calculated for the hour, if valid data for HCl or HF concentration and/
or any of the other necessary parameters are not obtained for the hour. 
For the purposes of this appendix, the substitute data values required 
under part 75 of this chapter for diluent gas concentration, stack gas 
flow rate and moisture content are not considered to be valid data.
    10.1.8 Certification and Quality Assurance Test Records. For the HCl 
and/or HF CEMS used to provide data under this subpart at

[[Page 231]]

each affected unit (or group of units monitored at a common stack), 
record the following information for all required certification, 
recertification, diagnostic, and quality-assurance tests:
    10.1.8.1 HCl and HF CEMS.
    10.1.8.1.1 For all required daily calibrations (including 
calibration transfer standard tests) of the HCl or HF CEMS, record the 
test dates and times, reference values, monitor responses, and 
calculated calibration error values;
    10.1.8.1.2 For gas audits of HCl or HF CEMS, record the date and 
time of each spiked and unspiked sample, the audit gas reference values 
and uncertainties. Keep records of all calculations and data analyses 
required under sections 9.1 and 12.1 of Performance Specification 15, 
and the results of those calculations and analyses.
    10.1.8.1.3 For each RATA of a HCl or HF CEMS, record the date and 
time of each test run, the reference method(s) used, and the reference 
method and HCl or HF CEMS values. Keep records of the data analyses and 
calculations used to determine the relative accuracy.
    10.1.8.2 Additional Monitoring Systems. For the stack gas flow rate, 
diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems described in section 3.2 of 
this appendix, you must keep records of all certification, 
recertification, diagnostic, and on-going quality-assurance tests of 
these systems, as specified in Sec. 75.59(a) of this chapter.

                       11. Reporting Requirements

    11.1 General Reporting Provisions. The owner or operator shall

scrubber, or any other air pollution control equipment that reduces the 
quantity of ethylene oxide in the effluent gas stream from sterilization 
and aeration processes.
    Combination sterilization unit means any enclosed vessel in which 
both the sterilization process and the aeration process occur within the 
same vessel, i.e., the vessel is filled with ethylene oxide gas or an 
ethylene oxide/inert gas mixture for the purpose of sterilizing and is 
followed by off-gassing of ethylene oxide.
    Common aeration time means that items require the same length of 
time to off-gas ethylene oxide.
    Full load means the maximum number of items that does not impede 
proper air removal, humidification of the load, or sterilant penetration 
and evacuation in the sterilization unit.
    Hospital means a facility that provides medical care and treatment 
for patients who are acutely ill or chronically ill on an inpatient 
basis under supervision of licensed physicians and under nursing care 
offered 24 hours per day. Hospitals include diagnostic and major surgery

responsible for sterile processing at a hospital.
    Medically necessary means circumstances that a hospital central 
services staff, a hospital administrator, or a physician concludes, 
based on generally accepted medical practices, necessitate sterilizing 
without a full load in order to protect human health.
    State or local regulation means a regulation at the State or local 
level that requires a hospital to reduce the quantity of ethylene oxide 
emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization units.
    Sterilization facility means the group of ethylene oxide 
sterilization units at a hospital using ethylene oxide gas or an 
ethylene oxide/inert gas mixture for the purpose of sterilizing.
    Sterilization process means any time when ethylene oxide is removed 
from the sterilization unit or combination sterilization unit through

                  Standards and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.10685  What are the requirements for the control of contaminants from 

scrap?

    (a) Chlorinated plastics, lead, and free organic liquids. For 
metallic scrap utilized in the EAF at your facility, you must comply 
with the requirements in either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. 
You may have certain scrap at your facility subject to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section and other scrap subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section provided the scrap remains segregated until charge make-up.
    (1) Pollution prevention plan. For the production of steel other 
than leaded steel, you must prepare and implement a pollution prevention 
plan for metallic scrap selection and inspection to minimize the amount 
of chlorinated plastics, lead, and free organic liquids that is charged 
to the furnace. For the production of leaded steel, you must prepare and 
implement a pollution prevention plan for scrap selection and inspection 
to minimize the amount of chlorinated plastics and free organic liquids 
in the scrap that is charged to the furnace. You must submit the scrap 
pollution prevention plan to the permitting authority for approval. You 
must operate according to the plan as submitted during the review and 
approval process, operate according to the approved plan at all times 
after approval, and address any deficiency identified by the permitting 
authority within 60 days following disapproval of a plan. You may 
request approval to revise the plan and may operate according to the 
revised plan unless and until the revision is disapproved by the 
permitting authority. You must keep a copy of the plan onsite, and you 
must provide training on the plan's requirements to all plant personnel 
with materials acquisition or inspection duties. Each plan must include 
the information in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
    (i) Specifications that scrap materials must be depleted (to the 
extent practicable) of undrained used oil filters, chlorinated plastics, 
and free organic liquids at the time of charging to the furnace.
    (ii) A requirement in your scrap specifications for removal (to the 
extent practicable) of lead-containing components (such as batteries, 
battery cables, and wheel weights) from the scrap, except for scrap used 
to produce leaded steel.
    (iii) Procedures for determining if the requirements and 
specifications in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are met (such as 
visual inspection or periodic audits of scrap providers) and procedures 
for taking corrective actions with vendors whose shipments are not 
within specifications.
    (iv) The requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not 
apply to the routine recycling of baghouse bags or other internal 
process or maintenance materials in the furnace. These exempted 
materials must be identified in the pollution prevention plan.
    (2) Restricted metallic scrap. For the production of steel other 
than leaded steel, you must not charge to a furnace metallic scrap that 
contains scrap from motor vehicle bodies, engine blocks, oil filters, 
oily turnings, machine shop borings, transformers or capacitors 
containing polychlorinated biphenyls, lead-containing components, 
chlorinated plastics, or free organic liquids. For the production of 
leaded steel, you must not charge to the furnace metallic scrap that 
contains scrap from motor vehicle bodies, engine

[[Page 238]]

blocks, oil filters, oily turnings, machine shop borings, transformers 
or capacitors containing polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated 
plastics, or free organic liquids. This restriction does not apply to 
any post-consumer engine blocks, post-consumer oil filters, or oily 
turnings that are processed or cleaned to the extent practicable such 
that the materials do not include lead components, chlorinated plastics, 
or free organic liquids. This restriction does not apply to motor 
vehicle scrap that is charged to recover the chromium or nickel content 
if you meet the requirements in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (b) Mercury requirements. For scrap containing motor vehicle scrap, 
you must procure the scrap pursuant to one of the compliance options in 
paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section for each scrap provider, 
contract, or shipment. For scrap that does not contain motor vehicle 
scrap, you must procure the scrap pursuant to the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each scrap provider, contract, or 
shipment. You may have one scrap provider, contract, or shipment subject 
to one compliance provision and others subject to another compliance 
provision.
    (1) Site-specific plan for mercury switches. You must comply with 
the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) You must include a requirement in your scrap specifications for 
removal of mercury switches from vehicle bodies used to make the scrap.
    (ii) You must prepare and operate according to a plan demonstrating 
how your facility will implement the scrap specification in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section for removal of mercury switches. You must 
submit the plan to the permitting authority for approval. You must 
operate according to this plan as submitted during the review and 
approval process, operate according to the approved plan at all times 
after approval, and address any deficiency identified by the permitting 
authority within 60 days following disapproval of a plan. You may 
request approval to revise the plan and may operate according to the 
revised plan unless and until the revision is disapproved by the 
permitting authority. The permitting authority may change the approval 
status of the plan upon 90-days written notice based upon the semiannual 
compliance report or other information. The plan must include:
    (A) A means of communicating to scrap purchasers and scrap providers 
the need to obtain or provide motor vehicle scrap from which mercury 
switches have been removed and the need to ensure the proper management 
of the mercury switches removed from that scrap as required under the 
rules implementing subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA) (40 CFR parts 261 through 265 and 268). The plan must include 
documentation of direction to appropriate staff to communicate to 
suppliers throughout the scrap supply chain the need to promote the 
removal of mercury switches from end-of-life vehicles. Upon the request 
of the permitting authority, you must provide examples of materials that 
are used for outreach to suppliers, such as letters, contract language, 
policies for purchasing agents, and scrap inspection protocols;
    (B) Provisions for obtaining assurance from scrap providers that 
motor vehicle scrap provided to the facility meet the scrap 
specification;
    (C) Provisions for periodic inspections or other means of 
corroboration to ensure that scrap providers and dismantlers are 
implementing appropriate steps to minimize the presence of mercury 
switches in motor vehicle scrap and that the mercury switches removed 
are being properly managed, including the minimum frequency such means 
of corroboration will be implemented; and
    (D) Provisions for taking corrective actions (i.e., actions 
resulting in scrap providers removing a higher percentage of mercury 
switches or other mercury-containing components) if needed, based on the 
results of procedures implemented in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this 
section).
    (iii) You must require each motor vehicle scrap provider to provide 
an estimate of the number of mercury switches removed from motor vehicle 
scrap sent to your facility during the previous year and the basis for 
the estimate. The permitting authority may

[[Page 239]]

request documentation or additional information at any time.
    (iv) You must establish a goal for each scrap provider to remove at 
least 80 percent of the mercury switches. Although a site-specific plan 
approved under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may require only the 
removal of convenience light switch mechanisms, the permitting authority 
will credit all documented and verifiable mercury-containing components 
removed from motor vehicle scrap (such as sensors in anti-locking brake 
systems, security systems, active ride control, and other applications) 
when evaluating progress towards the 80 percent goal.
    (v) For each scrap provider, you must submit semiannual progress 
reports to the permitting authority that provide the number of mercury 
switches removed or the weight of mercury recovered from the switches, 
the estimated number of vehicles processed, an estimate of the percent 
of mercury switches removed, and certification that the removed mercury 
switches were recycled at RCRA-permitted facilities or otherwise 
properly managed pursuant to RCRA subtitle C regulations referenced in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. This information can be 
submitted in aggregated form and does not have to be submitted for each 
scrap provider, contract, or shipment. The permitting authority may 
change the approval status of a site-specific plan following 90-days 
notice based on the progress reports or other information.
    (2) Option for approved mercury programs. You must certify in your 
notification of compliance status that you participate in and purchase 
motor vehicle scrap only from scrap providers who participate in a 
program for removal of mercury switches that has been approved by the 
Administrator based on the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section. If you purchase motor vehicle scrap from a 
broker, you must certify that all scrap received from that broker was 
obtained from other scrap providers who participate in a program for the 
removal of mercury switches that has been approved by the Administrator 
based on the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section. The National Vehicle Mercury Switch Recovery Program and the 
Vehicle Switch Recovery Program mandated by Maine State law are EPA-
approved programs under paragraph (b)(2) of this section unless and 
until the Administrator disapproves the program (in part or in whole) 
under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (i) The program includes outreach that informs the dismantlers of 
the need for removal of mercury switches and provides training and 
guidance for removing mercury switches;
    (ii) The program has a goal to remove at least 80 percent of mercury 
switches from the motor vehicle scrap the scrap provider processes. 
Although a program approved under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may 
require only the removal of convenience light switch mechanisms, the 
Administrator will credit all documented and verifiable mercury-
containing components removed from motor vehicle scrap (such as sensors 
in anti-locking brake systems, security systems, active ride control, 
and other applications) when evaluating progress towards the 80 percent 
goal; and
    (iii) The program sponsor agrees to submit progress reports to the 
Administrator no less frequently than once every year that provide the 
number of mercury switches removed or the weight of mercury recovered 
from the switches, the estimated number of vehicles processed, an 
estimate of the percent of mercury switches recovered, and certification 
that the recovered mercury switches were recycled at facilities with 
permits as required under the rules implementing subtitle C of RCRA (40 
CFR parts 261 through 265 and 268). The progress reports must be based 
on a database that includes data for each program participant; however, 
data may be aggregated at the State level for progress reports that will 
be publicly available. The Administrator may change the approval status 
of a program or portion of a program (e.g., at the State level) 
following 90-days notice based on the progress reports or on other 
information.
    (iv) You must develop and maintain onsite a plan demonstrating the 
manner through which your facility is participating in the EPA-approved 
program.

[[Page 240]]

    (A) The plan must include facility-specific implementation elements, 
corporate-wide policies, and/or efforts coordinated by a trade 
association as appropriate for each facility.
    (B) You must provide in the plan documentation of direction to 
appropriate staff to communicate to suppliers throughout the scrap 
supply chain the need to promote the removal of mercury switches from 
end-of-life vehicles. Upon the request of the permitting authority, you 
must provide examples of materials that are used for outreach to 
suppliers, such as letters, contract language, policies for purchasing 
agents, and scrap inspection protocols.
    (C) You must conduct periodic inspections or provide other means of 
corroboration to ensure that scrap providers are aware of the need for 
and are implementing appropriate steps to minimize the presence of 
mercury in scrap from end-of-life vehicles.
    (3) Option for specialty metal scrap. You must certify in your 
notification of compliance status that the only materials from motor 
vehicles in the scrap are materials recovered for their specialty alloy 
(including, but not limited to, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, or other 
alloys) content (such as certain exhaust systems) and, based on the 
nature of the scrap and purchase specifications, that the type of scrap 
is not reasonably expected to contain mercury switches.
    (4) Scrap that does not contain motor vehicle scrap. For scrap not 
subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this 
section, you must certify in your notification of compliance status and 
maintain records of documentation that this scrap does not contain motor 
vehicle scrap.
    (c) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. In addition to the 
records required by Sec. 63.10, you must keep records to demonstrate 
compliance with the requirements for your pollution prevention plan in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and/or for the use of only restricted 
scrap in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and for mercury in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (3) of this section as applicable. You must keep records 
documenting compliance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section for scrap 
that does not contain motor vehicle scrap.
    (1) If you are subject to the requirements for a site-specific plan 
for mercury under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must:
    (i) Maintain records of the number of mercury switches removed or 
the weight of mercury recovered from the switches and properly managed, 
the estimated number of vehicles processed, and an estimate of the 
percent of mercury switches recovered; and
    (ii) Submit semiannual reports of the number of mercury switches 
removed or the weight of mercury recovered from the switches and 
properly managed, the estimated number of vehicles processed, an 
estimate of the percent of mercury switches recovered, and a 
certification that the recovered mercury switches were recycled at RCRA-
permitted facilities. The semiannual reports must include a 
certification that you have conducted inspections or taken other means 
of corroboration as required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this 
section. You may include this information in the semiannual compliance 
reports required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) If you are subject to the option for approved mercury programs 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you must maintain records 
identifying each scrap provider and documenting the scrap provider's 
participation in an approved mercury switch removal program. If you 
purchase motor vehicle scrap from a broker, you must maintain records 
identifying each broker and documentation that all scrap provided by the 
broker was obtained from other scrap providers who participate in an 
approved mercury switch removal program.
    (3) You must submit semiannual compliance reports to the 
Administrator for the control of contaminants from scrap according to 
the requirements in Sec. 63.10(e). The report must clearly identify any 
deviation from the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section and the corrective action taken. You must identify which 
compliance option in paragraph (b) of this section applies to each scrap 
provider, contract, or shipment.

<R05>
Sec. 63.10686  What are the requirements for electric arc furnaces and argon-

oxygen decarburization vessels?

    (a) You must install, operate, and maintain a capture system that 
collects the emissions from each EAF (including charging, melting, and 
tapping operations) and argon-oxygen decarburization (AOD) vessel and 
conveys the collected emissions to a control device for the removal of 
particulate matter (PM).
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, you must 
not discharge or cause the discharge into the atmosphere from an EAF or 
AOD vessel any gases which:
    (1) Exit from a control device and contain in excess of 0.0052 
grains of PM per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf); and
    (2) Exit from a melt shop and, due solely to the operations of any 
affected EAF(s) or AOD vessel(s), exhibit 6 percent opacity or greater.
    (c) If you own or operate a new or existing affected source that has 
a production capacity of less than 150,000 tons per year (tpy) of 
stainless or specialty steel (as determined by the maximum production if 
specified in the source's operating permit or EAF capacity and maximum 
number of operating hours per year), you must not discharge or cause the 
discharge into the atmosphere from an EAF or AOD vessel any gases which:
    (1) Exit from a control device and contain particulate matter (PM) 
in excess of 0.8 pounds per ton (lb/ton) of steel. Alternatively, the 
owner or operator may elect to comply with a PM limit of 0.0052 grains 
per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf); and
    (2) Exit from a melt shop and, due solely to the operations of any 
affected EAF(s) or AOD vessel(s), exhibit 6 percent opacity or greater.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, you must 
conduct performance tests to demonstrate initial compliance with the 
applicable emissions limit for each emissions source subject to an 
emissions limit in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (1) You must conduct each PM performance test for an EAF or AOD 
vessel according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7 and 40 CFR 60.275a 
using the following test methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendices A-1, A-2, 
A-3, and A-4:
    (i) Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60 to select 
sampling port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack 
or duct. Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control 
device (or at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is 
present) prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
    (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 
60 to determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.
    (iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-3 of 40 CFR part 60 to 
determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/
ASME PTC 19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses'' (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.
    (iv) Method 4 of appendix A-3 of 40 CFR part 60 to determine the 
moisture content of the stack gas.
    (v) Method 5 or 5D of appendix A-3 of 40 CFR part 60 to determine 
the PM concentration. Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a PM 
performance test. For EAF, sample only when metal is being melted and 
refined. For AOD vessels, sample only when the operation(s) are being 
conducted.
    (2) You must conduct each opacity test for a melt shop according to 
the procedures in Sec. 63.6(h) and Method 9 of appendix A-4 of 40 CFR 
part 60. When emissions from any EAF or AOD vessel are combined with 
emissions from emission sources not subject to this subpart, you must 
demonstrate compliance with the melt shop opacity limit based on 
emissions from only the emission sources subject to this subpart.
    (3) During any performance test, you must monitor and record the 
information specified in 40 CFR 60.274a(h) for all heats covered by the 
test.
    (4) You must notify and receive approval from the Administrator for 
procedures that will be used to determine compliance for an EAF or AOD 
vessel when emissions are combined with those from facilities not 
subject to this subpart.
    (5) To determine compliance with the PM emissions limit in paragraph 
(c) of this section for an EAF or AOD vessel in a lb/ton of steel 
format, compute the

[[Page 242]]

process-weighted mass emissions (E<INF>p</INF>) for each test run using 
Equation 1 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28DE07.004

Where:

E<INF>p</INF> = Process-weighted mass emissions of PM, lb/ton;
C = Concentration of PM or total metal HAP, gr/dscf;
Q = Volumetric flow rate of stack gas, dscf/hr;
T = Total time during a test run that a sample is withdrawn from the 
stack during steel production cycle, hr;
P = Total amount of metal produced during the test run, tons; and
K = Conversion factor, 7,000 grains per pound.

    (6) If you own or operate an existing affected source that is 
subject to the emissions limits in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, 
you may certify initial compliance with the applicable emission limit 
for one or more emissions sources based on the results of a previous 
performance test for that emissions source in lieu of the requirement 
for an initial performance test provided that the test(s) were conducted 
within 5 years of the compliance date using the methods and procedures 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section; the test(s) were 
for the affected facility; and the test(s) were representative of 
current or anticipated operating processes and conditions. Should the 
permitting authority deem the prior test data unacceptable to 
demonstrate compliance with an applicable emissions limit, the owner or 
operator must conduct an initial performance test within 180 days of the 
compliance date or within 90 days of receipt of the notification of 
disapproval of the prior test, whichever is later.

by EPA Method 9095B, (revision 2, dated November 1994) (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 63.14) after accounting for water using a moisture 
determination test by ASTM Method D2216-05 (incorporated by reference--
see Sec. 63.14). If, after conducting a moisture determination test, if 
any portion of the material passes through and drops from the filter 
within the 5-minute test period, the material contains free organic 
liquids.
    Leaded steel means steel that must meet a minimum specification for 
lead content (typically 0.25 percent or more) and for which lead is a 
necessary alloy for that grade of steel.
    Mercury switch means each mercury-containing capsule or switch 
assembly that is part of a convenience light switch mechanism installed 
in a vehicle.
    Motor vehicle means an automotive vehicle not operated on rails and 
usually operated with rubber tires for use on highways.
    Motor vehicle scrap means vehicle or automobile bodies, including 
automobile body hulks, that have been processed through a shredder. 
Motor vehicle scrap does not include automobile manufacturing bundles, 
or miscellaneous vehicle parts, such as wheels, bumpers or other 
components that do not contain mercury switches.
    Nonferrous metals means any pure metal other than iron or any metal 
alloy for which an element other than iron is its major constituent by 
percent in weight.
    Scrap provider means the person (including a broker) who contracts 
directly with a steel mill to provide scrap that contains motor vehicle 
scrap. Scrap processors such as shredder operators or vehicle 
dismantlers that do not sell scrap directly to a steel mill are not 
scrap providers.
    Specialty steel means low carbon and high alloy steel other than 
stainless steel that is processed in an argon-oxygen decarburization 
vessel.
    Stainless steel means low carbon steel that contains at least 10.5 
percent chromium.

 Subpart ZZZZZ_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 

                for Iron and Steel Foundries Area Sources

    Source: 73 FR 252, Jan. 2, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

                   Applicability and Compliance Dates


<R05>
Sec. 63.10880  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an iron 
and steel foundry that is an area source of hazardous air pollutant 
(HAP) emissions.
    (b) This subpart applies to each new or existing affected source. 
The affected source is each iron and steel foundry.
    (1) An affected source is existing if you commenced construction or 
reconstruction of the affected source before September 17, 2007.
    (2) An affected source is new if you commenced construction or 
reconstruction of the affected source on or after September 17, 2007. If 
an affected source is not new pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is 
not new as a result of a change in its compliance obligations pursuant 
to Sec. 63.10881(d).
    (c) On and after January 2, 2008, if your iron and steel foundry 
becomes a major source as defined in Sec. 63.2, you must meet the 
requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart EEEEE.
    (d) This subpart does not apply to research and development 
facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the Clean Air Act.
    (e) You are exempt from the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 
CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, provided you are not otherwise required 
by law to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a). 
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with 
the provisions of this subpart.
    (f) If you own or operate an existing affected source, you must 
determine the initial applicability of the requirements of this subpart 
to a small foundry or a large foundry based on your facility's metal 
melt production for calendar year 2008. If the metal melt production for 
calendar year 2008 is 20,000 tons or less, your area source is a small 
foundry. If your metal melt production for calendar year 2008 is greater 
than 20,000 tons, your area source is a large foundry. You must submit a 
written notification to the Administrator that identifies your area 
source as a small foundry or a large foundry no later than January 2, 
2009.
    (g) If you own or operate a new affected source, you must determine 
the

[[Page 246]]

initial applicability of the requirements of this subpart to a small 
foundry or a large foundry based on your facility's annual metal melting 
capacity at startup. If the annual metal melting capacity is 10,000 tons 
or less, your area source is a small foundry. If the annual metal 
melting capacity is greater than 10,000 tons, your area source is a 
large foundry. You must submit a written notification to the 
Administrator that identifies your area source as a small foundry or a 
large foundry no later than 120 days after startup.


<R05>
Sec. 63.10881  What are my compliance dates?

    (a) If you own or operate an existing affected source, you must 
achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart by the 
dates in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Not later than January 2, 2009 for the pollution prevention 
management practices for metallic scrap in Sec. 63.10885(a) and binder 
formulations in Sec. 63.10886.
    (2) Not later than January 4, 2010 for the pollution prevention 
management practices for mercury in Sec. 63.10885(b).
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, not later 
than 2 years after the date of your large foundry's notification of the 
initial determination required in Sec. 63.10880(f) for the standards 
and management practices in Sec. 63.10895.
    (b) If you have a new affected source for which the initial startup 
date is on or before January 2, 2008, you must achieve compliance with 
the provisions of this subpart not later than January 2, 2008.
    (c) If you own or operate a new affected source for which the 
initial startup date is after January 2, 2008, you must achieve 
compliance with the provisions of this subpart upon startup of your 
affected source.
    (d) Following the initial determination for an existing affected 
source required in Sec. 63.10880(f),
    (1) Beginning January 1, 2010, if the annual metal melt production 
of your small foundry exceeds 20,000 tons during the preceding calendar 
year, you must submit a notification of foundry reclassification to the 
Administrator within 30 days and comply with the requirements in 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
    (i) If your small foundry has never been classified as a large 
foundry, you must comply with the requirements for a large foundry no 
later than 2 years after the date of your foundry's notification that 
the annual metal melt production exceeded 20,000 tons.
    (ii) If your small foundry had previously been classified as a large 
foundry, you must comply with the requirements for a large foundry no 
later than the date of your foundry's most recent notification that the 
annual metal melt production exceeded 20,000 tons.
    (2) If your facility is initially classified as a large foundry (or 
your small foundry subsequently becomes a large foundry), you must 
comply with the requirements for a large foundry for at least 3 years 
before reclassifying your facility as a small foundry, even if your 
annual metal melt production falls below 20,000 tons. After 3 years, you 
may reclassify your facility as a small foundry provided your annual 
metal melt production for the preceding calendar year was 20,000 tons or 
less. If you reclassify your large foundry as a small foundry, you must 
submit a notification of reclassification to the Administrator within 30 
days and comply with the requirements for a small foundry no later than 
the date you notify the Administrator of the reclassification. If the 
annual metal melt production exceeds 20,000 tons during a subsequent 
year, you must submit a notification of reclassification to the 
Administrator within 30 days and comply with the requirements for a 
large foundry no later than the date you notify the Administrator of the 
reclassification.
    (e) Following the initial determination for a new affected source 
required in Sec. 63.10880(g),
    (1) If you increase the annual metal melt capacity of your small 
foundry to exceed 10,000 tons, you must submit a notification of 
reclassification to the Administrator within 30 days and comply with the 
requirements for a large foundry no later than the startup date for the 
new equipment, if applicable, or the date of issuance for your revised 
State or Federal operating permit.

[[Page 247]]

    (2) If your facility is initially classified as a large foundry (or 
your small foundry subsequently becomes a large foundry), you must 
comply with the requirements for a large foundry for at least 3 years 
before reclassifying your facility as a small foundry. After 3 years, 
you may reclassify your facility as a small foundry provided your most 
recent annual metal melt capacity is 10,000 tons or less. If you 
reclassify your large foundry as a small foundry, you must notify the 
Administrator within 30 days and comply with the requirements for a 
small foundry no later than the date your melting equipment was removed 
or taken out of service, if applicable, or the date of issuance for your 
revised State or Federal operating permit.

Pollution Prevention Management Practices for New and Existing Affected 
                                 Sources


<R05>
Sec. 63.10885  What are my management practices for metallic scrap and mercury 

switches?

    (a) Metallic scrap management program. For each segregated metallic 
scrap storage area, bin or pile, you must comply with the materials 
acquisition requirements in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. You 
must keep a copy of the material specifications onsite and readily 
available to all personnel with material acquisition duties, and provide 
a copy to each of your scrap providers. You may have certain scrap 
subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and other scrap subject to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section at your facility provided the metallic 
scrap remains segregated until charge make-up.
    (1) Restricted metallic scrap. You must prepare and operate at all 
times according to written material specifications for the purchase and 
use of only metal ingots, pig iron, slitter, or other materials that do 
not include post-consumer automotive body scrap, post-consumer engine 
blocks, post-consumer oil filters, oily turnings, lead components, 
chlorinated plastics, or free liquids. For the purpose of this subpart, 
``free liquids'' is defined as material that fails the paint filter test 
by EPA Method 9095B, ``Paint Filter Liquids Test'' (revision 2), 
November 2004 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14). The 
requirements for no free liquids do not apply if the owner or operator 
can demonstrate that the free liquid is water that resulted from scrap 
exposure to rain.
    (2) General iron and steel scrap. You must prepare and operate at 
all times according to written material specifications for the purchase 
and use of only iron and steel scrap that has been depleted (to the 
extent practicable) of organics and HAP metals in the charge materials 
used by the iron and steel foundry. The materials specifications must 
include at minimum the information specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, 
specifications for metallic scrap materials charged to a scrap preheater 
or metal melting furnace to be depleted (to the extent practicable) of 
the presence of used oil filters, chlorinated plastic parts, accessible 
lead-containing components (such as batteries and wheel weights), and a 
program to ensure the scrap materials are drained of free liquids.
    (ii) For scrap charged to a cupola metal melting furnace that is 
equipped with an afterburner, specifications for metallic scrap 
materials to be depleted (to the extent practicable) of the presence of 
chlorinated plastics, accessible lead-containing components (such as 
batteries and wheel weights), and a program to ensure the scrap 
materials are drained of free liquids.
    (b) Mercury requirements. For scrap containing motor vehicle scrap, 
you must procure the scrap pursuant to one of the compliance options in 
paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section for each scrap provider, 
contract, or shipment. For scrap that does not contain motor vehicle 
scrap, you must procure the scrap pursuant to the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each scrap provider, contract, or 
shipment. You may have one scrap provider, contract, or shipment subject 
to one compliance provision and others subject to another compliance 
provision.
    (1) Site-specific plan for mercury switches. You must comply with 
the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.

[[Page 248]]

    (i) You must include a requirement in your scrap specifications for 
removal of mercury switches from vehicle bodies used to make the scrap.
    (ii) You must prepare and operate according to a plan demonstrating 
how your facility will implement the scrap specification in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section for removal of mercury switches. You must 
submit the plan to the Administrator for approval. You must operate 
according to the plan as submitted during the review and approval 
process, operate according to the approved plan at all times after 
approval, and address any deficiency identified by the Administrator or 
delegated authority within 60 days following disapproval of a plan. You 
may request approval to revise the plan and may operate according to the 
revised plan unless and until the revision is disapproved by the 
Administrator or delegated authority. The Administrator or delegated 
authority may change the approval status of the plan upon 90-days 
written notice based upon the semiannual report or other information. 
The plan must include:
    (A) A means of communicating to scrap purchasers and scrap providers 
the need to obtain or provide motor vehicle scrap from which mercury 
switches have been removed and the need to ensure the proper management 
of the mercury switches removed from the scrap as required under the 
rules implementing subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA) (40 CFR parts 261 through 265 and 268). The plan must include 
documentation of direction to appropriate staff to communicate to 
suppliers throughout the scrap supply chain the need to promote the 
removal of mercury switches from end-of-life vehicles. Upon the request 
of the Administrator or delegated authority, you must provide examples 
of materials that are used for outreach to suppliers, such as letters, 
contract language, policies for purchasing agents, and scrap inspection 
protocols;
    (B) Provisions for obtaining assurance from scrap providers motor 
vehicle scrap provided to the facility meet the scrap specification;
    (C) Provisions for periodic inspections or other means of 
corroboration to ensure that scrap providers and dismantlers are 
implementing appropriate steps to minimize the presence of mercury 
switches in motor vehicle scrap and that the mercury switches removed 
are being properly managed, including the minimum frequency such means 
of corroboration will be implemented; and
    (D) Provisions for taking corrective actions (i.e., actions 
resulting in scrap providers removing a higher percentage of mercury 
switches or other mercury-containing components) if needed, based on the 
results of procedures implemented in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this 
section).
    (iii) You must require each motor vehicle scrap provider to provide 
an estimate of the number of mercury switches removed from motor vehicle 
scrap sent to the facility during the previous year and the basis for 
the estimate. The Administrator may request documentation or additional 
information at any time.
    (iv) You must establish a goal for each scrap supplier to remove at 
least 80 percent of the mercury switches. Although a site-specific plan 
approved under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may require only the 
removal of convenience light switch mechanisms, the Administrator will 
credit all documented and verifiable mercury-containing components 
removed from motor vehicle scrap (such as sensors in anti-locking brake 
systems, security systems, active ride control, and other applications) 
when evaluating progress towards the 80 percent goal.
    (v) For each scrap provider, you must submit semiannual progress 
reports to the Administrator that provide the number of mercury switches 
removed or the weight of mercury recovered from the switches, the 
estimated number of vehicles processed, an estimate of the percent of 
mercury switches removed, and certification that the removed mercury 
switches were recycled at RCRA-permitted facilities or otherwise 
properly managed pursuant to RCRA subtitle C regulations referenced in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. This information can be 
submitted in aggregate form and does not have to be submitted for each 
shipment. The Administrator may change

[[Page 249]]

the approval status of a site-specific plan following 90-days notice 
based on the progress reports or other information.
    (2) Option for approved mercury programs. You must certify in your 
notification of compliance status that you participate in and purchase 
motor vehicle scrap only from scrap providers who participate in a 
program for removal of mercury switches that has been approved by the 
Administrator based on the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section. If you purchase motor vehicle scrap from a 
broker, you must certify that all scrap received from that broker was 
obtained from other scrap providers who participate in a program for the 
removal of mercury switches that has been approved by the Administrator 
based on the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section. The National Mercury Switch Recovery Program and the State of 
Maine Mercury Switch Removal Program are EPA-approved programs under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section unless and until the Administrator 
disapproves the program (in part or in whole) under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (i) The program includes outreach that informs the dismantlers of 
the need for removal of mercury switches and provides training and 
guidance for removing mercury switches;
    (ii) The program has a goal to remove at least 80 percent of mercury 
switches from motor vehicle scrap the scrap provider processes. Although 
a program approved under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may require 
only the removal of convenience light switch mechanisms, the 
Administrator will credit all documented and verifiable mercury-
containing components removed from motor vehicle scrap (such as sensors 
in anti-locking brake systems, security systems, active ride control, 
and other applications) when evaluating progress towards the 80 percent 
goal; and
    (iii) The program sponsor agrees to submit progress reports to the 
Administrator no less frequently than once every year that provide the 
number of mercury switches removed or the weight of mercury recovered 
from the switches, the estimated number of vehicles processed, an 
estimate of the percent of mercury switches recovered, and certification 
that the recovered mercury switches were recycled at facilities with

Subpart AAAAAA [Reserved]


<R04>
Subpart BBBBBB_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 

for Source Category: Gasoline Distribution Bulk Terminals, Bulk Plants, 

                         and Pipeline Facilities

    Source: 73 FR 1933, Jan. 10, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.11080  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission limitations and 
management practices for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from 
area source gasoline distribution bulk terminals, bulk plants, and 
pipeline facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to 
demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations and management 
practices.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11081  Am I subject to the requirements in this subpart?

    (a) The affected source to which this subpart applies is each area 
source bulk gasoline terminal, pipeline breakout station, pipeline 
pumping station, and bulk gasoline plant identified in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (4) of this section. You are subject to the requirements in this 
subpart if you own or operate one or more of the affected area sources 
identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) A bulk gasoline terminal that is not subject to the control 
requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart R (Sec. Sec. 63.422, 63.423, 
and 63.424) or 40 CFR part 63,

[[Page 267]]

subpart CC (Sec. Sec. 63.646, 63.648, 63.649, and 63.650).
    (2) A pipeline breakout station that is not subject to the control 
requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart R (Sec. Sec. 63.423 and 
63.424).
    (3) A pipeline pumping station.
    (4) A bulk gasoline plant.
    (b) If you are an owner or operator of affected sources, as defined 
in (a)(1) through (4) of this section, you are not required to meet the 
obligation to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 as 
a result of being subject to this subpart. However, you are still 
subject to the requirement to apply for and obtain a permit under 40 CFR 
part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 if you meet one or more of the applicability 
criteria found in 40 CFR 70.3(a) and (b) or 40 CFR part 71.3(a) and (b).
    (c) Gasoline storage tanks that are located at affected sources 
identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, and that 
are used only for dispensing gasoline in a manner consistent with tanks 
located at a gasoline dispensing facility as defined in Sec. 63.11132, 
are not subject to any of the requirements in this subpart. These tanks 
must comply with subpart CCCCCC of this part.
    (d) The loading of aviation gasoline into storage tanks at airports, 
and the subsequent transfer of aviation gasoline within the airport, is 
not subject to this subpart.
    (e) The loading of gasoline into marine tank vessels at bulk 
facilities is not subject to this subpart.
    (f) If your affected source's throughput ever exceeds an applicable 
throughput threshold in the definition of ``bulk gasoline terminal'' or 
in item 1 in Table 2 to this subpart, the affected source will remain 
subject to the requirements for sources above the threshold, even if the 
affected source throughput later falls below the applicable throughput 
threshold.
    (g) For the purpose of determining gasoline throughput, as used in 
the definition of bulk gasoline plant and bulk gasoline terminal, the 
20,000 gallons per day threshold throughput is the maximum calculated 
design throughout for any day, and is not an average. An enforceable 
State, local, or Tribal permit limitation on throughput, established 
prior to the applicable compliance date, may be used in lieu of the 
20,000 gallons per day design capacity throughput threshold to determine 
whether the facility is a bulk gasoline plant or a bulk gasoline 
terminal.
    (h) Storage tanks that are used to load gasoline into a cargo tank 
for the on-site redistribution of gasoline to another storage tank are 
subject to this subpart.
    (i) For any affected source subject to the provisions of this 
subpart and another Federal rule, you may elect to comply only with the 
more stringent provisions of the applicable subparts. You must consider 
all provisions of the rules, including monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting. You must identify the affected source and provisions with 
which you will comply in your Notification of Compliance Status required 
under Sec. 63.11093. You also must demonstrate in your Notification of 
Compliance Status that each provision with which you will comply is at 
least as stringent as the otherwise applicable requirements in this 
subpart. You are responsible for making accurate determinations 
concerning the more stringent provisions; noncompliance with this rule 
is not excused if it is later determined that your determination was in 
error, and, as a result, you are violating this subpart. Compliance with 
this rule is your responsibility, and the Notification of Compliance 
Status does not alter or affect that responsibility.
    (j) For new or reconstructed affected sources, as specified in Sec. 
63.11082(b) and (c), recordkeeping to document applicable throughput

       Emission Limits, and Management Practices for Loading Racks

------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If you own or operate . . .              Then you must . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. A bulk gasoline terminal loading      (a) Equip your loading rack(s)
 rack(s) with a gasoline throughput       with a vapor collection system
 (total of all racks) of 250,000          designed to collect the TOC
 gallons per day, or greater. Gallons     vapors displaced from cargo
 per day is calculated by summing the     tanks during product loading;
 current day's throughput, plus the       and
 throughput for the previous 364 days,   (b) Reduce emissions of TOC to
 and then dividing that sum by 365.       less than or equal to 80 mg/l
                                          of gasoline loaded into
                                          gasoline cargo tanks at the
                                          loading rack; and
                                         (c) Design and operate the
                                          vapor collection system to
                                          prevent any TOC vapors
                                          collected at one loading rack
                                          or lane from passing through

                                          to the atmosphere; and
                                         (d) Limit the loading of
                                          gasoline into gasoline cargo
                                          tanks that are vapor tight
                                          using the procedures specified
                                          in Sec.  60.502(e) through
                                          (j) of this chapter. For the
                                          purposes of this section, the
                                          term ``tank truck'' as used in

2. A bulk gasoline terminal loading      (a) Use submerged filling with
 rack(s) with a gasoline throughput       a submerged fill pipe that is
 (total of all racks) of less than        no more than 6 inches from the
 250,000 gallons per day. Gallons per     bottom of the cargo tank; and
 day is calculated by summing the        (b) Make records available
 current day's throughput, plus the       within 24 hours of a request
 throughput for the previous 364 days,    by the Administrator to
 and then dividing that sum by 365        document your gasoline
                                          throughput.

Subpart CCCCCC_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 

           for Source Category: Gasoline Dispensing Facilities

    Source: 73 FR 1945, Jan. 10, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.11110  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission limitations and 
management practices for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from the 
loading of gasoline storage tanks at gasoline dispensing facilities 
(GDF). This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate 
compliance with the emission limitations and management practices.

[[Page 286]]


<R05>
Sec. 63.11111  Am I subject to the requirements in this subpart?

    (a) The affected source to which this subpart applies is each GDF 
that is located at an area source. The affected source includes each 
gasoline cargo tank during the delivery of product to a GDF and also 
includes each storage tank.
    (b) If your GDF has a monthly throughput of less than 10,000 gallons 
of gasoline, you must comply with the requirements in Sec. 63.11116.
    (c) If your GDF has a monthly throughput of 10,000 gallons of 
gasoline or more, you must comply with the requirements in Sec. 
63.11117.
    (d) If your GDF has a monthly throughput of 100,000 gallons of 
gasoline or more, you must comply with the requirements in Sec. 
63.11118.
    (e) An affected source shall, upon request by the Administrator, 
demonstrate that their monthly throughput is less than the 10,000-gallon 
or the 100,000-gallon threshold level, as applicable. For new or 
reconstructed affected sources, as specified in Sec. 63.11112(b) and 
(c), recordkeeping to document monthly throughput must begin upon 
startup of the affected source. For existing sources, as specified in 
Sec. 63.11112(d), recordkeeping to document monthly throughput must 
begin on January 10, 2008. For existing sources that are subject to this 
subpart only because they load gasoline into fuel tanks other than those 
in motor vehicles, as defined in Sec. 63.11132, recordkeeping to 
document monthly throughput must begin on January 24, 2011. Records 
required under this paragraph shall be kept for a period of 5 years.
    (f) If you are an owner or operator of affected sources, as defined 
in paragraph (a) of this section, you are not required to obtain a

a GDF into a portable gasoline tank for the on-site delivery and 
subsequent dispensing of the gasoline into the fuel tank of a motor 
vehicle or other gasoline-fueled engine or equipment used within the 
area source is only subject to Sec. 63.11116 of this subpart.
    (k) For any affected source subject to the provisions of this 
subpart and another Federal rule, you may elect to comply only with the 
more stringent provisions of the applicable subparts. You must consider 
all provisions of the rules, including monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting. You must identify the affected source and provisions with 
which you will comply in your Notification of Compliance Status required 
under Sec. 63.11124. You also must demonstrate in your Notification of 
Compliance Status that each provision with which you will comply is at 
least as stringent as the otherwise applicable requirements in this 
subpart. You are responsible for making accurate determinations 
concerning the more stringent provisions, and noncompliance with this 
rule is not excused if it is later determined that your determination 
was in error, and, as a result, you are violating this subpart. 
Compliance with this rule is your responsibility and the Notification of 
Compliance Status does not alter or affect that responsibility.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given them in the Clean Air Act (CAA), or in subparts A and 
BBBBBB of this part. For purposes of this subpart, definitions in this 
section supersede definitions in other parts or subparts.
    Dual-point vapor balance system means a type of vapor balance system 
in which the storage tank is equipped with an entry port for a gasoline 
fill pipe and a separate exit port for a vapor connection.
    Gasoline means any petroleum distillate or petroleum distillate/
alcohol blend having a Reid vapor pressure of 27.6 kilopascals or 
greater, which is used as a fuel for internal combustion engines.
    Gasoline cargo tank means a delivery tank truck or railcar which is 
loading or unloading gasoline, or which has loaded or unloaded gasoline 
on the immediately previous load.
    Gasoline dispensing facility (GDF) means any stationary facility 
which dispenses gasoline into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle, motor 
vehicle engine, nonroad vehicle, or nonroad engine, including a nonroad 
vehicle or nonroad engine used solely for competition. These facilities 
include, but are not limited to, facilities that dispense gasoline into 
on- and off-road, street, or highway motor vehicles, lawn equipment, 
boats, test engines, landscaping equipment, generators, pumps, and other 
gasoline-fueled engines and equipment.
    Monthly throughput means the total volume of gasoline that is loaded 
into, or dispensed from, all gasoline storage tanks at each GDF during a 
month. Monthly throughput is calculated by summing the volume of 
gasoline loaded into, or dispensed from, all gasoline storage tanks at 
each GDF during the current day, plus the total volume of gasoline 
loaded into, or dispensed from, all gasoline storage tanks at each GDF 
during the previous 364 days, and then dividing that sum by 12.
    Motor vehicle means any self-propelled vehicle designed for 
transporting persons or property on a street or highway.
    Nonroad engine means an internal combustion engine (including the 
fuel system) that is not used in a motor vehicle or a vehicle used 
solely for competition, or that is not subject to standards promulgated 
under section 7411 of this title or section 7521 of this title.
    Nonroad vehicle means a vehicle that is powered by a nonroad engine, 
and that is not a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for 
competition.
    Submerged filling means, for the purposes of this subpart, the 
filling of a gasoline storage tank through a submerged fill pipe whose 
discharge is no more than the applicable distance specified in Sec. 
63.11117(b) from the bottom of the tank. Bottom filling of gasoline

storage tanks is included in this definition.
    Vapor balance system means a combination of pipes and hoses that 
create a closed system between the vapor spaces of an unloading gasoline 
cargo tank and a receiving storage tank such that vapors displaced from 
the storage tank are transferred to the gasoline cargo tank being 
unloaded.
    Vapor-tight means equipment that allows no loss of vapors. 
Compliance with vapor-tight requirements can be determined by checking 
to ensure that the concentration at a potential leak source is not equal 
to or greater than 100 percent of the Lower Explosive Limit when 
measured with a combustible gas detector, calibrated with propane, at a 
distance of 1 inch from the source.
    Vapor-tight gasoline cargo tank means a gasoline cargo tank which 
has demonstrated within the 12 preceding months that it meets the annual 
certification test requirements in Sec. 63.11092(f) of this part.

                  Standards and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11147  What are the standards and compliance requirements for existing 

sources not using batch copper converters?

    (a) Emissions limits and work practice standards. (1) You must not 
discharge to the atmosphere through any combination of stacks or other 
vents captured process exhaust gases from the copper concentrate dryers, 
smelting vessels, converting vessels, matte drying and grinding plants, 
secondary gas systems, and anode refining department that contain 
particulate matter less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter 
(PM<INF>10</INF>) in excess of 89.5 pounds

[[Page 305]]

per hour (lb/hr) on a 24-hour average basis.
    (2) You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and 
fumes released during the transfer of molten materials from smelting 
vessels and converting vessels and conveys the collected gas stream to a 
control device.
    (3) You must operate one or more capture systems that collect the 
gases and fumes released from each vessel used to refine blister copper, 
remelt anode copper, or remelt anode scrap and convey each collected gas 
stream to a control device. One control device may be used for multiple 
collected gas streams.
    (b) Compliance requirements. For purposes of determining compliance 
with the emissions limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must 
comply with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this 
section.
    (1) You must calibrate, maintain and operate a system to 
continuously measure emissions of particulate matter (PM) from the 
smelter's main stack.
    (2) All PM collected by the smelter main stack continuous PM 
sampling system is reported as PM<INF>10</INF> unless you demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of the permitting authority that, due to an infrequent 
event, the measured PM contains a large fraction of particles greater 
than 10 microns in diameter.
    (3) To determine the mass emissions rate, the PM<INF>10</INF> 
concentration as determined by the smelter main stack continuous PM 
sampling system is multiplied by the volumetric flow rate for the 
smelter main stack and any necessary conversion factors.
    (4) Compliance with the PM<INF>10</INF> emissions limit is 
demonstrated based on the average mass PM<INF>10</INF> emissions rate 
for each 24-hour period.
    (5) The results of the PM monitoring and calculated average mass 
PM<INF>10</INF> emissions rate for each 24-hour period must be recorded 
and the records maintained for at least 5 years. Collected data must be 
available for inspection when the required laboratory analysis is 
completed.
    (6) You must submit to the permitting authority by the 20th day of 
each month a report summarizing the 24-hour average mass PM<INF>10</INF> 
emissions rates for the previous month.
    (7) You may certify initial compliance with the emissions limit in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section based on the results of PM sampling 
conducted during the previous month.
    (c) Operation and maintenance requirements. (1) At all times, 
including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, you must to the 
extent practicable, maintain and operate any affected source, including 
associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with 
good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. 
Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures 
are being used will be based on information available to the permitting 
authority which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, 
opacity observations, review of operating and maintenance procedures, 
and inspection of the source.
    (2) All pollution control equipment must be installed, maintained, 
and operated properly. Instructions from the vendor or established 
maintenance practices that maximize pollution control must be followed. 
All necessary equipment control and operating devices, such as pressure 
gauges, amp meters, volt meters, flow rate indicators, temperature 
gauges, continuous emission monitors, etc., must be installed, operated 
properly, and easily accessible to compliance inspectors. A copy of all 
manufacturers' operating instructions for pollution control equipment 
and pollution emitting equipment must be maintained at your facility 
site. These instructions must be available to all employees who operate 
the equipment and must be made available to the permitting authority 
upon request. Maintenance records must be made available to the 
permitting authority upon request.
    (3) You must document the activities performed to assure proper 
operation and maintenance of the air pollution control equipment and 
monitoring systems or devices.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, in the 
event of an emergency situation the owner or operator must comply with 
the requirements in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through

[[Page 306]]

(iii) of this section. For the purposes of complying with this 
paragraph, an emergency situation is any situation arising from sudden 
and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the facility 
owner or operator that requires immediate corrective action to restore 
normal operation, and that causes the affected source to exceed an 
applicable emissions limitation under this subpart, due to unavoidable 
increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency must 
not include noncompliance to the extent it is caused by improperly 
designed equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper 
operation, or operator error.
    (i) During the period of the emergency, you must implement all 
reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceed the 
emissions standards or other applicable requirements in this subpart.
    (ii) You must document through signed contemporaneous logs or other 
relevant evidence that an emergency occurred and you can identify the 
probable cause, your facility was being operated properly at the time 
the emergency occurred, and the corrective actions taken to minimize 
emissions as required by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
    (iii) You must submit a notice of the emergency to the permitting 
authority within two working days of the time when emissions limitations 
were exceeded due to the emergency (or an alternate timeframe acceptable 
to the permitting authority). This notice must contain a description of 
the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective 
actions taken.
    (5) As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section, you must comply with the startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction requirements in 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3).
    (d) Deviations. You must submit written notification to the 
permitting authority of any deviation from the requirements of this 
subpart, including the probable cause of such deviations and any 
corrective actions or preventative measures taken. You must submit this 
notification within 14 days of the date the deviation occurred.
    (e) Reports. You must submit semiannual monitoring reports to your 
permitting authority. All instances of deviations from the requirements 
of this subpart must be clearly identified in the reports.
    (f) Records. (1) You must retain records of all required monitoring 
data and support information. Support information includes all 
calibration and maintenance records, all original strip charts or 
appropriate recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, and 
copies of all reports required by this subpart. For all monitoring 
requirements, the owner or operator must record, where applicable, the 
date, place, and time of sampling or measurement; the date analyses were 
performed; the company or entity that performed the analyses; the 
analytical techniques or methods used; the results of such analyses; and

Sec. 63.11148  What are the standards and compliance requirements for existing 

sources using batch copper converters?

    (a) Emissions limits and work practice standards. (1) For each 
copper concentrate dryer, you must not discharge to the atmosphere from 
the dryer vent any gases that contain total particulate matter (PM) in 
excess of 0.022 grains per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf).
    (2) You must exhaust the process off gas from each smelting vessel 
to a control device according to the requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) During periods when copper ore concentrate feed is charged to 
and smelted to form molten copper matte and slag layers in the smelting 
vessel, you must exhaust the process off gas from the smelting vessel to 
a gas cleaning system controlling PM and to a sulfuric acid plant prior 
to discharge to the atmosphere.

[[Page 307]]

    (ii) During periods when no copper ore concentrate feed is charged 
to the smelting vessel but the smelting vessel remains in operation to 
temporarily hold molten material in the vessel before resuming copper 
production, you must exhaust the process off gas from the smelting 
vessel to an electrostatic precipitator, wet scrubber, or baghouse prior 
to discharge to the atmosphere.
    (3) You must control the process emissions released when tapping 
copper matte or slag from a smelting vessel according to paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and 
fumes released when copper matte or slag is tapped from the smelting 
vessel. The design and placement of this capture system must be such 
that the tapping port opening, launder, and receiving vessel (e.g., 
ladle, slag pot) are positioned within the confines or influence of the 
capture system's ventilation draft during those times when the copper 
matte or slag is flowing from the tapping port opening.
    (ii) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the 
capture system used to comply with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section 
any gases that contain total PM in excess of 0.022 gr/dscf.
    (4) For each batch copper converter, you must meet the requirements 
in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) You must operate a primary capture system that collects the 
process off gas vented when one or more batch copper converters are 
blowing. If you operate a batch copper converter that does not use a 
``U''-shaped side flue located at one end of the converter, then the 
capture system design must include use of a primary hood that covers the 
entire mouth of each batch copper converter vessel when the copper 
converter is positioned for blowing. The capture system may use multiple 
intake and duct segments through which the ventilation rates are 
controlled independently of each other.
    (ii) If you operate a batch copper converter that does not use a 
``U''-shaped side flue located at one end of the converter, then you 
must operate a secondary capture system that collects gases and fumes 
released from the batch copper converter when the converter mouth is 
rotated out partially or totally from within the confines or influence 
of the primary capture system's ventilation draft during charging, 
skimming, pouring, or holding. The capture system design must use 
additional hoods (e.g., sliding secondary hoods, air curtain hoods) or 
other capture devices (e.g., building evacuation systems). The capture 
system may use multiple intake and duct segments through which the 
ventilation rates are controlled independently of each other, and 
individual duct segments may be connected to separate PM control 
devices.
    (iii) You must exhaust the process off gas captured by the primary 
capture system that is used to comply with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this 
section to a gas cleaning system controlling PM and to a sulfuric acid 
plant prior to discharge to the atmosphere.
    (iv) For each secondary capture system that is used to comply with 
paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section and is not vented to a gas cleaning 
system controlling PM and a sulfuric acid plant, you must not cause to 
be discharged to the atmosphere any gases that contain total particulate 
matter in excess of 0.02 grains/dscf.
    (b) Monitoring requirements for electrostatic precipitators. To 
monitor the performance of each electrostatic precipitator used to 
comply with the PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section, 
you must use a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) that is 
installed at the outlet of each electrostatic precipitator or a common 
duct at the outlet of multiple electrostatic precipitators.
    (1) Each COMS must meet Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 
60, appendix B.
    (2) You must comply with the quality assurance requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) You must automatically (intrinsic to the opacity monitor) check 
the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least once daily. For 
a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and

[[Page 308]]

upscale calibration materials is as defined in the applicable version of 
Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
    (ii) You must adjust the zero and span whenever the 24-hour zero 
drift or 24-hour span drift exceeds 4 percent opacity. The COMS must 
allow for the amount of excess zero and span drift measured at the 24-
hour interval checks to be recorded and quantified. The optical surfaces 
exposed to the effluent gases must be cleaned prior to performing the 
zero and span drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic zero 
adjustments. For systems using automatic zero adjustments, the optical 
surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation 
exceeds 4 percent opacity.
    (iii) You must apply a method for producing a simulated zero opacity 
condition and an upscale (span) opacity condition using a certified 
neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known 
obscuration of the light beam. All procedures applied must provide a 
system check of the analyzer internal optical surfaces and all 
electronic circuitry including the lamp and photodetector assembly.
    (iv) Except during periods of system breakdowns, repairs, 
calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, the COMS must be in 
continuous operation and must complete a minimum of one cycle of 
sampling and analyzing for each successive 10 second period and one 
cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.
    (v) You must reduce all data from the COMS to 6-minute averages. 
Six-minute opacity averages must be calculated from 36 or more data 
points equally spaced over each 6-minute period. Data recorded during 
periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and 
span adjustments must not be included in the data averages. An 
arithmetic or integrated average of all data may be used.
    (3) You must evaluate opacity measurements from the COMS on a 24-
hour rolling average excluding periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction. If the 24-hour rolling average opacity exceeds 15 percent, 
you must initiate investigation of the relevant controls or equipment 
within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high opacity incident and, 
if necessary, take corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust or 
repair the controls or equipment to reduce the opacity average to below 
the 15 percent level.
    (4) You must log in ink or electronic format and maintain a record 
of 24-hour opacity measurements performed in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section and any corrective actions taken, if any. A 
record of corrective actions taken must include the date and time during 
which the 24-hour rolling average opacity exceeded 15 percent and the 
date, time and type of the corrective action.
    (c) Monitoring requirements for baghouses. To monitor the 
performance of each baghouse used to comply with PM emissions limits in 
paragraph (a) of this section, you must use a bag leak detection system 
according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this 
section.
    (1) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate 
a bag leak detection system for the baghouse to monitor the baghouse 
performance.
    (2) The baghouse leak detection system must meet the specifications 
and requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at 
concentrations that can effectively discern any dysfunctional leaks of 
the baghouse.
    (ii) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative or absolute particulate matter loadings.
    (iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative 
particulate emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be 
located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.
    (iv) The bag leak detection system must be installed downstream of 
the baghouse.
    (v) The bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, 
calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent

[[Page 309]]

with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations. The 
calibration of the system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing 
the relative baseline output level by adjusting the sensitivity and the 
averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and 
the alarm delay time.
    (3) If the bag leak detection system alarm sounds, you must initiate 
investigation of the baghouse within 24 hours of the first discovery of 
the alarm and, if necessary, take corrective action as soon as 
practicable to adjust or repair the baghouse to minimize possible 
exceedances of the applicable PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (4) You must log in ink or electronic format and maintain a record 
of installation, calibration, maintenance, and operation of the bag leak 
detection system. If the bag leak detection system alarm sounds, the 
records must include an identification of the date and time of all bag 
leak detection alarms, their cause, and an explanation of the corrective 
actions taken, if any.
    (d) Alternative monitoring requirements for baghouses. As an 
alternative to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for bag 
leak detection systems, you must monitor the performance of each 
baghouse used to comply with a PM emissions limit in paragraph (a) of 
this section using a COMS that is installed at the outlet on the 
baghouse or a common duct at the outlet of multiple baghouses. Each COMS 
must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this 
section.
    (e) Performance testing. (1) You must demonstrate initial compliance 
with the applicable PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section 
based on the results of a performance test for each affected source.
    (i) You may certify initial compliance for an affected source based 
on the results of a previous performance test conducted within the past 
12 months before your compliance date.
    (ii) If you have not conducted a performance test to demonstrate 
compliance with the applicable emissions limits within the past 12 
months before your compliance date, you must conduct a performance test 
within 180 days of your compliance date and report the results in your 
notification of compliance status.
    (2) You must demonstrate subsequent compliance with the applicable 
PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section based on the 
results of repeat performance tests conducted at least every 2.5 years 
for each affected source.
    (3) You must conduct each performance test according to Sec. 
63.7(e)(1) using the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) 
through (v) of this section.
    (i) Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to select sampling 
port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct. 
Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device (or 
at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is present) 
prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
    (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to 
determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.
    (iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine 
the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/ASME PTC 
19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses'' (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.
    (iv) Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the moisture 
content of the stack gas.
    (v) Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the PM 
concentration for negative pressure baghouses or Method 5D (40 CFR part 
60, appendix A) for positive pressure baghouses. A minimum of three 
valid test runs are needed to comprise a PM performance test.
    (f) Operation and maintenance requirements. (1) At all times, 
including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, you must to the 
extent practicable, maintain and operate any affected source, including 
associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with 
good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. 
Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures 
are being used will be based on information available to the permitting 
authority which may include, but

[[Page 310]]

is not limited to, monitoring results, opacity observations, review of 
operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the source.
    (2) All pollution control equipment must be installed, maintained, 
and operated properly. Instructions from the vendor or established 
maintenance practices that maximize pollution control must be followed. 
All necessary equipment control and operating devices, such as pressure

purpose of complying with this paragraph, an emergency situation is any 
situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond 
the control of the facility owner or operator that requires immediate 
corrective action to restore normal operation and that causes the 
affected source to exceed applicable emission limitation under this 
subpart due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the 
emergency. An emergency must not include noncompliance to the extent it 
is caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventive 
maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.
    (i) During the period of the emergency you must implement all 
reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the 
emission standards or other applicable requirements in this subpart.
    (ii) You must document through signed contemporaneous logs or other

    (2) You must maintain a file of all measurements, including 
continuous monitoring system, monitoring device, and performance testing 
measurements; all continuous monitoring system performance evaluations; 
all continuous monitoring system or monitoring device calibration 
checks; adjustments and maintenance performed on these systems or 
devices; and all other information required by this section recorded in 
a permanent form suitable for inspection. The file must be retained for 
at least 5 years following the date of such measurements, maintenance, 
reports.

[[Page 311]]

    (h) Reporting requirements. (1) You must prepare and submit to the 
permitting authority an excess emissions and monitoring systems 
performance report and summary report every calendar quarter. A less 
frequent reporting interval may used for either report as approved by 
the permitting authority.
    (2) The summary report must include the information in paragraphs 
(h)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.

emergency situation, you must comply with the requirements specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. For the purpose of 
complying with this paragraph, an emergency situation is any situation 
arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the 
control of the facility owner or operator that requires immediate 
corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the 
affected source to exceed an applicable emissions limitation under this 
subpart, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the 
emergency. An emergency must not include noncompliance to the extent it 
is caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventive 
maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.
    (1) During the period of the emergency, you must implement all 
reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the 
emission standards or other applicable requirements in this subpart.
    (2) You must document through signed contemporaneous logs or other 
relevant evidence that an emergency occurred and you can identify the

in which anode copper refining operations are performed. Emissions 
sources in the anode refining department include anode refining furnaces 
and anode shaft furnaces.
    Baghouse means a control device that collects particulate matter by 
filtering the gas stream through bags. A baghouse is also referred to as 
a ``fabric filter.''
    Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of 
continuously monitoring relative particulate matter (dust) loadings in 
the exhaust of a baghouse in order to detect bag leaks and other upset 
conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, 
an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, 
transmittance or other effect to continuously monitor relative 
particulate matter loadings.
    Batch copper converter means a converter in which molten copper 
matte is charged and then oxidized to form blister copper by a process 
that is performed in discrete batches using a sequence of charging, 
blowing, skimming, and pouring.
    Capture system means the collection of components used to capture 
gases and fumes released from one or more emissions points and then 
convey the captured gas stream to a control device. A capture system may 
include, but is not limited to, the following components as applicable 
to a given capture system design: Duct intake devices, hoods, 
enclosures, ductwork, dampers, manifolds, plenums, and fans.
    Charging means the operating mode for a batch copper converter 
during which molten or solid material is added into the vessel.
    Control device means air pollution control equipment used to remove 
PM from a gas stream.
    Converting vessel means a furnace, reactor, or other type of vessel 
in which copper matte is oxidized to form blister copper.
    Copper concentrate means copper ore that has been beneficiated to 
increase its copper content.
    Copper concentrate dryer means a vessel in which copper concentrates 
are heated in the presence of air to reduce the moisture content of the 
material. Supplemental copper-bearing feed materials and fluxes may be 
added or mixed with the copper concentrates fed to a copper concentrate 
dryer.
    Copper concentrate feed means the mixture of copper concentrate, 
secondary copper-bearing materials, recycled slags and dusts, fluxes, 
and other materials blended together for feeding to the smelting vessel.
    Copper matte means a material predominately composed of copper and 
iron sulfides produced by smelting copper ore concentrates.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or work 
practice standard;
    (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement 
an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the 
operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a 
permit; or
    (3) Fails to meet any emissions limitation or work practice standard 
in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of 
whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.
    Holding means the operating mode for a batch copper converter or a 
holding furnace associated with a smelting furnace during which the 
molten bath

[[Page 315]]

is maintained in the vessel but no blowing or smelting is performed nor 
is material added into or removed from the vessel.
    Matte drying and grinding plant means the area at a primary copper 
smelter in which wet granulated matte copper is ground in a mill, dried 
by blowing heated air through the mill, and then separated from the 
drying air stream using a control device such as a baghouse.
    Pouring means the operating mode for a batch copper converter during 
which molten copper is removed from the vessel.
    Primary copper smelter means any installation or any intermediate 
process engaged in the production of copper from copper sulfide ore 
concentrates through the use of pyrometallurgical techniques.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined at 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Secondary gas system means a capture system that collects the gases 
and fumes released when removing and transferring molten materials from 
one or more vessels using tapping ports, launders, and other openings in 
the vessels. Examples of molten material include, but are not limited 
to: Copper matte, slag, and blister copper.
    Skimming means the batch copper converter operating mode during 
which molten slag is removed from the vessel.
    Smelting vessel means a furnace, reactor, or other type of vessel in 
which copper ore concentrate and fluxes are smelted to form a molten 
mass of material containing copper matte and slag. Other copper-bearing 
materials may also be charged to the smelting vessel.
    Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, 
or operational standard, or combination thereof.

                  Standards and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11155  What are the standards and compliance requirements for new 

sources?

    (a) You must not discharge to the atmosphere any gases which contain 
particulate matter (PM) in excess of 0.002 grains per dry standard cubic 
foot (gr/dscf) from the exhaust vent of any capture system for a 
smelting furnace, melting furnace, or other vessel that contains molten 
material and any capture system for the transfer of molten material.
    (b) For each smelting furnace, melting furnace, or other vessel that 
contains molten material, you must install and operate a capture system 
that collects the gases and fumes from the vessel and from the transfer 
of molten material and convey the collected gas stream to a control 
device.
    (c) You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written 
plan for the selection, inspection, and pretreatment of copper scrap to 
minimize, to the extent practicable, the amount of oil and plastics in 
the scrap that is charged to the smelting furnace. Your plan must 
include a training program for scrap inspectors. You must keep records 
to demonstrate continuous compliance with the requirements of your plan. 
You must keep a current copy of your pollution prevention plan onsite 
and available for inspection.
    (d) You must install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection 
system on all baghouses used to comply with the PM emissions limit in 
paragraph (a) of this section according to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, prepare and operate by a site-specific monitoring plan 
according to paragraph (d)(2) of

[[Page 318]]

this section, take corrective action according to paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section, and record information according to paragraph (d)(4) of 
this section.
    (1) Each bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section.
    (i) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations 
of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic 
foot) or less.
    (ii) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative PM loadings. The owner or operator must continuously record the 
output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other 
means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger.)
    (iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative 
particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to 
paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such 
that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
    (iv) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you 
must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the 
sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm 
set points, and the alarm delay time.
    (v) Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the averaging 
period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the 
Administrator or delegated authority except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (vi) Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag 
leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including 
temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the 
site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (vii) You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of 
the baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.
    (viii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (2) You must develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated 
authority for approval a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak 
detection system. You must operate and maintain the bag leak detection 
system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each 
monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through 
(vi) of this section.
    (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
    (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;
    (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality 
assurance procedures;
    (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including 
a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;
    (v) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and 
stored; and
    (vi) Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the 
Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners and operators more 
than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if 
the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific 
condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it 
is not feasible to alleviate this specific condition within 3 hours of 
the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will 
ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.
    (3) For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate procedures 
to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except 
as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section, you must alleviate 
the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever 
corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but 
are not limited to the following:

[[Page 319]]

    (i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or 
filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
particulate emissions;
    (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
    (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise 
repairing the control device;
    (iv) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment;
    (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system; or
    (vi) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.
    (4) You must maintain records of the information specified in 
paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section for each bag leak 
detection system.
    (i) Records of the bag leak detection system output;

time that procedures to determine the cause of an alarm were initiated, 
whether procedures were initiated within 1 hour of the alarm, the cause 
of the alarm, an explanation of the actions taken, the date and time the 
cause of the alarm was alleviated, and whether the alarm was alleviated 
within 3 hours of the alarm.
    (e) You must conduct a performance test to demonstrate initial 
compliance with the PM emissions limit within 180 days after startup and 
report the results in your notification of compliance status. You must 
conduct each PM test according to Sec. 63.7(e)(1) using the test 
methods and procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to select sampling 
port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct. 
Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device (or 
at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is present) 
prior to any releases to the atmosphere.

emergency situation is any situation arising from sudden and reasonably 
unforeseeable events beyond the control of the facility owner or 
operator that require immediate corrective action to restore normal 
operation, and that cause the affected source to exceed applicable 
emission limitation under this subpart, due to unavoidable increases in 
emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency must not include 
noncompliance to the extent it is caused by improperly designed 
equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper 
operation, or operator error.
    (1) During the period of the emergency you must implement all 
reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the 
emission standards or other applicable requirements in this subpart.
    (2) You must document through signed contemporaneous logs or other

Subpart HHHHHH_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: 

  Paint Stripping and Miscellaneous Surface Coating Operations at Area 

                                 Sources

    Source: 73 FR 1759, Jan. 9, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.11169  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this subpart 
establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants 
(HAP) for area sources involved in any of the activities in paragraphs 
(a) through (c) of this section. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the 
emission standards contained herein.
    (a) Paint stripping operations that involve the use of chemical 
strippers that contain methylene chloride (MeCl), Chemical Abstract 
Service number 75092, in paint removal processes;
    (b) Autobody refinishing operations that encompass motor vehicle and 
mobile equipment spray-applied surface coating operations;
    (c) Spray application of coatings containing compounds of chromium 
(Cr), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), or cadmium (Cd), 
collectively referred to as the target HAP to any part or product made 
of metal or plastic, or combinations of metal and plastic that are not 
motor vehicles or mobile equipment.
    (d) This subpart does not apply to any of the activities described 
in paragraph (d)(1) through (6) of this section.
    (1) Surface coating or paint stripping performed on site at 
installations owned or operated by the Armed Forces of the United States 
(including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of any such State), 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or the National 
Nuclear Security Administration.
    (2) Surface coating or paint stripping of military munitions, as 
defined in Sec. 63.11180, manufactured by or for the Armed Forces of 
the United States (including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of 
any such State) or equipment directly and exclusively used for the 
purposes of transporting military munitions.
    (3) Surface coating or paint stripping performed by individuals on 
their personal vehicles, possessions, or property, either as a hobby or 
for maintenance of their personal vehicles, possessions, or property. 
This subpart also does not apply when these operations are performed by 
individuals for others without compensation. An individual who spray 
applies surface coating to more than two motor vehicles or pieces of 
mobile equipment per year is subject to the requirements in this subpart 
that pertain to motor vehicle and mobile equipment surface coating 
regardless of whether compensation is received.
    (4) Surface coating or paint stripping that meets the definition of 
``research and laboratory activities'' in Sec. 63.11180.
    (5) Surface coating or paint stripping that meets the definition of 
``quality control activities'' in Sec. 63.11180.
    (6) Surface coating or paint stripping activities that are covered 
under another area source NESHAP.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11170  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you operate an area source of 
HAP as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, including sources that 
are part of a tribal, local, State, or Federal facility and you perform 
one or more of the activities in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this 
section:
    (1) Perform paint stripping using MeCl for the removal of dried 
paint (including, but not limited to, paint, enamel, varnish, shellac, 
and lacquer) from wood, metal, plastic, and other substrates.
    (2) Perform spray application of coatings, as defined in Sec. 
63.11180, to motor vehicles and mobile equipment including operations 
that are located in stationary structures at fixed locations, and mobile 
repair and refinishing operations that travel to the customer's 
location, except spray coating applications that meet the definition of 
facility maintenance in Sec. 63.11180. However,

[[Page 333]]

if you are the owner or operator of a motor vehicle or mobile equipment 
surface coating operation, you may petition the Administrator for an 
exemption from this subpart if you can demonstrate, to the satisfaction 
of the Administrator, that you spray apply no coatings that contain the 
target HAP, as defined in Sec. 63.11180. Petitions must include a 
description of the coatings that you spray apply and your certification 
that you do not spray apply any coatings containing the target HAP. If 
circumstances change such that you intend to spray apply coatings 
containing the target HAP, you must submit the initial notification 
required by 63.11175 and comply with the requirements of this subpart.
    (3) Perform spray application of coatings that contain the target 
HAP, as defined in Sec. 63.11180, to a plastic and/or metal substrate 
on a part or product, except spray coating applications that meet the 
definition of facility maintenance or space vehicle in Sec. 63.11180.
    (b) An area source of HAP is a source of HAP that is not a major 
source of HAP, is not located at a major source, and is not part of a 
major source of HAP emissions. A major source of HAP emissions is any 
stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a 
contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential 
to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (Mg) (10 tons) or 
more per year, or emit any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg (25 
tons) or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11171  How do I know if my source is considered a new source or an 

existing source?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new and existing affected area 
source engaged in the activities listed in Sec. 63.11170, with the 
exception of those activities listed in Sec. 63.11169(d) of this 
subpart.
    (b) The affected source is the collection of all of the items listed 
in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section. Not all affected 
sources will have all of the items listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(6) of this section.
    (1) Mixing rooms and equipment;
    (2) Spray booths, ventilated prep stations, curing ovens, and 
associated equipment;
    (3) Spray guns and associated equipment;
    (4) Spray gun cleaning equipment;
    (5) Equipment used for storage, handling, recovery, or recycling of 
cleaning solvent or waste paint; and
    (6) Equipment used for paint stripping at paint stripping facilities 
using paint strippers containing MeCl.
    (c) An affected source is a new source if it meets the criteria in 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
    (1) You commenced the construction of the source after September 17, 
2007 by installing new paint stripping or surface coating equipment. If 
you purchase and install spray booths, enclosed spray gun cleaners, 
paint stripping equipment to reduce MeCl emissions, or purchase new 
spray guns to comply with this subpart at an existing source, these 
actions would not make your existing source a new source.
    (2) The new paint stripping or surface coating equipment is used at 
a source that was not actively engaged in paint stripping and/or 
miscellaneous surface coating prior to September 17, 2007.
    (d) An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition 
of reconstruction in Sec. 63.2.
    (e) An affected source is an existing source if it is not a new 
source or a reconstructed source.

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11172  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    The date by which you must comply with this subpart is called the 
compliance date. The compliance date for each type of affected source is 
specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) For a new or reconstructed affected source, the compliance date 
is the applicable date in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section:
    (1) If the initial startup of your new or reconstructed affected 
source is after September 17, 2007, the compliance date is January 9, 
2008.
    (2) If the initial startup of your new or reconstructed affected 
source occurs after January 9, 2008, the compliance

[[Page 334]]

date is the date of initial startup of your affected source.
    (b) For an existing affected source, the compliance date is January 
10, 2011.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11173  What are my general requirements for complying with this 

subpart?

    (a) Each paint stripping operation that is an affected area source 
must implement management practices to minimize the evaporative 
emissions of MeCl. The management practices must address, at a minimum, 
the practices in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, as 
applicable, for your operations.
    (1) Evaluate each application to ensure there is a need for paint 
stripping (e.g., evaluate whether it is possible to re-coat the piece 
without removing the existing coating).
    (2) Evaluate each application where a paint stripper containing MeCl 
is used to ensure that there is no alternative paint stripping 
technology that can be used.
    (3) Reduce exposure of all paint strippers containing MeCl to the 
air.
    (4) Optimize application conditions when using paint strippers 
containing MeCl to reduce MeCl evaporation (e.g., if the stripper must 
be heated, make sure that the temperature is kept as low as possible to 
reduce evaporation).
    (5) Practice proper storage and disposal of paint strippers 
containing MeCl (e.g., store stripper in closed, air-tight containers).
    (b) Each paint stripping operation that has annual usage of more 
than one ton of MeCl must develop and implement a written MeCl 
minimization plan to minimize the use and emissions of MeCl. The MeCl 
minimization plan must address, at a minimum, the management practices 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, as 
applicable, for your operations. Each operation must post a placard or 
sign outlining the MeCl minimization plan in each area where paint 
stripping operations subject to this subpart occur. Paint stripping 
operations with annual usage of less than one ton of MeCl, must comply 
with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, 
as applicable, but are not required to develop and implement a written 
MeCl minimization plan.
    (c) Each paint stripping operation must maintain copies of annual 
usage of paint strippers containing MeCl on site at all times.
    (d) Each paint stripping operation with annual usage of more than 
one ton of MeCl must maintain a copy of their current MeCl minimization 
plan on site at all times.
    (e) Each motor vehicle and mobile equipment surface coating 
operation and each miscellaneous surface coating operation must meet the 
requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section.
    (1) All painters must be certified that they have completed training 
in the proper spray application of surface coatings and the proper setup 
and maintenance of spray equipment. The minimum requirements for 
training and certification are described in paragraph (f) of this 
section. The spray application of surface coatings is prohibited by 
persons who are not certified as having completed the training described 
in paragraph (f) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph do 
not apply to the students of an accredited surface coating training 
program who are under the direct supervision of an instructor who meets 
the requirements of this paragraph.
    (2) All spray-applied coatings must be applied in a spray booth, 
preparation station, or mobile enclosure that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section and either paragraph (e)(2)(ii), 
(e)(2)(iii), or (e)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (i) All spray booths, preparation stations, and mobile enclosures 
must be fitted with a type of filter technology that is demonstrated to 
achieve at least 98-percent capture of paint overspray. The procedure 
used to demonstrate filter efficiency must be consistent with the 
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning 
Engineers (ASHRAE) Method 52.1, ``Gravimetric and Dust-Spot Procedures 
for Testing Air-Cleaning Devices Used in General Ventilation for 
Removing Particulate Matter, June 4, 1992'' (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 63.14 of subpart A of this part). The

[[Page 335]]

test coating for measuring filter efficiency shall be a high solids bake 
enamel delivered at a rate of at least 135 grams per minute from a 
conventional (non-HVLP) air-atomized spray gun operating at 40 pounds 
per square inch (psi) air pressure; the air flow rate across the filter 
shall be 150 feet per minute. Owners and operators may use published 
filter efficiency data provided by filter vendors to demonstrate 
compliance with this requirement and are not required to perform this 
measurement. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to 
waterwash spray booths that are operated and maintained according to the 
manufacturer's specifications.
    (ii) Spray booths and preparation stations used to refinish complete 
motor vehicles or mobile equipment must be fully enclosed with a full 
roof, and four complete walls or complete side curtains, and must be 
ventilated at negative pressure so that air is drawn into any openings 
in the booth walls or preparation station curtains. However, if a spray 
booth is fully enclosed and has seals on all doors and other openings 
and has an automatic pressure balancing system, it may be operated at up 
to, but not more than, 0.05 inches water gauge positive pressure.
    (iii) Spray booths and preparation stations that are used to coat 
miscellaneous parts and products or vehicle subassemblies must have a 
full roof, at least three complete walls or complete side curtains, and 
must be ventilated so that air is drawn into the booth. The walls and 
roof of a booth may have openings, if needed, to allow for conveyors and 
parts to pass through the booth during the coating process.
    (iv) Mobile ventilated enclosures that are used to perform spot 
repairs must enclose and, if necessary, seal against the surface around 
the area being coated such that paint overspray is retained within the 
enclosure and directed to a filter to capture paint overspray.
    (3) All spray-applied coatings must be applied with a high volume, 
low pressure (HVLP) spray gun, electrostatic application, airless spray 
gun, air-assisted airless spray gun, or an equivalent technology that is 
demonstrated by the spray gun manufacturer to achieve transfer 
efficiency comparable to one of the spray gun technologies listed above 
for a comparable operation, and for which written approval has been 
obtained from the Administrator. The procedure used to demonstrate that 
spray gun transfer efficiency is equivalent to that of an HVLP spray gun 
must be equivalent to the California South Coast Air Quality Management 
District's ``Spray Equipment Transfer Efficiency Test Procedure for 
Equipment User, May 24, 1989'' and ``Guidelines for Demonstrating 
Equivalency with District Approved Transfer Efficient Spray Guns, 
September 26, 2002'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14 of 
subpart A of this part). The requirements of this paragraph do not apply 
to painting performed by students and instructors at paint training 
centers. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to the surface 
coating of aerospace vehicles that involves the coating of components 
that normally require the use of an airbrush or an extension on the 
spray gun to properly reach limited access spaces; to the application of 
coatings on aerospace vehicles that contain fillers that adversely 
affect atomization with HVLP spray guns; or to the application of 
coatings on aerospace vehicles that normally have a dried film thickness 
of less than 0.0013 centimeter (0.0005 in.).
    (4) All paint spray gun cleaning must be done so that an atomized 
mist or spray of gun cleaning solvent and paint residue is not created 
outside of a container that collects used gun cleaning solvent. Spray 
gun cleaning may be done with, for example, hand cleaning of parts of 
the disassembled gun in a container of solvent, by flushing solvent 
through the gun without atomizing the solvent and paint residue, or by 
using a fully enclosed spray gun washer. A combination of non-atomizing 
methods may also be used.
    (5) As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), we, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, may choose to grant you permission to use an 
alternative to the emission standards in this section after you have 
requested approval to do so according to Sec. 63.6(g)(2).
    (f) Each owner or operator of an affected miscellaneous surface 
coating

[[Page 336]]

source must ensure and certify that all new and existing personnel, 
including contract personnel, who spray apply surface coatings, as 
defined in Sec. 63.11180, are trained in the proper application of 
surface coatings as required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The 
training program must include, at a minimum, the items listed in 
paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.
    (1) A list of all current personnel by name and job description who 
are required to be trained;
    (2) Hands-on and classroom instruction that addresses, at a minimum, 
initial and refresher training in the topics listed in paragraphs 
(f)(2)(i) through (2)(iv) of this section.
    (i) Spray gun equipment selection, set up, and operation, including 
measuring coating viscosity, selecting the proper fluid tip or nozzle, 
and achieving the proper spray pattern, air pressure and volume, and 
fluid delivery rate.
    (ii) Spray technique for different types of coatings to improve 
transfer efficiency and minimize coating usage and overspray, including 
maintaining the correct spray gun distance and angle to the part, using 
proper banding and overlap, and reducing lead and lag spraying at the 
beginning and end of each stroke.
    (iii) Routine spray booth and filter maintenance, including filter 
selection and installation.
    (iv) Environmental compliance with the requirements of this subpart.
    (3) A description of the methods to be used at the completion of 
initial or refresher training to demonstrate, document, and provide 
certification of successful completion of the required training. Owners 
and operators who can show by documentation or certification that a 
painter's work experience and/or training has resulted in training 
equivalent to the training required in paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
are not required to provide the initial training required by that 
paragraph to these painters.
    (g) As required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, all new and 
existing personnel at an affected motor vehicle and mobile equipment or 
miscellaneous surface coating source, including contract personnel, who 
spray apply surface coatings, as defined in Sec. 63.11180, must be 
trained by the dates specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this 
section. Employees who transfer within a company to a position as a 
painter are subject to the same requirements as a new hire.
    (1) If your source is a new source, all personnel must be trained

and the street address where compliance records are maintained, if 
different. If the source is a motor vehicle or mobile equipment surface 
coating operation that repairs vehicles at the customer's location, 
rather than at a fixed location, such as a collision repair shop, the 
notification should state this and indicate the physical location where 
records are kept to demonstrate compliance;
    (4) An identification of the relevant standard (i.e., this subpart, 
40 CFR part 63, subpart HHHHHH);
    (5) A brief description of the type of operation as specified in 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) For all surface coating operations, indicate whether the source 
is a motor vehicle and mobile equipment surface coating operation or a 
miscellaneous surface coating operation, and include the number of spray 
booths and preparation stations, and the number of painters usually 
employed at the operation.
    (ii) For paint stripping operations, identify the method(s) of paint 
stripping employed (e.g., chemical, mechanical) and the substrates 
stripped (e.g., wood, plastic, metal).
    (6) Each paint stripping operation must indicate whether they plan 
to annually use more than one ton of MeCl after the compliance date.
    (7) A statement of whether the source is already in compliance with 
each of the relevant requirements of this subpart, or whether the source 
will be brought into compliance by the compliance date. For paint 
stripping operations, the relevant requirements that you must evaluate 
in making this determination are specified in Sec. 63.11173(a) through 
(d) of this subpart. For surface coating operations, the relevant 
requirements are specified in Sec. 63.11173(e) through (g) of this 
subpart.
    (8) If your source is a new source, you must certify in the initial 
notification whether the source is in compliance with each of the 
requirements of this subpart. If your source is an existing source, you 
may certify in the initial notification that the source is already in 
compliance. If you are certifying in the initial notification that the 
source is in compliance with the relevant requirements of this subpart, 
then include also a statement by a responsible official with that 
official's name, title, phone number, e-mail address (if available) and 
signature, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the 
notification, a statement that the source has complied with all the 
relevant standards of this subpart, and that this initial notification 
also serves as the notification of compliance status.
    (b) Notification of Compliance Status. If you are the owner or

as part of the initial notification, and your compliance status has not 
since changed. If you are the owner or operator of any existing source 
and did not certify in the initial notification that your source is 
already in compliance as

[[Page 338]]

specified in paragraph (a) of this section, then you must submit a 
notification of compliance status. You must submit a Notification of 
Compliance Status on or before March 11, 2011. You are required to 
submit the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of 
this section with your Notification of Compliance Status:
    (1) Your company's name and the street address (physical location) 
of the affected source and the street address where compliance records 
are maintained, if different.
    (2) The name, title, address, telephone, e-mail address (if 
available) and signature of the owner and operator, or other certifying 
company official, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of 
the notification and a statement of whether the source has complied with 
all the relevant standards and other requirements of this subpart or an 
explanation of any noncompliance and a description of corrective actions 
being taken to achieve compliance. For paint stripping operations, the 
relevant requirements that you must evaluate in making this 
determination are specified in Sec. 63.11173(a) through (d). For

preparation materials.
    (5) In-mold coatings that are spray-applied in the manufacture of 
reinforced plastic composite parts.
    Compliance date means the date by which you must comply with this 
subpart.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source, subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source fails to meet any 
requirement or obligation established by this subpart.

of any surface coating as part of janitorial activities. Facility 
maintenance includes the application of coatings to stationary 
structures or their appurtenances at the site of installation, to 
portable buildings at the site of installation, to pavements, or to 
curbs. Facility maintenance also includes the refinishing of mobile 
equipment in the field or at the site where they are used in service and 
at which they are intended to remain indefinitely after refinishing. 
Such mobile equipment includes, but is not limited to, farm equipment 
and mining equipment for which it is not practical or feasible to move 
to a dedicated mobile equipment refinishing facility. Such mobile 
equipment also includes items, such as fork trucks, that are used in a 
manufacturing facility and which are refinished in that same facility. 
Facility maintenance does not include surface coating of motor vehicles,

applied to a given part. A surface coating operation includes all other 
steps (such as surface preparation with solvent and equipment cleaning) 
in the affected source where HAP are emitted from the coating of a part. 
The use of solvent to clean parts (for example, to remove grease during 
a mechanical repair) does not constitute a miscellaneous surface coating 
operation if no coatings are applied. A single affected source may have 
multiple surface coating operations. Surface coatings applied to wood, 
leather, rubber, ceramics, stone, masonry, or substrates other than 
metal and plastic are not considered miscellaneous surface coating 
operations for the purposes of this subpart.

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11205  What are my general requirements for complying with this 

subpart?

    (a) At all times you must operate and maintain any affected source, 
including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring 
equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution 
control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize 
emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce 
emissions if levels required by this standard have been achieved. 
Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are 
being used will be based on information available to the Administrator 
that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of 
operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and 
maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
    (b) You can demonstrate compliance with any applicable mercury 
emission limit using fuel analysis if the emission rate calculated 
according to Sec. 63.11211(c) is less than the applicable emission 
limit. Otherwise, you must demonstrate compliance using stack testing.
    (c) If you demonstrate compliance with any applicable emission limit 
through performance stack testing and subsequent compliance with 
operating limits (including the use of continuous parameter monitoring 
system), with a CEMS, or with a COMS, you must develop a site-specific 
monitoring plan according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (3) of this section for the use of any CEMS, COMS, or continuous 
parameter monitoring system. This requirement also applies to you if you 
petition the EPA Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters 
under Sec. 63.8(f).
    (1) For each continuous monitoring system required in this section 
(including CEMS, COMS, or continuous parameter monitoring system), you 
must develop, and submit to the delegated authority for approval upon 
request, a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (vi)

[[Page 348]]

of this section. You must submit this site-specific monitoring plan, if 
requested, at least 60 days before your initial performance evaluation 
of your CMS. This requirement to develop and submit a site specific 
monitoring plan does not apply to affected sources with existing 
monitoring plans that apply to CEMS and COMS prepared under appendix B 
to part 60 of this chapter and which meet the requirements of Sec. 
63.11224.
    (i) Installation of the continuous monitoring system sampling probe 
or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected 
process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of 
the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control 
device);
    (ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample 
interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, 
and the data collection and reduction systems; and
    (iii) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria 
(e.g., calibrations).
    (iv) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with 
the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(c)(1)(ii), (c)(3), and 
(c)(4)(ii);
    (v) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the 
general requirements of Sec. 63.8(d); and
    (vi) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance 
with the general requirements of Sec. 63.10(c) (as applicable in Table 
8 to this subpart), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).
    (2) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CMS in 
accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.
    (3) You must operate and maintain the CMS in continuous operation 
according to the site-specific monitoring plan.

                     Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11210  What are my initial compliance requirements and by what date 

must I conduct them?

    (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emission limit 
specified in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you by either 
conducting performance (stack) tests, as applicable, according to Sec. 
63.11212 and Table 4 to this subpart or, for mercury, conducting fuel 
analyses, as applicable, according to Sec. 63.11213 and Table 5 to this 
subpart.
    (b) For existing affected boilers that have applicable emission 
limits, you must demonstrate initial compliance no later than 180 days 
after the compliance date that is specified in Sec. 63.11196 and 
according to the applicable provisions in Sec. 63.7(a)(2).
    (c) For existing affected boilers that have applicable work practice 
standards, management practices, or emission reduction measures, you 
must demonstrate initial compliance no later than the compliance date 
that is specified in Sec. 63.11196 and according to the applicable 
provisions in Sec. 63.7(a)(2).
    (d) For new or reconstructed affected sources, you must demonstrate 
initial compliance no later than 180 calendar days after March 21, 2011 
or within 180 calendar days after startup of the source, whichever is 
later, according to Sec. 63.7(a)(2)(ix).
    (e) For affected boilers that ceased burning solid waste consistent 
with Sec. 63.11196(d), you must demonstrate compliance within 60 days 
of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. If you have not 
conducted your compliance demonstration for this subpart within the 
previous 12 months, you must complete all compliance demonstrations 
before you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11211  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission 

limits?

    (a) For affected boilers that demonstrate compliance with any of the 
emission limits of this subpart through performance (stack) testing, 
your initial compliance requirements include conducting performance 
tests according to Sec. 63.11212 and Table 4 to this subpart, 
conducting a fuel analysis for each type of fuel burned in your boiler 
according to Sec. 63.11213 and Table 5 to this subpart, establishing 
operating limits according to Sec. 63.11222, Table 6 to this subpart 
and paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable, and conducting 
continuous monitoring system (CMS) performance evaluations according to 
Sec. 63.11224. For affected boilers that burn a single type of fuel, 
you are exempted

[[Page 349]]

from the compliance requirements of conducting a fuel analysis for each 
type of fuel burned in your boiler. For purposes of this subpart, 
boilers that use a supplemental fuel only for startup, unit shutdown, 
and transient flame stability purposes still qualify as affected boilers 
that burn a single type of fuel, and the supplemental fuel is not 
subject to the fuel analysis requirements under Sec. 63.11213 and Table 
5 to this subpart.
    (b) You must establish parameter operating limits according to 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) For a wet scrubber, you must establish the minimum liquid 
flowrate and pressure drop as defined in Sec. 63.11237, as your 
operating limits during the three-run performance stack test. If you use 
a wet scrubber and you conduct separate performance stack tests for 
particulate matter and mercury emissions, you must establish one set of 
minimum scrubber liquid flowrate and pressure drop operating limits. If 
you conduct multiple performance stack tests, you must set the minimum 
liquid flowrate and pressure drop operating limits at the highest 
minimum values established during the performance stack tests.
    (2) For an electrostatic precipitator operated with a wet scrubber, 
you must establish the minimum voltage and secondary amperage (or total 
electric power input), as defined in Sec. 63.11237, as your operating 
limits during the three-run performance stack test. (These operating 
limits do not apply to electrostatic precipitators that are operated as 
dry controls without a wet scrubber.)
    (3) For activated carbon injection, you must establish the minimum 
activated carbon injection rate, as defined in Sec. 63.11237, as your 
operating limit during the three-run performance stack test.
    (4) The operating limit for boilers with fabric filters that 
demonstrate continuous compliance through bag leak detection systems is 
that a bag leak detection system be installed according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.11224, and that each fabric filter must be 
operated such that the bag leak detection system alarm does not sound 
more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period.
    (c) If you elect to demonstrate compliance with an applicable 
mercury emission limit through fuel analysis, you must conduct fuel 
analyses according to Sec. 63.11213 and Table 5 to this subpart and 
follow the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) If you burn more than one fuel type, you must determine the fuel 
type, or mixture, you could burn in your boiler that would result in the 
maximum emission rates of mercury.
    (2) You must determine the 90th percentile confidence level fuel 
mercury concentration of the composite samples analyzed for each fuel 
type using Equation 1 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21MR11.021

    Where:

P<INF>90</INF> = 90th percentile confidence level mercury concentration, 
in pounds per million Btu.
mean = Arithmetic average of the fuel mercury concentration in the fuel 
samples analyzed according to Sec. 63.11213, in units of pounds per 
million Btu.
SD = Standard deviation of the mercury concentration in the fuel samples 
analyzed according to Sec. 63.11213, in units of pounds per million 
Btu.
t = t distribution critical value for 90th percentile (0.1) probability 
for the appropriate degrees of freedom (number of samples minus one) as 
obtained from a Distribution Critical Value Table.

    (3) To demonstrate compliance with the applicable mercury emission 
limit, the emission rate that you calculate for your boiler using 
Equation 1 of this section must be less than the applicable mercury 
emission limit.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11212  What stack tests and procedures must I use for the performance 

tests?

    (a) You must conduct all performance tests according to Sec. 
63.7(c), (d), (f),

[[Page 350]]

and (h). You must also develop a site-specific test plan according to 
the requirements in Sec. 63.7(c).
    (b) You must conduct each stack test according to the requirements 
in Table 4 to this subpart.
    (c) You must conduct performance stack tests at the representative 
operating load conditions while burning the type of fuel or mixture of 
fuels that have the highest emissions potential for each regulated 
pollutant, and you must demonstrate initial compliance and establish 
your operating limits based on these performance stack tests. For 
subcategories with more than one emission limit, these requirements 
could result in the need to conduct more than one performance stack 
test. Following each performance stack test and until the next 
performance stack test, you must comply with the operating limit for 
operating load conditions specified in Table 3 to this subpart.
    (d) You must conduct a minimum of three separate test runs for each 
performance stack test required in this section, as specified in Sec. 
63.7(e)(3) and in accordance with the provisions in Table 4 to this 
subpart.
    (e) To determine compliance with the emission limits, you must use 
the F-Factor methodology and equations in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of EPA 
Method 19 of appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter to convert the 
measured particulate matter concentrations and the measured mercury 
concentrations that result from the initial performance test to pounds 
per million Btu heat input emission rates.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11213  What fuel analyses and procedures must I use for the 

performance tests?

    (a) You must conduct fuel analyses according to the procedures in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and Table 5 to this subpart, as 
applicable. You are not required to conduct fuel analyses for fuels used 
for only startup, unit shutdown, and transient flame stability purposes. 
You are required to conduct fuel analyses only for fuels and units that 
are subject to emission limits for mercury in Table 1 of this subpart.
    (b) At a minimum, you must obtain three composite fuel samples for 
each fuel type according to the procedures in Table 5 to this subpart. 
Each composite sample must consist of a minimum of three samples 
collected at approximately equal intervals during a test run period.
    (c) Determine the concentration of mercury in the fuel in units of 
pounds per million Btu of each composite sample for each fuel type 
according to the procedures in Table 5 to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11214  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the work practice 

standard, emission reduction measures, and management practice?

    (a) If you own or operate an existing or new coal-fired boiler with 
a heat input capacity of less than 10 million Btu per hour, you must 
conduct a performance tune-up according to Sec. 63.11223(b) and you 
must submit a signed statement in the Notification of Compliance Status 
report that indicates that you conducted a tune-up of the boiler.
    (b) If you own or operate an existing or new biomass-fired boiler or 
an existing or new oil-fired boiler, you must conduct a performance 
tune-up according to Sec. 63.11223(b) and you must submit a signed 
statement in the Notification of Compliance Status report that indicates 
that you conducted a tune-up of the boiler.
    (c) If you own or operate an existing affected boiler with a heat 
input capacity of 10 million Btu per hour or greater, you must submit a 
signed certification in the Notification of Compliance Status report 
that an energy assessment of the boiler and its energy use systems was 
completed and submit, upon request, the energy assessment report.
    (d) If you own or operate a boiler subject to emission limits in 
Table 1 of this subpart, you must minimize the boiler's startup and 
shutdown periods following the manufacturer's recommended procedures, if 
available. If manufacturer's recommended procedures are not available, 
you must follow recommended procedures for a unit of similar design for 
which manufacturer's recommended procedures are available. You must 
submit a signed

[[Page 351]]

statement in the Notification of Compliance Status report that indicates 
that you conducted startups and shutdowns according to the 
manufacturer's recommended procedures or procedures specified for a 
boiler of similar design if manufacturer's recommended procedures are 
not available.

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11220  When must I conduct subsequent performance tests?

    (a) If your boiler has a heat input capacity of 10 million Btu per 
hour or greater, you must conduct all applicable performance (stack) 
tests according to Sec. 63.11212 on an triennial basis, unless you 
follow the requirements listed in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section. Triennial performance tests must be completed no more than 37 
months after the previous performance test, unless you follow the 
requirements listed in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) You can conduct performance stack tests less often for 
particulate matter or mercury if your performance stack tests for the 
pollutant for at least 3 consecutive years show that your emissions are 
at or below 75 percent of the emission limit, and if there are no 
changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control 
equipment that could increase emissions. In this case, you do not have 
to conduct a performance stack test for that pollutant for the next 2 
years. You must conduct a performance stack test during the third year 
and no more than 37 months after the previous performance stack test.
    (c) If your boiler continues to meet the emission limit for 
particulate matter or mercury, you may choose to conduct performance 
stack tests for the pollutant every third year if your emissions are at 
or below 75 percent of the emission limit, and if there are no changes 
in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control 
equipment that could increase emissions, but each such performance stack 
test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous 
performance test.
    (d) If you have an applicable CO emission limit, you must conduct 
triennial performance tests for CO according to Sec. 63.11212. Each 
triennial performance test must be conducted between no more than 37 
months after the previous performance test.
    (e) If you demonstrate compliance with the mercury emission limit 
based on fuel analysis, you must conduct a fuel analysis according to 
Sec. 63.11213 for each type of fuel burned monthly. If you plan to burn 
a new type of fuel or fuel mixture, you must conduct a fuel analysis 
before burning the new type of fuel or mixture in your boiler. You must 
recalculate the mercury emission rate using Equation 1 of Sec. 
63.11211. The recalculated mercury emission rate must be less than the 
applicable emission limit.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11221  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous 

compliance?

    (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
    (b) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all 
required intervals at all times the affected source is operating except 
for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, 
repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control 
periods (see section 63.8(c)(7) of this part), and required monitoring 
system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments. A 
monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably 
preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. 
Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance 
or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to effect 
monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions 
or out-of-control periods and to return the monitoring system to 
operation as expeditiously as practicable.
    (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system 
malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with 
monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, or required 
monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in 
calculations used to report emissions or

[[Page 352]]

operating levels. You must use all the data collected during all other 
periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated 
control system.
    (d) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-
control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions 
or out-of-control periods, and required monitoring system quality 
assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, 
calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments, failure to 
collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11222  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 

limits?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission 
limit and operating limit in Tables 1 and 3 to this subpart that applies 
to you according to the methods specified in Table 7 to this subpart and 
to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) Following the date on which the initial compliance demonstration 
is completed or is required to be completed under Sec. Sec. 63.7 and 
63.11196, whichever date comes first, you must continuously monitor the 
operating parameters. Operation above the established maximum, below the 
established minimum, or outside the allowable range of the operating 
limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a 
deviation from your operating limits established under this subpart, 
except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with 
the emission and operating limits or to establish new operating limits. 
Operating limits are confirmed or reestablished during performance 
tests.
    (2) If you have an applicable mercury or PM emission limit, you must 
keep records of the type and amount of all fuels burned in each boiler 
during the reporting period to demonstrate that all fuel types and 
mixtures of fuels burned would result in lower emissions of mercury than 
the applicable emission limit (if you demonstrate compliance through 
fuel analysis), or result in lower fuel input of mercury than the 
maximum values calculated during the last performance stack test (if you 
demonstrate compliance through performance stack testing).
    (3) If you have an applicable mercury emission limit and you plan to 
burn a new type of fuel, you must determine the mercury concentration 
for any new fuel type in units of pounds per million Btu, using the 
procedures in Equation 1 of Sec. 63.11211 based on supplier data or 
your own fuel analysis, and meet the requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) The recalculated mercury emission rate must be less than the 
applicable emission limit.
    (ii) If the mercury concentration is higher than mercury fuel input 
during the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new 
performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel 
mixture according to the procedures in Sec. 63.11212 to demonstrate 
that the mercury emissions do not exceed the emission limit.
    (4) If your unit is controlled with a fabric filter, and you 
demonstrate continuous compliance using a bag leak detection system, you 
must initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection 
system alarm and operate and maintain the fabric filter system such that 
the alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time 
during a 6-month period. You must also keep records of the date, time, 
and duration of each alarm, the time corrective action was initiated and 
completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alarm and the 
corrective action taken. You must also record the percent of the 
operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds. In 
calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric 
filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time 
is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a 
minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective 
action, the alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to 
initiate corrective action.
    (b) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each 
emission limit and operating limit in Tables 1 and 3 to this subpart 
that apply to you. These instances are deviations from the emission 
limits in this subpart.

[[Page 353]]

These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in Sec. 
63.11225.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11223  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the work 

practice and management practice standards?

    (a) For affected sources subject to the work practice standard or 
the management practices of a tune-up, you must conduct a biennial 
performance tune-up according to paragraphs (b) of this section and keep 
records as required in Sec. 63.11225(c) to demonstrate continuous 
compliance. Each biennial tune-up must be conducted no more than 25 
months after the previous tune-up.
    (b) You must conduct a tune-up of the boiler biennially to 
demonstrate continuous compliance as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (7) of this section.
    (1) As applicable, inspect the burner, and clean or replace any 
components of the burner as necessary (you may delay the burner 
inspection until the next scheduled unit shutdown, but you must inspect 
each burner at least once every 36 months).
    (2) Inspect the flame pattern, as applicable, and adjust the burner 
as necessary to optimize the flame pattern. The adjustment should be 
consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, if available.
    (3) Inspect the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio, as 
applicable, and ensure that it is correctly calibrated and functioning 
properly.
    (4) Optimize total emissions of carbon monoxide. This optimization 
should be consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, if 
available.
    (5) Measure the concentrations in the effluent stream of carbon 
monoxide in parts per million, by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, 
before and after the adjustments are made (measurements may be either on 
a dry or wet basis, as long as it is the same basis before and after the 
adjustments are made).
    (6) Maintain onsite and submit, if requested by the Administrator, 
biennial report containing the information in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) 
through (iii) of this section.
    (i) The concentrations of CO in the effluent stream in parts per 
million, by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, measured before and 
after the tune-up of the boiler.
    (ii) A description of any corrective actions taken as a part of the 
tune-up of the boiler.
    (iii) The type and amount of fuel used over the 12 months prior to 
the biennial tune-up of the boiler.
    (7) If the unit is not operating on the required date for a tune-up, 
the tune-up must be conducted within one week of startup.
    (c) If you own or operate an existing or new coal-fired boiler with 
a heat input capacity of 10 million Btu per hour or greater, you must 
minimize the boiler's time spent during startup and shutdown following 
the manufacturer's recommended procedures and you must submit a signed 
statement in the Notification of Compliance Status report that indicates 
that you conducted startups and shutdowns according to the 
manufacturer's recommended procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11224  What are my monitoring, installation, operation, and 

maintenance requirements?

    (a) If your boiler is subject to a carbon monoxide emission limit in 
Table 1 to this subpart, you must install, operate, and maintain a 
continuous oxygen monitor according to the procedures in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (6) of this section by the compliance date specified in 
Sec. 63.11196. The oxygen level shall be monitored at the outlet of the 
boiler.
    (1) Each monitor must be installed, operated, and maintained 
according to the applicable procedures under Performance Specification 3 
at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and according to the site-specific 
monitoring plan developed according to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according 
to the requirements in Sec. 63.8(e) and according to Performance 
Specification 3 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
    (3) Each CEMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation 
(sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute 
period.

[[Page 354]]

    (4) The CEMS data must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2).
    (5) You must calculate and record the 12-hour block average 
concentrations.
    (6) For purposes of calculating data averages, you must use all the 
data collected during all periods in assessing compliance, excluding 
data collected during periods when the monitoring system malfunctions or 
is out of control, during associated repairs, and during required 
quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, 
calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments). Monitoring 
failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless 
operation are not malfunctions. Any period for which the monitoring 
system malfunctions or is out of control and data are not available for 
a required calculation constitutes a deviation from the monitoring 
requirements. Periods when data are unavailable because of required 
quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, 
calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments) do not 
constitute monitoring deviations.
    (b) If you are using a control device to comply with the emission 
limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must maintain each 
operating limit in Table 3 to this subpart that applies to your boiler 
as specified in Table 7 to this subpart. If you use a control device not 
covered in Table 3 to this subpart, or you wish to establish and monitor 
an alternative operating limit and alternative monitoring parameters, 
you must apply to the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under Sec. 
63.8(f).
    (c) If you demonstrate compliance with any applicable emission limit 
through stack testing and subsequent compliance with operating limits, 
you must develop a site-specific monitoring plan according to the 
requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. This 
requirement also applies to you if you petition the EPA Administrator 
for alternative monitoring parameters under Sec. 63.8(f).
    (1) For each continuous monitoring system (CMS) required in this 
section, you must develop, and submit to the EPA Administrator for 
approval upon request, a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. You must submit this 
site-specific monitoring plan (if requested) at least 60 days before 
your initial performance evaluation of your CMS.
    (i) Installation of the CMS sampling probe or other interface at a 
measurement location relative to each affected unit such that the 
measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., 
on or downstream of the last control device).
    (ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample 
interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, 
and the data collection and reduction systems.
    (iii) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria 
(e.g., calibrations).
    (2) In your site-specific monitoring plan, you must also address 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with 
the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(c)(1), (3), and (4)(ii).
    (ii) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with 
the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(d).
    (iii) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance 
with the general requirements of Sec. 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).
    (3) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CMS in 
accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.
    (4) You must operate and maintain the CMS in continuous operation 
according to the site-specific monitoring plan.
    (d) If you have an operating limit that requires the use of a CMS, 
you must install, operate, and maintain each continuous parameter 
monitoring system according to the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) 
through (5) of this section.
    (1) The continuous parameter monitoring system must complete a 
minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. 
You must have a minimum of four successive cycles of operation to have a 
valid hour of data.

[[Page 355]]

    (2) Except for monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must conduct all monitoring in continuous operation at all times 
that the unit is operating. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, 
infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring to 
provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor 
maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
    (3) For purposes of calculating data averages, you must not use data 
recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out of 
control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities. 
You must use all the data collected during all other periods in 
assessing compliance. Any period for which the monitoring system is out-
of-control and data are not available for a required calculation 
constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
    (4) Determine the 12-hour block average of all recorded readings, 
except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (5) Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and 
validation check.

rule, you must install, operate, certify and maintain each continuous 
opacity monitoring system (COMS) according to the procedures in 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (7) of this section by the compliance date 
specified in Sec. 63.11196.
    (1) Each COMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according 
to Performance Specification 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
    (2) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each COMS according 
to the requirements in Sec. 63.8 and according to Performance 
Specification 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
    (3) As specified in Sec. 63.8(c)(4)(i), each COMS must complete a 
minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-
second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-
minute period.
    (4) The COMS data must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2).
    (5) You must include in your site-specific monitoring plan 
procedures and acceptance criteria for operating and maintaining each 
COMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8(d). At a minimum, the 
monitoring plan must include a daily calibration drift assessment, a 
quarterly performance audit, and an annual zero alignment audit of each 
COMS.
    (6) You must operate and maintain each COMS according to the 
requirements in the monitoring plan and the requirements of Sec. 
63.8(e). Identify periods the COMS is out of control including any 
periods that the COMS fails to pass a daily calibration drift 
assessment, a quarterly performance audit, or an annual zero alignment 
audit.
    (7) You must determine and record all the 1-hour block averages 
collected for periods during which the COMS is not out of control.
    (f) If you use a fabric filter bag leak detection system to comply 
with the requirements of this subpart, you must install, calibrate, 
maintain, and continuously operate the bag leak detection system as 
specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this section.
    (1) You must install and operate a bag leak detection system for 
each exhaust stack of the fabric filter.
    (2) Each bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, 
calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the 
manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations and in 
accordance with EPA-454/R-98-015 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
63.14).
    (3) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at 
concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter or less.
    (4) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative or absolute particulate matter loadings.
    (5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to 
continuously record the output signal from the sensor.
    (6) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an audible 
or visual alarm system that will activate automatically when an increase 
in relative particulate matter emissions

[[Page 356]]

over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is 
easily heard or seen by plant operating personnel.
    (7) For positive pressure fabric filter systems that do not duct all 
compartments of cells to a common stack, a bag leak detection system 
must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.
    (8) Where multiple bag leak detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11225  What are my notification, reporting, and recordkeeping

Sec. 63.11226  How can I assert an affirmative defense if I exceed an emission 

limit during a malfunction?

    In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in 
paragraph Sec. 63.11201 you may assert an affirmative defense to a 
claim for civil penalties for exceedances of numerical emission limits 
that are caused by malfunction, as defined at Sec. 63.2. Appropriate 
penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of 
proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The 
affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive 
relief.
    (a) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce 
such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in 
paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of 
evidence that:
    (1) The excess emissions:
    (i) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of 
air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a 
process to operate in a normal or usual manner, and
    (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper 
design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
    (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been 
foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
    (iv) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate 
design, operation, or maintenance; and
    (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the 
applicable

[[Page 359]]

emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor 
were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
    (3) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions 
(including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable 
during periods of such emissions; and
    (4) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control 
equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss 
of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
    (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the 
excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human 
health; and
    (6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in 
operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air 
pollution control practices; and
    (7) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were 
documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
    (8) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent 
with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
    (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of 
which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the 
malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction 
event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring 
methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that 
were the result of the malfunction.
    (b) Notification. The owner or operator of the facility experiencing 
an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify 
the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon 
as possible, but no later than two business days after the initial 
occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an 
affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner 
or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a 
written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial 
occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in Sec. 63.11201 to 
demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has 
met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 
additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator 
before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an 
extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator 
is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of 
the initial occurrence of the exceedance.

Sec. 63.11398  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Acrylic fiber means a manufactured synthetic fiber in which the 
fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of 
at least 85 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units.
    Acrylic and modacrylic fibers production means the production of 
either of the following synthetic fibers composed of acrylonitrile 
units: acrylic fiber or modacrylic fiber.
    Acrylonitrile solution polymerization means a process where 
acrylonitrile and comonomers are dissolved in a solvent to form a 
polymer solution (typically polyacrylonitrile). The polyacrylonitrile is 
soluble in the solvent. In contrast to suspension polymerization, the 
resulting reactor polymer solution (spin dope) is filtered and pumped 
directly to the fiber spinning process.
    Acrylonitrile suspension polymerization means a polymerization 
process where small drops of acrylonitrile and comonomers are suspended 
in water in the presence of a catalyst where they polymerize under 
agitation. Solid beads of polymer are formed in this suspension reaction 
which are subsequently filtered, washed, refiltered, and dried. The 
beads must be subsequently redissolved in a solvent to create a spin 
dope prior to introduction to the fiber spinning process.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or 
management practice;
    (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement 
an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the 
operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a 
permit; or
    (3) Fails to meet any emissions limitation or management practice in 
this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of 
whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.
    Equipment means each of the following that is subject to this 
subpart: pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling 
collection system, open-ended valve or line, valve connector, 
instrumentation system in organic HAP service which contains or contacts 
greater than 10 percent by weight of acrylonitrile and operates more 
than 300 hours per year.
    Fiber spinning line means the group of equipment and process vents 
associated with acrylic or modacrylic fiber spinning operations. The 
fiber spinning line includes (as applicable to the type of spinning 
process used) the blending and dissolving tanks, spinning solution 
filters, wet spinning units, spin bath tanks, and the equipment used 
downstream of the spin bath to wash, dry, or draw the spun fiber.
    Maintenance wastewater means wastewater generated by the draining of 
process fluid from components in the process unit, whose primary product 
is a product produced by a source category subject to this subpart, into 
an individual drain system prior to or during maintenance activities. 
Maintenance wastewater can be generated during planned and unplanned 
shutdowns and during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of 
activities that can generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling 
of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, 
draining of low legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an 
individual drain system, and draining of portions of the process unit, 
whose primary product is a product produced by a source category subject 
to this subpart, for repair.
    Modacrylic fiber means a manufactured synthetic fiber in which the 
fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of 
at least 35 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units but less than 85 
percent by weight of acrylonitrile units.
    Monomer recovery process equipment means the collection of process 
units and associated process equipment used to reclaim the monomer for 
subsequent reuse, including but not limited to polymer holding tanks, 
polymer buffer tanks, monomer vacuum pump flush

[[Page 375]]

drum, and drum filter vacuum pump flush drum.
    Polymerization process equipment means the collection of process 
units and associated process equipment used in the acrylonitrile 
polymerization process prior to the fiber spinning line, including but 
not limited to acrylonitrile storage tanks, recovered monomer tanks, 
monomer measuring tanks, monomer preparation tanks, monomer feed tanks, 
slurry receiver tanks, polymerization reactors, and drum filters.
    Process vent means the point of discharge to the atmosphere (or 
point of entry into a control device, if any) of a gas stream from the 
acrylic and modacrylic fibers production process.
    Process wastewater means wastewater, which during manufacturing or 
processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the 
production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished 
product, by-product, or waste product.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined at 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Spin dope means the liquid mixture of polymer and solvent that is 
fed to the spinneret to form the acrylic and modacrylic fibers.

    (a) If you use a pressure treatment process with any wood 
preservative containing chromium, arsenic, dioxins, or methylene 
chloride at a new or existing area source, the preservative must be 
applied to the wood product inside a retort or similarly enclosed 
vessel.
    (b) If you use a thermal treatment process with any wood 
preservative containing chromium, arsenic, dioxins, or methylene 
chloride at a new or existing area source, the preservative must be 
applied using process treatment tanks equipped with an air scavenging 
system to control emissions.
    (c) If you use any wood preservative containing chromium, arsenic, 
dioxins, or methylene chloride at a new or existing area source, you 
must prepare and operate according to a management practice plan to 
minimize air emissions from the preservative treatment of wood at a new 
or existing area source. You may use your standard operating procedures 
to meet the requirements for a management practice plan if it includes 
the minimum activities required for a management practice plan. The 
management practice plan must include, but is not limited to, the 
following activities:
    (1) Minimize preservative usage;
    (2) Maintain records on the type of treatment process and types and 
amounts of wood preservatives used at the facility;

[[Page 396]]

    (3) For the pressure treatment process, maintain charge records 
identifying pressure reading(s) inside the retorts (or similarly 
enclosed vessel);
    (4) For the thermal treatment process, maintain records that the air 
scavenging system is in place and operated properly during the treatment 
process;
    (5) Store treated wood product on drip pads or in a primary 
containment area to convey preservative drippage to a collection system 
until drippage has ceased;
    (6) For the pressure treatment process, fully drain the retort to 
the extent practicable, prior to opening the retort door;
    (7) Promptly collect any spills; and
    (8) Perform relevant corrective actions or preventative measures in 
the event of a malfunction before resuming operations.

methylene chloride, you must comply with the requirements of the General 
Provisions in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, according to Table 1 to this 
subpart.
    (b) If you own or operate a new or existing affected source that 
uses any wood preservative containing chromium, arsenic, dioxins, or 
methylene chloride, you must submit an initial notification of 
applicability required by Sec. 63.9(b)(2) no later than 90 days after 
the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.11429. The initial 
notification may be combined with the notification of compliance status 
required in paragraph (c) of this section. The notification of 
applicability must include the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the owner or operator;
    (2) The address (i.e., physical location) of the affected source; 
and
    (3) An identification of the relevant standard, or other 
requirement, that is the basis of the notification and the source's 
compliance date.
    (c) If you own or operate a new or existing affected source that 
uses any wood preservative containing chromium, arsenic, dioxins, or 
methylene chloride, you must submit a notification of compliance status 
required by Sec. 63.9(h) no later than 90 days after the applicable 
compliance date specified in Sec. 63.11429. Your notification of 
compliance status must include this certification of compliance, signed 
by a responsible official, for the standards in Sec. 63.11430: ``This 
facility complies with the management practices to minimize air 
emissions from the preservative treatment of wood in accordance with 
Sec. 63.11430.''

                  Standards and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11495  What are the management practices and other requirements?

    (a) Management practices. If you have a CMPU subject to this 
subpart, you must comply with paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this 
section.
    (1) Each process vessel in organic HAP service or metal HAP service 
must be equipped with a cover or lid that must be in place at all times 
when the vessel contains HAP, except for material addition and sampling.
    (2) You must use any of the methods listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) 
through (iv) of this section to control total organic HAP emissions from 
transfer of liquids containing Table 1 organic HAP to tank trucks or 
railcars. You are not required to comply with this paragraph (a)(2) if 
you have notified the Administrator in your initial notification that a 
material is reactive or resinous, and you will not be able to comply 
with any of the methods in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this 
section for the transfer of such material.
    (i) Use submerged loading or bottom loading.
    (ii) Route emissions to a fuel gas system or process in accordance 
with Sec. 63.982(d) of subpart SS.
    (iii) Vapor balance back to the storage tank or another storage tank 
connected by a common header.
    (iv) Vent through a closed-vent system to a control device.
    (3) You must conduct inspections of process vessels and equipment 
for each CMPU in organic HAP service or metal HAP service at least 
quarterly to demonstrate compliance with these requirements and to 
determine that the process vessels and equipment are sound and free of 
leaks. For these inspections, detection methods incorporating sight, 
sound, or smell are acceptable. The inspection must include direct and 
proximal (thorough) inspection of all areas of potential leak within the 
CMPU. Indications of a leak identified using such method constitutes a 
leak unless you demonstrate that the indications of a leak are due to a 
condition other than loss of HAP. Alternatively, Method 21 of 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A-7, with a leak definition of 500 parts per million 
by volume (ppmv), may be used for detection of leaks or to determine if 
the indications of a leak are due to a condition other than loss of HAP. 
If indications of a leak are determined not to be HAP in one quarterly 
monitoring period, you must still perform the inspection and 
demonstration in the next quarterly monitoring period. Inspections must 
be conducted while the subject CMPU is operating. No inspection is 
required in a calendar quarter during which the subject CMPU does not 
operate for the entire calendar quarter and is not in organic HAP 
service or metal HAP service. If the CMPU operates at all during a 
calendar quarter, an inspection is required.
    (4) You must repair any leak within 15 calendar days after detection 
of the leak, or document the reason for any delay of repair. For the 
purposes of this paragraph (a)(4), a leak will be considered 
``repaired'' if a condition specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i), (ii), or 
(iii) of this section is met.
    (i) The visual, audible, olfactory, or other indications of a leak 
to the atmosphere have been eliminated, or
    (ii) No bubbles are observed at potential leak sites during a leak 
check using soap solution, or
    (iii) The system will hold a test pressure.
    (5) You must keep records of the dates and results of each 
inspection event, the dates of equipment repairs, and, if applicable, 
the reasons for any delay in repair.
    (b) Small heat exchange systems. For each heat exchange system 
subject to this subpart with a cooling water flow rate less than 8,000 
gallons per minute (gal/min) and not meeting one or more of the 
conditions in Sec. 63.104(a), you must comply with paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (3) of this section, or as an alternative, you may comply with 
any one of the requirements in Item 1.a or 1.b of Table 8 to this 
subpart.
    (1) You must develop and operate in accordance with a heat exchange 
system inspection plan. The plan must describe the inspections to be 
performed that will provide evidence of hydrocarbons in the cooling 
water. Among other things, inspections may include checks for visible 
floating hydrocarbon

[[Page 423]]

on the water, hydrocarbon odor, discolored water, and/or chemical 
addition rates. You must conduct inspections at least once per quarter, 
even if the previous inspection determined that the indications of a 
leak did not constitute a leak as defined by Sec. 63.104(b)(6).
    (2) You must perform repairs to eliminate the leak and any 
indications of a leak or demonstrate that the HAP concentration in the 
cooling water does not constitute a leak, as defined by Sec. 
63.104(b)(6), within 45 calendar days after indications of the leak are 
identified, or you must document the reason for any delay of repair in 
your next semiannual compliance report.
    (3) You must keep records of the dates and results of each 
inspection, documentation of any demonstrations that indications of a 
leak do not constitute a leak, the dates of leak repairs, and, if 
applicable, the reasons for any delay in repair.
    (c) Startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) provisions in subparts 
that are referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11496  What are the standards and compliance requirements for process 

vents?

    (a) Organic HAP emissions from batch process vents. You must comply 
with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section 
for organic HAP emissions from your batch process vents for each CMPU 
using Table 1 organic HAP. If uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from 
all batch process vents from a CMPU subject to this subpart are equal to 
or greater than 10,000 pounds per year (lb/yr), you must also comply 
with the emission limits and other requirements in Table 2 to this 
subpart.
    (1) You must determine the sum of actual organic HAP emissions from 
all of your batch process vents within a CMPU subject to this subpart 
using process knowledge, engineering assessment, or test data. Emissions 
for a standard batch in a process may be used to represent actual 
emissions from each batch in that process. You must maintain records of 
the calculations. Calculations of annual emissions are not required if 
you meet the emission standards for batch process vents in Table 2 to 
this subpart.
    (2) As an alternative to calculating actual emissions for each 
affected CMPU at your facility, you may elect to estimate emissions for 
each CMPU based on the emissions for the worst-case CMPU. The worst-case 
CMPU means the CMPU at the affected source with the highest organic HAP 
emissions per batch. The worst-case emissions per batch are used with 
the number of batches run for other affected CMPU. Process knowledge, 
engineering assessment, or test data may be used to identify the worst-
case process. You must keep records of the information and procedures 
used to identify the worst-case process.
    (3) If your current estimate is that emissions from batch process 
vents from a CMPU are less than 10,000 pounds per year (lb/yr), then you 
must keep a record of the number of batches of each process operated per 
month. Also, you must reevaluate your total emissions from batch process 
vents prior to making any process changes that affect emission 
calculations in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. If projected 
emissions increase to 10,000 lb/yr or more, you must be in compliance 
options for batch process vents in Table 2 to this subpart upon 
initiating operation under the new operating conditions. You must 
maintain records documenting the results of all updated emissions 
calculations.
    (4) As an alternative to determining the HAP emissions, you may 
elect to demonstrate that the amount of organic HAP used in the process 
is less than 10,000 lb/yr. You must keep monthly records of the organic 
HAP usage.
    (b) Organic HAP emissions from continuous process vents. You must 
comply with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this 
section for organic HAP emissions from your continuous process vents for 
each CMPU subject to this subpart using Table 1 organic HAP. If the 
total resource-effectiveness (TRE) index value for a continuous process 
vent is less than or equal to 1.0, you must also comply with the 
emission limits and other requirements in Table 3 to this subpart.

[[Page 424]]

    (1) You must determine the TRE index value according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.115(d), except as specified in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) You are not required to calculate the TRE index value if you 
control emissions in accordance with Table 3 to this subpart.
    (ii) Sections 63.115(d)(1)(i) and (ii) are not applicable for the 
purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii).
    (iii) You may assume the TRE for a vent stream is <ls-thn-eq> 1.0 if 
the amount of organic HAP emitted in the vent stream is less than 0.1 
pound per hour.
    (2) If the current TRE index value is greater than 1, you must 
recalculate the TRE index value before you make any process or 
operational change that affects parameters in the calculation. If the 
recalculated TRE is less than or equal to 1.0, then you must comply with 
one of the compliance options for continuous process vents in Table 3 to 
this subpart before operating under the new operating conditions. You 
must maintain records of all TRE calculations.
    (3) If a recovery device as defined in Sec. 63.11502 is used to 
maintain the TRE index value at a level greater than 1.0 and less than 
or equal to 4.0, you must comply with Sec. 63.982(e) and the 
requirements specified therein.
    (c) Combined streams. If you combine organic HAP emissions from 
batch process vents and continuous process vents, you must comply with 
the more stringent standard in Table 2 or Table 3 to this subpart that 
applies to any portion of the combined stream, or you must comply with 
Table 2 for the batch process vents and Table 3 for the continuous 
process vents. The TRE index value for continuous process vents and the 
annual emissions from batch process vents shall be determined for the 
individual streams before they are combined, and prior to any control, 
in order to determine the most stringent applicable requirements.
    (d) Combustion of halogenated streams. If you use a combustion 
device to comply with the emission limits for organic HAP from a 
halogenated batch process vent or a halogenated continuous process vent, 
you must use a halogen reduction device to meet the emission limit in 
either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section and in accordance with 
Sec. 63.994 and the requirements referenced therein.
    (1) Reduce overall emissions of hydrogen halide and halogen HAP 
after the combustion device by greater than or equal to 95 percent, to 
less than or equal to 0.45 kilograms per hour (kg/hr), or to a 
concentration less than or equal to 20 parts per million by volume 
(ppmv).
    (2) Reduce the halogen atom mass emission rate before the combustion 
device to less than or equal to 0.45 kg/hr or to a concentration less 
than or equal to 20 ppmv.
    (e) Alternative standard for organic HAP. Exceptions to the 
requirements for the alternative standard requirements specified in 
Tables 2 and 3 to this subpart and Sec. 63.2505 are specified in 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) When Sec. 63.2505 of subpart FFFF refers to Tables 1 and 2 to 
subpart FFFF and Sec. Sec. 63.2455 and 63.2460, it means Tables 2 and 3 
to this subpart and Sec. 63.11496(a) and (b).
    (2) Sections 63.2505(a)(2) and (b)(9) do not apply.
    (3) When Sec. 63.2505(b) references Sec. 63.2445 it means Sec. 
63.11494(f) through (h).
    (4) The requirements for hydrogen halide and halogen HAP apply only 
to hydrogen halide and halogen HAP generated in a combustion device that 
is used to comply with the alternative standard.
    (5) When Sec. 63.1258(b)(5)(ii)(B)(2) refers to a ``notification of 
process change'' report, it means the semi-annual compliance report 
required by Sec. 63.11501(d) for the purposes of this subpart.
    (f) Emissions from metal HAP process vents. You must comply with the 
requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section for metal HAP 
emissions from each CMPU using Table 1 metal HAP. If the collective 
uncontrolled metal HAP emissions from all metal HAP process vents from a 
CMPU are equal to or greater than 400 lb/yr, then you must also comply 
with the emission limits and other requirements in Table 4 to this 
subpart and in paragraph (f)(3), (4), or (5) of this section.

[[Page 425]]

    (1) You must determine the sum of metal HAP emissions from all metal 
HAP process vents within a CMPU subject to this subpart, except you are 
not required to determine the annual emissions if you control the metal 
HAP process vents within a CMPU in accordance with Table 4 to this 
subpart or if you determine your total metal HAP usage in the process 
unit is less than 400 lb/yr. To determine the mass emission rate you may 
use process knowledge, engineering assessment, or test data. You must 
keep records of the emissions calculations.
    (2) If your current estimate is that total uncontrolled metal HAP 
emissions from a CMPU subject to this subpart are less than 400 lb/yr, 
then you must keep records of either the number of batches operated per 
month (batch vents) or the process operating hours (continuous vents). 
Also, you must reevaluate your total emissions before you make any 
process or operational change that affects emissions of metal HAP. If 
projected emissions increase to 400 lb/yr or more, then you must be in 
compliance with one of the options for metal HAP process vents in Table 
4 to this subpart upon initiating operation under the new operating 
conditions. You must keep records of all recalculated emissions 
determinations.
    (3) If you have an existing source subject to the HAP metals 
emission limits specified in Table 4 to this subpart, you must comply 
with the initial compliance and monitoring requirements in paragraphs 
(f)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section. You must keep records of 
monitoring results to demonstrate continuous compliance.
    (i) You must prepare a monitoring plan containing the information in 
paragraphs (f)(3)(i)(A) through (E) of this section. The plan must be 
maintained on-site and be available on request. You must operate and 
maintain the control device according to a site-specific monitoring plan 
at all times.
    (A) A description of the device;
    (B) Results of a performance test or engineering assessment 
conducted in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section 
verifying the performance of the device for reducing HAP metals or 
particulate matter (PM) to the levels required by this subpart;
    (C) Operation and maintenance plan for the control device (including 
a preventative maintenance schedule consistent with the manufacturer's 
instructions for routine and long-term maintenance) and continuous 
monitoring system.
    (D) A list of operating parameters that will be monitored to 
maintain continuous compliance with the applicable emissions limits; and
    (E) Operating parameter limits based on either monitoring data 
collected during the performance test or established in the engineering 
assessment.
    (ii) You must conduct a performance test or an engineering 
assessment for each CMPU subject to a HAP metals emissions limit in 
Table 4 to this subpart and report the results in your Notification of 
Compliance Status (NOCS) report. If you own or operate an existing 
affected source, you are not required to conduct a performance test if a 
prior performance test was conducted within the 5 years prior to the 
effective date using the same methods specified in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) 
of this section and either no process changes have been made since the 
test, or if you can demonstrate that the results of the performance 
test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance 
despite process changes. For each performance test, sampling must be 
conducted at both the inlet and outlet of the control device, and the 
test must be conducted under representative process operating 
conditions.
    (iii) If you elect to conduct a performance test, it must be 
conducted according to requirements in Sec. 63.11410(j)(1). As an 
alternative to conducting a performance test using Method 5 or 5D to 
determine the concentration of PM, you may use Method 29 in 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A-8 to determine the concentration of HAP metals. You have 
demonstrated initial compliance if the overall reduction of either HAP 
metals or total PM is equal to or greater than 95 percent.
    (4) If you have a new source using a baghouse as a control device, 
you must install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection system on 
all baghouses used to comply with the HAP metals

[[Page 426]]

emissions limit in Table 4 to this subpart. You must comply with the 
testing, monitoring, and recordkeeping requirements in Sec. 
63.11410(g), (i), and (j)(1), except you are not required to submit the 
monitoring plan required by Sec. 63.11410(g)(2) for approval.
    (5) If you have a new source using a control device other than a 
baghouse to comply with the HAP metals emission limits in Table 4 to 
this subpart, you must comply with the initial compliance and monitoring 
requirements in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (g) Exceptions and alternatives to 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS. If

to the requirements specified in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS.
    (2) Design evaluation. To determine initial compliance with a 
percent reduction emission limit, you may elect to conduct a design 
evaluation as specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(1) instead of a performance 
test as specified in subpart SS of this part 63. You must establish the 
value(s) and basis for the operating limits as part of the design 
evaluation. For continuous process vents, the design evaluation must be 
conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the 
process, unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate 
operating conditions. For batch process vents, the design evaluation 
must be conducted under worst-case conditions, as specified in Sec. 
63.2460(c)(2).
    (3) Outlet concentration correction for combustion devices. When 
Sec. 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) requires you to correct the measured

paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (g)(3)(ii) of this section apply for the purposes 
of this subpart.
    (i) You must correct the concentration in the gas stream at the 
outlet of the combustion device to 3 percent oxygen if you add 
supplemental gases, as defined in Sec. 63.2550, to the vent stream, or;
    (ii) You must correct the measured concentration for supplemental 
gases using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.2460; you may use process knowledge 
and representative operating data to determine the fraction of the total 
flow due to supplemental gas.
    (4) Continuous parameter monitoring. The provisions in Sec. 
63.2450(k)(1) through (6) apply in addition to the requirements for 
continuous parameter monitoring systems (CPMS) in subpart SS of this 
part 63, except as specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) You may measure pH at least once per day for any halogen 
scrubber within a CMPU subject to this rule.
    (ii) The requirements in Sec. 63.2450(k)(6) to request approval of 
a procedure to monitor operating parameters does not apply for the 
purposes of this subpart. You must provide the required information in 
your NOCS report required by Sec. 63.11501(b).
    (5) Startup, shutdown, malfunction (SSM). Section 
63.998(b)(2)(iii),(b)(6)(i)(A), and (d)(3) do not apply for the purposes 
of this subpart.
    (6) Excused excursions. Excused excursions, as defined in subpart SS 
of this part 63, are not allowed.
    (7) Energetics and organic peroxides. If an emission stream contains 
energetics or organic peroxides that, for safety reasons, cannot meet an 
applicable emission limit specified in this subpart, then you must 
submit an application to the Administrator explaining why an undue 
safety hazard would be created if the air emission controls were 
installed, and you must describe the procedures that you will implement 
to minimize HAP emissions from these vent streams in lieu of the 
emission limitations in this section.

[[Page 427]]

    (8) Additional requirements for batch process vents. The provisions 
specified in Sec. 63.2460(c) apply in addition to the provisions in 
subpart SS of this part 63, except as specified in paragraphs (g)(8)(i)

[[Page 432]]

    Batch process vent means a vent from a CMPU or vents from multiple 
CMPUs within a process that are manifolded together into a common 
header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or has the 
potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Batch process vents include 
vents with intermittent flow from continuous operations that are not 
combined with any stream that originated as a continuous gas stream from 
the same continuous process. Examples of batch process vents include, 
but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, 
reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. The following are not 
batch process vents for the purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Continuous process vents;
    (2) Bottoms receivers;
    (3) Surge control vessels;
    (4) Gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system(s);
    (5) A gas stream routed to other processes for reaction or other use 
in another process (i.e., for chemical value as a product, isolated 
intermediate, byproduct, or coproduct, or for heat value).
    (6) Vents on storage tanks or wastewater systems;
    (7) Drums, pails, and totes; and
    (8) Emission streams from emission episodes that are undiluted and 
uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP are not part of any batch 
process vent. The HAP concentration may be determined using any of the 
following: process knowledge, an engineering assessment, or test data.
    Byproduct means a chemical (liquid, gas, or solid) that is produced 
coincidentally during the production of the product.
    Chemical manufacturing process means all equipment which 
collectively functions to produce a product or isolated intermediate. A 
process includes, but is not limited to any, all, or a combination of

to and including the dryer or extruder, or for a polymer production 
process without a dryer or extruder, it is up to and including the die 
plate or solid-state reactor, except in two cases. If the dryer, 
extruder, die plate, or solid-state reactor is followed by an operation 
that is designed and operated to remove HAP solvent or residual monomer 
from the solid, then the solvent removal operation is the last step in 
the process. If the dried solid is diluted or mixed with a HAP-based 
solvent, then the solvent removal operation is the last step in the 
process.

CMPU, even if emission streams from two or more CMPU are combined prior 
to discharge to the atmosphere or to a control device.
    Co-Product means a chemical that is produced during the production 
of another chemical, both for their intended production.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source fails to meet any 
requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including, but 
not limited to any emissions limitation or management practice; or fails 
to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable 
requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit 
for any affected source required to obtain such a permit.

equipment either contains or contacts a feedstock, byproduct, or product 
that contains an organic HAP.
    Metal HAP means the compounds containing metals listed as HAP in 
section 112(b) of the CAA.
    Metal HAP process vent means the point of discharge to the 
atmosphere (or inlet to a control device, if any) of a metal HAP-
containing gas stream from any CMPU at an affected source.
    Organic HAP means any organic HAP listed in section 112(b) of the 
CAA. For the purposes of requirements in this subpart VVVVVV, hydrazine

resembling pitch or tar, such as plastic resin, that sticks to or 
hardens in the fill pipe under normal transfer conditions.
    Shutdown, for a unit operation with a continuous process vent, means 
the cessation of the unit operation for any purpose. Shutdown begins 
with the initiation of steps as described in a written standard 
operating procedures (SOP) or shutdown plan to cease normal/stable 
operation (e.g., reducing or immediately stopping feed).
    Startup, for a unit operation with a continuous process vent, means 
the setting in operation of the unit for any purpose. The period of 
startup ends upon completion of the transient, non-equilibrium step at 
the time operating conditions reach steady state for operating 
parameters such as temperature, pressure, composition, feed rate, and 
production rate. Periods of startup described by SOP manuals at the 
affected source may be used to determine the period of startup.

[[Page 434]]

                   Other Requirements and Information


<R05>
Sec. 63.11510  What General Provisions apply to this subpart?

    If you own or operate a new or existing affected source, you must 
comply with the requirements of the General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A) according to Table 1 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11511  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in this section.
    Batch electrolytic process tank means a tank used for an 
electrolytic process in which a part or group of parts, typically 
mounted on racks or placed in barrels, is placed in the tank and 
immersed in an electrolytic process solution as a single unit (i.e., as 
a batch) for a predetermined period of time, during which none of the 
parts are removed from the tank and no other parts are added to the 
tank, and after which the part or parts are removed from the tank as a 
unit.
    Bath means the liquid contents of a tank, as defined in this 
section, which is used for electroplating, electroforming, 
electropolishing, or other metal coating processes at a plating and 
polishing facility.
    Bench-scale means any operation that is small enough to be performed 
on a bench, table, or similar structure so that the equipment is not 
directly contacting the floor.
    Capture system means the collection of components used to capture 
gases and fumes released from one or more emissions points and then 
convey the captured gas stream to a control device, as part of a 
complete control system. A capture system may include, but is not 
limited to, the following components as applicable to a given capture 
system design: duct intake devices, hoods, enclosures, ductwork, 
dampers, manifolds, plenums, and fans.
    Cartridge filter means a type of control device that uses perforated 
metal cartridges containing a pleated paper or non-woven fibrous filter 
media to remove PM from a gas stream by sieving and other mechanisms. 
Cartridge filters can be designed with single use cartridges, which are 
removed and disposed after reaching capacity, or continuous use 
cartridges, which typically are cleaned by means of a pulse-jet 
mechanism.
    Composite mesh pad means a type of control device similar to a mesh 
pad mist eliminator except that the device is designed with multiple 
pads in series that are woven with layers of material with varying fiber 
diameters, which produce a coalescing effect on the droplets or PM that 
impinge upon the pads.
    Continuous electrolytic process tank means a tank that uses an 
electrolytic process and in which a continuous metal strip or other type 
of continuous substrate is fed into and removed from the tank 
continuously. This process is also called reel-to-reel electrolytic 
plating.
    Control device means equipment that is part of a control system that 
collects and/or reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to 
the air. The control device receives emissions that are transported from 
the process by the capture system.

[[Page 452]]

    Control system means the combination of a capture system and a 
control device. The capture system is designed to collect and transport 
air emissions from the affected source to the control device. The 
overall control efficiency of any control system is a combination of the 
ability of the system to capture the air emissions (i.e., the capture 
efficiency) and the control device efficiency. Consequently, it is 
important to achieve good capture to ensure good overall control 
efficiency. Capture devices that are known to provide high capture 
efficiencies include hoods, enclosures, or any other duct intake devices 
with ductwork, dampers, manifolds, plenums, or fans.
    Conversion coatings are coatings that form a hard metal finish on an 
object when the object is submerged in a tank bath or solution that 
contains the conversion coatings. Conversion coatings for the purposes 
of this rule include coatings composed of chromium, as well as the other 
plating and polishing metal HAP, where no electrical current is used.
    Cyanide plating means plating processes performed in tanks that use 
cyanide as a major bath ingredient and that operate at pH of 12 or more, 
and use or emit any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined 
in this section. Electroplating and electroforming are performed with or 
without cyanide. The cyanide in the bath works to dissolve the HAP metal 
added as a cyanide compound (e.g., cadmium cyanide) and creates free 
cyanide in solution, which helps to corrode the anode. These tanks are 
self-regulating to a pH of 12 due to the caustic nature of the cyanide 
bath chemistry. The cyanide in the bath is a major bath constituent and 
not an additive; however, the self-regulating chemistry of the bath 
causes the bath to act as if wetting agents/fume suppressants are being 
used and to ensure an optimum plating process. All cyanide plating baths 
at pH greater than or equal to 12 have cyanide-metal complexes in 
solution. The metal HAP to be plated is not emitted because it is either 
bound in the metal-cyanide complex or reduced at the cathode to 
elemental metal, and plated onto the immersed parts. Cyanide baths are 
not intentionally operated at pH less 12 since unfavorable plating 
conditions would occur in the tank, among other negative effects.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source or an owner 
or operator of such an affected source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
rule including, but not limited to, any equipment standard (including 
emissions and operating limits), management practice, or operation and 
maintenance requirement;
    (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement 
an applicable requirement in this rule and that is included in the 
operating permit for any affected facility required to obtain such a 
permit; or
    (3) Fails to meet any equipment standard (including emission and 
operating limits), management standard, or operation and maintenance 
requirement in this rule during startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
    Dry mechanical polishing means a process used for removing defects 
from and smoothing the surface of finished metals and formed products 
after plating or thermal spraying with any of the plating and polishing 
metal HAP, as defined in this section, using automatic or manually-
operated machines that have hard-faced abrasive wheels or belts and 
where no liquids or fluids are used to trap the removed metal particles. 
The affected process does not include polishing with use of pastes, 
liquids, lubricants, or any other added materials.
    Electroforming means an electrolytic process using or emitting any 
of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, that 
is used for fabricating metal parts. This process is essentially the 
same as electroplating except that the plated substrate (mandrel) is 
removed, leaving only the metal plate. In electroforming, the metal 
plate is self-supporting and generally thicker than in electroplating.
    Electroless plating means a non-electrolytic process that uses or 
emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this 
section, in which metallic ions in a plating bath or solution are 
reduced to form a metal coating at the surface of a catalytic substrate 
without the use of external

[[Page 453]]

electrical energy. Electroless plating is also called non-electrolytic 
plating. Examples include, but are not limited to, chromate conversion 
coating, nickel acetate sealing, sodium dichromate sealing, and 
manganese phosphate coating.
    Electrolytic plating processes means electroplating and 
electroforming that use or emit any of the plating and polishing metal 
HAP, as defined in this section, where metallic ions in a plating bath 
or solution are reduced to form a metal coating on the surface of parts 
and products using electrical energy.
    Electroplating means an electrolytic process that uses or emits any 
of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, in 
which metal ions in solution are reduced onto the surface of the work 
piece (the cathode) via an electrical current. The metal ions in the 
solution are usually replenished by the dissolution of metal from solid 
metal anodes fabricated of the same metal being plated, or by direct 
replenishment of the solution with metal salts or oxides; electroplating 
is also called electrolytic plating.
    Electropolishing means an electrolytic process performed in a tank 
after plating that uses or emits any of the plating and polishing metal 
HAP, as defined in this section, in which a work piece is attached to an 
anode immersed in a bath, and the metal substrate is dissolved 
electrolytically, thereby removing the surface contaminant; 
electropolishing is also called electrolytic polishing. For the purposes 
of this subpart, electropolishing does not include bench-scale 
operations.
    Fabric filter means a type of control device used for collecting PM 
by filtering a process exhaust stream through a filter or filter media. 
A fabric filter is also known as a baghouse.
    Filters, for the purposes of this part, include cartridge, fabric, 
or HEPA filters, as defined in this section.
    Flash electroplating means an electrolytic process performed in a 
tank that uses or emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as 
defined in this section, and that is used no more than 3 cumulative 
minutes per hour or no more than 1 cumulative hour per day.
    General Provisions of this part (40 CFR part 63, subpart A) means 
the section of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that addresses air 
pollution rules that apply to all HAP sources addressed in part 63, 
which includes the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants (NESHAP).
    HAP means hazardous air pollutant as defined from the list of 188 
chemicals and compounds specified in the CAA Amendments of 1990; HAP are 
also called ``air toxics.'' The five plating and polishing metal HAP, as 
defined in this section, are on this list of 188 chemicals.
    High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter means a type of 
control device that uses a filter composed of a mat of randomly arranged 
fibers and is designed to remove at least 99.97 percent of airborne 
particles that are 0.3 micrometers or larger in diameter.
    Maintenance is any process at a plating and polishing facility that 
is performed to keep the process equipment or the facility operating 
properly and is not performed on items to be sold as products.
    Major facility for HAP is any facility that emits greater than 10 
tpy of any HAP, or that emits a combined total of all HAP of over 25 
tpy, where the HAP used to determine the total facility emissions are 
not restricted to only plating and polishing metal HAP or from only 
plating and polishing operations.

with a high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) spray gun, electrostatic 
application, airless spray gun, air-assisted airless spray gun, or an 
equivalent technology that is demonstrated to achieve transfer 
efficiency comparable to one of these spray gun technologies for a 
comparable operation, and for which written approval has been obtained 
from the Administrator. The procedure used to demonstrate that spray gun 
transfer efficiency is equivalent to that of an HVLP spray gun must be 
equivalent to the California South Coast Air Quality Management 
District's ``Spray Equipment Transfer Efficiency Test Procedure for 
Equipment User, May 24, 1989'' and ``Guidelines for Demonstrating 
Equivalency with District Approved Transfer Efficient Spray Guns, 
September 26, 2002'', Revision 0 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.

done with either non-HAP gun cleaning solvents, or in such a manner that 
an atomized mist of spray of gun cleaning solvent and paint residue is 
not created outside of a container that collects the used gun cleaning 
solvent. Spray gun cleaning may be done with, for example, by hand 
cleaning of parts of the disassembled gun in a container of solvent, by 
flushing solvent through the gun without atomizing the solvent and paint 
residue, or by using a fully enclosed spray gun washer. A combination of 
these non-atomizing methods may also be used.
    (5) Spray painting worker certification. All workers performing 
painting must be certified that they have completed training in the 
proper spray application of paints and the proper setup and maintenance 
of spray equipment. The minimum requirements for training and

delivery rate.
    (B) Spray technique for different types of paints to improve 
transfer efficiency and minimize paint usage and overspray, including 
maintaining the correct spray gun distance and angle to the part, using 
proper banding and overlap, and reducing lead and lag spraying at the 
beginning and end of each stroke.
    (C) Routine spray booth and filter maintenance, including filter 
selection and installation.
    (D) Environmental compliance with the requirements of this subpart.
    (iii) A description of the methods to be used at the completion of

where production quantities are established by the volume, linear foot, 
square foot, or other value suited to the specific industry. The period 
used to determine production should be the previous continuous 12 months 
of operation. Facilities must document and retain their rationale for 
the determination that their facility is not ``primarily engaged'' 
pursuant to Sec. 63.10(b)(3) of the General Provisions.
    Quality control activities means operations that meet all of the 
following criteria:
    (1) The activities are intended to detect and correct defects in the 
final product by selecting a limited number of samples from the 
operation, and comparing the samples against specific performance 
criteria.
    (2) The activities do not include the production of an intermediate 
or final product for sale or exchange for commercial profit; for 
example, parts that are not sold and do not leave the facility.
    (3) The activities are not a normal part of the operation;
    (4) The activities do not involve fabrication of tools, equipment, 
machinery, and structures that comprise the infrastructure of the 
facility and that are necessary for the facility to function in its 
intended capacity; that is, the activities are not facility maintenance.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Spray-applied painting means application of paints using a hand-held 
device that creates an atomized mist of paint and deposits the paint on 
a substrate. For the purposes of this subpart, spray-applied painting 
does not include the following materials or activities:
    (1) Paints applied from a hand-held device with a paint cup capacity 
that is less than 3.0 fluid ounces (89 cubic centimeters).
    (2) Surface coating application using powder coating, hand-held, 
non-refillable aerosol containers, or non-atomizing application 
technology, including, but not limited to, paint brushes, rollers, hand 
wiping, flow coating, dip coating, electrodeposition coating, web 
coating, coil coating, touch-up markers, or marking pens.
    (3) Painting operations that normally require the use of an airbrush 
or an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited access 
spaces; the application of paints that contain fillers that adversely 
affect atomization with HVLP spray guns, and the application of paints 
that normally have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0013 centimeter 
(0.0005 in.).
    (4) Thermal spray operations (also known as metallizing, flame 
spray, plasma arc spray, and electric arc spray, among other names) in 
which solid metallic or non-metallic material is heated to a molten or 
semi-molten state and propelled to the work piece or substrate by 
compressed air or other gas, where a bond is produced upon impact.
    Spray booth or spray room means an enclosure with four sides and a 
roof where spray paint is prevented from leaving the booth during 
spraying by the enclosure. The roof of the spray booth or spray room may 
contain narrow slots for connecting the parts and

[[Page 473]]

products to overhead cranes, or for cord or cable entry into the spray 
booth or spray room.
    Tool or equipment repair means equipment and devices used to repair 
or maintain process equipment or to prepare molds, dies, or other 
changeable elements of process equipment.
    Totally enclosed and unvented means enclosed so that no air enters 
or leaves during operation.
    Totally enclosed and unvented dry abrasive blasting chamber means a 
dry abrasive blasting enclosure which has no vents to the atmosphere, 
thus no emissions. A typical example of this sort of abrasive blasting 
enclosure is a small ``glove box'' enclosure, where the worker places 
their hands in openings or gloves that extend into the box and enable 
the worker to hold the objects as they are being blasted without 
allowing air and blast material to escape the box.
    Vented dry abrasive blasting means dry abrasive blasting where the 
blast material is moved by air flow from within the chamber to outside 
the chamber into the atmosphere or into a control device.
    Welding means a process which joins two metal parts by melting the 
parts at the joint and filling the space with molten metal.
    Welding rod containing MFHAP means a welding rod that contains 
cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel in amounts greater than or equal to 
0.1 percent by weight (as the metal), or that contains manganese in 
amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight (as the metal), 
as shown in formulation data provided by the manufacturer or supplier, 
such as the Material Safety Data Sheet for the welding rod.

from the furnace building containing the electrometallurgical operations 
that exhibit opacity greater than 20 percent (6-minute average), except 
for one 6-minute average per hour that does not exceed 60 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11527  What are the monitoring requirements for new and existing 

sources?

    (a) EAF equipped with fabric filters--(1) Visual monitoring. You 
must conduct visual monitoring of the monovent or fabric filter outlet 
stack(s) for any VE according to the schedule specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) Daily visual monitoring. Perform visual determination of 
fugitive emissions once per day, on each day the process is in 
operation, during operation of the process.
    (ii) Weekly visual monitoring. If no visible fugitive emissions are 
detected in consecutive daily visual monitoring performed in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for 90 days

[[Page 476]]

of operation of the process, you may decrease the frequency of visual 
monitoring to once per calendar week of time the process is in 
operation, during operation of the process. If visible fugitive 
emissions are detected during these inspections, you must resume daily 
visual monitoring of that operation during each day that the process is 
in operation, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section 
until you satisfy the criteria of this section to resume conducting 
weekly visual monitoring.
    (2) If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you 
must conduct a Method 22 (appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60) test following 
the requirements of Sec. 63.11528(b)(1) within 24 hours of determining 
the presence of any VE.
    (3) If you own or operate an existing affected source, you may 
install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection system for each 
fabric filter as an alternative to the monitoring requirements in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If you own or operate a new affected 
source, you must install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection 
system for each fabric filter according to the requirements in 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(vii) of this section. Such source is 
not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (i) The system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable 
of detecting emissions of PM at concentrations of 10 milligrams per 
actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
    (ii) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative PM loadings and the owner or operator shall continuously record 
the output from the bag leak detection system using a strip chart 
recorder, data logger, or other means.
    (iii) The system must be equipped with an alarm that will sound when 
an increase in relative PM loadings is detected over the alarm set point 
established in the operation and maintenance plan, and the alarm must be 
located such that it can be heard, seen, or otherwise detected by the 
appropriate plant personnel.
    (iv) The initial adjustment of the system must, at minimum, consist 
of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) 
and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the alarm set 
points. If the system is equipped with an alarm delay time feature, you 
also must establish a maximum reasonable alarm delay time.
    (v) Following the initial adjustment, do not adjust the sensitivity 
or range, averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time, except 
that, once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak 
detection system to account for seasonal effects including temperature 
and humidity.
    (vi) For fabric filters that are discharged to the atmosphere 
through a stack, the bag leak detector sensor must be installed 
downstream of the fabric filter and upstream of any wet scrubber.
    (vii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (4) When operating a bag leak detection system, if an alarm sounds, 
conduct visual monitoring of the monovent or fabric filter outlet 
stack(s) as required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 1 hour. 
If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you must 
conduct a Method 22 test following the requirements of Sec. 
63.11528(b)(1) within 24 hours of determining the presence of any VE.
    (5) You must prepare a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag 
leak detection system. You must operate and maintain each bag leak 
detection system according to the plan at all times. Each plan must 
address all of the items identified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through 
(a)(5)(v)of this section.
    (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system.
    (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system including how the alarm set-point and alarm delay time will be 
established.
    (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality 
assurance procedures.
    (iv) Maintenance of the bag leak detection system including a 
routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.

[[Page 477]]

    (v) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and 
stored.
    (b) EAF equipped with wet scrubbers--(1) Visual monitoring. You must 
conduct visual monitoring of the wet scrubber outlet stack(s) for any VE 
according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) Daily visual monitoring. Perform visual determination of 
fugitive emissions once per day, on each day the process is in 
operation, during operation of the process.
    (ii) Weekly visual monitoring. If no visible fugitive emissions are 
detected in consecutive daily visual monitoring performed in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for 90 days of operation of the 
process, you may decrease the frequency of visual monitoring to once per 
calendar week of time the process is in operation, during operation of 
the process. If visible fugitive emissions are detected during these 
inspections, you must resume daily visual monitoring of that operation 
during each day that the process is in operation, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section until you satisfy the criteria of 
this section to resume conducting weekly visual monitoring.
    (2) If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you 
must conduct a Method 22 (appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60) test following 
the requirements of Sec. 63.11528(b)(1) within 24 hours of determining 
the presence of any VE.
    (3) If you own or operate an existing affected source, you may 
install, operate and maintain a continuous parameter monitoring system 
(CPMS) to measure and record the 3-hour average pressure drop and 
scrubber water flow rate as an alternative to the monitoring 
requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If you own 
or operate a new sealed EAF affected source, you must install, operate, 
and maintain a CPMS for each wet scrubber. Such source is not subject to 
the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) When operating a CPMS, if the 3-hour average pressure drop or 
scrubber water flow rate is below the minimum levels that indicate 
normal operation of the control device, conduct visual monitoring of the 
outlet stack(s) as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section within 1 
hour of determining that the 3-hour average parameter value is below the 
required minimum levels. Manufacturer's specifications for pressure drop 
and liquid flow rate will be used to determine normal operations. If the 
visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you must conduct a 
Method 22 (appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60) test following the 
requirements of Sec. 63.11528(b)(1) within 24 hours of determining the 
presence of any VE.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11528  What are the performance test and compliance requirements for 

new and existing sources?

    (a) Initial compliance demonstration deadlines. You must conduct an 
initial Method 22 (appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60) test following the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section of each existing 
electrometallurgical operation control device and an initial Method 9 
observation following the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section from the furnace building due to electrometallurgical operations 
no later than 60 days after your applicable compliance date. For any new 
electrometallurgical operation control device, you must conduct an 
initial Method 22 test following the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section within 15 days of startup of the control device.
    (b) Visible emissions limit compliance demonstration. (1) You must 
conduct a Method 22 (appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60) test to determine 
that VE from the control device do not exceed the emission standard 
specified in Sec. 63.11526(a). For a fabric filter, conduct the test 
for at least 60 minutes at the fabric filter monovent or outlet 
stack(s), as applicable. For a wet scrubber, conduct the test for at 
least 60 minutes at the outlet stack(s).
    (2) You must conduct a semiannual Method 22 test using the 
procedures specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Furnace building opacity. (1) You must conduct an opacity test 
for fugitive emissions from the furnace building according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.6(h) and Method 9 (appendix A-4 of 40 CFR part 
60). The test must be conducted for at least 60 minutes and shall

[[Page 478]]

include tapping the furnace or reaction vessel. The observation must be 
focused on the part of the building where electrometallurgical operation 
fugitive emissions are most likely to be observed.
    (2) Conduct subsequent Method 9 tests no less frequently than every 
6 months and each time you make a process change likely to increase 
fugitive emissions.
    (3) After the initial Method 9 performance test, as an alternative 
to the Method 9 performance test, you may monitor VE using Method 22 
(appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60) for subsequent semi-annual compliance 
demonstrations. The Method 22 test is successful if no VE are observed 
for 90 percent of the readings over the furnace cycle (tap to tap) or 60 
minutes, whichever is longer. If VE are observed greater than 10 percent 
of the time over the furnace cycle or 60 minutes, whichever is longer, 
then the facility must conduct another test as soon as possible, but no 
later than 15 calendar days after the Method 22 test using Method 9 
(appendix A-4 of 40 CFR part 60) as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11529  What are the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping 

requirements?

aluminum, copper or other nonferrous foundry after February 9, 2009, you 
must determine if you are subject to this rule based on your facility's 
annual metal melt capacity at startup.
    (iii) If your foundry with an existing melting operation increases 
production after calendar year 2010 such that the annual metal melt 
production equals or exceeds 600 tpy, you must submit a written 
notification of applicability to the Administrator within 30 days after 
the end of the calendar year and comply within 2 years after the date of 
the notification.
    (iv) If your foundry with a new melting operation increases capacity 
after startup such that the annual metal melt capacity equals or exceeds 
600 tpy, you must submit a written notification of applicability to the 
Administrator within 30 days after the capacity increase year and comply 
at the time of the capacity increase.
    (b) This subpart applies to each new or existing affected source 
located at an aluminum, copper or other nonferrous foundry that is an 
area source as defined by Sec. 63.2. The affected source is the 
collection of all melting operations located at an aluminum, copper, or 
other nonferrous foundry.
    (c) An affected source is an existing source if you commenced 
construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or before 
February 9, 2009.
    (d) An affected source is a new source if you commenced construction 
or reconstruction of the affected source after February 9, 2009.
    (e) This subpart does not apply to research or laboratory 
facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the Clean Air Act.

of PM at the inlet and outlet in pounds per hour and calculate the 
percent reduction in PM.
    (2) Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test. 
Each run must cover at least one production cycle (charging, melting, 
and tapping).
    (3) For a source with a single control device exhausted through 
multiple stacks, you must ensure that three runs are performed by a 
representative sampling of the stacks satisfactory to the Administrator 
or his or her delegated representative. You must provide data or an 
adequate explanation why the stack(s) chosen for testing are

day, on each day the process is in operation, during melting operations.
    (ii) If no VE are detected in consecutive daily visual monitoring 
performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for 30 
consecutive days or more of operation of the process, you may decrease 
the frequency of visual monitoring to once per calendar week of time the 
process is in operation, during melting operations. If VE are detected 
during these inspections, you must resume daily visual monitoring of 
that operation during each day that the process is in operation, in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section until you satisfy 
the criteria of this section to resume conducting weekly visual 
monitoring.
    (2) If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you 
must initiate procedures to determine the cause of the emissions within 
1 hour of the initial observation and alleviate the cause of the 
emissions within 3 hours of initial observation by taking

[[Page 484]]

whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. You may take more than 3 
hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes VE if you identify 
in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to 
VE in advance, you adequately explain why it is not feasible to 
alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the VE occurs, and 
you demonstrate that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this 
condition as expeditiously as practicable.

system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative 
particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to 
paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such 
that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
    (iv) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you 
must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the 
sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm 
set points, and the alarm delay time.
    (v) Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the averaging 
period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the 
Administrator or delegated authority, except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (vi) Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag 
leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including 
temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the 
site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (vii) You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of 
the fabric filter.
    (viii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (2) You must prepare a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag 
leak detection system. You must operate and maintain each bag leak 
detection system according to the plan at all times. Each monitoring 
plan must describe the items in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of 
this section.
    (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
    (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system, including how the alarm set-point and alarm delay time will be 
established;
    (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality 
assurance procedures;
    (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including 
a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;
    (v) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and 
stored; and
    (vi) Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section.

initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm from a bag 
leak detection system within 1 hour of the alarm and

[[Page 485]]

alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking 
whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags 
or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in PM 
emissions;
    (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
    (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media, or otherwise 
repairing the control device;
    (iv) Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment;

<R05>
Sec. 63.11556  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 
Sec. 63.2, and in this section as follows:
    Aluminum foundry means a facility that melts aluminum and pours 
molten aluminum into molds to manufacture aluminum castings (except die 
casting) that are complex shapes. For purposes of this subpart, this 
definition does not include primary or secondary metal producers that 
cast molten aluminum to produce simple shapes such as sows, ingots, 
bars, rods, or billets.
    Aluminum foundry HAP means any compound of the following metals: 
beryllium, cadmium, lead, manganese, or nickel, or any of these metals 
in the elemental form.
    Annual copper and other nonferrous foundry metal melt capacity 
means, for new affected sources, the lower of the copper and other 
nonferrous metal melting operation capacity, assuming 8,760 operating 
hours per year or, if applicable, the maximum permitted copper and other 
nonferrous metal melting operation production rate for the melting 
operation calculated on an annual basis. Unless otherwise specified in 
the permit, permitted copper and other nonferrous metal melting 
operation rates that are not specified on an annual basis must be 
annualized assuming 24 hours per day, 365 days per year of operation. If 
the permit limits the operating hours of the melting operation(s) or 
foundry, then the permitted operating hours are used to annualize the 
maximum permitted copper and other nonferrous metal melt production 
rate. The annual copper and other nonferrous metal melt capacity does 
not include the melt capacity for ferrous metal melted in iron or steel 
foundry melting operations that are co-located with copper or other 
nonferrous melting operations or the nonferrous metal melted in non-
foundry melting operations.
    Annual copper and other nonferrous foundry metal melt production 
means, for existing affected sources, the quantity of copper and other 
nonferrous metal melted in melting operations at the foundry in a given 
calendar year. For the purposes of this subpart, metal melt production 
is determined on the basis of the quantity of metal charged to the 
melting operations. The annual copper and nonferrous metal melt 
production does not include the melt production of ferrous metal melted 
in iron or steel foundry melting operations that are co-located with 
copper and other nonferrous melting operations or the nonferrous metal 
melted in non-foundry melting operations.
    Annual metal melt capacity, for new affected sources, means the 
lower of the aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melting 
operation capacity, assuming 8,760 operating hours per year or, if 
applicable, the maximum permitted aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous 
metal melting operation

[[Page 488]]

production rate for the melting operation calculated on an annual basis. 
Unless otherwise specified in the permit, permitted aluminum, copper, 
and other nonferrous metal melting operation rates that are not 
specified on an annual basis must be annualized assuming 24 hours per 
day, 365 days per year of operation. If the permit limits the operating 
hours of the melting operation(s) or foundry, then the permitted 
operating hours are used to annualize the maximum permitted aluminum, 
copper, and other nonferrous metal melt production rate. The annual 
metal melt capacity does not include the melt capacity for ferrous metal 
melted in iron or steel foundry melting operations that are co-located 
with aluminum, copper, or other nonferrous melting operations or the 
nonferrous metal melted in non-foundry melting operations.
    Annual metal melt production means, for existing affected sources, 
the quantity of aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melted in 
melting operations at the foundry in a given calendar year. For the 
purposes of this subpart, annual metal melt production is determined on 
the basis of the quantity of metal charged to the melting operations. 
The annual metal melt production does not include the melt production of 
ferrous metal melted in iron or steel foundry melting operations that 
are co-located with aluminum, copper, or other nonferrous melting 
operations or the nonferrous metal melted in non-foundry melting 
operations.
    Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of 
continuously monitoring relative PM (i.e., dust) loadings in the exhaust 
of a baghouse to detect bag leaks and other upset conditions. A bag leak 
detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that 
operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light transmittance, or 
other effect to continuously monitor relative PM loadings.
    Copper foundry means a foundry that melts copper or copper-based 
alloys and pours molten copper or copper-based alloys into molds to 
manufacture copper or copper-based alloy castings (excluding die 
casting) that are complex shapes. For purposes of this subpart, this 
definition does not include primary or secondary metal producers that 
cast molten copper to produce simple shapes such as sows, ingots, 
billets, bars, anode copper, rods, or copper cake.
    Copper foundry HAP means any compound of any of the following 
metals: lead, manganese, or nickel, or any of these metals in the 
elemental form.
    Deviation means any instance where an affected source subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or work 
practice standard;

startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such 
failure is permitted by this subpart.
    Die casting means operations classified under the North American 
Industry Classification System codes 331521 (Aluminum Die-Casting 
Foundries) and 331522 (Nonferrous (except Aluminum) Die-Casting 
Foundries) and comprises establishments primarily engaged in introducing 
molten aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal, under high 
pressure, into molds or dies to make die-castings.
    Large foundry means, for an existing affected source, a copper or 
other nonferrous foundry with an annual metal melt production of copper, 
other nonferrous metals, and all associated alloys (excluding aluminum) 
of 6,000 tons or greater. For a new affected source, large foundry means 
a copper or other nonferrous foundry with an annual metal melt capacity 
of copper, other nonferrous metals, and all associated alloys (excluding

Where:

d = Density of the asphalt, kg/m\3\ (lb/ft\3\)
d = K<INF>1</INF>-K<INF>2</INF>T<INF>i</INF>
K<INF>1</INF> = 1056.1 kg/m\3\ (metric units)
= 66.6147 lb/ft\3\ (English Units)
K<INF>2</INF> = 0.6176 kg/(m\3\ [deg]C) (metric units)

with the emission limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart:
    E = [(C)*(Q)/(P)*(K)]

Where:

E = emission rate of particulate matter, kg/Mg (lb/ton).
C = concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
Q = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
P = the average asphalt roofing production rate or asphalt charging rate 
          over the duration of the test, Mg/hr (ton/hr).
K = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg [7000 (gr/lb)].

affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment 
and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good 
air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general 
duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to 
make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by this 
standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and 
maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information 
available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, 
monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, 
review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the 
source.
    (j) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CPMS in

                   Other Requirements and Information


<R05>
Sec. 63.11565  What general provisions sections apply to this subpart?

    You must comply with the requirements of the General Provisions (40 
CFR part 63, subpart A) according to Table 5 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11566  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Asphalt coating equipment means the saturators, coating mixers, and 
coaters used to apply asphalt to substrate to manufacture roofing 
products (e.g., shingles, roll roofing).
    Asphalt flux means the organic residual material from distillation 
of crude oil that is generally used in asphalt roofing manufacturing and 
paving and non-paving asphalt products.
    Asphalt processing operation means any operation engaged in the 
preparation of asphalt flux at stand-alone asphalt processing 
facilities, petroleum refineries, and asphalt roofing facilities. 
Asphalt preparation, called ``blowing,'' is the oxidation of asphalt 
flux, achieved by bubbling air through the heated asphalt, to raise the 
softening point and to reduce penetration of the oxidized asphalt. An 
asphalt processing facility includes one or more asphalt flux blowing 
stills.
    Asphalt roofing manufacturing operation means the collection of 
equipment used to manufacture asphalt roofing products through a series 
of sequential process steps. The equipment configuration of an asphalt 
roofing manufacturing process varies depending upon the type of 
substrate used (i.e., organic or inorganic). For example, an asphalt 
roofing manufacturing line that uses organic substrate (e.g.,

[[Page 498]]

felt) typically would consist of a saturator (and wet looper), coating 
mixer, and coater (although the saturator could be bypassed if the line 
manufacturers multiple types of products). An asphalt roofing 
manufacturing line that uses inorganic (fiberglass mat) substrate 
typically would consist of a coating mixer and coater.
    Blowing still means the equipment in which air is blown through 
asphalt flux to change the softening point and penetration rate of the 
asphalt flux, creating oxidized asphalt.
    Built-up roofing operations means operations involved in the on-site 
(e.g., at a commercial building) assembly of roofing system components 
(e.g., asphalt, substrate, surface granules).
    Coater means the equipment used to apply amended (filled or 
modified) asphalt to the top and bottom of the substrate (typically 
fiberglass mat) used to manufacture shingles and rolled roofing 
products.
    Coating mixer means the equipment used to mix coating asphalt and a 
mineral stabilizer, prior to applying the stabilized coating asphalt to 
the substrate.
    Hot-mix asphalt operation means operations involved in mixing 
asphalt cement and aggregates to produce materials for paving roadways 
and hardstand (e.g., vehicle parking lots, prepared surfaces for 
materiel storage).
    Particulate matter (PM) means, for the purposes of this subpart, 
includes any material determined gravimetrically using EPA Method 5A--
Determination of Particulate Matter Emissions From the Asphalt 
Processing And Asphalt Roofing Industry (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3).
    Responsible official is defined in Sec. 63.2.
    Saturator means the equipment used to impregnate a substrate 
(predominantly organic felt) with asphalt. Saturators are predominantly 
used for the manufacture of rolled-roofing products (e.g., saturated 
felt). For the purposes of this subpart, the term saturator includes 
impregnation vat and wet looper.
    Wet looper means the series of rollers typically following the 
saturator used to provide additional absorption time for asphalt to 
penetrate the roofing substrate.

\a\ The 3-hour averaging period applies at all times other than startup
  and shutdown, as defined in Sec.  63.2. Within 24 hours of a startup
  event, or 24 hours prior to a shutdown event, you must normalize the
  emissions that occur during the startup or shutdown, when there is no
  production rate available to assess compliance with the lb/ton of
  product emission limits, with emissions that occur when the process is
  operational. The emissions that occur during the startup or shutdown
  event must be included with the process emissions when assessing
  compliance with the emission limits specified in Tables 1 and 2 of
  this subpart.
\b\ As an alternative to monitoring the inlet gas temperature and
  pressure drop, you can use a leak detection system that identifies
  when the filter media has been comprised.
\c\ As an alternative to monitoring the ESP voltage, you can monitor the
  ESP instrumentation (e.g. light, alarm) that indicates when the ESP
  must be cleaned and maintain a record of the instrumentation on an
  hourly basis. Failure to service the ESP within one hour of the
  indication is an exceedance of the applicable monitoring requirements
  specified in Sec.  63.11563(a).
\d\ If you are not using a control device to comply with the emission
  limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart, the process parameters
  and corresponding parameter values that you select to demonstrate
  continuous compliance must correlate to the process emissions.

initial compliance by conducting the inspection and monitoring 
activities in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and ongoing compliance by 
conducting the inspection and testing activities in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (1) Initial particulate control device inspections and tests. You 
must conduct an initial inspection of each particulate control device 
according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of 
this section and perform a visible emissions test according to the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. You must record 
the results of each inspection and test according to paragraph (b) of 
this section and perform corrective action where necessary.You must 
conduct each inspection no later than 180 days after your applicable 
compliance date for each control device which has been operated within 
60 days following the compliance date. For a control device which has 
not been installed or operated within 60 days following the compliance 
date, you must conduct an initial inspection prior to startup of the 
control device.
    (i) For each wet particulate control system, you must verify the 
presence of water flow to the control equipment. You must also visually 
inspect the system ductwork and control equipment for leaks and inspect 
the interior of the control equipment (if applicable) for structural 
integrity and the condition of the control system.
    (ii) For each dry particulate control system, you must visually 
inspect the system ductwork and dry particulate control unit for leaks. 
You must also inspect the inside of each dry particulate control unit 
for structural integrity and condition.
    (iii) An initial inspection of the internal components of a wet or 
dry particulate control system is not required if there is a record that 
an inspection meeting the requirements of this subsection has been 
performed within the past 12 months and any maintenance actions have 
been resolved.
    (iv) For each particulate control device, you must conduct a visible 
emission test consisting of three 1-minute test runs using Method 203C 
(40 CFR part 51, appendix M). The visible emission test runs must be 
performed during the addition of dry pigments and solids containing 
compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel to a process vessel or 
to the grinding and milling equipment. If the average test results of 
the visible emissions test runs indicate an opacity greater than the 
applicable limitation in Sec. 63.11601(a), you must take corrective 
action and retest within 15 days.
    (2) Ongoing particulate control device inspections and tests. 
Following the initial inspections, you must perform periodic inspections 
of each PM control device according to the requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. You must record the results of each

the results according to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (i) You must inspect and maintain each wet particulate control 
system according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through 
(C) of this section.
    (A) You must conduct a daily inspection to verify the presence of 
water flow to the wet particulate control system.
    (B) You must conduct weekly visual inspections of any flexible 
ductwork for leaks.
    (C) You must conduct inspections of the rigid, stationary ductwork 
for leaks, and the interior of the wet control system (if applicable) to 
determine the structural integrity and condition of the control 
equipment every 12 months.
    (ii) You must inspect and maintain each dry particulate control unit 
according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of 
this section.

[[Page 517]]

    (A) You must conduct weekly visual inspections of any flexible 
ductwork for leaks.
    (B) You must conduct inspections of the rigid, stationary ductwork 
for leaks, and the interior of the dry particulate control unit for 
structural integrity and to determine the condition of the fabric filter 
(if applicable) every 12 months.
    (iii) For each particulate control device, you must conduct a 5-
minute visual determination of emissions from the particulate control 
device every 3 months using Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7). 
The visible emission test must be performed during the addition of dry 
pigments and solids containing compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead, or 
nickel to a process vessel or to the grinding and milling equipment. If 
visible emissions are observed for two minutes of the required 5-minute 
observation period, you must conduct a Method 203C (40 CFR part 51, 
appendix M) test within 15 days of the time when visible emissions were 
observed. The Method 203C test will consist of three 1-minute test runs 
and must be performed during the addition of dry pigments and solids 
containing compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel HAP to a 
process vessel or to the grinding and milling equipment. If the Method 
203C test runs indicates an opacity greater than the limitation in Sec. 
63.11601(a)(5), you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) You must take corrective action and retest using Method 203C 
within 15 days. The Method 203C test will consist of three 1-minute test 
runs and must be performed during the addition of dry pigments and 
solids containing compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel to a 
process vessel or to the grinding and milling equipment. You must 
continue to take corrective action and retest each 15 days until a 
Method 203C test indicates an opacity equal to or less than the 
limitation in Sec. 63.11601(a)(5).
    (B) You must prepare a deviation report in accordance with Sec. 
63.11603(b)(3) for each instance in which the Method 203C opacity 
results were greater than the limitation in Sec. 63.11601(a)(5).
    (C) You must resume the visible determinations of emissions from the 
particulate control device in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of 
this section 3 months after the previous visible determination.
    (b) You must record the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (6) of this section for each inspection and testing activity.
    (1) The date, place, and time;
    (2) Person conducting the activity;

<R05>
Sec. 63.11646  What are my compliance requirements?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must 
conduct a mercury compliance emission test within 180 days of the 
compliance date for all process units at new and existing affected 
sources according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(13) of this section. This compliance testing must be repeated 
annually thereafter, with no two consecutive annual compliance tests 
occurring less than 3 months apart or more than 15 months apart.

[[Page 531]]

    (1) You must determine the concentration of mercury and the 
volumetric flow rate of the stack gas according to the following test 
methods and procedures:
    (i) Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1) to select sampling 
port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct. 
Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device (or 
at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is present) 
and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
    (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1), or 
Method 2G (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2) to determine the volumetric 
flow rate of the stack gas.
    (iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2) to 
determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/
ASME PTC 19.10, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses'' (incorporated by 
reference-see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.
    (iv) Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3) to determine the 
moisture content of the stack gas.
    (v) Method 29 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8) to determine the 
concentration of mercury, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(vi) 
and (vii) of this section.
    (vi) Upon approval by the permitting authority, ASTM D6784; 
``Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total 
Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources 
(Ontario Hydro Method)'' (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14) 
may be used as an alternative to Method 29 to determine the 
concentration of mercury.
    (vii) Upon approval by the permitting authority, Method 30B (40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A-8) may be used as an alternative to Method 29 to 
determine the concentration of mercury for those process units with 
relatively low particulate-bound mercury as specified in Section 1.2 of 
Method 30B.
    (2) A minimum of three test runs must be conducted for each 
performance test of each process unit. Each test run conducted with 
Method 29 must collect a minimum sample volume of 0.85 dry standard 
cubic meters (30 dry standard cubic feet). If conducted with Method 30B 
or ASTM D6784, determine sample time and volume according to the testing 
criteria set forth in the relevant method. If the emission testing 
results for any of the emission points yields a non-detect value, then 
the minimum detection limit (MDL) must be used to calculate the mass 
emissions rate (lb/hr) used to calculate the emissions factor (lb/ton) 
for that emission point and, in turn, for calculating the sum of the 
emissions (in units of pounds of mercury per ton of concentrate, or 
pounds of mercury per million tons of ore) for all emission points 
subject to the emission standard for determining compliance. If the 
resulting mercury emissions are greater than the MACT emission standard, 
the owner or operator may use procedures that produce lower MDL results 
and repeat the mercury emissions testing one additional time for any 
emission point for which the measured result was below the MDL. If this 
additional testing is performed, the results from that testing must be 
used to determine compliance (i.e., there are no additional 
opportunities allowed to lower the MDL).
    (3) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as 
the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on 
representative performance of the affected source for the period being 
tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the 
Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the 
conditions of performance tests. Performance tests must be conducted 
under operating conditions (including process or production throughputs) 
that are based on representative performance. Record and report to the 
permit authority the process throughput for each test run. For sources 
with multiple emission units (e.g., two roasters, or a furnace, 
electrowinning circuit and a mercury retort) ducted to a common control 
device and stack, compliance testing must be performed either by 
conducting a single compliance test with all affected emissions units in 
operation or by conducting a separate compliance test on each emissions 
unit. Alternatively, the owner or operator may request approval from the 
permit authority for an alternative

[[Page 532]]

testing approach. If the units are tested separately, any emissions unit 
that is not tested initially must be tested as soon as is practicable. 
If the performance test is conducted when all affected units are 
operating, then the number of hours of operation used for calculating 
emissions pursuant to paragraphs (a)(6) and (7) of this section must be 
the total number of hours for the unit that has the greatest total 
operating hours for that period of time, or based on an appropriate 
alternative method approved by the permit authority to account for the 
hours of operation for each separate unit in these calculations.
    (4) Calculate the mercury emission rate (lb/hr), based on the 
average of 3 test run values, for each process unit (or combination of 
units that are ducted to a common stack and are tested when all affected 
sources are operating pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section) 
using Equation (1) of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17FE11.003

Where:

E = mercury emissions in lb/hr;
Cs = concentration of mercury in the stack gas, in grains per dry 
          standard cubic foot (gr/dscf);
Qs = volumetric flow rate of the stack gas, in dry standard cubic feet 
          per hour; and
K = conversion factor for grains (gr) to pounds (lb), 1.43 x 
          10<SUP>-4</SUP>.

    (5) Monitor and record the number of one-hour periods each process 
unit operates during each month.
    (6) For the initial compliance determination for both new and 
existing sources, determine the total mercury emissions for all the full 
calendar months between the compliance date and the date of the initial 
compliance test by multiplying the emission rate in lb/hr for each 
process unit (or combination of units ducted to a common stack that are 
tested together) by the number of one-hour periods each process unit (or 
the unit that had the greatest total operating hours among the 
combination of multiple units with one stack that are tested together, 
or an alternative method approved by the permit authority, pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section) operated during those full calendar 
months prior to the initial compliance test. This initial period must 
include at least 1 full month of operations. After the initial 
compliance test, for subsequent compliance tests, determine the mercury 
mass emissions for the 12 full calendar months prior to the compliance 
test in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (a)(7) of this 
section. Existing sources may use a previous emission test for their 
initial compliance determination in lieu of conducting a new test if the 
test was conducted within one year of the compliance date using the 
methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, 
and the tests were representative of current operating processes and 
conditions. If a previous test is used for their initial compliance 
determination, 3 to 12 full months of data on hours of operation and 
production (i.e., million tons of ore or tons of concentrate), including 
the month the test was conducted, must be used to calculate the 
emissions rate (in units of pounds of mercury per million tons of ore 
for the ore pretreatment affected sources, or in units of pounds of 
mercury per tons of concentrate for the other affected sources).
    (7) For compliance determinations following the initial compliance 
test for new and existing sources, determine the total mercury mass 
emissions for each process unit for the 12 full calendar months 
preceding the performance test by multiplying the emission rate in lb/hr 
for each process unit (or combination of units ducted to a common stack 
that are tested together) by the number of one-hour periods each process 
unit (or the unit that had the greatest total operating hours among the 
combination of multiple units with one stack that are tested together, 
or an alternative method approved by the permit authority, pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section) operated

[[Page 533]]

during the 12 full calendar months preceding the completion of the 
performance tests.
    (8) You must install, calibrate, maintain and operate an appropriate 
weight measurement device, mass flow meter, or densitometer and 
volumetric flow meter to measure ore throughput for each roasting 
operation and autoclave and calculate hourly, daily and monthly totals 
in tons of ore according to paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (a)(8)(ii) of this 
section.
    (i) Measure the weight or the density and volumetric flow rate of 
the oxidized ore slurry as it exits the roaster oxidation circuit(s) and 
before the carbon-in-leach tanks. Alternatively, the weight of the ore 
can be measured ``as fed'' if approved by the permit authority as an 
acceptable equivalent method to measure amount of ore processed.
    (ii) Measure the weight or the density and volumetric flow rate of 
the ore slurry as it is fed to the autoclave(s). Alternatively, the 
weight or the density and volumetric flow rate of the oxidized ore 
slurry can be measured as it exits the autoclave and before the carbon-
in-leach tanks if approved by the permit authority as an acceptable 
equivalent method to measure amount of ore processed.
    (9) Measure the weight of concentrate (produced by electrowinning, 
Merrill Crowe process, gravity feed, or other methods) using weigh 
scales for each batch prior to processing in mercury retorts or melt 
furnaces. For facilities with mercury retorts, the concentrate must be 
weighed in the same state and condition as it is when fed to the mercury 
retort. For facilities without mercury retorts, the concentrate must be 
weighed prior to being fed to the melt furnace before drying in any 
ovens. For facilities that ship concentrate offsite, measure the weight 
of concentrate as shipped offsite. You must keep accurate records of the 
weights of each batch of concentrate processed and calculate, and record 
the total weight of concentrate processed each month.
    (10) You must maintain the systems for measuring density, volumetric 
flow rate, and weight within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent accuracy. 
You must describe the specific equipment used to make measurements at 
your facility and how that equipment is periodically calibrated. You 
must also explain, document, and maintain written procedures for 
determining the accuracy of the measurements and make these written 
procedures available to your permitting authority upon request. You must 
determine, record, and maintain a record of the accuracy of the 
measuring systems before the beginning of your initial compliance test 
and during each subsequent quarter of affected source operation.
    (11) Record the weight in tons of ore for ore pretreatment processes 
and concentrate for carbon processes with mercury retorts, carbon 
processes without mercury retorts, and for non-carbon concentrate 
processes on a daily and monthly basis.
    (12) Calculate the emissions from each new and existing affected 
source for the sum of all full months between the compliance date and 
the date of the initial compliance test in pounds of mercury per ton of 
process input using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(12)(i) through 
(a)(12)(iv) of this section to determine initial compliance with the 
emission standards in Sec. 63.11645. This must include at least 1 full 
month of data. Or, if a previous test is used pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section for the initial compliance test, use a period of 
time pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section to calculate the 
emissions for the affected source. After this initial compliance test 
period, determine annual compliance using the procedures in paragraph 
(a)(13) of this section for existing sources.
    (i) For ore pretreatment processes, divide the sum of mercury mass 
emissions (in pounds) from all roasting operations and autoclaves during 
the number of full months between the compliance date and the initial 
compliance test by the sum of the total amount of gold mine ore 
processed (in million tons) in these process units during those same 
full months following the compliance date. Or, if a previous test is 
used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of 
this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of production data 
(i.e., million tons of ore) and hours of operation referred to in 
paragraph (a)(6) of

[[Page 534]]

this section, must be used to determine the emissions in pounds of 
mercury per million tons of ore.
    (ii) For carbon processes with mercury retorts, divide the sum of 
mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, 
electrowinning, mercury retorts, and melt furnaces during the initial 
number of full months between the compliance date and the initial 
compliance tests by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed 
in these process units during those same full months following the 
compliance date. If a previous test is used to determine initial 
compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 
3 to 12 full months of production data (i.e., tons of concentrate) and 
hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must 
be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per tons of 
concentrate.
    (iii) For carbon processes without mercury retorts, divide the sum 
of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, 
electrowinning, and melt furnaces during the initial number of full 
months between the compliance date and the initial compliance tests by 
the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process 
units during those same full months following the compliance date. If a 
previous test is used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of 
production data (i.e., tons of concentrate) and hours of operation 
referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must be used to 
determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per tons of concentrate.
    (iv) For non-carbon concentrate processes, divide the sum of mercury 
mass emissions (in pounds) from mercury retorts and melt furnaces during 
the initial number of full months between the compliance date and the 
initial compliance tests by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) 
processed in these process units during those same full months following 
the compliance date. If a previous test is used to determine initial 
compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 
3 to 12 full months of production data (i.e., tons of concentrate) and 
hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must 
be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per tons of 
concentrate.
    (13) After the initial compliance test, calculate the emissions from 
each new and existing affected source for each 12-month period preceding 
each subsequent compliance test in pounds of mercury per ton of process 
input using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(13)(i) through (iv) of this 
section to determine compliance with the emission standards in Sec. 
63.11645.
    (i) For ore pretreatment processes, divide the sum of mercury mass 
emissions (in pounds) from all roasting operations and autoclaves in the 
12-month period preceding a compliance test by the sum of the total 
amount of gold mine ore processed (in million tons) in that 12-month 
period.
    (ii) For carbon processes with mercury retorts, divide the sum of 
mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, 
electrowinning, mercury retorts, and melt furnaces in the 12-month 
period preceding a compliance test by the total amount of concentrate 
(in tons) processed in these process units in that 12-month period.
    (iii) For carbon processes without mercury retorts, divide the sum 
of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, 
electrowinning, and melt furnaces in the 12-month period preceding a 
compliance test by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed 
in these process units in that 12-month period.
    (iv) For non-carbon concentrate processes, divide the sum of mercury 
mass emissions (in pounds) from mercury retorts and melt furnaces in the 
12-month period preceding a compliance test by the total amount of 
concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units in that 12-month 
period.
    (b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, 
including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring 
equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution 
control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination

[[Page 535]]

of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will 
be based on information available to the Administrator which may 
include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation 
and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, 
and inspection of the source.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11647  What are my monitoring requirements?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you must 
monitor each roaster for mercury emissions using one of the procedures 
in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section and establish 
operating limits for mercury concentration as described in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section.
    (1) Perform sampling and analysis of the roaster's exhaust for 
mercury concentration using EPA Performance Specification 12B (40 CFR 
part 60, appendix B and Procedure 5 of appendix F) or EPA Method 30B (40 
CFR part 60, appendix A-8) at least twice per month. A minimum of two 
measurements must be taken per month that are at least 11 days apart 
from other consecutive tests. The mercury concentration must be 
maintained below the operating limit established in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section. The results of the sampling must be obtained within 72 
hours of the time the sample is taken.
    (i) To determine the appropriate sampling duration, you must review 
the available data from previous stack tests to determine the upper 99th 
percentile of the range of mercury concentrations in the exit stack gas. 
Based on this upper end of expected concentrations, select an 
appropriate sampling duration that is likely to provide a valid sample 
and not result in breakthrough of the sampling tubes. If breakthrough of 
the sampling tubes occurs, you must re-sample within 7 days using a 
shorter sampling duration.
    (ii) If any mercury concentration measurement from the twice per 
month sampling with PS 12B or Method 30B is higher than the operating 
limit, the exceedance must be reported to the permit authority as a 
deviation and corrective actions must be implemented within 48 hours 
upon receipt of the sampling results. Moreover, within 96 hours of the 
exceedance, the owner or operator must measure the concentration again 
(with PS 12B (40 CFR part 60, appendix B and Procedure 5 of appendix F), 
Method 30B or Method 29 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8), or ASTM 
D6784(incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14)) and demonstrate to 
the permit authority that the mercury concentration is no higher than 
the operating limit, or inform the permit authority that the limit 
continues to be exceeded. If the measured mercury concentration exceeds 
the operating limit for mercury concentration after these 96 hours, the 
exceedance must be reported as a deviation within 24 hours to the 
permitting authority. The owner or operator must conduct a full 
compliance test pursuant to Sec. 63.11646(a) for the roaster operations 
within 40 days to determine if the affected source is in compliance with 
the MACT emission standard. For facilities that have roasters and 
autoclaves, the owner or operator can use the results of the previous 
compliance test for the autoclaves to determine the emissions for those 
process units to be used in the calculations of the emissions for the 
affected source. If the source is determined to be in compliance, the 
compliance test may also be used to establish a new operating limit for 
mercury concentration (in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section).
    (2) Install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a continuous emissions 
monitoring system (CEMS) to continuously measure the mercury 
concentration in the final exhaust stream from each roaster according to 
the requirements of Performance Specification 12A (40 CFR part 60, 
appendix B) except that calibration standards traceable to the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology are not required. You must perform 
a data accuracy assessment of the CEMS according to section 5 of 
Appendix F in part 60 and follow the applicable monitoring requirements 
in Sec. 63.8 as provided in Table 1 to subpart EEEEEEE.
    (i) You must continuously monitor the daily average mercury 
concentration from the roaster and maintain the daily average 
concentration below the operating limit established in paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section.

[[Page 536]]

    (ii) If the daily average mercury concentration from the CEMs is 
higher than the operating limit, the exceedance must be reported to the 
permit authority as a deviation and corrective actions must be 
implemented within 48 hours upon receipt of the sampling results. 
Moreover, within 96 hours of the exceedance, the owner or operator must 
measure the concentration again (with the CEMs (40 CFR part 60, appendix 
B and Procedure 5 of appendix F) and demonstrate to the permit authority 
that the mercury concentration is no higher than the operating limit, or 
inform the permit authority that the limit continues to be exceeded. If 
the measured mercury concentration exceeds the operating limit for 
mercury concentration after these 96 hours, the exceedance must be 
reported as a deviation within 24 hours to the permitting authority, and 
the owner or operator must conduct a full compliance test pursuant to 
Sec. 63.11646(a) for the roaster operations within 40 days to determine 
if the affected source is in compliance with the MACT emission standard. 
For facilities that have roasters and autoclaves, the owner or operator 
can use the results of the previous compliance test for the autoclaves 
to determine the emissions for those process units to be used in the 
calculations of the emissions for the affected source. If the source is 
determined to be in compliance, the compliance test results may also be 
used to establish a new operating limit for mercury concentration (in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section).
    (iii) You must submit a monitoring plan that includes quality 
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures sufficient to 
demonstrate the accuracy of the CEMS to your permitting authority for 
approval 180 days prior to your initial compliance test. At a minimum, 
the QA/QC procedures must include daily calibrations and an annual 
accuracy test for the CEMS.
    (3) Continuously measure the mercury concentration in the final 
exhaust stream from each roaster using EPA Performance Specification 12B 
(40 CFR part 60 appendix B and Procedure 5 of appendix F).
    (i) You must continuously measure the mercury concentration in the 
roaster exhaust and maintain the average daily mercury concentration 
below the operating limit established in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section. To determine the appropriate sampling duration, you must review 
the available data from previous stack tests to determine the upper 99th 
percentile of the range of mercury concentrations in the exit stack gas. 
Based on this upper end of expected concentrations, select an 
appropriate sampling duration that is likely to provide a valid sample 
and not result in breakthrough of the sampling tubes. If breakthrough of 
the sampling tubes occurs, you must re-sample within 7 days using a 
shorter sampling duration.
    (ii) If the daily average mercury concentration is higher than the 
operating limit, the exceedance must be reported to the permit authority 
as a deviation and corrective actions must be implemented within 48 
hours upon receipt of the sampling results. Moreover, within 96 hours of 
the exceedance, the owner or operator must measure the concentration 
again with PS 12B (40 CFR part 60, appendix B and Procedure 5 of 
appendix F), Method 30B or Method 29 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8), or 
ASTM D6784(incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14) and demonstrate 
to the permit authority that the mercury concentration is no higher than 
the operating limit, or inform the permit authority that the limit 
continues to be exceeded. If the measured mercury concentration exceeds 
the operating limit for mercury concentration after these 96 hours, the 
exceedance must be reported as a deviation within 24 hours to the 
permitting authority and the owner or operator must conduct a full 
compliance test pursuant to Sec. 63.11646(a) for the roaster operations 
within 40 days to determine if the affected source is in compliance with 
the MACT emission standard. For facilities that have roasters and 
autoclaves, the owner or operator can use the results of the previous 
compliance test for the autoclaves to determine the emissions for those 
process units to be used in the calculations of the emissions for the 
affected source. If the source is determined to be in compliance, the 
compliance test results may also be used to establish a new operating 
limit for

[[Page 537]]

mercury concentration (in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section).
    (4) Use Equation (2) of this section to establish an upper operating 
limit for mercury concentration as determined by using the procedures in 
paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section concurrently while 
you are conducting your annual compliance performance stack tests 
according to the procedures in Sec. 63.11646(a).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17FE11.004

Where:

OLR = mercury concentration operating limit for the roaster (or roasters 
          that share a common stack) (in micrograms per cubic meter);
C<INF>test</INF> = average mercury concentration measured by the 
          monitoring procedures (PS 12A or PS 12B or 30B) during the 
          compliance performance stack test (in micrograms per cubic 
          meter);
EL = emission standard for ore pretreatment processes (in lb/million 
          tons of ore);
CT = compliance test results for ore pretreatment processes (in lb/
          million tons of ore).

    (5) For roasters that utilize calomel-based mercury control systems 
for emissions controls, you are not required to perform the monitoring 
for mercury emissions in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this 
section if you demonstrate to the satisfaction of your permitting 
authority that mercury emissions from the roaster are less than 10 
pounds of mercury per million tons of ore throughput. If you make this 
demonstration, you must conduct the parametric monitoring as described 
below in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (i) The initial demonstration must include three or more consecutive 
independent stack tests for mercury at least one month apart on the 
roaster exhaust stacks. Subsequent demonstrations may be based upon the 
single stack test required in paragraph (a) of section Sec. 63.11646. 
The results of each of the tests must be less than 10 pounds of mercury 
per million tons of ore. The testing must be performed according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.11646(a)(1) through (a)(4) to determine mercury 
emissions in pounds per hour.
    (ii) Divide the mercury emission rate in pounds per hour by the ore 
throughput rate during the test expressed in millions of tons per hour 
to determine the emissions in pounds per million tons of ore.
    (b) For facilities with roasters and a calomel-based mercury control 
system that choose to monitor for mercury emissions using the procedures 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or that qualify for and choose to 
follow the requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you must 
establish operating parameter limits for scrubber liquor flow (or line 
pressure) and scrubber inlet gas temperature and monitor these 
parameters. You may establish your operating parameter limits from the 
initial compliance test, according to the manufacturer's specifications, 
or based on limits established by the permitting authority. If you 
choose to establish your operating parameter limits from the initial 
compliance test, monitor the scrubber liquor flow (or line pressure) and 
scrubber inlet gas temperature during each run of your initial 
compliance test. The minimum operating limit for scrubber liquor flow 
rate (or line pressure) is either the lowest value during any run of the 
initial compliance test or 10 percent less than the average value 
measured during the compliance test, and your maximum scrubber inlet 
temperature limit is the highest temperature measured during any run of 
the initial compliance test or 10 percent higher than the average value 
measured during the compliance test. You must monitor the scrubber 
liquor flow rate (or line pressure) and scrubber inlet gas temperature 
hourly and maintain the scrubber liquor flow (or line pressure) at or 
above the established operating parameter and maintain the inlet gas 
temperature below the established operating parameter limit.
    (c) For facilities with roasters and a calomel-based mercury control 
system

[[Page 538]]

that choose to monitor for mercury emissions using the procedures in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section or that qualify for and follow the 
requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you must establish 
operating parameter ranges for mercuric ion and chloride ion 
concentrations or for oxidation reduction potential and pH using the 
procedures in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section respectively.
    (1) Establish the mercuric ion concentration and chloride ion 
concentration ranges for each calomel-based mercury control system. The 
mercuric ion concentration and chloride ion concentration ranges for 
each calomel-based mercury control system must be based on the 
manufacturer's specifications, or based on approval by your permitting 
authority. Measure the mercuric ion concentration and chloride ion 
concentrations at least once during each run of your initial compliance 
test. The measurements must be within the established concentration 
range for mercuric ion concentration and chloride ion concentration. 
Subsequently, you must sample at least once daily and maintain the 
mercuric ion concentration and chloride ion concentrations within their 
established range.
    (2) Establish the oxidation reduction potential and pH range for 
each calomel-based mercury control system. The oxidation reduction 
potential and pH range for each calomel-based mercury control system 
must be based on the manufacturer's specifications, or based on approval 
by your permitting authority. Install monitoring equipment to 
continuously monitor the oxidation reduction potential and pH of the 
calomel-based mercury control system scrubber liquor. Measure the 
oxidation reduction potential and pH of the scrubber liquor during each 
run of your initial compliance test. The measurements must be within the 
established range for oxidation reduction potential and pH. 
Subsequently, you must monitor the oxidation reduction potential and pH 
of the scrubber liquor continuously and maintain it within the 
established operating range.
    (d) If you have an exceedance of a control device operating 
parameter range provided in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, you 
must take corrective action and bring the parameters back into the 
established parametric ranges. If the corrective actions taken following 
an exceedance do not result in the operating parameter value being 
returned within the established range within 48 hours, a mercury 
concentration measurement (with PS 12B or PS 12A CEMS (40 CFR part 60, 
appendix B and Procedure 5 of appendix F), Method 30B or Method 29 (40 
CFR part 60, appendix A-8), or ASTM D6784 (incorporated by reference--
see Sec. 63.14)) must be made to determine if the operating limit for 
mercury concentration is being exceeded. The measurement must be 
performed and the mercury concentration determined within 48 hours 
(after the initial 48 hours, or a total of 96 hours from the time the 
parameter range was exceeded). If the measured mercury concentration 
meets the operating limit for mercury concentration established under 
Sec. 63.11647(a)(4), the corrective actions are deemed successful, and 
the owner or operator can request the permit authority to establish a 
new limit or range for the parameter. If the measured mercury 
concentration exceeds the operating limit for mercury concentration 
after these 96 hours, the exceedance must be reported as a deviation 
within 24 hours to the permitting authority and the owner or operator 
must conduct a full compliance test pursuant to Sec. 63.11646(a) for 
the roaster operations within 40 days to determine if the affected 
source is in compliance with the MACT emission standard. For facilities 
that have roasters and autoclaves, the owner or operator can use the 
results of the previous compliance test for the autoclaves to determine 
the emissions for those process units to be used in the calculations of 
the emissions for the affected source. If the source is determined to be 
in compliance with the MACT emission standard, the compliance test may 
also be used to establish a new operating limit for mercury 
concentration (see paragraph (e) of this section).
    (e) You may submit a request to your permitting authority for 
approval to change the operating limits established under paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section

[[Page 539]]

for the monitoring required in paragraph (a)(1),(a)(2), or (a)(3) of 
this section. In the request, you must demonstrate that the proposed 
change to the operating limit detects changes in levels of mercury 
emission control. An approved change to the operating limit under this 
paragraph only applies until a new operating limit is established during 
the next annual compliance test.
    (f) You must monitor each process unit at each new and existing 
affected source that uses a carbon adsorber to control mercury emissions 
using the procedures in paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section. A 
carbon adsorber may include a fixed carbon bed, carbon filter packs or 
modules, carbon columns, and other variations.
    (1) Continuously sample and analyze the exhaust stream from the 
carbon adsorber for mercury using Method 30B (40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A-8) for a duration of at least the minimum sampling time specified in 
Method 30B and up to one week that includes the period of the annual 
performance test.
    (i) Establish an upper operating limit for the process as determined 
using the mercury concentration measurements from the sorbent trap 
(Method 30B) as calculated from Equation (3) of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17FE11.005

Where:

OLC = mercury concentration operating limit for the carbon adsorber 
          control device on the process as measured using the sorbent 
          trap, (micrograms per cubic meter);
C<INF>trap</INF> = average mercury concentration measured using the 
          sorbent trap during the week that includes the compliance 
          performance test, (micrograms per cubic meter);
EL = emission standard for the affected sources (lb/ton of concentrate);
CT = compliance test results for the affected sources (lb/ton of 
          concentrate).

    (ii) Sample and analyze the exhaust stream from the carbon adsorber 
for mercury at least monthly using Method 30B (40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A-8). When the mercury concentration reaches 75 percent of the operating 
limit, begin weekly sampling and analysis. When the mercury 
concentration reaches 90 percent of the operating limit, replace the 
carbon in the carbon adsorber within 30 days. If mercury concentration 
exceeds the operating limit, change the carbon in the carbon adsorber 
within 30 days and report the deviation to your permitting authority.
    (2) Conduct an initial sampling of the carbon in the carbon bed for 
mercury 90 days after the replacement of the carbon. A representative 
sample must be collected from the inlet of the bed and the exit of the 
bed and analyzed using SW-846 Method 7471B (incorporated by reference--
see Sec. 63.14). The depth to which the sampler is inserted must be 
recorded. The design capacity is established by calculating the average 
carbon loading from the inlet and outlet measurements. Sampling and 
analysis of the carbon bed for mercury must be performed quarterly 
thereafter. When the carbon loading reaches 50 percent of the design 
capacity of the carbon, monthly sampling must be performed until 90 
percent of the carbon loading capacity is reached. The carbon must be 
removed and replaced with fresh carbon no later than 30 days after 
reaching 90 percent of capacity. For carbon designs where there may be 
multiple carbon columns or beds, a representative sample may be 
collected from the first and last column or bed instead of the inlet or 
outlet. If the carbon loading exceeds the design capacity of the carbon, 
change the carbon within 30 days and report the deviation to your 
permitting authority.
    (g) You must monitor gas stream temperature at the inlet to the 
carbon adsorber for each process unit (i.e., carbon kiln, melt furnace, 
etc.) equipped with a carbon adsorber. Establish a

[[Page 540]]

maximum value for the inlet temperature either during the annual 
performance test (required in Sec. 63.11646(a)), according to the 
manufacturer's specifications, or as approved by your permitting 
authority. If you choose to establish the temperature operating limit 
during the performance test, establish the temperature operating limit 
based on either the highest reading during the test or at 10 [deg]F 
higher than the average temperature measured during the performance 
test. Monitor the inlet temperature once per shift. If an inlet 
temperature exceeds the temperature operating limit, you must take 
corrective actions to get the temperature back within the parameter 
operating limit within 48 hours. If the exceedance persists, within 144 
hours of the exceedance, you must sample and analyze the exhaust stream 
from the carbon adsorber using Method 30B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8) 
and compare to an operating limit (calculated pursuant to (f)(1)(i)) or 
you must conduct carbon sampling pursuant to (f)(2) of this section. If 
the concentration measured with Method 30B is below 90 percent of the 
operating limit or the carbon sampling results are below 90 percent of 
the carbon loading capacity, you may set a new temperature operating 
limit 10 [deg]F above the previous operating limit or at an alternative 
level approved by your permit authority. If the concentration is above 
90 percent of the operating limit or above 90 percent of the carbon 
loading capacity you must change the carbon in the bed within 30 days 
and report the event to your permitting authority, and reestablish an 
appropriate maximum temperature limit based on approval of your permit 
authority.
    (h) For each wet scrubber at each new and existing affected source 
not followed by a mercury control system, you must monitor the water 
flow rate (or line pressure) and pressure drop. Establish a minimum 
value as the operating limit for water flow rate (or line pressure) and 
pressure drop either during the performance test required in Sec. 
63.11646(a), according to the manufacturer's specifications, or as 
approved by your permitting authority. If you choose to establish the 
operating limit based on the results of the performance test, the new 
operating limit must be established based on either the lowest value 
during any test run or 10 percent less than the average value measured 
during the test. For wet scrubbers on an autoclave, establish the 
pressure drop range according to manufacturer's specifications. You must 
monitor the water flow rate and pressure drop once per shift and take 
corrective action within 24 hours if any daily average is less than the 
operating limit. If the parameters are not in range within 72 hours, the 
owner or operator must report the deviation to the permitting authority 
and perform a compliance test for the process unit(s) controlled with 
the wet scrubber that has the parameter exceedance within 40 days to 
determine if the affected source is in compliance with the MACT limit. 
For the other process units included in the affected source, the owner 
or operator can use the results of the previous compliance test to 
determine the emissions for those process units to be used in the 
calculations of the emissions for the affected source.
    (i) You may conduct additional compliance tests according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.11646 and re-establish the operating limits 
required in paragraphs (a) through (c) and (f) through (h) of this 
section at any time. You must submit a request to your permitting 
authority for approval to re-establish the operating limits. In the 
request, you must demonstrate that the proposed change to the operating 
limit detects changes in levels of mercury emission control. An approved 
change to the operating limit under this paragraph only applies until a 
new operating limit is established during the next annual compliance 
test.

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 
Sec. 63.2, and in this section as follows:
    Autoclave means a pressure oxidation vessel that is used to treat 
gold ores (primarily sulfide refractory ore) and involves pumping a 
slurry of milled ore into the vessel which is highly pressurized with 
oxygen and heated to temperatures of approximately 350[deg] to 430 
[deg]F.
    Calomel-based mercury control system means a mercury emissions 
control system that uses scrubbers to remove mercury from the gas stream 
of a roaster or combination of roasters by complexing the mercury from 
the gas stream with mercuric chloride to form mercurous chloride 
(calomel). These scrubbers are also referred to as ``mercury 
scrubbers.''
    Carbon adsorber means a control device consisting of a single fixed 
carbon bed, multiple carbon beds or columns, carbon filter packs or 
modules, and other variations that uses activated carbon to remove 
pollutants from a gas stream.
    Carbon kiln means a kiln or furnace where carbon is regenerated by 
heating, usually in the presence of steam, after the gold has been 
stripped from the carbon.
    Carbon processes with mercury retorts means the affected source that 
includes carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning cells, mercury 
retorts, and melt furnaces at gold mine ore processing and production 
facilities that use activated carbon, or resins that can be used as a 
substitute for activated carbon, to recover (adsorb) gold from the 
pregnant cyanide solution.
    Carbon processes without mercury retorts means the affected source 
that includes carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning cells, and melt 
furnaces, but has no retorts, at gold mine ore processing and production 
facilities that use activated carbon, or resins that can be used as a 
substitute for activated carbon, to recover (adsorb) gold from the 
pregnant cyanide solution.
    Concentrate means the sludge-like material that is loaded with gold 
along with various other metals (such as silver, copper, and mercury) 
and various other substances, that is produced by electrowinning, the 
Merrill-Crowe process, flotation and gravity separation processes. 
Concentrate is measured as the input to mercury retorts, or for 
facilities without mercury retorts, as the input to melt furnaces before 
any drying takes place. For facilities without mercury retorts or melt 
furnaces, concentrate is measured as the quantity shipped.
    Deviation means any instance where an affected source subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or work 
practice standard;
    (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement 
an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the 
operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a 
permit; or
    (3) Exceeds any operating limit established under this subpart.
    Electrowinning means a process that uses induced voltage on anode 
and cathode plates to remove metals from the continuous flow of

wool is typically used as the plating surface.
    Electrowinning Cells means a tank in which the electrowinning takes 
place.
    Gold mine ore processing and production facility means any 
industrial facility engaged in the processing of gold mine ore that uses 
any of the following processes: Roasting operations,

autoclaves, carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning, mercury retorts, 
or melt furnaces. Laboratories (see CAA section 112(c)(7)), individual 
prospectors, and very small pilot scale mining operations that processes 
or produces less than 100 pounds of concentrate per year are not a gold 
mine ore processing and production facility. A facility that produces 
primarily metals other than gold, such as copper, lead, zinc, or nickel 
(where these metals other than gold comprise 95 percent or more of the 
total metal production) that may also recover some gold as a byproduct 
is not a gold mine ore processing and production facility. Those 
facilities whereby 95 percent or more of total mass of metals produced 
are metals other than gold, whether final metal production is onsite or 
offsite, are not part of the gold mine ore processing and production 
source category.
    Melt furnace means a furnace (typically a crucible furnace) that is 
used for smelting the gold-bearing material recovered from mercury 
retorting, or the gold-bearing material from electrowinning, the 
Merrill-Crowe process, or other processes for facilities without mercury 
retorts.
    Mercury retort means a vessel that is operated under a partial 
vacuum at approximately 1,100 [deg] to 1,300 [deg]F to remove mercury 
and moisture from the gold bearing sludge material that is recovered 
from electrowinning, the Merrill-Crowe process, or other processes. 
Mercury retorts are usually equipped with condensers that recover liquid 
mercury during the processing.
    Merrill-Crowe process means a precipitation technique using zinc 
oxide for removing gold from a cyanide solution. Zinc dust is added to 
the solution, and gold is precipitated to produce a concentrate.
    Non-carbon concentrate processes means the affected source that 
includes mercury retorts and melt furnaces at gold mine ore processing 
and production facilities that use the Merrill-Crowe process or other 
processes and do not use carbon (or resins that substitute for carbon) 
to recover (adsorb) gold from the pregnant cyanide solution.
    Ore dry grinding means a process in which the gold ore is ground and 
heated (dried) prior to additional preheating or prior to entering the 
roaster.
    Ore preheating means a process in which ground gold ore is preheated 
prior to entering the roaster.
    Ore pretreatment processes means the affected source that includes 
roasting operations and autoclaves that are used to pre-treat gold mine 
ore at gold mine ore processing and production facilities prior to the 
cyanide leaching process.
    Pregnant solution tank (or preg tank) means a storage tank for 
pregnant solution, which is the cyanide solution that contains gold-
cyanide complexes that is generated from leaching gold ore with cyanide 
solution.
    Pregnant cyanide solution means the cyanide solution that contains 
gold-cyanide complexes that are generated from leaching gold ore with a 
dilute cyanide solution.
    Quenching means a process in which the hot calcined ore is cooled 
and quenched with water after it leaves the roaster.
    Roasting operation means a process that uses an industrial furnace 
in which milled ore is combusted across a fluidized bed to oxidize and 
remove organic carbon and sulfide mineral grains in refractory gold ore. 
The emissions points of the roasting operation subject to this subpart 
include ore dry grinding, ore preheating, the roaster stack, and 
quenching.

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11885  What parts of the General Provisions apply to me?

    Table 4 to this subpart specifies which parts of the General 
Provisions in subpart A of this part apply to you.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11890  What are my additional general requirements for complying with 

this subpart?

    (a) The emission limits, operating limits and work practice 
standards specified in this subpart apply at all times, including 
periods of startup, shutdown or malfunction.
    (b) At all times, you must operate and maintain your affected 
source, including associated air pollution control components and 
monitoring system components, in a manner consistent with safety and 
good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. 
Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures 
are being used will be based on information available to the 
Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring 
results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of 
operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
    (c) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate all 
monitoring system components according to Sec. Sec. 63.8, 63.11935(b) 
and (c), and paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs 
associated with monitoring system malfunctions and required monitoring 
system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must operate the continuous monitoring system

[[Page 547]]

at all times the affected source is operating. A monitoring system 
malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable 
failure of the monitoring system to provide data. Monitoring system 
failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless 
operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring 
system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to 
return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as 
practicable.
    (2) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system 
malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or 
required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in 
calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use 
all the data collected during all other required data collection periods 
in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control 
system. You must report any periods for which the monitoring system 
failed to collect required data.
    (d) A deviation means any of the cases listed in paragraphs (d)(1) 
through (7) of this section.
    (1) Any instance in which an affected source subject to this 
subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source, fails to meet any 
requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including, but 
not limited to, any emission limit, operating limit or work practice 
standard.
    (2) When a performance test indicates that emissions of a pollutant 
in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart are exceeding the emission standard for 
the pollutant specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
    (3) When a 3-hour block average from a continuous emissions monitor, 
as required by Sec. 63.11925(c)(1) through (3), exceeds an emission 
limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
    (4) When the average value of a monitored operating parameter, based 
on the data averaging period for compliance specified in Table 5 to this 
subpart, does not meet the operating limit established in Sec. 
63.11880(b).
    (5) When an affected source discharges directly to the atmosphere 
from any of the sources specified in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (iv) 
of this section.
    (i) A pressure relief device, as defined in Sec. 63.12005.
    (ii) A bypass, as defined in Sec. 63.12005.
    (iii) A closed vent system in vacuum service.
    (iv) A closure device on a pressure vessel.
    (6) Any instance in which the affected source subject to this 
subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source, fails to meet any 
term or condition specified in paragraph (d)(6)(i) or (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) Any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable 
requirement in this subpart.
    (ii) Any term or condition relating to compliance with this subpart 
that is included in the operating permit for any affected source 
required to obtain such a permit.
    (7) Any failure to collect required data, except for periods of 
monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring 
system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or 
quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks 
and required zero and span adjustments).


<R05>
Sec. 63.11895  How do I assert an affirmative defense for exceedance of 

emission standard during malfunction?

    In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in Sec. 
63.11880, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil 
penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by 
malfunction, as defined at 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be 
assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the 
requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall 
not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
    (a) Evidence. To establish the affirmative defense in any action to 
enforce such a standard, you must timely meet the notification 
requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a 
preponderance of evidence that:
    (1) The violation:
    (i) Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of 
air pollution control and monitoring

[[Page 548]]

equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or 
usual manner.
    (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper 
design or better operation and maintenance practices.
    (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been 
foreseen and avoided, or planned for.
    (iv) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate 
design, operation or maintenance.
    (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when violation 
occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent 
practicable to make these repairs.
    (3) The frequency, amount and duration of the violation (including 
any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable.
    (4) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or 
a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, 
personal injury, or severe property damage.
    (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the 
violations on ambient air quality, the environment and human health.
    (6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in 
operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air 
pollution control practices.
    (7) All of the actions in response to the violations were documented 
by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs.
    (8) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner 
consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions.
    (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of 
which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the 
malfunction and the violations resulting from the malfunction event at 
issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods 
and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the 
result of the malfunction.
    (b) Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative 
defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator in the 
compliance report required by Sec. 63.11985(b) with all necessary 
supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11896  What am I required to do if I make a process change at my 

affected source?

    If you make a process change to an existing affected source that 
does not meet the criteria to become a new affected source in Sec. 
63.11870(d), you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (a) of

<R05>
Sec. 63.11910  What are my initial and continuous compliance requirements for 

storage vessels?

    You must comply with the requirements specified in Table 3 to this 
subpart for each storage vessel in HAP service.
    (a) For each fixed roof storage vessel used to comply with the 
requirements specified in Table 3 to this subpart, you must meet the 
requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section. If you 
elect to use a fixed roof storage vessel vented to a closed vent system 
and control device, the closed vent system and control device must meet 
the requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.11925 through 63.11950.
    (1) Design requirements. (i) The fixed roof must be installed in a 
manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open 
spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the roof 
edge and the tank wall.
    (ii) Each opening in the fixed roof must be equipped with a closure 
device designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured 
in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or 
other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the 
opening and the closure device.
    (2) Operating requirements. (i) Except as specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section, the fixed roof must be installed with each 
closure device secured in the closed position.

    (ii) Opening of closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is 
allowed under conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) 
of this section.
    (A) A closure device may be opened or the roof may be removed when 
needed to provide access.
    (B) A conservation vent that vents to the atmosphere is allowed 
during normal operations to maintain the tank internal operating 
pressure within tank design specifications. Normal operating conditions 
that may require these devices to open are during those times when the 
internal pressure of the storage vessel is outside the internal pressure 
operating range for the storage vessel as a result of loading or 
unloading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.
    (iii) During periods of planned routine maintenance of a control 
device, operate the storage vessel in accordance with paragraphs 
(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section. You must keep the records 
specified in Sec. 63.11990(b)(6).
    (A) Do not add material to the storage vessel during periods of 
planned routine maintenance.
    (B) Limit periods of planned routine maintenance for each control 
device to no more than 360 hours per year (hr/yr).
    (3) Inspection and monitoring requirements. (i) Visually inspect the 
fixed roof and its closure devices for defects initially and at least 
once per calendar year except as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
this section. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, 
holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the wall of 
the storage vessel; broken, cracked or otherwise damaged seals, or 
gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access 
covers, caps or other closure devices.
    (ii) The inspection requirement specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of 
this section does not apply to parts of the fixed roof that you 
determine are unsafe to inspect because operating personnel would be 
exposed to an imminent or potential danger as a consequence of complying 
with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, provided you comply with the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this 
section.
    (A) You prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation 
that identifies all parts of the fixed roof that are unsafe to inspect 
and explains why such parts are unsafe to inspect.
    (B) You develop and implement a written plan and schedule to conduct 
inspections the next time alternative storage capacity becomes available 
and the storage vessel can be emptied or temporarily removed from 
service, as necessary, to complete the inspection. The required 
inspections must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not 
need to be performed more than once per calendar year. You must maintain 
a copy of the written plan and schedule at the plant site.
    (4) Repair requirements. (i) Complete repair of a defect as soon as 
possible, but no later than 45 days after detection. You must comply 
with the requirements in this paragraph (a)(4)(i) except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 days if you 
determine that repair of the defect requires emptying or temporary 
removal from service of the storage vessel and no alternative storage 
capacity is available at the site to accept the removed material. In 
this case, repair the defect the next time alternative storage capacity 
becomes available and the storage vessel can be emptied or temporarily 
removed from service.
    (b) If you elect to use an internal floating roof storage vessel or 
external floating roof storage vessel to comply with the requirements 
specified in Table 3 to this subpart, you must meet all requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 63.1060 through 63.1067 of subpart WW of this part for 
internal floating roof storage vessels or external floating roof storage 
vessels, as applicable.
    (c) For each pressure vessel used to comply with the requirements 
specified in Table 3 to this subpart, you must meet the requirements in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) Whenever the pressure vessel is in hazardous air pollutants 
(HAP) service, you must operate the pressure vessel as a closed system 
that does not vent to the atmosphere, e.g., during filling, emptying and 
purging. The vent stream during filling, emptying and

[[Page 551]]

purging must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.11925(a) and (b).
    (2) Each opening in the pressure vessel must be equipped with a 
closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is 
secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps 
or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of 
the opening and the closure device.
    (3) All potential leak interfaces must be monitored annually for 
leaks using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.11915 and you may 
adjust for background concentration. You must comply with the 
recordkeeping provisions specified in Sec. 63.11990(b)(4) and the 
reporting provisions specified in Sec. 63.11985(a)(1), (b)(1), and 
(b)(10).
    (4) Pressure vessel closure devices must not discharge to the 
atmosphere. Any such release (e.g., leak) constitutes a violation of 
this rule. You must submit to the Administrator as part of your 
compliance report the information specified in Sec. 63.11985(b)(10). 
This report is required even if you elect to follow the procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.11895 to establish an affirmative defense.

section.
    (1) Rotating pumps. HAP emissions from seals on all rotating pumps 
in HAP service are to be minimized by either installing sealless pumps, 
pumps with double mechanical seals or equivalent equipment, or by 
complying with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart UU for 
rotating pumps. If double mechanical seals are used, emissions from the 
seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure between the two 
seals so that any leak that occurs is into the pump; by complying with 
Sec. 63.11925(a) and (b); or equivalent equipment or procedures 
approved by the Administrator.
    (2) Reciprocating pumps, rotating compressors, reciprocating 
compressors and agitators. HAP emissions from seals on all reciprocating 
pumps, rotating compressors, reciprocating compressors and agitators in 
HAP service are to be minimized by either installing double mechanical 
seals or equivalent equipment, or by complying with the requirements of 
40 CFR part 63, subpart UU for reciprocating pumps, rotating 
compressors, reciprocating compressors and/or agitators. If double 
mechanical seals are used, HAP emissions from the seals are to be 
minimized by maintaining the pressure between the two seals so that any 
leak that occurs is into the pump; by complying with Sec. 63.11925(a) 
and (b); or equivalent equipment or procedures approved by the 
Administrator.
    (c) Requirements for pressure relief devices. For pressure relief 
devices in HAP service, as defined in Sec. 63.12005, you must meet the 
requirements of this paragraph (c) and paragraph (a) of this section, 
you must comply with the recordkeeping provisions in Sec. 63.11990(c), 
and you must comply with the reporting provisions in Sec. Sec. 
63.11985(a)(2), (b)(2) and (c)(7).
    (1) For pressure relief devices in HAP service that discharge 
directly to the atmosphere without first meeting the process vent 
emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart by routing the discharge 
to a closed vent system and control device designed and operated in 
accordance with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.11925 through 
63.11950, you must install, maintain, and operate release indicators as 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. Any release 
to the atmosphere without meeting the process vent emission limits in 
Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, constitutes a violation of this rule. You 
must submit the report specified in Sec. 63.11985(c)(7), as described 
in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.

[[Page 552]]

    (i) A release indicator must be properly installed on each pressure 
relief device in such a way that it will indicate when an emission 
release has occurred.
    (ii) Each indicator must be equipped with an alert system that will 
notify an operator immediately and automatically when the pressure 
relief device is open. The alert must be located such that the signal is 
detected and recognized easily by an operator.
    (iii) For any instance that the release indicator indicates that a 
pressure relief device is open, you must notify operators that a 
pressure release has occurred, and, within 10 days of the release, you 
must submit to the Administrator the report specified in Sec. 
63.11985(c)(7). This report is required even if you elect to follow the 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.11895 to establish an affirmative 
defense.
    (2) For pressure relief devices in HAP service that discharge 
directly to a closed vent system and control device designed and 
operated in accordance with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.11925 
through 63.11950, and are required to meet process vent emission limits 
in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart. Any release to the atmosphere without 
meeting the process vent emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this 
subpart, constitutes a violation of this rule. You must notify operators 
that a pressure release has occurred, and, within 10 days of the 
release, you must submit to the Administrator the report specified in 
Sec. 63.11985(c)(7). This report is required even if you elect to 
follow the procedures specified in Sec. 63.11895(b) to establish an 
affirmative defense.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11920  What are my initial and continuous compliance requirements for 

heat exchange systems?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must 
perform monitoring to identify leaks of volatile organic compounds from 
each heat exchange system in HAP service subject to the requirements of 
this subpart according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(4) of this section.
    (1) Monitoring locations for closed-loop recirculation heat exchange 
systems. For each closed loop recirculating heat exchange system, you 
must collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in 
either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) Each cooling tower return line prior to exposure to air for each 
heat exchange system in HAP service.
    (ii) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s) so that each heat 
exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is 
covered by the selected monitoring location(s).
    (2) Monitoring locations for once-through heat exchange systems. For 
each once-through heat exchange system, you must collect and analyze a 
sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section. You may also elect to collect and analyze an additional sample 
from the location(s) described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (i) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s) so that each heat exchanger 
or group of heat exchangers in HAP service within a heat exchange system 
is covered by the selected monitoring location(s).
    (ii) The inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange 
system prior to any heat exchanger. If multiple heat exchange systems 
use the same water feed (i.e., inlet water from the same primary water 
source), you may monitor at one representative location and use the 
monitoring results for that sampling location for all heat exchange 
systems that use that same water feed.
    (3) Monitoring method. You must determine the total strippable 
volatile organic compounds concentration or vinyl chloride concentration 
at each monitoring location using one of the analytical methods 
specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Determine the total strippable volatile organic compounds 
concentration (in parts per million by volume) as methane from the air 
stripping testing system using Modified El Paso Method (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 63.14) using a flame ionization detector analyzer.
    (ii) Determine the total strippable volatile organic compounds 
concentration (in parts per billion by weight) in the cooling water 
using Method 624 at 40 CFR part 136, appendix A. The target

[[Page 553]]

list of compounds shall be generated based on a pre-survey sample and 
analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and process knowledge 
to include all compounds that can potentially leak into the cooling 
water. If Method 624 of part 136, appendix A is not applicable for all 
compounds that can potentially leak into the cooling water for a given 
heat exchange system, you cannot use this monitoring method for that 
heat exchange system.
    (iii) Determine the vinyl chloride concentration (in parts per 
billion by weight) in the cooling water using Method 107 at 40 CFR part 
61, appendix A.
    (4) Monitoring frequency. You must determine the total strippable 
volatile organic compounds or vinyl chloride concentration at each 
monitoring location at the frequencies specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) 
and (ii) of this section.
    (i) For heat exchange systems for which you have not delayed repair 
of any leaks, monitor at least monthly. You may elect to monitor more 
frequently than the minimum frequency specified in this paragraph.
    (ii) If you elect to monitor the inlet water feed line for a once-
through heat exchange system as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section, you must monitor the inlet water feed line at the same 
frequency used to monitor the heat exchange exit line(s), as required in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
    (b) A heat exchange system is not subject to the monitoring 
requirements in paragraph (a) of this section if it meets any one of the 
criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) All heat exchangers that are in HAP service within the heat 
exchange system operate with the minimum pressure on the cooling water 
side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the maximum pressure on the 
process side.
    (2) The heat exchange system does not contain any heat exchangers 
that are in HAP service.
    (3) The heat exchange system has a maximum cooling water flow rate 
of 10 gallons per minute or less.
    (c) The leak action levels for both existing and new sources are 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) If you elect to monitor your heat exchange system by using the 
monitoring method specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, then 
the leak action level is a total strippable volatile organic compounds 
concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 3.9 parts per million 
by volume.
    (2) If you elect to monitor your heat exchange system by using the 
monitoring method specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, 
then the leak action level is a total strippable volatile organic 
compounds concentration in the cooling water of 50 parts per billion by 
weight.
    (3) If you elect to monitor your heat exchange system by using the 
monitoring method specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, 
then the leak action level is a vinyl chloride concentration in the 
cooling water of 50 parts per billion by weight.
    (d) A leak is defined as specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of 
this section, as applicable.
    (1) For once-through heat exchange systems for which you monitor the 
inlet water feed, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, 
a leak is detected if the difference in the measurement value of the 
sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from 
the location specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section equals or 
exceeds the leak action level.
    (2) For all other heat exchange systems, a leak is detected if a 
measurement value taken according to the requirements in paragraph (a) 
of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
    (e) If a leak is detected, you must repair the leak to reduce the 
measured concentration to below the applicable action level as soon as 
practicable, but no later than 45 days after identifying the leak, 
except as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section. Repair 
includes re-monitoring as specified in paragraph (a) of this section to 
verify that the measured concentration is below the applicable action 
level.

[[Page 554]]

Actions that you can take to achieve repair include but are not limited 
to:
    (1) Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as 
welding the leak or replacing a tube;
    (2) Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;
    (3) Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process 
fluid;
    (4) Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or
    (5) Isolating, bypassing or otherwise removing the leaking heat 
exchanger from service until it is otherwise repaired.
    (f) If you detect a leak when monitoring a cooling tower return line 
or heat exchanger exit line under paragraph (a) of this section, you may 
conduct additional monitoring following the requirements in paragraph 
(a) of this section to further isolate each heat exchanger or group of 
heat exchangers in HAP service within the heat exchange system for which 
the leak was detected. If you do not detect any leaks when conducting 
additional monitoring for each heat exchanger or group of heat 
exchangers, the heat exchange system is excluded from repair 
requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) The delay of repair action level is defined as either a total 
strippable volatile organic compounds concentration (as methane) in the 
stripping gas of 39 parts per million by volume or a total strippable 
volatile organic compounds concentration in the cooling water of 500 
parts per billion by weight or a vinyl chloride concentration in the 
cooling water of 500 parts per billion by weight. While you remain below 
the repair action level, you may delay the repair of a leaking heat 
exchanger only if one of the conditions in paragraphs (g)(1) or (2) of 
this section is met. If you exceed the repair action level you must 
repair according to paragraph (e) of this section. You must determine if 
a delay of repair is necessary as soon as practicable, but no later than 
45 days after first identifying the leak.
    (1) If the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and 
the total strippable volatile organic compounds or vinyl chloride 
concentration is initially and remains less than the delay of repair 
action level for all monitoring periods during the delay of repair, you 
may delay repair until the next scheduled shutdown of the heat exchange 
system. If, during subsequent monitoring, the total strippable volatile 
organic compounds or vinyl chloride concentration is equal to or greater 
than the delay of repair action level, you must repair the leak within 
30 days of the monitoring event in which the total strippable volatile 
organic compounds or vinyl chloride concentration was equal to or 
exceeded the delay of repair action level.
    (2) If the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel are not 
available and the total strippable volatile organic compounds or vinyl 
chloride concentration is initially and remains less than the delay of 
repair action level for all monitoring periods during the delay of 
repair, you may delay the repair for a maximum of 120 days from the day 
the leak was first identified. You must demonstrate that the necessary 
equipment, parts or personnel were not available. If, during subsequent 
monthly monitoring, the total strippable volatile organic compounds or 
vinyl chloride concentration is equal to or greater than the delay of 
repair action level, you must repair the leak within 30 days of the 
monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the total 
strippable volatile organic compounds or vinyl chloride delay of repair 
action level.
    (h) To delay the repair under paragraph (g) of this section, you 
must record the information in paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this 
section.
    (1) The reason(s) for delaying repair.
    (2) A schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.
    (3) The date and concentration of the leak as first identified and 
the results of all subsequent monitoring events during the delay of 
repair.
    (4) An estimate of the potential emissions from the leaking heat 
exchange system following the procedures in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) Determine the total strippable volatile organic compounds or 
vinyl chloride concentration in the cooling water, in parts per billion 
by weight. If the Modified El Paso Method is used, calculate the total 
strippable volatile

[[Page 555]]

organic compounds concentration in the cooling water using equation 7-1 
from Modified El Paso Method (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
63.14) and the total strippable volatile organic compounds concentration 
measured in the stripped air.
    (ii) Calculate the emissions for the leaking heat exchange system by 
multiplying the volatile organic compounds or vinyl chloride 
concentration in the cooling water, ppbw, by the flow rate of the 
cooling water at the selected monitoring location and by the expected 
duration of the delay according to Equation 1 of this section. The flow 
rate may be based on direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance 
calculations or other engineering methods.

specific monitoring plan. You must continuously determine the average 
value of each monitored operating parameter based on the data collection 
and reduction methods specified in Sec. Sec. 63.11935(c)(2) and 
63.11935(e), and the applicable data averaging period for compliance 
specified in Table 5 to this subpart for all periods the process is 
operating. For a CPMS used on a batch operation, you may use a data 
averaging period based on an operating block in lieu of the averaging 
periods specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
    (C) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating 
limit established in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section using these 
average values calculated in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.

an emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart must be operated at 
all times when emissions are vented to, or collected by, these systems 
or devices.
    (f) To demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan toxic 
equivalency emission limit specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, 
you must determine dioxin/furan toxic equivalency as specified in 
paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan (tetra-through 
octachlorinated) congener emitted using Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A-7.
    (2) For each dioxin/furan (tetra-through octachlorinated) congener 
measured in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, multiply 
the congener concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor 
specified in Table 6 to this subpart.
    (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans 
emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
    (g) Emission profile. You must characterize each process vent by 
developing an emissions profile for each contributing continuous process 
vent, miscellaneous vent and batch process vent according to paragraphs 
(g)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) For batch process vents, the emissions profile must:
    (i) Describe the characteristics of the batch process vent under 
worst-case conditions.
    (ii) Determine emissions per episode and batch process vent 
emissions according to the procedures specified in Sec. 63.11950.
    (2) For continuous process vents, the flow rate and concentration 
must be determined according to paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) or 
according to paragraph (g)(2)(iv):
    (i)(A) Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1, as 
appropriate, shall

[[Page 558]]

be used for selection of the sampling site. The sampling site shall be 
after the last recovery device (if any recovery devices are present) but 
prior to being combined with any other continuous process vent, batch 
process vent, or miscellaneous vent, prior to the inlet of any control 
device that is present and prior to release to the atmosphere.
    (B) No traverse site selection method is needed for vents smaller 
than 0.10 meter in diameter.
    (ii) The gas volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Method 
2, 2A, 2C or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1, as appropriate.
    (iii) (A) Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6 or Method 25A of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 shall be used to measure concentration; 
alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated 
according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of this part may 
be used.
    (B) Where Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6 is used, the 
following procedures shall be used to calculate parts per million by 
volume concentration:
    (1) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which 
either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal 
intervals in time, such as 15-minute intervals during the run.
    (2) The concentration of either total organic compounds (TOC) (minus 
methane and ethane) or organic HAP shall be calculated according to 
paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B)(2)(i) or (g)(2)(iii)(B)(2)(ii) of this section 
as applicable.
    (i) The TOC concentration (C<INF>TOC</INF>) is the sum of the 
concentrations of the individual components and shall be computed for 
each run using Equation 1 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17AP12.001

Where:

C<INF>TOC</INF> = Concentration of TOC (minus methane and ethane), dry 
          basis, parts per million by volume.
C<INF>ji</INF> = Concentration of sample component j of the sample i, 
          dry basis, parts per million by volume.
n = Number of components in the sample.
x = Number of samples in the sample run.

    (ii) The total organic HAP concentration (CHAP) shall be computed 
according to Equation 1 of this section except that only the organic HAP 
species shall be summed. The list of organic HAP is provided in Table 2 
to subpart F of this part.
    (C) Where Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 is used, the 
following procedures shall be used to calculate parts per million by 
volume TOC concentration:
    (1) Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, shall be used only 
if a single organic HAP compound is greater than 50 percent of total 
organic HAP, by volume, in the vent stream.
    (2) The vent stream composition may be determined by either process 
knowledge, test data collected using an appropriate EPA method, or a 
method or data validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of 
appendix A of this part. Examples of information that could constitute 
process knowledge include calculations based on material balances, 
process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are 
still relevant to the current vent stream conditions.
    (3) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A-7 shall be the single organic HAP compound 
present at greater than 50 percent of the total organic HAP by volume.

[[Page 559]]

    (4) The span value for Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 
shall be 50 parts per million by volume.
    (5) Use of Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 is acceptable 
if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times 
the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas 
when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
    (iv) Engineering assessment including, but not limited to, the 
following:
    (A) Previous test results provided the tests are representative of 
current operating practices at the process unit.
    (B) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data representative of the 
process under representative operating conditions.
    (C) Maximum flow rate, TOC emission rate, organic HAP emission rate, 
or net heating value limit specified or implied within a permit limit 
applicable to the process vent.
    (D) Design analysis based on accepted chemical engineering 
principles, measurable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws 
or properties. Examples of analytical methods include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Use of material balances based on process stoichiometry to 
estimate maximum organic HAP concentrations,
    (2) Estimation of maximum flow rate based on physical equipment 
design such as pump or blower capacities,
    (3) Estimation of TOC or organic HAP concentrations based on 
saturation conditions,
    (4) Estimation of maximum expected net heating value based on the 
vent stream concentration of each organic compound or, alternatively, as 
if all TOC in the vent stream were the compound with the highest heating 
value.
    (E) All data, assumptions, and procedures used in the engineering 
assessment shall be documented.
    (3) For miscellaneous process vents the emissions profile must be 
determined according to paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (h) Process changes. Except for temporary shutdowns for maintenance 
activities, if you make a process change such that, as a result of that 
change, you are subject to a different process vent limit in Table 1 or 
2 to this subpart, then you must meet the requirements of Sec. 
63.11896.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11930  What requirements must I meet for closed vent systems?

    (a) General. To route emissions from process vents subject to the 
emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart to a control device, you 
must use a closed vent system and meet the requirements of this section 
and all provisions referenced in this section. However, if you operate 
and maintain your closed vent system in vacuum service as defined in 
Sec. 63.12005, you must meet the requirements in paragraph (h) of this 
section and are not required to meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) 
through (g) of this section.
    (b) Collection of emissions. Each closed vent system must be 
designed and operated to collect the HAP vapors from each continuous 
process vent, miscellaneous process vent and batch process vent, and to 
route the collected vapors to a control device.
    (c) Bypass. For each closed vent system that contains a bypass as 
defined in Sec. 63.12005 (e.g., diverting a vent stream away from the 
control device), you must not discharge to the atmosphere through the 
bypass. Any such release constitutes a violation of this rule. The use 
of any bypass diverted to the atmosphere during a performance test 
invalidates the performance test. You must comply with the provisions of 
either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section for each closed vent 
system that contains a bypass that could divert a vent stream to the 
atmosphere.
    (1) Bypass flow indicator. Install, maintain, and operate a flow 
indicator as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this 
section.
    (i) The flow indicator must be properly installed at the entrance to 
any bypass.
    (ii) The flow indicator must be equipped with an alarm system that 
will alert an operator immediately, and automatically when flow is 
detected in the bypass. The alarm must be located such that the alert is 
detected and recognized easily by an operator.
    (iii) If the alarm is triggered, you must immediately initiate 
procedures to identify the cause of the alarm. If

[[Page 560]]

any closed vent system has discharged to the atmosphere through a vent 
or bypass, you must initiate procedures to stop the bypass discharge.
    (iv) For any instances where the flow indicator alarm is triggered, 
you must submit to the Administrator as part of your compliance report, 
the information specified in Sec. 63.11985(b)(9) and (10). This report 
is required even if you elect to follow the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.11895 to establish an affirmative defense and submit the 
reports specified in Sec. 63.11985(b)(11).
    (2) Bypass valve configuration. Secure the bypass valve in the non-
diverting position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration.
    (i) You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least 
once every month to verify that the valve is maintained in the non-
diverting position, and the vent stream is not diverted through the 
bypass. A broken seal or closure mechanism or a diverted valve 
constitutes a violation from the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this 
subpart. You must maintain the records specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) 
of this section.
    (ii) For each seal or closure mechanism, you must comply with either 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) For each instance that you change the bypass valve to the 
diverting position, you must submit to the Administrator as part of your 
compliance report, the information specified in Sec. 63.11985(b)(9) and 
(10). This report is required even if you elect to follow the procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.11895 to establish an affirmative defense and 
submit the reports specified in Sec. 63.11985(b)(11).
    (B) You must install, maintain, and operate a bypass flow indicator 
as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section and you 
must meet the requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this 
section for each instance that the flow indicator alarm is triggered.
    (d) Closed vent system inspection and monitoring requirements. 
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, you must inspect 
each closed vent system as specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this 
section.
    (1) Hard-piping inspection. If the closed vent system is constructed 
of hard-piping, you must comply with the requirements specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (ii) Conduct annual inspections for visible, audible, or olfactory 
indications of leaks.
    (2) Ductwork inspection. If the closed vent system is constructed of 
ductwork, you must conduct initial and annual inspections according to 
the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Equipment that is unsafe to inspect. You may designate any parts 
of the closed vent system as unsafe to inspect if you determine that 
personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of 
complying with the initial and annual closed vent system inspection 
requirements of this subpart.
    (e) Closed vent system inspection procedures. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section, you must comply with all provisions of 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) General. Inspections must be performed during periods when HAP 
is being collected by or vented through the closed vent system. A leak 
is indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 parts per million 
by volume above background or by visual inspection.
    (2) Inspection procedures. Each closed vent system subject to this 
paragraph (e)(2) must be inspected according to the procedures specified 
in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section.
    (i) Inspections must be conducted in accordance with Method 21 at 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A-7, except as otherwise specified in this 
section.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, 
the detection instrument must meet the performance criteria of Method 21 
at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, except the instrument response factor 
criteria in section 8.1.1.2 of Method 21 must be for the representative 
composition of the process fluid and not of each individual volatile 
organic compound in the stream. For process streams that contain 
nitrogen, air, water or other inerts that are not organic HAP or 
volatile organic

[[Page 561]]

compound, the representative stream response factor must be determined 
on an inert-free basis. You may determine the response factor at any 
concentration for which you will monitor for leaks.
    (iii) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet 
the performance criteria of Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 
specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the instrument 
readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the representative response 
factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as 
described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) The detection instrument must be calibrated before use on each 
day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 at 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A-7.
    (v) Calibration gases must be as specified in paragraphs 
(e)(2)(v)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million by volume hydrocarbon 
in air).
    (B) Mixtures of methane in air at a concentration less than 10,000 
parts per million by volume. A calibration gas other than methane in air 
may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the 
instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph 
(e)(2)(ii) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a 
mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
    (C) If the detection instrument's design allows for multiple 
calibration scales, then the lower scale must be calibrated with a 
calibration gas that is no higher than 2,500 parts per million by 
volume.
    (D) Perform a calibration drift assessment, at a minimum, at the end 
of each monitoring day. Check the instrument using the same calibration 
gas(es) that were used to calibrate the instrument before use. Follow 
the procedures specified in Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, 
section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to 
the calibration gas value. Record the instrument reading for each scale 
used as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section. Divide these 
readings by the initial calibration values for each scale and multiply 
by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage. If any 
calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 
percent from the initial calibration value, then all equipment monitored 
since the last calibration with instrument readings below the 
appropriate leak definition and above the leak definition multiplied by 
the value specified in paragraph (e)(2)(v)(D)(1) of this section must be 
re-monitored. If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift 
of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at 
your discretion, all equipment since the last calibration with 
instrument readings above the appropriate leak definition and below the 
leak definition multiplied by the value specified in paragraph 
(e)(2)(v)(D)(2) of this section may be re-monitored.
    (1) 100 minus the percent of negative drift, divided by 100.
    (2) 100 plus the percent of positive drift, divided by 100.
    (vi) You may elect to adjust or not adjust instrument readings for 
background. If you elect not to adjust readings for background, all such 
instrument readings must be compared directly to 500 parts per million 
by volume to determine whether there is a leak. If you elect to adjust 
instrument readings for background, you must measure background 
concentration using the procedures in this section. You must subtract 
the background reading from the maximum concentration indicated by the 
instrument.
    (vii) If you elect to adjust for background, the arithmetic 
difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument 
and the background level must be compared with 500 parts per million by 
volume for determining whether there is a leak.
    (3) Instrument probe. The instrument probe must be traversed around 
all potential leak interfaces as described in Method 21 at 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A-7.
    (4) Unsafe-to-inspect written plan requirements. For equipment 
designated as unsafe to inspect according to the provisions of paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section, you must maintain and follow a written plan that 
requires inspecting

[[Page 562]]

the equipment as frequently as practical during safe-to-inspect times, 
but not more frequently than the annual inspection schedule otherwise 
applicable. You must still repair unsafe-to-inspect equipment according 
to the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section if a leak is 
detected.
    (f) Closed vent system leak repair provisions. The provisions of 
this paragraph (f) apply to closed vent systems collecting HAP from an 
affected source.
    (1) Leak repair general for hard-piping. If there are visible, 
audible, or olfactory indications of leaks at the time of the annual 
visual inspections required by paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, you 
must follow the procedure specified in either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) You must eliminate the leak.
    (ii) You must monitor the equipment according to the procedures in 
paragraph (e) of this section and comply with the leak repair provisions 
in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (2) Leak repair schedule. Leaks must be repaired as soon as 
practical, except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (i) A first attempt at repair must be made no later than 5 days 
after the leak is detected.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, repairs 
must be completed no later than 15 days after the leak is detected or at 
the beginning of the next introduction of vapors to the system, 
whichever is later.
    (3) Delay of repair. Delay of repair of a closed vent system for 
which leaks have been detected is allowed if repair within 15 days after 
a leak is detected is technically infeasible or unsafe without a closed 
vent system shutdown or if you determine that emissions resulting from 
immediate repair would be greater than the emissions likely to result 
from delay of repair. Repair of such equipment must be completed as soon 
as practical, but not later than the end of the next closed vent system 
shutdown.
    (g) Closed vent system records. For closed vent systems, you must 
record the information specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of 
this section, as applicable.
    (1) Bypass records. For each closed vent system that contains a 
bypass that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and 
to the atmosphere, or cause air intrusion into the control device, you 
must keep a record of the information specified in either paragraph 
(g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
    (i) You must maintain records of any alarms triggered because flow 
was detected in the bypass, including the date and time the alarm was 
triggered, the duration of the flow in the bypass, as well as records of 
the times of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the 
control device or the flow indicator is not operating.
    (ii) Where a seal mechanism is used to comply with paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, 
you must record that the monthly visual inspection of the seals or 
closure mechanisms has been done, and must record the occurrence of all 
periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass valve position has 
changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type lock has been checked out, 
and records of any car-seal that has been broken.
    (2) Inspection records. For each instrumental or visual inspection 
conducted in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section for 
closed vent systems collecting HAP from an affected source during which 
no leaks are detected, you must record that the inspection was 
performed, the date of the inspection, and a statement that no leaks 
were detected.
    (3) Leak records. When a leak is detected from a closed vent system 
collecting HAP from an affected source, the information specified in 
paragraphs (g)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section must be recorded and 
kept for 5 years.
    (i) The instrument and the equipment identification number and the 
operator name, initials, or identification number.
    (ii) The date the leak was detected and the date of the first 
attempt to repair the leak.
    (iii) The date of successful repair of the leak.
    (iv) The maximum instrument reading measured by the procedures in

[[Page 563]]

paragraph (e) of this section after the leak is successfully repaired.
    (v) Repair delayed and the reason for the delay if a leak is not 
repaired within 15 days after discovery of the leak. You may develop a 
written procedure that identifies the conditions that justify a delay of 
repair. In such cases, reasons for delay of repair may be documented by 
citing the relevant sections of the written procedure.
    (vi) Copies of the compliance reports as specified in Sec. 
63.11985(b)(9), if records are not maintained on a computerized database 
capable of generating summary reports from the records.
    (4) Instrument calibration records. You must maintain records of the 
information specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) through (vi) of this 
section for monitoring instrument calibrations conducted according to 
sections 8.1.2 and 10 of Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, and 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (i) Date of calibration and initials of operator performing the 
calibration.
    (ii) Calibration gas cylinder identification, certification date, 
and certified concentration.
    (iii) Instrument scale(s) used.
    (iv) A description of any corrective action taken if the meter 
readout could not be adjusted to correspond to the calibration gas value 
in accordance with section 10.1 of Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A-7.
    (v) Results of each calibration drift assessment required by 
paragraph (e)(2)(v)(D) of this section (i.e., instrument reading for 
calibration at end of the monitoring day and the calculated percent 
difference from the initial calibration value).
    (vi) If you make your own calibration gas, a description of the 
procedure used.
    (5) Unsafe-to-inspect records. If you designate equipment as unsafe-
to-inspect as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, you must 
keep the records specified in paragraph (g)(5)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) You must maintain the identity of unsafe-to-inspect equipment as 
specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (ii) You must keep a written plan for inspecting unsafe-to-inspect 
equipment as required by paragraph (e)(4) of this section and record all 
activities performed according to the written plan.
    (h) Closed vent systems in vacuum service. If you operate and 
maintain a closed vent system in vacuum service as defined in Sec. 
63.12005, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (3) of this section, and you are not required to comply with any 
other provisions of this section. Any incidence where a closed vent 
system designed to be in vacuum service is operating and not in vacuum 
service constitutes a violation of this rule, unless the closed vent 
system is meeting the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this 
section for closed vent systems that are not in vacuum service. Any such 
incidence during a performance test invalidates the performance test.
    (1) In vacuum service alarm. You must install, maintain, and operate 
a pressure gauge and alarm system that will alert an operator 
immediately and automatically when the pressure is such that the closed 
vent system no longer meets the definition of in vacuum service as 
defined in Sec. 63.12005. The alarm must be located such that the alert 
is detected and recognized easily by an operator.
    (2) In vacuum service alarm procedures. If the alarm is triggered 
for a closed vent system operating in vacuum service as specified in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, you must immediately initiate 
procedures to identify the cause of the alarm. If the closed vent system 
is not in vacuum service, you must initiate procedures to get the closed 
vent system back in vacuum service as defined in Sec. 63.12005, or you 
must immediately comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through 
(g) of this section for closed vent systems that are not in vacuum 
service.
    (3) In vacuum service alarm records and reports. For any incidences 
where a closed vent system designed to be in vacuum service is not in 
vacuum service, you must submit to the Administrator as part of your 
compliance report, the information specified in Sec. 63.11985(b)(10). 
This report is required even if you elect to follow the procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.11895 to establish an affirmative defense and 
submit the reports specified in Sec. 63.11985(b)(11).

of this section.
    (i) You must notify the Administrator 1 month before starting use of 
the continuous emissions monitoring system.
    (ii) You must notify the Administrator 1 month before stopping use 
of the continuous emissions monitoring system, in which case you must 
also conduct a performance test within 60 days of ceasing operation of 
the system.
    (c) CPMS. You must install, maintain, and operate each CPMS as 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section and 
continuously monitor operating parameters.
    (1) As part of your quality control program and site-specific 
performance evaluation test plan prepared as specified in Sec. 63.8(d) 
and (e), you must prepare a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses 
the monitoring system design, data collection, and the quality assurance 
and quality control elements specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through

    (d) Establish operating limit. For each operating parameter that 
must be monitored in Sec. 63.11925(c) for process vent control devices, 
you must establish an operating limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) 
through (4) of this section. You must establish each operating limit as 
an operating parameter range, minimum operating parameter level, or 
maximum operating parameter level as specified in Table 7 to this 
subpart. Where this subpart does not specify which format to use for 
your operating limit (e.g., operating range or minimum operating level), 
you must determine which format is best to establish proper operation of 
the control device such that you are meeting the emission limits 
specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
    (1) For process vent control devices, the operating limit 
established for each monitored parameter specified in Sec. 63.11940 
must be based on the operating parameter values recorded during any 
performance test conducted to demonstrate compliance as required by 
Sec. 63.11925(d)(4) and (e)(4) and may be supplemented by engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. You are not required 
to conduct performance tests over the entire range of allowed operating 
parameter values. The established operating limit must represent the 
conditions for which the control device is meeting the emission limits 
specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
    (2) You must include as part of the notification of compliance 
status or the operating permit application or amendment, the information 
in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, as applicable, for 
each process vent control device requiring operating limits.
    (i) Descriptions of monitoring devices, monitoring frequencies and 
operating scenarios.
    (ii) The established operating limit of the monitored parameter(s).
    (iii) The rationale for the established operating limit, including 
any data and calculations used to develop the operating limit and a 
description of why the operating limit indicates proper operation of the 
control device.
    (iv) The rationale used to determine which format to use for your 
operating limit (e.g., operating range, minimum operating level or 
maximum operating level), where this subpart does not specify which 
format to use.
    (3) For batch processes, you may establish operating limits for 
individual batch emission episodes, including each distinct episode of 
process vent emissions or each individual type of batch process that 
generates wastewater, if applicable. You must provide rationale in a 
batch precompliance report as specified in Sec. 63.11985(c)(2) instead 
of the notification of compliance status for the established operating 
limit. You must include any data and

[[Page 566]]

calculations used to develop the operating limits and a description of 
why each operating limit indicates proper operation of the control 
device during the specific batch emission episode.
    (4) If you elect to establish separate operating limits for 
different batch emission episodes within a batch process as specified in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section, you must maintain daily records 
indicating each point at which you change from one operating limit to 
another, even if the monitoring duration for an operating limit is less 
than 15 minutes. You must maintain a daily record according to Sec. 
63.11990(e)(4)(i).
    (e) Reduction of CPMS and CEMS data. You must reduce CEMS and CPMS 
data to 1-hour averages according to Sec. 63.8(g) to compute the 
average values for demonstrating compliance specified in Sec. Sec. 
63.11925(e)(3)(ii), 63.11925(e)(4)(ii)(B), and 63.11960(c)(2) for CEMS 
and CPMS, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11940  What continuous monitoring requirements must I meet for control 

devices required to install CPMS to meet the emission limits for process 

vents?

    As required in Sec. 63.11925(c), you must install and operate the 
applicable CPMS specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section 
for each control device you use to comply with the emission limits for 
process vents in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart. You must monitor, record, 
and calculate CPMS data averages as specified in Table 7 to this 
subpart. Paragraph (h) of this section provides an option to propose 
alternative monitoring parameters or procedures.
    (a) Flow indicator. If flow to a control device could be 
intermittent, you must install, calibrate, and operate a flow indicator 
at the inlet or outlet of the control device to identify periods of no 
flow.
    (b) Thermal oxidizer monitoring. If you are using a thermal oxidizer 
to meet an emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you are 
required to use CPMS as specified in Sec. 63.11925(c), you must equip 
the thermal oxidizer with the monitoring equipment specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable.
    (1) If a thermal oxidizer other than a catalytic thermal oxidizer is 
used, you must install a temperature monitoring device in the fire box 
or in the ductwork immediately downstream of the fire box in a position 
before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, where a 
catalytic thermal oxidizer is used, you must install temperature 
monitoring devices in the gas stream immediately before and after the 
catalyst bed. You must monitor the temperature differential across the 
catalyst bed.
    (3) Instead of complying with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and 
if the temperature differential between the inlet and outlet of the 
catalytic thermal oxidizer during normal operating conditions is less 
than 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit), you may elect to 
monitor the inlet temperature and conduct catalyst checks as specified 
in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) You must conduct annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst 
activity (i.e., conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or 
catalyst supplier's recommended procedures. If problems are found during 
the catalyst activity test, you must replace the catalyst bed or take 
other corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's 
recommendations within 15 days or by the next time any process vent 
stream is collected by the control device, whichever is sooner.
    (ii) You must conduct annual internal inspections of the catalyst 
bed to check for fouling, plugging, or mechanical breakdown. You must 
also inspect the bed for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems 
are found during the annual internal inspection of the catalyst, you 
must replace the catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent 
with the manufacturer's recommendations within 15 days or by the next 
time any process vent stream is collected by the control device, 
whichever is later. If the catalyst bed is replaced and is not of like 
or better kind and quality as the old catalyst then you must conduct a 
new performance test according to Sec. 63.11945 to determine 
destruction efficiency. If a catalyst bed is replaced and the 
replacement catalyst is of like or better kind and quality as the old 
catalyst, then a

[[Page 567]]

new performance test to determine destruction efficiency is not 
required.
    (c) Absorber and acid gas scrubber monitoring. If you are using an 
absorber or acid gas scrubber to meet an emission limit in Table 1 or 2 
to this subpart and you are required to use CPMS as specified in Sec. 
63.11925(c), you must install the monitoring equipment specified in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Install and operate the monitoring equipment as specified in 
either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) A flow meter to monitor the absorber or acid gas scrubber 
influent liquid flow.
    (ii) A flow meter to monitor the absorber or acid gas scrubber 
influent liquid flow and the gas stream flow using one of the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section. You 
must monitor the liquid-to-gas ratio determined by dividing the flow 
rate of the absorber or acid gas scrubber influent by the gas flow rate. 
The units of measure must be consistent with those used to calculate 
this ratio during the performance test.
    (A) Determine gas stream flow using the design blower capacity, with 
appropriate adjustments for pressure drop.
    (B) Measure the gas stream flow at the absorber or acid gas scrubber 
inlet.
    (C) If you have previously determined compliance for a scrubber that 
requires a determination of the liquid-to-gas ratio, you may use the 
results of that test provided the test conditions are representative of 
current operation.
    (2) Install and operate the monitoring equipment as specified in 
either paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
    (i) Install and operate pressure gauges at the inlet and outlet of 
the absorber or acid gas scrubber to monitor the pressure drop through 
the absorber or acid gas scrubber.
    (ii) If the difference in the inlet gas stream temperature and the 
inlet liquid stream temperature is greater than 38 degrees Celsius, you 
may install and operate a temperature monitoring device at the scrubber 
gas stream exit.
    (iii) If the difference between the specific gravity of the scrubber 
effluent scrubbing fluid and specific gravity of the scrubber inlet 
scrubbing fluid is greater than or equal to 0.02 specific gravity units, 
you may install and operate a specific gravity monitoring device on the 
inlet and outlet of the scrubber.
    (3) If the scrubbing liquid is a reactant (e.g., lime, ammonia 
hydroxide), you must install and operate one of the devices listed in 
either paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section.
    (i) A pH monitoring device to monitor the pH of the scrubber liquid 
effluent.
    (ii) A caustic strength monitoring device to monitor the caustic 
strength of the scrubber liquid effluent.
    (iii) A conductivity monitoring device to monitor the conductivity 
of the scrubber liquid effluent.
    (d) Regenerative adsorber monitoring. If you are using a 
regenerative adsorber to meet an emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this 
subpart and you are required to use CPMS as specified in Sec. 
63.11925(c), you must install and operate the applicable monitoring 
equipment listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section, and 
comply with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this 
section. If the adsorption system water is wastewater as defined in 
Sec. 63.12005, then it is subject to the requirements of Sec. 
63.11965.
    (1) For non-vacuum regeneration systems, an integrating regeneration 
stream flow monitoring device having an accuracy of <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent, capable of recording the total regeneration 
stream mass for each regeneration cycle. For non-vacuum regeneration 
systems, an integrating regeneration stream flow monitoring device 
capable of continuously recording the total regeneration stream mass 
flow for each regeneration cycle.
    (2) For non-vacuum regeneration systems, an adsorber bed temperature 
monitoring device, capable of continuously recording the adsorber bed 
temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing 
any temperature regulation (cooling or warming to bring bed temperature 
closer to vent gas temperature) portion of the regeneration cycle.
    (3) For non-vacuum and non-steam regeneration systems, an adsorber 
bed

[[Page 568]]

temperature monitoring device capable of continuously recording the bed 
temperature during regeneration, except during any temperature 
regulating (cooling or warming to bring bed temperature closer to vent 
gas temperature) portion of the regeneration cycle.
    (4) For a vacuum regeneration system, a pressure transmitter 
installed in the vacuum pump suction line capable of continuously 
recording the vacuum level for each minute during regeneration. You must 
establish a minimum target and a length of time at which the vacuum must 
be below the minimum target during regeneration.
    (5) A device capable of monitoring the regeneration frequency (i.e., 
operating time since last regeneration) and duration.
    (6) You must perform a verification of the adsorber during each day 
of operation. The verification must be through visual observation or 
through an automated alarm or shutdown system that monitors and records 
system operational parameters. The verification must verify that the 
adsorber is operating with proper valve sequencing and cycle time.
    (7) You must conduct weekly measurements of the carbon bed outlet 
volatile organic compounds concentration over the last 5 minutes of an 
adsorption cycle for each carbon bed. For regeneration cycles longer 
than 1 week, you must perform the measurement over the last 5 minutes of 
each adsorption cycle for each carbon bed. The outlet concentration of 
volatile organic compounds must be measured using a portable analyzer, 
in accordance with Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, for open-
ended lines. Alternatively, outlet concentration of HAP(s) may be 
measured using chromatographic analysis using Method 18 at 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A-6.
    (e) Non-regenerative adsorber monitoring. If you are using a non-
regenerative adsorber, or canister type system that is sent off site for 
regeneration or disposal, to meet an emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to 
this subpart and you are required to use CPMS as specified in Sec. 
63.11925(c), you must install a system of dual adsorber units in series 
and conduct the monitoring and bed replacement as specified in 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) Establish the average adsorber bed life by conducting daily 
monitoring of the outlet volatile organic compound or HAP concentration, 
as specified in this paragraph (e)(1), of the first adsorber bed in 
series until breakthrough occurs for the first three adsorber bed 
change-outs. The outlet concentration of volatile organic compounds must 
be measured using a portable analyzer, in accordance with Method 21 at 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, for open-ended lines. Alternatively, 
outlet concentration of HAP may be measured using chromatographic 
analysis using Method 18 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6. Breakthrough 
of the bed is defined as the time when the level of HAP detected is at 
the highest concentration allowed to be discharged from the adsorber 
system.
    (2) Once the average life of the bed is determined, conduct ongoing 
monitoring as specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section, conduct daily monitoring of the adsorber bed outlet volatile 
organic compound or HAP concentration, as specified in paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.
    (ii) You may conduct monthly monitoring if the adsorbent has more 
than 2 months of life remaining, as determined by the average primary 
adsorber bed life, established in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and 
the date the adsorbent was last replaced.
    (iii) You may conduct weekly monitoring if the adsorbent has more 
than 2 weeks of life remaining, as determined by the average primary 
adsorber bed life, established in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and 
the date the adsorbent was last replaced.
    (3) The first adsorber in series must be replaced immediately when 
breakthrough is detected between the first and second adsorber. The 
original second adsorber (or a fresh canister) will become the new first 
adsorber and a fresh adsorber will become the second adsorber. For 
purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), ``immediately'' means within 8 hours 
of the detection of a

[[Page 569]]

breakthrough for adsorbers of 55 gallons or less, and within 24 hours of 
the detection of a breakthrough for adsorbers greater than 55 gallons.
    (4) In lieu of replacing the first adsorber immediately, you may 
elect to monitor the outlet of the second canister beginning on the day 
the breakthrough between the first and second canister is identified and 
each day thereafter. This daily monitoring must continue until the first 
canister is replaced. If the constituent being monitored is detected at 
the outlet of the second canister during this period of daily 
monitoring, both canisters must be replaced within 8 hours of the time 
of detection of volatile organic compounds or HAP at 90 percent of the 
allowed level (90 percent of breakthrough definition).
    (f) Condenser monitoring. If you are using a condenser to meet an 
emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you are required to 
use CPMS as specified in Sec. 63.11925(c), you must install and operate 
a condenser exit gas temperature monitoring device.
    (g) Other control devices. If you use a control device other than 
those listed in this subpart to comply with an emission limit in Table 1 
or 2 to this subpart and you are required to use CPMS as specified in 
Sec. 63.11925(c), you must comply with the requirements as specified in 
paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Submit a description of the planned monitoring, recordkeeping, 
and reporting procedures. The Administrator will approve, deny or modify 
the proposed monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements as 
part of the review of the plan or through the review of the permit 
application or by other appropriate means.
    (2) You must establish operating limits for monitored parameters 
that are approved by the Administrator. To establish the operating 
limit, the information required in Sec. 63.11935(d) must be submitted 
in the notification of compliance status report specified in Sec. 
63.11985(a).
    (h) Alternatives to monitoring requirements. (1) You may request 
approval to use alternatives to the continuous operating parameter 
monitoring listed in this section, as specified in Sec. Sec. 
63.11985(c)(4) and 63.8.
    (2) You may request approval to monitor a different parameter than 
those established in Sec. 63.11935(d) or to set unique monitoring 
parameters, as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.11985(c)(5) and 63.8. Until 
permission to use an alternative monitoring parameter has been granted 
by the Administrator, you remain subject to the requirements of this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11945  What performance testing requirements must I meet for process 

vents?

    (a) General. For each control device used to meet the emission 
limits for process vents in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must 
conduct the initial and periodic performance tests required in Sec. 
63.11925(d) and (e) and as specified in Sec. 63.11896 using the 
applicable test methods and procedures specified in Table 8 to this 
subpart and paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) Process operating conditions. You must conduct performance tests 
under the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this 
section, as applicable. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make 
available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to 
determine the conditions of performance tests. In all cases, a site-
specific plan must be submitted to the Administrator for approval prior 
to testing in accordance with Sec. 63.7(c). The test plan must include 
the emission profiles described in Sec. 63.11925(g).
    (1) Continuous process vents. For continuous process vents, you must 
conduct all performance tests at maximum representative operating 
conditions for the process. For continuous compliance, you must conduct 
subsequent performance tests within the range of operating limit(s) that 
were established for the control device during the initial or subsequent 
performance tests specified in Sec. 63.11925(d) and (e). If an 
operating limit is a range, then you must conduct subsequent performance 
tests within the range of maximum or minimum operating limits for the 
control device, which result in highest emissions (i.e., lowest emission 
reduction).
    (2) Batch process operations. Testing must be conducted at absolute 
worst-

[[Page 570]]

case conditions or hypothetical worst-case conditions as specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Combination of both continuous and batch unit operations. You 
must conduct performance tests when the batch process vents are 
operating at absolute worst-case conditions or hypothetical worst-case 
conditions, as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, 
and at maximum representative operating conditions for the process. For 
continuous compliance, you must operate the control device as close as 
possible to your operating limit(s) for the control device established 
during the initial or subsequent performance tests specified in Sec. 
63.11925 (d) and (e). If an operating limit is a range, then you must 
operate the control device as close as possible to the maximum or 
minimum operating limit for the control device, whichever results in 
higher emissions (i.e., lower emission reduction), unless the 
Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions.
    (c) Batch worst-case conditions. The absolute worst-case conditions 
for batch process operations must be characterized by the criteria 
presented in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The hypothetical worst-
case conditions for batch process operations must be characterized by 
the criteria presented in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (1) Absolute worst-case conditions. For batch process operations, 
absolute worst-case conditions are defined by the criteria presented in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section if the maximum load is the most 
challenging condition for the control device. Otherwise, absolute worst-
case conditions are defined by the conditions in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section. You must consider all relevant factors, including load and 
compound-specific characteristics in defining absolute worst-case 
conditions.
    (i) A 1-hour period of time in which the inlet to the control device 
contains the highest HAP mass loading rate, in pounds per hour, capable 
of being vented to the control device. An emission profile as described 
in Sec. 63.11925(g) must be used to identify the 1-hour period of 
maximum HAP loading.
    (ii) The period of time when the HAP loading or stream composition 
(including non-HAP) is most challenging for the control device. These 
conditions include, but are not limited to the following:
    (A) Periods when the stream contains the highest combined organic 
load, in pounds per hour, described by the emission profiles in Sec. 
63.11925(g).
    (B) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach 
limits of solubility for scrubbing media.
    (C) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach 
limits of adsorptivity for adsorption systems.
    (2) Hypothetical worst-case conditions. For batch process 
operations, hypothetical worst-case conditions are simulated test 
conditions that, at a minimum, contain the highest hourly HAP load of 
emissions that would be predicted to be vented to the control device 
based on the emissions profiles described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) or 
(iii) of this section.
    (3) Emission profile. For batch process operations, you must develop 
an emission profile for the vent to the control device that describes 
the characteristics of the vent stream at the inlet to the control 
device under worst-case conditions. The emission profile must be 
developed based on any one of the procedures described in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Emission profile by process. The emission profile must consider 
all batch emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack for 
a period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting to 
the stack and must consider production scheduling. The profile must 
describe the HAP load to the device that equals the highest sum of 
emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control device in any 
given hour. Emissions per episode must be calculated using the 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.11950. Emissions per episode must be 
divided by the duration of the episode only if the duration of the 
episode is longer than 1 hour.
    (ii) Emission profile by equipment. The emission profile must 
consist of emissions that meet or exceed the highest emissions, in 
pounds per hour that

[[Page 571]]

would be expected under actual processing conditions. The profile must 
describe equipment configurations used to generate the emission events, 
volatility of materials processed in the equipment, and the rationale 
used to identify and characterize the emission events. The emissions may 
be based on using a compound more volatile than compounds actually used 
in the process(es), and the emissions may be generated from all 
equipment in the process(es) or only selected equipment.
    (iii) Emission profile by capture and control device limitation. The 
emission profile must consider the capture and control system 
limitations and the highest emissions, in pounds per hour that can be 
routed to the control device, based on maximum flow rate and 
concentrations possible because of limitations on conveyance and control 
equipment (e.g., fans and lower explosive level alarms).
    (d) Concentration correction calculation. If a combustion device is 
the control device and supplemental combustion air is used to combust 
the emissions, the concentration of total hydrocarbons, total organic 
HAP, vinyl chloride, and hydrogen chloride must be corrected as 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. If a control 
device other than a combustion device is used to comply with an outlet 
concentration emission limit for batch process vents, you must correct 
the actual concentration for supplemental gases as specified in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (1) Determine the concentration of total hydrocarbons, total organic 
HAP, vinyl chloride, or hydrogen chloride corrected to 3-percent oxygen 
(Cc) using Equation 1 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17AP12.002

Where:

C<INF>c</INF> = Concentration of total hydrocarbons, total organic HAP, 
          vinyl chloride, or hydrogen chloride corrected to 3-percent 
          oxygen, dry basis, parts per million by volume.
C<INF>m</INF> = Concentration of total hydrocarbons, total organic HAP, 
          vinyl chloride, or hydrogen chloride, dry basis, parts per 
          million by volume.
%O<INF>2d</INF> = Concentration of oxygen, dry basis, percentage by 
          volume.

    (2) To determine the oxygen concentration, you must use the emission 
rate correction factor (or excess air), integrated sampling and analysis 
procedures of Method 3, 3A, or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, or 
ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14).

    When developing your emission profiles for batch process vents as 
required in Sec. 63.11925(g), except as specified in paragraph (i) of 
this section, you must calculate emissions from episodes caused by vapor 
displacement, purging a partially filled vessel, heating, 
depressurization, vacuum operations, gas evolution, air drying, or empty 
vessel purging, using the applicable procedures in paragraphs (a) 
through (h) of this section.

each condensable compound. Stop iterating when the calculated saturation 
factors for all compounds are the same to two significant figures for

polymerization reactors used in the manufacture of bulk resins) for any 
reason, the quantity of vinyl chloride must be reduced to an amount that 
occupies a volume of no more than 2.0 percent of the component's or 
equipment's containment volume, or 25 gallons, whichever is larger, at

quantity of vinyl chloride is not to exceed 0.04 pounds per ton of PVC 
product, with the product determined on a dry solids basis.
    (c) Any gas or vapor HAP removed from a process component in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be vented to 
a closed vent system and control device meeting the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 63.11925 through 63.11950.

control device meeting the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.11925 through 
63.11950.
    (2) Each gasholder must operate with one or more of the following

maintenance or repair. The standard operating procedures must be 
developed and implemented and made available to the Administrator upon 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11956  What are my compliance requirements for ambient monitoring?

    You must operate a reliable and accurate vinyl chloride monitoring 
system for detection of major leaks and identification of the general 
area of the affected source where a leak is located. A vinyl chloride 
monitoring system means a device which obtains air samples from one or 
more points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples 
with gas chromatography or, if you assume that all hydrocarbons measured 
are vinyl chloride, analyzes the samples with infrared 
spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an equivalent or alternative 
method. You must operate the vinyl chloride monitoring system according 
to a program that you develop for your affected source. You must submit 
a description of the program to the Administrator within 45 days of your 
compliance date, unless a waiver of compliance is granted by the 
Administrator, or the program has been approved and the Administrator 
does not request a review of the program. Approval of a program will be 
granted by the Administrator provided the Administrator finds:
    (a) The location and number of points to be monitored and the 
frequency of monitoring provided for in the program are acceptable when 
they are compared with the number of pieces of equipment in vinyl 
chloride service and size and physical layout of the affected source.
    (b) It contains a definition of leak which is acceptable when 
compared with the background concentrations of vinyl chloride in the 
areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring 
system. Measurements of background concentrations of vinyl chloride in 
the areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring 
system are to be included with the description of the program. The 
definition of leak for a given plant may vary among the different areas 
within the plant and is also to change over time as background 
concentrations in the plant are reduced.

[[Page 579]]

    (c) It contains an acceptable plan of action to be taken when a leak 
is detected.
    (d) It provides for an acceptable calibration and maintenance 
schedule for the vinyl chloride monitoring system and portable 
hydrocarbon detector. For the vinyl chloride monitoring system, a daily 
span check must be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride 
equal to the concentration defined as a leak according to paragraph (b) 
of this section. The calibration must be done with either:
    (1) A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in 
sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 at 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, 
and in accordance with section 10.1 of Method 106, or
    (2) A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate 
concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration 
gas cylinder standard must have been certified by the manufacturer. The 
manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each 
cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent from the certified value. The date of gas 
cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and 
recommended maximum shelf life must have been affixed to the cylinder 
before shipment from the manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas 
chromatograph is used as the vinyl chloride monitoring system, these gas 
mixtures may be directly used to prepare a chromatograph calibration 
curve as described in Sections 8.1 and 9.2 of Method 106. The 
requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 of Method 106 for 
certification of cylinder standards and for establishment and 
verification of calibration standards are to be followed.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 63.12005  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 
Sec. 63.2, and in this section, as follows:
    Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement 
proceeding, a response or defense put forward by a

[[Page 594]]

defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and 
the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a 
judicial or administrative proceeding.
    Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that is 
associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more 
than one batch emission episode. For example, a displacement of vapor 
resulting from the charging of a vessel with HAP will result in a 
discrete emission episode that will last through the duration of the 
charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the 
charge. If the vessel is then heated, there will also be another 
discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded 
vapor. Both emission episodes may occur in the same vessel or unit 
operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur 
from the vessel or other process components, depending on process 
operations.
    Batch operation means a noncontinuous operation involving 
intermittent or discontinuous feed into process components, and, in 
general, involves the emptying of the process components after the 
operation ceases and prior to beginning a new operation. Addition of raw 
material and withdrawal of product do not occur simultaneously in a 
batch operation.
    Batch process vent means a vent from a batch operation from a PVCPU 
through which a HAP-containing gas stream has the potential to be 
released to the atmosphere except that it is required by this subpart to 
routed to a closed vent system and control device. Emissions for all 
emission episodes associated with the unit operation(s) are part of the 
batch process vent. Batch process vents also include vents with 
intermittent flow from continuous operations. Examples of batch process 
vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for 
product recovery, polymerization reactors, and process tanks.
    Bottoms receiver means a tank that collects bottoms from continuous 
distillation before the stream is sent for storage or for further 
downstream processing. A rundown tank is an example of a bottoms 
receiver.
    Bulk process means a process for producing polyvinyl chloride resin 
that is characterized by a two-step anhydrous polymerization process: 
the formation of small resin particles in a pre-polymerization reactor 
using small amounts of vinyl chloride monomer, an initiator, and 
agitation; and the growth of the resin particles in a post-
polymerization reactor using additional vinyl chloride monomer. Resins 
produced using the bulk process are referred to as bulk resins.
    Bypass means diverting a process vent or closed vent system stream 
to the atmosphere such that it does not first pass through an emission 
control device.
    Calendar year means the period between January 1 and December 31, 
inclusive for a given year.
    Capacity means the nominal figure or rating given by the 
manufacturer of the storage vessel, condenser, or other process 
component.
    Car-seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to 
change the position of a valve (e.g., from opened to closed) in such a 
way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking 
the seal.
    Closed vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere 
and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, 
flow inducing devices that collect or transport gas or vapor from an 
emission point to a control device.
    Combustion device means an individual unit used for the combustion 
of organic emissions, such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or 
boiler.
    Conservation vent means an automatically operated (e.g., weight-
loaded or spring-loaded) safety device used to prevent the operating 
pressure of a storage vessel from exceeding the maximum allowable 
working pressure of the process component. Conservation vents must be 
designed to open only when the operating pressure of the storage vessel 
exceeds the maximum allowable working pressure of the process component. 
Conservation vents open and close to permit only the intake or outlet 
relief necessary to keep the storage vessel within permissible working 
pressures, and reseal automatically.

[[Page 595]]

    Container means a portable unit in which a material can be stored, 
transported, treated, disposed of or otherwise handled. Examples of 
containers include, but are not limited to, drums, pails, and portable 
cargo containers known as ``portable tanks'' or ``totes.'' Container 
does not include transport vehicles or barges.
    Continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) means the total 
equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and 
availability requirements of this subpart, used to sample, condition (if 
applicable), analyze, and provide a record of emissions.
    Continuous operation means any operation that is not a batch 
operation.
    Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) means the total 
equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and 
availability requirements of this part, used to sample, condition (if 
applicable), analyze, and provide a record of process or control system 
parameters.
    Continuous process vent means a vent from a continuous PVCPU 
operation through which a HAP-containing gas stream has the potential to 
be released to the atmosphere except that it is required by this subpart 
to routed to a closed vent system and control device and has the 
following characteristics:
    (1) The gas stream originates as a continuous flow from any 
continuous PVCPU operation during operation of the PVCPU.
    (2) The discharge into the closed vent system and control device 
meets at least one of the following conditions:
    (i) Is directly from any continuous operation.
    (ii) Is from any continuous operation after passing solely (i.e.,

Resins produced using the dispersion process are referred to as latex or 
dispersion resins.
    Empty or emptying means the partial or complete removal of stored 
liquid

[[Page 596]]

from a storage vessel. Storage vessels that contain liquid only as a 
result of the liquid clinging to the walls or bottoms, or resting in

    Equipment means each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief 
device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, 
connector and instrumentation system in HAP service; and any control 
devices or systems used to comply with this subpart.

(e.g., river or pond water). For closed-loop recirculation systems, the 
heat exchange system consists of a cooling tower, all heat exchangers 
that are serviced by that cooling tower and all water lines to and from 
the heat exchanger(s). For once-through systems, the heat exchange 
system consists of one or more heat exchangers servicing an individual

prior to exposure to the atmosphere or mixing with non-cooling water 
streams, in, as an example, a once-through cooling system, whichever 
occurs first.
    In HAP service means that a process component either contains or 
contacts a liquid that is at least 5-percent HAP by weight or a gas that 
is at least 5 percent by volume HAP as determined according to the 
provisions of Sec. 63.180(d). For the purposes of this definition, the 
term ``organic HAP'' as used in Sec. 63.180(d) means HAP. The 
provisions of Sec. 63.180(d) also specify how to determine that a 
process component is not in HAP service.
    In vacuum service means that the process component is operating at 
an internal pressure that is at least 5 kilopascals (kPa) (0.7 pounds 
per square inch absolute) below ambient pressure.

[[Page 597]]

    Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device with an enclosed 
fire box that is used for destroying organic compounds. Auxiliary fuel 
may be used to heat waste gas to combustion temperatures. Any energy 
recovery section present is not physically formed into one manufactured 
or assembled unit with the combustion section; rather, the energy 
recovery section is a separate section following the combustion section 
and the two are joined by ducts or connections carrying flue gas. This 
energy recovery section limitation does not apply to an energy recovery 
section used solely to preheat the incoming vent stream or combustion 
air.
    Maintenance wastewater means wastewater generated by the draining of 
process fluid from components in the PVCPU into an individual drain 
system prior to or during maintenance activities. Maintenance wastewater 
can be generated during planned and unplanned shutdowns and during 
periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities that can 
generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling of heat exchanger 
tubing bundles, hydroblasting PVCPU process components such as 
polymerization reactors, vessels and heat exchangers, draining of low 
legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an individual drain 
system, draining of portions of the PVCPU for repair and water used to 
wash out process components or equipment after the process components or 
equipment has already been opened to the atmosphere and has met the 
requirements of Sec. 63.11955.

the range of operating conditions that are documented in an existing 
operating scenario, but is still a reasonably anticipated event. For 
example, a nonstandard batch occurs when additional processing or 
processing at different operating conditions must be conducted to 
produce a product that is normally produced under the conditions 
described by the standard batch. A nonstandard batch may be necessary as 
a result of a malfunction, but it is not itself a malfunction.

requirement applies to the added or changed emission points. Examples of 
process changes include, but are not limited to, changes in production 
capacity, production rate, or catalyst type, or whenever there is 
replacement, removal, or addition of recovery device components. For 
purposes of this definition, process changes do not include process 
upsets, changes that do not alter the process component configuration

    Process condenser means a condenser whose primary purpose is to 
recover material as an integral part of a batch process. All condensers 
recovering condensate from a batch process at or above the boiling point 
or all condensers in line prior to a vacuum source are considered 
process condensers. Typically, a primary condenser or condensers in 
series are considered to be integral to the batch regulated process if 
they are capable of and normally used for the purpose of recovering 
chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse 
or for sale for fuel value, use or reuse. This definition does not apply 
to a condenser that is used to remove materials that would hinder 
performance of a downstream recovery device as follows:
    (1) To remove water vapor that would cause icing in a downstream 
condenser.
    (2) To remove water vapor that would negatively affect the 
adsorption capacity of carbon in a downstream carbon adsorber.

The process vent standards apply at the outlet of the control device. A 
process vent is either a PVC-only process vent or a PVC-combined process 
vent.
    Process wastewater means wastewater that comes into direct contact 
with HAP or results from the production or use of any raw material,

    Product means a polymer produced using the same monomers and varying 
in additives (e.g., initiators, terminators, etc.); catalysts; or in the 
relative proportions of monomers, that is manufactured by a process 
unit. With respect to polymers, more than one recipe may be used to 
produce the same product, and there can be more than one grade of a 
product. Product also means a chemical that is not a polymer, which is 
manufactured by a process unit. By-products, isolated intermediates, 
impurities, wastes, and trace contaminants are not considered products.

a PVCPU and is combined with one or more process vents originating from 
another source category prior to being controlled or emitted to the 
atmosphere.

[[Page 600]]

the applicable leak definition.
    Resin stripper means a unit that removes organic compounds from a 
raw polyvinyl chloride and copolymer product. In the production of a 
polymer, stripping is a discrete step that occurs after the 
polymerization reaction and before drying or other finishing operations. 
Examples of types of stripping include steam stripping, vacuum 
stripping, or other methods of devolatilization. For the purposes of 
this subpart, devolatilization that occurs in dryers or other finishing 
operations is not resin stripping. Resin stripping may occur in a 
polymerization reactor or in a batch or continuous stripper separate 
from the polymerization reactor where resin stripping occurs.
    Root cause analysis means an assessment conducted through a process 
of investigation to determine the primary cause, and any other 
significant contributing cause(s), of a discharge of gases in excess of 
specified thresholds.

product in the vessel by the physical state of the material the gauge 
discharges.
    Solution process means a process for producing polyvinyl chloride 
copolymer resin that is characterized by the anhydrous formation of the 
polymer through precipitation. Polymerization occurs in an organic 
solvent in the presence of an initiator where vinyl chloride monomer and 
co-monomers are soluble in the solvent, but the polymer is not. The PVC 
copolymer is a granule suspended in the solvent, which then precipitates 
out of solution. Emulsifiers and suspending agents are not used in the 
solution process. PVC copolymer resins produced using the solution 
process are referred to as solution resins.

under the wastewater provisions.
    Stripped resin means the material exiting the resin stripper that 
contains polymerized vinyl chloride.
    Supplemental combustion air means the air that is added to a vent 
stream after the vent stream leaves the unit operation. Air that is part 
of the vent stream as a result of the nature of the unit operation is 
not considered supplemental combustion air. Air required to operate 
combustion device burner(s) is not considered supplemental combustion 
air. Air required to ensure the proper operation of catalytic oxidizers, 
to include the intermittent addition of air upstream of the catalyst bed 
to maintain a minimum threshold flow rate through the catalyst bed or to 
avoid excessive temperatures in the catalyst bed, is not considered to 
be supplemental combustion air.
    Surge control vessel means feed drums, recycle drums, and 
intermediate vessels used as a part of any continuous operation. Surge 
control vessels are used within an affected source when in-process 
storage, mixing, or management of flow rates or volumes is needed to 
introduce material into continuous operations. Surge control vessels 
also include gasholders.
    Suspension blending process means a process for producing polyvinyl 
chloride resin that is similar to the suspension polymerization process, 
but employs a rate of agitation that is significantly higher than the 
highest range for non-blending suspension resins. The suspension 
blending process uses a recipe that creates extremely small resin 
particles, generally equal to or less than 100 microns in size, with a 
glassy surface and very little porosity. The suspension blending process 
concentrates the resins using a centrifuge that is specifically designed 
to handle these small particles. Polyvinyl chloride resins produced 
using the suspension blending process are referred to as suspension 
blending resins and are typically blended with dispersion resins.
    Suspension process means a process for producing polyvinyl chloride 
resin that is characterized by the formation of the polymers in droplets 
of liquid vinyl chloride monomer or other co-monomers suspended in 
water. The droplets are formed by agitation and the use of protective 
colloids or suspending agents. Initiators used in the suspension process 
are soluble in vinyl chloride monomer. Polyvinyl chloride resins 
produced using the suspension process are referred to as suspension 
resins.
    Table 10 HAP means a HAP compound listed in table 10 of this 
subpart.

                 1.0 What is the purpose of Method 301?

    The purpose of Method 301 is to provide a set of procedures that 
you, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to requirements 
under 40 CFR part 63 can use to validate an alternative test method to a 
test method required in 40 CFR part 63 or to validate a stand-alone 
alternative test method based on established precision and bias 
criteria. If you use Method 301 to validate your proposed alternative 
method, you must use the procedures described in this method. This 
method describes the minimum procedures that you must use to validate an 
alternative test method to meet 40 CFR part 63 compliance requirements. 
If you choose to propose a validation method other than Method 301, you 
must submit and obtain the Administrator's approval for the alternative 
validation method.

                     2.0 When must I use Method 301?

    If you want to use an alternative test method to meet requirements 
in a subpart of 40 CFR part 63, you can use Method 301 to validate the 
alternative test method. You must request approval to use this 
alternative test method according to the procedures in Sections 16 and 
63.7(f). You must receive the Administrator's written approval to use 
the alternative test method before you use the alternative test method 
to meet requirements under 40 CFR part 63. In some cases, the 
Administrator may decide to waive the requirement to use Method 301 for 
alternative test methods. Section 17 describes the requirements for 
obtaining a waiver.

                    3.0 What does Method 301 include?

    3.1 Procedures. This method includes minimum procedures to determine 
and document systematic error (bias) and random error (precision) of 
measured concentrations from exhaust gases, wastewater, sludge, and 
other media. It contains procedures for ensuring sample stability if 
such procedures are not included in the test method. This method also 
includes optional procedures for ruggedness and detection limits.
    3.2 Definitions.
    Affected source means affected source as defined in 40 CFR 63.2 and 
in the relevant subpart under 40 CFR part 63.
    Alternative test method means the sampling and analytical 
methodology selected for field validation using the method described in 
this appendix.
    Paired sampling system means a sampling system capable of obtaining 
two replicate samples that were collected as closely as possible in 
sampling time and sampling location.
    Quadruplet sampling system means a sampling system capable of 
obtaining four replicate samples that were collected as closely as 
possible in sampling time and sampling location.
    Surrogate compound means a compound that serves as a model for the 
types of compounds being analyzed (i.e., similar chemical structure, 
properties, behavior). The model can be distinguished by the method from 
the compounds being analyzed.

[[Page 612]]

                    4.0 How do I perform Method 301?

    First, you introduce a known concentration of an analyte or compare 
the alternative test method against a validated test method to determine 
the alternative test method's bias. Then, you collect multiple, 
collocated simultaneous samples to determine the alternative test 
method's precision. Alternatively, though it is not required, we allow 
validation testing over a broad range of concentrations over an extended 
time period to determine precision of a proposed alternative method. 
Sections 5.0 through 17.0 describe the procedures in detail.

                           Reference Materials

                5.0 What reference materials must I use?

    You must use reference materials (a material or substance whose one 
or more properties are sufficiently homogenous to the analyte) that are 
traceable to a national standards body (e.g., National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST)) at the level of the applicable emission 
limitation or standard that the subpart in 40 CFR part 63 requires. If 
you want to expand the applicable range of the method, you must conduct 
additional runs with higher and lower analyte concentrations. You must 
obtain information about your analyte according to the procedures in 
Sections 5.1 through 5.4.
    5.1 Exhaust Gas Tests Concentration. You must get a known 
concentration of each analyte from an independent source such as a 
speciality gas manufacturer, specialty chemical company, or chemical 
laboratory. You must also get the manufacturer's certification for the 
analyte concentration and stability.
    5.2 Tests for Other Waste Media. You must get the pure liquid 
components of each analyte from an independent manufacturer. The 
manufacturer must certify the purity and shelf life of the pure liquid 
components. You must dilute the pure liquid components in the same type 
medium as the waste from the affected source.
    5.3 Surrogate Analytes. If you demonstrate to the Administrator's 
satisfaction that a surrogate compound behaves as the analyte does, then 
you may use surrogate compounds for highly toxic or reactive compounds. 
A surrogate may be an isotope or one that contains a unique element (for 
example, chlorine) that is not present in the source or a derivation of 
the toxic or reactive compound if the derivative formation is part of 
the method's procedure. You may use laboratory experiments or literature 
data to show behavioral acceptability.
    5.4 Isotopically Labeled Materials. Isotope mixtures may contain the 
isotope and the natural analyte. The isotope labeled analyte 
concentration must be more than five times the natural concentration of 
the analyte.

                           Sampling Procedures

                6.0 What sampling procedures must I use?

    You may determine bias and precision by comparing against a 
validated test method, using isotopic sampling, or using analyte spiking 
(or the equivalent). Isotopic sampling can only be used for procedures 
requiring mass spectrometry or radiological procedures. You must collect 
samples according to the requirements in Table 1. You must perform the 
sampling according to the procedures in Sections 6.1 through 6.4.
    6.1 Isotopic Spiking. Spike all 12 samples with the analyte at the 
concentration in the applicable emission limitation or standard in the 
subpart of 40 CFR part 63. If there is no applicable emission limitation 
or standard, spike at the expected level of the samples. Follow the 
appropriate spiking procedures in Sections 6.3.1 through 6.3.2 for the 
applicable waste medium.
    6.2 Analyte Spiking. In each quadruplet set, spike half of the 
samples (two out of the four) with the analyte according to the 
applicable procedure in Section 6.3.
    6.3 Spiking Procedure.
    6.3.1 Gaseous Analyte with Sorbent or Impinger Sampling Trains. 
Sample the analyte (in the laboratory or in the field) at a 
concentration that is close to the concentration in the applicable 
emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR Part 63 (or the 
expected sample concentration where there is no standard) for the time 
required by the method, and then sample the gas stream for an equal 
amount of time. The time for sampling both the analyte and gas stream 
should be equal; however, the time should be adjusted to avoid sorbent 
breakthrough. The stack gas and the gaseous analyte may be sampled at 
the same time. The analyte must be introduced as close to the tip of the 
sampling train as possible.
    6.3.2 Gaseous Analyte with Sample Container (Bag or Canister). Spike 
the sample containers after completion of each test run with an amount 
equal to the concentration in the applicable emission limitation or 
standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 (or the expected sample 
concentration where there is no standard). The final concentration of 
the analyte would be approximately equal to the analyte concentration in 
the stack plus the applicable emission standard (corrected for spike 
volume). The volume amount of analyte must be less than 10 percent of 
the sample volume.
    6.3.3 Liquid and Solid Analyte with Sorbent or Impinger Trains. 
Spike the trains with an amount equal to the concentration in the 
applicable emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 
63 (or the expected sample concentration where there is no standard) 
before sampling the stack gas. If possible, do the spiking in the field. 
If it is

[[Page 613]]

not possible to do the spiking in the field, you can do it in the 
laboratory.
    6.3.4 Liquid and Solid Analyte with Sample Container (Bag or 
Canister). Spike the containers at the completion of each test run with 
an amount equal to the concentration in the applicable emission 
limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 (or the expected 
sample concentration where there is no standard).
    6.4 Probe Placement and Arrangement for Stationary Source Stack or 
Duct Sampling. To sample a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 63.2, 
you must place the probe according to the procedures in this subsection. 
You must place the probes in the same horizontal plane.
    6.4.1 Paired Sampling Probes. For paired sampling probes, the probe 
tip should be 2.5 cm from the outside edge of the other sample probe, 
with a pitot tube on the outside of each probe. The Administrator may 
approve a validation request where other paired arrangements for the 
pitot tube (where required) are used.
    6.4.2 Quadruplet Sampling Probes. For quadruplet sampling probes, 
the tips should be in a 6.0 cm x 6.0 cm square area measured from the 
center line of the opening of the probe tip with a single pitot tube 
(where required) in the center or two pitot tubes (where required) with 
their location on either side of the probe tip configuration. You must 
propose an alternative arrangement whenever the cross-sectional area of 
the probe tip configuration is approximately five percent or more of the 
stack or duct cross-sectional area.

                  7.0 How do I ensure sample stability?

    7.1 Developing Storage and Analysis Procedures. If the alternative 
test method includes well-established procedures supported by 
experimental data for sample storage and the time within which the 
collected samples must be analyzed, you must store the samples according 
to the procedures in the alternative test method. You are not required 
to conduct the procedures in Section 7.2 or 7.3. If the alternative test 
method does not include such procedures, you must propose procedures for 
storing and analyzing samples to ensure sample stability. At a minimum, 
your proposed procedures must meet the requirements in Section 7.2 or 
7.3. The minimum storage time should be as soon as possible, but no 
longer than 72 hours after collection of the sample. The maximum storage 
time should be no longer than two weeks.
    7.2 Storage and Sampling Procedures for Stack Test Emissions. You 
must store and analyze samples of stack test emissions according to 
Table 3. If you are using analyte spiking procedures, you must include 
equal numbers of spiked and unspiked samples.
    7.3 Storage and Sampling Procedures for Testing Other Waste Media 
(e.g., Soil/Sediment, Solid Waste, Water/Liquid). You must analyze half 
of the replicate samples at the proposed minimum storage time and the 
other half at the proposed maximum storage time or within two weeks of 
the initial analysis to identify the effect of storage times on analyte 
samples. The minimum storage time should be as soon as possible, but no 
longer than seven days after collection of the sample.
    7.4 Sample Stability. After you have conducted sampling and analysis 
according to Section 7.2 or 7.3, compare the results at the minimum and 
maximum storage times. Calculate the difference in the results using 
Equation 301-1.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.002

Where:

d<INF>i</INF> = difference between the results of the ith sample.
R<INF>mini</INF> = results from the ith sample at the minimum storage 
          time.
R<INF>maxi</INF> = results from the ith sample at the maximum storage 
          time.

    7.4.1 Standard Deviation. Determine the standard deviation 
(SD<INF>d</INF>) of the differences (d<INF>i</INF>'s) of the paired 
samples using Equation 301-2.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.003


[[Page 614]]


Where:

d<INF>i</INF> = The difference between the results of the ith sample, 
          R<INF>mini</INF> - R<INF>maxi</INF>.
d<INF>m</INF> = The mean of the paired sample differences.
n = Total number of paired samples.

    7.4.2 t Test. Test the difference in the results for statistical 
significance by calculating the t-statistic and determining if the mean 
of the differences between the initial results and the results after 
storage is significant at the 95 percent confidence level and n - 1 
degrees of freedom. Calculate the value of the t-statistic using 
Equation 301-3.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.004

Where:

n = The total number of paired samples.

    Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical value of the t-
statistic from Table 2. If the calculated t-value is less than the 
critical value, the difference is not statistically significant; thus, 
the sampling and analysis procedure ensures stability, and you may 
submit a request for validation of the proposed alternative test method. 
If the calculated t-value is greater than the critical value, the 
difference is statistically significant, and you must repeat the 
procedures in Section 7.2 or 7.3 with new samples using shorter proposed 
maximum storage times.

                           Bias and Precision

                 8.0 What are the requirements for bias?

    You must establish bias by comparing the results of the sampling 
using the alternative test method against a reference value. The bias 
must be no more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent without the use of 
correction factors, and no more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 percent 
with the use of correction factors for bias values between 10 and 30 
percent for the alternative test method to be acceptable.

              9.0 What are the requirements for precision?

    At a minimum, you must use paired sampling systems to establish 
precision. If you are using analyte spiking, including isotopic samples, 
the precision expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the 
alternative test method at the level of the applicable emission 
limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 must be less 
than or equal to 20 percent. For samples with a precision greater than 
20 percent but less than 50 percent, a minimum of nine sample runs will 
be required. If you are comparing to a validated test method, the 
alternative test method must be at least as precise as the validated 
method at the level of the applicable emission limitation or standard in 
the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 as determined by an F test (Section 
11.2.2).

       10.0 What calculations must I perform for isotopic spiking?

    You must analyze the bias, precision, relative standard deviation, 
and data acceptance for isotopic spiking tests according to the 
provisions in Sections 10.1 through 10.3.
    10.1 Numerical Bias. Calculate the numerical value of the bias using 
the results from the analysis of the isotopically spiked field samples 
and the calculated value of the isotopically labeled spike according to 
Equation 301-4.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.005

Where:

B = Bias at the spike level.
S<INF>m</INF> = Mean of the measured values of the isotopically spiked 
          samples.
CS = Calculated value of the isotopically labeled spike.

    10.2 Standard Deviation. Calculate the standard deviation of the 
S<INF>i</INF> values according to Equation 301-5.

[[Page 615]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.006

Where:

S<INF>i</INF> = Measured value of the isotopically labeled analyte in 
          the i-th field sample,
n = Number of isotopically spiked samples, 12.

    10.3 t Test. Test the bias for statistical significance by 
calculating the t-statistic using Equation 301-6. Use the standard 
deviation determined in Section 10.2 and the numerical bias determined 
in Section 10.1.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.007

    Compare the calculated t-value with the critical value of the two-
sided t-distribution at the 95 percent confidence level and n-1 degrees 
of freedom. When spiking is conducted according to the procedures 
specified in Sections 6.2 and 6.4 as required, this critical value is 
2.201 for the 11 degrees of freedom. If the calculated t-value is less 
than the critical value, the bias is not statistically significant, and 
the bias of the candidate test method is acceptable. If the calculated 
t-value is greater than the critical value, the bias is statistically 
significant, and you must evaluate the relative magnitude of the bias 
using Equation 301-7.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.008

Where:

B<INF>R</INF> = Relative bias.

    If the relative bias is less than or equal to ten percent, the bias 
of the candidate test method is acceptable and no correction factors are 
required. If the relative bias is greater than 10 percent but less than 
30 percent, and if you correct all future data collected with the method 
for the magnitude of the bias, the bias of the candidate test method is 
acceptable. If either of the preceding two cases applies, you may 
continue to evaluate the method by calculating its precision. If not, 
the candidate method will not meet the requirements of Method 301.
    10.4 Relative Standard Deviation. Calculate the RSD according to 
Equation 301-8.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.009

Where:

S<INF>m</INF> = The measured mean of the isotopically labeled spiked 
          samples.

    The data and alternative test method are unacceptable if the RSD is 
greater than 20 percent.

 11.0 What calculations must I perform for comparison with a validated 
       method if I am using quadruplet replicate sampling systems?

    If you are using quadruplet replicate sampling systems to compare an 
alternative test method to a validated method, then you must analyze the 
data according to the provisions in this section. If the data from the 
alternative test method fail either the bias or precision test, the data 
and the alternative test method are unacceptable. If the Administrator 
determines that the affected source has highly variable emission rates, 
the Administrator may require additional precision checks.
    11.1 Bias Analysis. Test the bias for statistical significance at 
the 95 percent confidence level by calculating the t-statistic.
    11.1.1 Bias. Determine the bias, which is defined as the mean of the 
differences between the alternative test method and the validated method 
(d<INF>m</INF>). Calculate d<INF>i</INF> according to Equation 301-9.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.010

Where:

V<INF>1i</INF> = First measured value with the validated method in the 
          i-th sample.
V<INF>2i</INF> = Second measured value with the validated method in the 
          i-th sample.
P<INF>1i</INF> = First measured value with the alternative test method 
          in the i-th sample.
<INF>2i</INF> = Second measured value with the alternative test method 
          in the i-th sample.

    11.1.2 Standard Deviation of the Differences. Calculate the standard 
deviation of the differences, SD<INF>d</INF>, using Equation 301-2.
    11.1.3 t Test. Calculate the t-statistic using Equation 301-3, where 
n is the total number of test sample differences (d<INF>i</INF>). For 
the quadruplet sampling system procedure in Section 6.1 and Table 1, n 
equals four. Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical value 
of the t-statistic, and determine if the bias is significant at the 95 
percent confidence level. When four runs are conducted, as specified in 
Section 6.2 and Table 1, the critical value of the t-statistic is 3.182 
for three degrees of freedom. If the calculated t-value is less than the 
critical value, the bias is not statistically significant and the data 
are acceptable. If the calculated t-value is greater than the critical 
value, the bias is statistically significant, and you must evaluate the 
relative magnitude of the bias using Equation 301-10.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.011

Where:

B = Bias - mean of the d<INF>i</INF>'s.
VS = Mean measured by the validated method.

    If the relative bias is less than or equal to 10 percent, the bias 
of the candidate test method is acceptable and no correction factors are 
required. If the relative bias is greater than 10 percent but less than 
30 percent, and if you correct all future data collected with the method 
for the magnitude of the bias, the bias of the candidate test method is 
acceptable. If either of the preceding two cases applies, you may 
continue to evaluate the method by calculating its precision. If not, 
the candidate method will not meet the requirements of Method 301.
    11.2 Precision. Compare the estimated variance (or standard 
deviation) of the alternative test method to that of the validated 
method. If a significant difference is determined using the F test, the 
alternative test method and the results are rejected. If the F test does 
not show a significant difference, then the alternative test method has 
acceptable precision. Use the value furnished with the method. Calculate 
the estimated variance of the validated method using Equation 301-11.
    11.2.1 Alternative Test Method Variance. Calculate the estimated 
variance of the alternative test method, S<INF>p</INF>\2\, according to 
Equation 301-11.

[[Page 617]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.012

Where:

d<INF>i</INF> = The difference between the i-th pair of samples 
          collected with the alternative test method.
n = Number of samples and the degrees of freedom.

    11.2.2 F Test. Determine if the estimated variance of the 
alternative test method is greater than that of the validated method by 
calculating the F-value using Equation 301-12.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.013

Where:

S<INF>p</INF>\2\ = The estimated variance of the alternative method.
S<INF>v</INF>\2\ = The estimated variance of the validated method.

    Compare the experimental F value with the one-sided confidence level 
for F. The one-sided confidence level of 95 percent for F is 6.388 when 
the procedure specified in Section 6.1 and Table 1 for quadruplet trains 
is followed. If the calculated F is outside the critical range, the 
difference in precision is significant, and the data and the candidate 
test method are unacceptable.

       12.0 What calculations must I perform for analyte spiking?

    You must analyze the data for analyte spike testing according to 
this section.
    12.1 Bias Analysis. Test the bias for statistical significance at 
the 95 percent confidence level by calculating the t-statistic.
    12.1.1 Bias. Determine the bias using the results from the analysis 
of the spiked field samples, the unspiked field samples, and the 
calculated value of the spike using Equation 301-13.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.014

Where:

S<INF>1i</INF> = First measured value of the ith spiked sample.
S<INF>2i</INF> = Second measured value of the ith spiked sample.
M<INF>1i</INF> = First measured value of the ith unspiked sample.
M<INF>2i</INF> = Second measured value of the ith unspiked sample.
CS = Calculted value of the spiked level.

    12.1.2 Standard Deviation of the Differences. Calculate the standard 
deviation of the differences, SD<INF>d</INF>, using Equation 301-2.
    12.1.3 t Test. Calculate the t-statistic using Equation 301-3, where 
n is the total number of test sample differences (d<INF>i</INF>). For 
the quadruplet sampling system procedure in Table 1, n equals six. 
Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical value of the t-
statistic, and determine if the bias is significant at the 95 percent 
confidence level. When six runs are conducted, as specified in Table 1, 
the two-sided confidence level critical value is 2.571 for the five 
degrees of freedom. If the relative bias is less than or equal to 10 
percent with no correction factors, or the bias is greater than 10 
percent but less than 30 percent with the use of correction factors, 
then the data are acceptable. Proceed to evaluate precision of the 
candidate test method.

[[Page 618]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.015

Where:

B = Bias - mean of the d<INF>i</INF>'s.
VS = Mean measured by the validated method.

    12.2 Precision. Calculate the standard deviation and the relative 
standard deviation of the candidate test method. The relative standard 
deviation of the candidate test method can be calculated using Equation 
301-8.

             13.0 How do I conduct tests at similar sources?

    If the Administrator has approved the use of an alternative test 
method to a test method required in 40 CFR part 63 for an affected 
source, and the Administrator has approved the use of the alternative 
test method at your similar source according to the procedures in 
Section 17.1.1, you must meet the requirements in this section. You must 
have at least three replicate samples for each test that you conduct at 
the similar source. You must average the results of the samples to 
determine the pollutant concentration.

                          Optional Requirements

            14.0 How do I use and conduct ruggedness testing?

    If you want to use a validated test method at a concentration that 
is different from the concentration in the applicable emission 
limitation in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 or for a source category 
that is different from the source category that the test method 
specifies, then you must conduct ruggedness testing according to the 
procedures in Citation 18.16 of Section 18.0 and submit a request for a 
waiver according to Section 17.1.1.
    Ruggedness testing is a laboratory study to determine the 
sensitivity of a method to parameters such as sample collection rate, 
interferant concentration, collecting medium temperature, and sample 
recovery temperature. You conduct ruggedness testing by changing several 
variables simultaneously instead of changing one variable at a time. For 
example, you can determine the effect of seven variables in eight 
experiments instead of one. (W.J. Youden, Statistical Manual of the 
Association of Official Analytical Chemists, Association of Official 
Analytical Chemists, Washington, DC, 1975, pp. 33-36).

   15.0 How do I determine the Limit of Detection for the alternative 
                                 method?

    15.1 Limit of Detection. The Limit of Detection (LOD) is the lowest 
level above which you may obtain quantitative results with an acceptable 
degree of confidence. For this protocol, the LOD is defined as three 
times the standard deviation, S<INF>o</INF>, at the blank level.
    15.2 Purpose. The LOD will be used to establish the lower limit of 
the test method. If the estimated LOD is no more than twice the 
calculated LOD, use Procedure I in Table 4 to determine S<INF>o</INF>. 
If the LOD is greater than twice the calculated LOD, use Procedure II in 
Table 4 to determine S<INF>o</INF>. For radiochemical methods, use the 
Multi-Agency Radiological Laboratory Analytical Protocols (MARLAP) 
Manual (i.e., use the minimum detectable concentration (MDC) and not the 
LOD) available at http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/marlap/402-b-04-
001c-20--final.pdf.

                   Other Requirements and Information

   16.0 How do I apply for approval to use an alternative test method?

    16.1 Submitting Requests. You must request to use an alternative 
test method according to the procedures in Section 63.7(f). You may not 
use an alternative test method to meet any requirement under 40 CFR part 
63 until the Administrator has approved your request. The request must 
include a field validation report containing the information in Section 
16.2. The request must be submitted to the Director, Air Quality 
Assessment Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, C304-02, 
Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
    16.2 Field Validation Report. The field validation report must 
contain the information in Sections 16.2.1 through 16.2.8.
    16.2.1 Regulatory objectives for the testing, including a 
description of the reasons for the test, applicable emission limits, and 
a description of the source.
    16.2.2 Summary of the results and calculations shown in Sections 6.0 
through 16, as applicable.
    16.2.3 Analyte certification and value(s).
    16.2.4 Discussion of laboratory evaluations.
    16.2.5 Discussion of field sampling.
    16.2.6 Discussion of sample preparations and analysis.
    16.2.7 Storage times of samples (and extracts, if applicable).
    16.2.8 Reasons for eliminating any results.

                     17.0 How do I request a waiver?

    17.1 Conditions for Waivers. If you meet one of the criteria in 
Sections 17.1.1 through

[[Page 619]]

17.1.2, the Administrator may waive the requirement to use the 
procedures in this method to validate an alternative test method. In 
addition, if EPA currently recognizes an appropriate test method or 
considers the analyst's test method to be satisfactory for a particular 
source, the Administrator may waive the use of this protocol or may 
specify a less rigorous validation procedure.
    17.1.1 Similar Sources. If the alternative test method that you want 
to use has been validated at another source and you can demonstrate to 
the Administrator's satisfaction that your affected source is similar to 
that source, then the Administrator may waive the requirement for you to 
validate the alternative test method. One procedure you may use to 
demonstrate the applicability of the method to your affected source is 
by conducting a ruggedness test as described in Section 14.0.
    17.1.2 Documented Methods. If the bias and precision of the 
alternative test method that you are proposing have been demonstrated 
through laboratory tests or protocols different from this method, and 
you can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the bias 
and precision apply to your application, then the Administrator may 
waive the requirement to use this method or to use part of this method.
    17.2 Submitting Applications for Waivers. You must sign and submit 
each request for a waiver from the requirements in this method in 
writing. The request must be submitted to the Director, Air Quality 
Assessment Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, C304-02, 
Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
    17.3 Information Application for Waiver. The request for a waiver 
must contain a thorough description of the test method, the intended 
application, and results of any validation or other supporting 
documents. The request for a waiver must contain, at a minimum, the 
information in Sections 17.3.1 through 17.3.4. The Administrator may 
request additional information if necessary to determine whether this 
method can be waived for a particular application.
    17.3.1 A Clearly Written Test Method. The method should be written 
preferably in the format of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A Test Methods. It 
must include an applicability statement, concentration range, precision, 
bias (accuracy), and minimum and maximum storage time in which samples 
must be analyzed.
    17.3.2 Summaries of previous validation tests or other supporting 
documents. If a different procedure from that described in this method 
was used, you must submit documents substantiating the bias and 
precision values to the Administrator's satisfaction.
    17.3.3 Ruggedness Testing Results. You must submit results of 
ruggedness testing conducted according to Section 14.0, sample stability 
conducted according to Section 7.0, and detection limits conducted 
according to Section 15.0, as applicable. For example, you would not 
need to submit ruggedness testing results if you will be using the 
method at the same concentration level as the concentration level at 
which it was validated.
    17.3.4 Applicability Statement and Basis for Waiver Approval. Your 
discussion of the applicability statement and basis for approval of the 
waiver should address the following as applicable: Applicable 
regulation, emission standards, effluent characteristics, and process 
operations.

Method 303--Determination of Visible Emissions From By-Product Coke Oven 
                                Batteries

    Note: This method is not inclusive with respect to observer 
certification. Some material is incorporated by reference from other 
methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. Therefore, to obtain reliable 
results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of 
Method 9.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of visible emissions (VE) from the following by-product coke oven 
battery sources: charging systems during charging; doors, topside port 
lids, and offtake systems on operating coke ovens; and collecting mains. 
This method is also applicable for qualifying observers for visually 
determining the presence of VE. In order for the test method results to 
be indicative of plant performance, the time of day of the run should 
vary.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 A certified observer visually determines the VE from coke oven 
battery sources. Certification procedures are presented. This method 
does not require that opacity of emissions be determined or that 
magnitude be differentiated.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Bench means the platform structure in front of the oven doors.
    3.2 By-product Coke Oven Battery means a source consisting of a 
group of ovens connected by common walls, where coal undergoes 
destructive distillation under positive pressure to produce coke and 
coke oven gas, from which by-products are recovered.
    3.3 Charge or charging period means the period of time that 
commences when coal begins to flow into an oven through a topside port 
and ends when the last charging port is recapped.

[[Page 622]]

    3.4 Charging system means an apparatus used to charge coal to a coke 
oven (e.g., a larry car for wet coal charging systems).
    3.5 Coke oven door means each end enclosure on the push side and the 
coking side of an oven. The chuck, or leveler-bar, door is considered 
part of the push side door. The coke oven door area includes the entire 
area on the vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top 
of the battery between two adjacent buck stays.
    3.6 Coke side means the side of a battery from which the coke is 
discharged from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    3.7 Collecting main means any apparatus that is connected to one or 
more offtake systems and that provides a passage for conveying gases 
under positive pressure from the by-product coke oven battery to the by-
product recovery system.
    3.8 Consecutive charges means charges observed successively, 
excluding any charge during which the observer's view of the charging 
system or topside ports is obscured.
    3.9 Damper-off means to close off the gas passage between the coke 
oven and the collecting main, with no flow of raw coke oven gas from the 
collecting main into the oven or into the oven's offtake system(s).
    3.10 Decarbonization period means the period of time for combusting 
oven carbon that commences when the oven lids are removed from an empty 
oven or when standpipe caps of an oven are opened. The period ends with 
the initiation of the next charging period for that oven.
    3.11 Larry car means an apparatus used to charge coal to a coke oven 
with a wet coal charging system.
    3.12 Log average means logarithmic average as calculated in Section 
12.4.
    3.13 Offtake system means any individual oven apparatus that is 
stationary and provides a passage for gases from an oven to a coke oven 
battery collecting main or to another oven. Offtake system components 
include the standpipe and standpipe caps, goosenecks, stationary jumper 
pipes, mini-standpipes, and standpipe and gooseneck connections.
    3.14 Operating oven means any oven not out of operation for rebuild 
or maintenance work extensive enough to require the oven to be skipped 
in the charging sequence.
    3.15 Oven means a chamber in the coke oven battery in which coal 
undergoes destructive distillation to produce coke.
    3.16 Push side means the side of the battery from which the coke is 
pushed from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    3.17 Run means the observation of visible emissions from topside 
port lids, offtake systems, coke oven doors, or the charging of a single 
oven in accordance with this method.
    3.18 Shed means an enclosure that covers the side of the coke oven 
battery, captures emissions from pushing operations and from leaking 
coke oven doors on the coke side or push side of the coke oven battery, 
and routes the emissions to a control device or system.
    3.19 Standpipe cap means An apparatus used to cover the opening in 
the gooseneck of an offtake system.
    3.20 Topside port lid means a cover, removed during charging or 
decarbonizing, that is placed over the opening through which coal can be 
charged into the oven of a by-product coke oven battery.
    3.21 Traverse time means accumulated time for a traverse as measured 
by a stopwatch. Traverse time includes time to stop and write down oven 
numbers but excludes time waiting for obstructions of view to clear or 
for time to walk around obstacles.
    3.22 Visible Emissions or VE means any emission seen by the unaided 
(except for corrective lenses) eye, excluding steam or condensing water.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.
    5.2 Safety Training. Because coke oven batteries have hazardous 
environments, the training materials and the field training (Section 
10.0) shall cover the precautions required by the company to address 
health and safety hazards. Special emphasis shall be given to the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations 
pertaining to exposure of coke oven workers (see Reference 3 in Section 
16.0). In general, the regulation requires that special fire-retardant 
clothing and respirators be worn in certain restricted areas of the coke 
oven battery. The OSHA regulation also prohibits certain activities, 
such as chewing gum, smoking, and eating in these areas.

                  6.0 Equipment and Supplies [Reserved]

                  7.0 Reagents and Standards [Reserved]

 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage [Reserved]

                     9.0 Quality Control [Reserved]

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Observer certification and training requirements are as follows:

[[Page 623]]

    10.1 Certification Procedures. This method requires only the 
determination of whether VE occur and does not require the determination 
of opacity levels; therefore, observer certification according to Method 
9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is not required to obtain 
certification under this method. However, in order to receive Method 303 
observer certification, the first-time observer (trainee) shall have 
attended the lecture portion of the Method 9 certification course. In 
addition, the trainee shall successfully complete the Method 303 
training course, satisfy the field observation requirement, and 
demonstrate adequate performance and sufficient knowledge of Method 303. 
The Method 303 training course shall be conducted by or under the 
sanction of the EPA and shall consist of classroom instruction and field 
observations, and a proficiency test.
    10.1.1 The classroom instruction shall familiarize the trainees with 
Method 303 through lecture, written training materials, and a Method 303 
demonstration video. A successful completion of the classroom portion of 
the Method 303 training course shall be demonstrated by a perfect score 
on a written test. If the trainee fails to answer all of the questions 
correctly, the trainee may review the appropriate portion of the 
training materials and retake the test.
    10.1.2 The field observations shall be a minimum of 12 hours and 
shall be completed before attending the Method 303 certification course. 
Trainees shall observe the operation of a coke oven battery as it 
pertains to Method 303, including topside operations, and shall also 
practice conducting Method 303 or similar methods. During the field 
observations, trainees unfamiliar with coke battery operations shall 
receive instruction from an experienced coke oven observer familiar with 
Method 303 or similar methods and with the operation of coke batteries. 
The trainee must verify completion of at least 12 hours of field 
observation prior to attending the Method 303 certification course.
    10.1.3 All trainees must demonstrate proficiency in the application 
of Method 303 to a panel of three certified Method 303 observers, 
including an ability to differentiate coke oven emissions from 
condensing water vapor and smoldering coal. Each panel member shall have 
at least 120 days experience in reading visible emissions from coke 
ovens. The visible emissions inspections that will satisfy the 
experience requirement must be inspections of coke oven battery fugitive 
emissions from the emission points subject to emission standards under 
subpart L of this part (i.e., coke oven doors, topside port lids, 
offtake system(s), and charging operations), using either Method 303 or 
predecessor State or local test methods. A ``day's experience'' for a 
particular inspection is a day on which one complete inspection was 
performed for that emission point under Method 303 or a predecessor 
State or local method. A ``day's experience'' does not mean 8 or 10 
hours performing inspections, or any particular time expressed in 
minutes or hours that may have been spent performing them. Thus, it 
would be possible for an individual to qualify as a Method 303 panel 
member for some emission points, but not others (e.g., an individual 
might satisfy the experience requirement for coke oven doors, but not 
topside port lids). Until November 15, 1994, the EPA may waive the 
certification requirement (but not the experience requirement) for panel 
members. The composition of the panel shall be approved by the EPA. The 
panel shall observe the trainee in a series of training runs and a 
series of certification runs. There shall be a minimum of 1 training run 
for doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems, and a minimum of 5 
training runs (i.e., 5 charges) for charging. During training runs, the 
panel can advise the trainee on proper procedures. There shall be a 
minimum of 3 certification runs for doors, topside port lids, and 
offtake systems, and a minimum of 15 certification runs for charging 
(i.e., 15 charges). The certifications runs shall be unassisted. 
Following the certification test runs, the panel shall approve or 
disapprove certification based on the trainee's performance during the 
certification runs. To obtain certification, the trainee shall 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the panel a high degree of 
proficiency in performing Method 303. To aid in evaluating the trainee's 
performance, a checklist, provided by the EPA, will be used by the panel 
members.
    10.2 Observer Certification/Recertification. The coke oven observer 
certification is valid for 1 year from date of issue. The observer shall 
recertify annually by viewing the training video and answering all of 
the questions on the certification test correctly. Every 3 years, an 
observer shall be required to pass the proficiency test in Section 
10.1.3 in order to be certified.
    10.3 The EPA (or applicable enforcement agency) shall maintain 
records reflecting a certified observer's successful completion of the 
proficiency test, which shall include the completed proficiency test 
checklists for the certification runs.
    10.4 An owner or operator of a coke oven battery subject to subpart 
L of this part may observe a training and certification program under 
this section.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Procedure for Determining VE from Charging Systems During 
Charging.
    11.1.1 Number of Oven Charges. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this 
part for the number of oven charges to observe. The observer shall 
observe consecutive charges. Charges that are nonconsecutive can only be 
observed

[[Page 624]]

when necessary to replace observations terminated prior to the 
completion of a charge because of visual interferences. (See Section 
11.1.5).
    11.1.2 Data Records. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the charging system inspection sheet (Figure 303-1). For each charge, 
record the identification number of the oven being charged, the 
approximate beginning time of the charge, and the identification of the 
larry car used for the charge.
    11.1.3 Observer Position. Stand in an area or move to positions on 
the topside of the coke oven battery with an unobstructed view of the 
entire charging system. For wet coal charging systems or non-pipeline 
coal charging systems, the observer should have an unobstructed view of 
the emission points of the charging system, including larry car hoppers, 
drop sleeves, and the topside ports of the oven being charged. Some 
charging systems are configured so that all emission points can only be 
seen from a distance of five ovens. For other batteries, distances of 8 
to 12 ovens are adequate.
    11.1.4 Observation. The charging period begins when coal begins to 
flow into the oven and ends when the last charging port is recapped. 
During the charging period, observe all of the potential sources of VE 
from the entire charging system. For wet coal charging systems or non-
pipeline coal charging systems, sources of VE typically include the 
larry car hoppers, drop sleeves, slide gates, and topside ports on the 
oven being charged. Any VE from an open standpipe cap on the oven being 
charged is included as charging VE.
    11.1.4.1 Using an accumulative-type stopwatch with unit divisions of 
at least 0.5 seconds, determine the total time VE are observed as 
follows. Upon observing any VE emerging from any part of the charging 
system, start the stopwatch. Stop the watch when VE are no longer 
observed emerging, and restart the watch when VE reemerges.
    11.1.4.2 When VE occur simultaneously from several points during a 
charge, consider the sources as one. Time overlapping VE as continuous 
VE. Time single puffs of VE only for the time it takes for the puff to 
emerge from the charging system. Continue to time VE in this manner for 
the entire charging period. Record the accumulated time to the nearest 
0.5 second under ``Visible emissions, seconds'' on Figure 303-1.
    11.1.5 Visual Interference. If fugitive VE from other sources at the 
coke oven battery site (e.g., door leaks or condensing water vapor from 
the coke oven wharf) prevent a clear view of the charging system during 
a charge, stop the stopwatch and make an appropriate notation under 
``Comments'' on Figure 303-1. Label the observation an observation of an 
incomplete charge, and observe another charge to fulfill the 
requirements of Section 11.1.1.
    11.1.6 VE Exemptions. Do not time the following VE:
    11.1.6.1 The VE from burning or smoldering coal spilled on top of 
the oven, topside port lid, or larry car surfaces;

    Note: The VE from smoldering coal are generally white or gray. These 
VE generally have a plume of less than 1 meter long. If the observer 
cannot safely and with reasonable confidence determine that VE are from 
charging, do not count them as charging emissions.

    11.1.6.2 The VE from the coke oven doors or from the leveler bar; or
    11.1.6.3 The VE that drift from the top of a larry car hopper if the 
emissions had already been timed as VE from the drop sleeve.

    Note: When the slide gate on a larry car hopper closes after the 
coal has been added to the oven, the seal may not be airtight. On 
occasions, a puff of smoke observed at the drop sleeves is forced past 
the slide gate up into the larry car hopper and may drift from the top; 
time these VE either at the drop sleeves or the hopper. If the larry car 
hopper does not have a slide gate or the slide gate is left open or 
partially closed, VE may quickly pass through the larry car hopper 
without being observed at the drop sleeves and will appear as a strong 
surge of smoke; time these as charging VE.

    11.1.7 Total Time Record. Record the total time that VE were 
observed for each charging operation in the appropriate column on the 
charging system inspection sheet.
    11.1.8 Determination of Validity of a Set of Observations. Five 
charging observations (runs) obtained in accordance with this method 
shall be considered a valid set of observations for that day. No 
observation of an incomplete charge shall be included in a daily set of 
observations that is lower than the lowest reading for a complete 
charge. If both complete and incomplete charges have been observed, the 
daily set of observations shall include the five highest values 
observed. Four or three charging observations (runs) obtained in 
accordance with this method shall be considered a valid set of charging 
observations only where it is not possible to obtain five charging 
observations, because visual interferences (see Section 11.1.5) or 
inclement weather prevent a clear view of the charging system during 
charging. However, observations from three or four charges that satisfy 
these requirements shall not be considered a valid set of charging 
observations if use of such set of observations in a calculation under 
Section 12.4 would cause the value of A to be less than 145.
    11.1.9 Log Average. For each day on which a valid daily set of 
observations is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling log average

[[Page 625]]

of seconds of visible emissions from the charging operation for each 
battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily sets of 
observations, in accordance with Section 12.4.
    11.2. Procedure for Determining VE from Coke Oven Door Areas. The 
intent of this procedure is to determine VE from coke oven door areas by 
carefully observing the door area from a standard distance while walking 
at a normal pace.
    11.2.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for 
the appropriate number of runs.
    11.2.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a battery traverse, walk the 
length of the battery on the outside of the pusher machine and quench 
car tracks at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing to make appropriate 
entries on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2). A single test 
run consists of two timed traverses, one for the coke side and one for 
the push side. The walking pace shall be such that the duration of the 
traverse does not exceed an average of 4 seconds per oven door, 
excluding time spent moving around stationary obstructions or waiting 
for other obstructions to move from positions blocking the view of a 
series of doors. Extra time is allowed for each leak (a maximum of 10 
additional seconds for each leaking door) for the observer to make the 
proper notation. A walking pace of 3 seconds per oven door has been 
found to be typical. Record the actual traverse time with a stopwatch.
    11.2.2.1 Include in the traverse time only the time spent observing 
the doors and recording door leaks. To measure actual traverse time, use 
an accumulative-type stopwatch with unit divisions of 0.5 seconds or 
less. Exclude interruptions to the traverse and time required for the 
observer to move to positions where the view of the battery is 
unobstructed, or for obstructions, such as the door machine, to move 
from positions blocking the view of a series of doors.
    11.2.2.2 Various situations may arise that will prevent the observer 
from viewing a door or a series of doors. Prior to the door inspection, 
the owner or operator may elect to temporarily suspend charging 
operations for the duration of the inspection, so that all of the doors 
can be viewed by the observer. The observer has two options for dealing 
with obstructions to view: (a) Stop the stopwatch and wait for the 
equipment to move or the fugitive emissions to dissipate before 
completing the traverse; or (b) stop the stopwatch, skip the affected 
ovens, and move to an unobstructed position to continue the traverse. 
Restart the stopwatch and continue the traverse. After the completion of 
the traverse, if the equipment has moved or the fugitive emissions have 
dissipated, inspect the affected doors. If the equipment is still 
preventing the observer from viewing the doors, then the affected doors 
may be counted as not observed. If option (b) is used because of doors 
blocked by machines during charging operations, then, of the affected 
doors, exclude the door from the most recently charged oven from the 
inspection. Record the oven numbers and make an appropriate notation 
under ``Comments'' on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2).
    11.2.2.3 When batteries have sheds to control emissions, conduct the 
inspection from outside the shed unless the doors cannot be adequately 
viewed. In this case, conduct the inspection from the bench. Be aware of 
special safety considerations pertinent to walking on the bench and 
follow the instructions of company personnel on the required equipment 
and procedures. If possible, conduct the bench traverse whenever the 
bench is clear of the door machine and hot coke guide.
    11.2.3 Observations. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2), including the number 
of non-operating ovens. Record the clock time at the start of the 
traverse on each side of the battery. Record which side is being 
inspected (i.e., coke side or push side). Other information may be 
recorded at the discretion of the observer, such as the location of the 
leak (e.g., top of the door, chuck door, etc.), the reason for any 
interruption of the traverse, or the position of the sun relative to the 
battery and sky conditions (e.g., overcast, partly sunny, etc.).
    11.2.3.1 Begin the test run by starting the stopwatch and traversing 
either the coke side or the push side of the battery. After completing 
one side, stop the watch. Complete this procedure on the other side. If 
inspecting more than one battery, the observer may view the push sides 
and the coke sides sequentially.
    11.2.3.2 During the traverse, look around the entire perimeter of 
each oven door. The door is considered leaking if VE are detected in the 
coke oven door area. The coke oven door area includes the entire area on 
the vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the 
battery between two adjacent buck stays (e.g., the oven door, chuck 
door, between the masonry brick, buck stay or jamb, or other sources). 
Record the oven number and make the appropriate notation on the door 
area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2).

    Note: Multiple VE from the same door area (e.g., VE from both the 
chuck door and the push side door) are counted as only one emitting 
door, not as multiple emitting doors.

    11.2.3.3 Do not record the following sources as door area VE:
    11.2.3.3.1 VE from ovens with doors removed. Record the oven number 
and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;''

[[Page 626]]

    11.2.3.3.2 VE from ovens taken out of service. The owner or operator 
shall notify the observer as to which ovens are out of service. Record 
the oven number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;'' or
    11.2.3.3.3 VE from hot coke that has been spilled on the bench as a 
result of pushing.
    11.2.4 Criteria for Acceptance. After completing the run, calculate 
the maximum time allowed to observe the ovens using the equation in 
Section 12.2. If the total traverse time exceeds T, void the run, and 
conduct another run to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of 
this part.
    11.2.5 Percent Leaking Doors. For each day on which a valid 
observation is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling average for 
each battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily 
observations, in accordance with Section 12.5.
    11.3 Procedure for Determining VE from Topside Port Lids and Offtake 
Systems.
    11.3.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for 
the number of runs to be conducted. Simultaneous runs or separate runs 
for the topside port lids and offtake systems may be conducted.
    11.3.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a topside traverse of the 
battery, walk the length of the battery at a steady, normal walking 
pace, pausing only to make appropriate entries on the topside inspection 
sheet (Figure 303-3). The walking pace shall not exceed an average rate 
of 4 seconds per oven, excluding time spent moving around stationary 
obstructions or waiting for other obstructions to move from positions 
blocking the view. Extra time is allowed for each leak for the observer 
to make the proper notation. A walking pace of 3 seconds per oven is 
typical. Record the actual traverse time with a stopwatch.
    11.3.3 Topside Port Lid Observations. To observe lids of the ovens 
involved in the charging operation, the observer shall wait to view the 
lids until approximately 5 minutes after the completion of the charge. 
Record all the information requested on the topside inspection sheet 
(Figure 303-3). Record the clock time when traverses begin and end. If 
the observer's view is obstructed during the traverse (e.g., steam from 
the coke wharf, larry car, etc.), follow the guidelines given in Section 
11.2.2.2.
    11.3.3.1 To perform a test run, conduct a single traverse on the 
topside of the battery. The observer shall walk near the center of the 
battery but may deviate from this path to avoid safety hazards (such as 
open or closed charging ports, luting buckets, lid removal bars, and 
topside port lids that have been removed) and any other obstacles. Upon 
noting VE from the topside port lid(s) of an oven, record the oven 
number and port number, then resume the traverse. If any oven is 
dampered-off from the collecting main for decarbonization, note this 
under ``Comments'' for that particular oven.

    Note: Count the number of topside ports, not the number of points, 
exhibiting VE, i.e., if a topside port has several points of VE, count 
this as one port exhibiting VE.

    11.3.3.2 Do not count the following as topside port lid VE:
    11.3.3.2.1 VE from between the brickwork and oven lid casing or VE 
from cracks in the oven brickwork. Note these VE under ``Comments;''
    11.3.3.2.2 VE from topside ports involved in a charging operation. 
Record the oven number, and make an appropriate notation (e.g., not 
observed because ports open for charging) under ``Comments;''
    11.3.3.2.3 Topside ports having maintenance work done. Record the 
oven number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;'' or
    11.3.3.2.4 Condensing water from wet-sealing material. Ports with 
only visible condensing water from wet-sealing material are counted as 
observed but not as having VE.
    11.3.3.2.5 Visible emissions from the flue inspection ports and 
caps.
    11.3.4 Offtake Systems Observations. To perform a test run, traverse 
the battery as in Section 11.3.3.1. Look ahead and back two to four 
ovens to get a clear view of the entire offtake system for each oven. 
Consider visible emissions from the following points as offtake system 
VE: (a) the flange between the gooseneck and collecting main 
(``saddle''), (b) the junction point of the standpipe and oven 
(``standpipe base''), (c) the other parts of the offtake system (e.g., 
the standpipe cap), and (d) the junction points with ovens and flanges 
of jumper pipes.
    11.3.4.1 Do not stray from the traverse line in order to get a 
``closer look'' at any part of the offtake system unless it is to 
distinguish leaks from interferences from other sources or to avoid 
obstacles.
    11.3.4.2 If the centerline does not provide a clear view of the 
entire offtake system for each oven (e.g., when standpipes are longer 
than 15 feet), the observer may conduct the traverse farther from 
(rather than closer to) the offtake systems.
    11.3.4.3 Upon noting a leak from an offtake system during a 
traverse, record the oven number. Resume the traverse. If the oven is 
dampered-off from the collecting main for decarbonization and VE are 
observed, note this under ``Comments'' for that particular oven.
    11.3.4.4 If any part or parts of an offtake system have VE, count it 
as one emitting offtake system. Each stationary jumper pipe is 
considered a single offtake system.
    11.3.4.5 Do not count standpipe caps open for a decarbonization 
period or standpipes of an oven being charged as source of offtake 
system VE. Record the oven number and

[[Page 627]]

write ``Not observed'' and the reason (i.e., decarb or charging) under 
``Comments.''

    Note: VE from open standpipes of an oven being charged count as 
charging emissions. All VE from closed standpipe caps count as offtake 
leaks.

    11.3.5 Criteria for Acceptance. After completing the run (allow 2 
traverses for batteries with double mains), calculate the maximum time 
allowed to observe the topside port lids and/or offtake systems using 
the equation in Section 12.3. If the total traverse time exceeds T, void 
the run and conduct another run to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 
63.309(c)(1) of this part.
    11.3.6 In determining the percent leaking topside port lids and 
percent leaking offtake systems, do not include topside port lids or 
offtake systems with VE from the following ovens:
    11.3.6.1 Empty ovens, including ovens undergoing maintenance, which 
are properly dampered off from the main.
    11.3.6.2 Ovens being charged or being pushed.
    11.3.6.3 Up to 3 full ovens that have been dampered off from the 
main prior to pushing.
    11.3.6.4 Up to 3 additional full ovens in the pushing sequence that 
have been dampered off from the main for offtake system cleaning, for 
decarbonization, for safety reasons, or when a charging/pushing schedule 
involves widely separated ovens (e.g., a Marquard system); or that have 
been dampered off from the main for maintenance near the end of the 
coking cycle. Examples of reasons that ovens are dampered off for safety 
reasons are to avoid exposing workers in areas with insufficient 
clearance between standpipes and the larry car, or in areas where 
workers could be exposed to flames or hot gases from open standpipes, 
and to avoid the potential for removing a door on an oven that is not 
dampered off from the main.
    11.3.7 Percent Leaking Topside Port Lids and Offtake Systems. For 
each day on which a valid observation is obtained, calculate the daily 
30-day rolling average for each battery using these data and the 29 
previous valid daily observations, in accordance with Sections 12.6 and 
12.7.
    11.4 Procedure for Determining VE from Collecting Mains.
    11.4.1 Traverse. To perform a test run, traverse both the collecting 
main catwalk and the battery topside along the side closest to the 
collecting main. If the battery has a double main, conduct two sets of 
traverses for each run, i.e., one set for each main.
    11.4.2 Data Recording. Upon noting VE from any portion of a 
collection main, identify the source and approximate location of the 
source of VE and record the time under ``Collecting main'' on Figure 
303-3; then resume the traverse.
    11.4.3 Collecting Main Pressure Check. After the completion of the 
door traverse, the topside port lids, and offtake systems, compare the 
collecting main pressure during the inspection to the collecting main 
pressure during the previous 8 to 24 hours. Record the following: (a) 
the pressure during inspection, (b) presence of pressure deviation from 
normal operations, and (c) the explanation for any pressure deviation 
from normal operations, if any, offered by the operators. The owner or 
operator of the coke battery shall maintain the pressure recording 
equipment and conduct the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) 
necessary to ensure reliable pressure readings and shall keep the QA/QC 
records for at least 6 months. The observer may periodically check the 
QA/QC records to determine their completeness. The owner or operator 
shall provide access to the records within 1 hour of an observer's 
request.

 Method 303A--Determination of Visible Emissions From Nonrecovery Coke 
                             Oven Batteries

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications 
pertaining to observer certification. Some material is incorporated by 
reference from other methods in this part and in appendix A to 40 CFR 
part 60. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this 
method should have a thorough knowledge of Method 9 and Method 303.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of visible emissions (VE) from leaking doors at nonrecovery coke oven 
batteries.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 A certified observer visually determines the VE from coke oven 
battery sources while walking at a normal pace. This method does not 
require that opacity of emissions be determined or that magnitude be 
differentiated.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Bench means the platform structure in front of the oven doors.
    3.2 Coke oven door means each end enclosure on the push side and the 
coking side of an oven.
    3.3 Coke side means the side of a battery from which the coke is 
discharged from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    3.4 Nonrecovery coke oven battery means a source consisting of a 
group of ovens connected by common walls and operated as a unit, where 
coal undergoes destructive distillation under negative pressure to 
produce coke, and which is designed for the combustion of coke oven gas 
from which by-products are not recovered.
    3.5 Operating oven means any oven not out of operation for rebuild 
or maintenance work

[[Page 633]]

extensive enough to require the oven to be skipped in the charging 
sequence.
    3.6 Oven means a chamber in the coke oven battery in which coal 
undergoes destructive distillation to produce coke.
    3.7 Push side means the side of the battery from which the coke is 
pushed from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    3.8 Run means the observation of visible emissions from coke oven 
doors in accordance with this method.
    3.9 Shed means an enclosure that covers the side of the coke oven 
battery, captures emissions from pushing operations and from leaking 
coke oven doors on the coke side or push side of the coke oven battery, 
and routes the emissions to a control device or system.
    3.10 Traverse time means accumulated time for a traverse as measured 
by a stopwatch. Traverse time includes time to stop and write down oven 
numbers but excludes time waiting for obstructions of view to clear or 
for time to walk around obstacles.
    3.11 Visible Emissions or VE means any emission seen by the unaided 
(except for corrective lenses) eye, excluding steam or condensing water.

                      4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.
    5.2 Safety Training. Because coke oven batteries have hazardous 
environments, the training materials and the field training (Section 
10.0) shall cover the precautions required by the company to address 
health and safety hazards. Special emphasis shall be given to the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations 
pertaining to exposure of coke oven workers (see Reference 3 in Section 
16.0). In general, the regulation requires that special fire-retardant 
clothing and respirators be worn in certain restricted areas of the coke 
oven battery. The OSHA regulation also prohibits certain activities, 
such as chewing gum, smoking, and eating in these areas.

                  6.0 Equipment and Supplies [Reserved]

                  7.0 Reagents and Standards [Reserved]

 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage [Reserved]

                     9.0 Quality Control [Reserved]

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization.

    10.1 Training. This method requires only the determination of 
whether VE occur and does not require the determination of opacity 
levels; therefore, observer certification according to Method 9 in 
Appendix A to Part 60 is not required. However, the first-time observer 
(trainee) shall have attended the lecture portion of the Method 9 
certification course. Furthermore, before conducting any VE 
observations, an observer shall become familiar with nonrecovery coke 
oven battery operations and with this test method by observing for a 
minimum of 4 hours the operation of a nonrecovery coke oven battery in 
the presence of personnel experienced in performing Method 303 
assessments.

                             11.0 Procedure

    The intent of this procedure is to determine VE from coke oven door 
areas by carefully observing the door area while walking at a normal 
pace.
    11.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for 
the appropriate number of runs.
    11.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a battery traverse, walk the 
length of the battery on the outside of the pusher machine and quench 
car tracks at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing to make appropriate 
entries on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1). The walking 
pace shall be such that the duration of the traverse does not exceed an 
average of 4 seconds per oven door, excluding time spent moving around 
stationary obstructions or waiting for other obstructions to move from 
positions blocking the view of a series of doors. Extra time is allowed 
for each leak (a maximum of 10 additional seconds for each leaking door) 
for the observer to make the proper notation. A walking pace of 3 
seconds per oven door has been found to be typical. Record the actual 
traverse time with a stopwatch. A single test run consists of two timed 
traverses, one for the coke side and one for the push side.
    11.2.1 Various situations may arise that will prevent the observer 
from viewing a door or a series of doors. The observer has two options 
for dealing with obstructions to view: (a) Wait for the equipment to 
move or the fugitive emissions to dissipate before completing the 
traverse; or (b) skip the affected ovens and move to an unobstructed 
position to continue the traverse. Continue

[[Page 634]]

the traverse. After the completion of the traverse, if the equipment has 
moved or the fugitive emissions have dissipated, complete the traverse 
by inspecting the affected doors. Record the oven numbers and make an 
appropriate notation under ``Comments'' on the door area inspection 
sheet (Figure 303A-1).

    Note: Extra time incurred for handling obstructions is not counted 
in the traverse time.

    11.2.2 When batteries have sheds to control pushing emissions, 
conduct the inspection from outside the shed, if the shed allows such 
observations, or from the bench. Be aware of special safety 
considerations pertinent to walking on the bench and follow the 
instructions of company personnel on the required equipment and 
operations procedures. If possible, conduct the bench traverse whenever 
the bench is clear of the door machine and hot coke guide.
    11.3 Observations. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1), including the number 
of non-operating ovens. Record which side is being inspected, i.e., coke 
side or push side. Other information may be recorded at the discretion 
of the observer, such as the location of the leak (e.g., top of the 
door), the reason for any interruption of the traverse, or the position 
of the sun relative to the battery and sky conditions (e.g., overcast, 
partly sunny, etc.).
    11.3.1 Begin the test run by traversing either the coke side or the 
push side of the battery. After completing one side, traverse the other 
side.
    11.3.2 During the traverse, look around the entire perimeter of each 
oven door. The door is considered leaking if VE are detected in the coke 
oven door area. The coke oven door area includes the entire area on the 
vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the 
battery and the adjacent doors on both sides. Record the oven number and 
make the appropriate notation on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 
303A-1).
    11.3.3 Do not record the following sources as door area VE:
    11.3.3.1 VE from ovens with doors removed. Record the oven number 
and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments'';
    11.3.3.2 VE from ovens where maintenance work is being conducted. 
Record the oven number and make an appropriate notation under 
``Comments''; or
    11.3.3.3 VE from hot coke that has been spilled on the bench as a 
result of pushing.

Method 304A: Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds 
                              (Vent Option)

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of biodegradation rates of organic compounds in an activated sludge 
process. The test method is designed to evaluate the ability of an 
aerobic biological reaction system to degrade or destroy specific 
components in waste streams. The method may also be used to determine 
the effects of changes in wastewater composition on operation. The 
biodegradation rates determined by utilizing this method are not 
representative of a full-scale system. The rates measured by this method 
shall be used in conjunction with the procedures listed in appendix C of 
this part to calculate the fraction emitted to the air versus the 
fraction biodegraded.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 A self-contained benchtop bioreactor system is assembled in the 
laboratory. A sample of mixed liquor is added and the waste stream is 
then fed continuously. The benchtop bioreactor is operated under 
conditions nearly identical to the target full-scale activated sludge 
process. Bioreactor temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, average 
residence time in the reactor, waste composition, biomass concentration, 
and biomass composition of the full-scale process are the parameters 
which are duplicated in the benchtop bioreactor. Biomass shall be 
removed from the target full-scale activated sludge unit and held for no 
more than 4 hours prior to use in the benchtop bioreactor. If 
antifoaming agents are used in the full-scale system, they shall also be 
used in the benchtop bioreactor. The feed flowing into and the effluent 
exiting the benchtop bioreactor are analyzed to determine the 
biodegradation rates of the target compounds. The flow rate of the exit 
vent is used to calculate the concentration of target compounds 
(utilizing Henry's law) in the exit gas stream. If Henry's law constants 
for the compounds of interest are not known, this method cannot be used 
in the determination of the biodegradation rate and Method 304B is the 
suggested method. The choice of analytical methodology for measuring the 
compounds of interest at the inlet and outlet to the benchtop bioreactor 
are left to the discretion of the source, except where validated methods 
are available.

                       3.0 Definitions [Reserved]

                      4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 If explosive gases are produced as a byproduct of biodegradation 
and could realistically pose a hazard, closely monitor headspace 
concentration of these gases to ensure laboratory safety. Placement of 
the benchtop bioreactor system inside a laboratory hood is recommended 
regardless of byproducts produced.

[[Page 636]]

                       6.0. Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Figure 304A-1 illustrates a typical laboratory apparatus used 
to measure biodegradation rates. While the following description refers 
to Figure 304A-1, the EPA recognizes that alternative reactor 
configurations, such as alternative reactor shapes and locations of 
probes and the feed inlet, will also meet the intent of this method. 
Ensure that the benchtop bioreactor system is self-contained and 
isolated from the atmosphere (except for the exit vent stream) by leak-
checking fittings, tubing, etc.

    6.1 Benchtop Bioreactor. The biological reaction is conducted in a 
biological oxidation reactor of at least 6 liters capacity. The benchtop 
bioreactor is sealed and equipped with internal probes for controlling 
and monitoring dissolved oxygen and internal temperature. The top of the 
reactor is equipped for aerators, gas flow ports, and instrumentation 
(while ensuring that no leaks to the atmosphere exist around the 
fittings).
    6.2 Aeration gas. Aeration gas is added to the benchtop bioreactor 
through three diffusers, which are glass tubes that extend to the bottom 
fifth of the reactor depth. A pure oxygen pressurized cylinder is 
recommended in order to maintain the specified oxygen concentration. 
Install a blower (e.g., Diaphragm Type, 15 SCFH capacity) to blow the 
aeration gas into the reactor diffusers. Measure the aeration gas flow 
rate with a rotameter (e.g., 0-15 SCFH recommended). The aeration gas 
will rise through the benchtop bioreactor, dissolving oxygen into the 
mixture in the process. The aeration gas must provide sufficient 
agitation to keep the solids in suspension. Provide an exit for the 
aeration gas from the top flange of the benchtop bioreactor through a 
water-cooled (e.g., Allihn-type) vertical condenser. Install the 
condenser through a gas-tight fitting in the benchtop bioreactor 
closure. Install a splitter which directs a portion of the gas to an 
exit vent and the rest of the gas through an air recycle pump back to 
the benchtop bioreactor. Monitor and record the flow rate through the 
exit vent at least 3 times per day throughout the day.
    6.3 Wastewater Feed. Supply the wastewater feed to the benchtop 
bioreactor in a collapsible low-density polyethylene container or 
collapsible liner in a container (e.g., 20 L) equipped with a spigot cap 
(collapsible containers or liners of other material may be required due 
to the permeability of some volatile compounds through polyethylene). 
Obtain the wastewater feed by sampling the wastewater feed in the target 
process. A representative sample of wastewater shall be obtained from 
the piping leading to the aeration tank. This sample may be obtained 
from existing sampling valves at the discharge of the wastewater feed 
pump, or collected from a pipe discharging to the aeration tank, or by 
pumping from a well-mixed equalization tank upstream from the aeration 
tank. Alternatively, wastewater can be pumped continuously to the 
laboratory apparatus from a bleed stream taken from the equalization 
tank of the full-scale treatment system.
    6.3.1 Refrigeration System. Keep the wastewater feed cool by ice or 
by refrigeration to 4 [deg]C. If using a bleed stream from the 
equalization tank, refrigeration is not required if the residence time 
in the bleed stream is less than five minutes.
    6.3.2 Wastewater Feed Pump. The wastewater is pumped from the 
refrigerated container using a variable-speed peristaltic pump drive 
equipped with a peristaltic pump head. Add the feed solution to the 
benchtop bioreactor through a fitting on the top flange. Determine the 
rate of feed addition to provide a retention time in the benchtop 
bioreactor that is numerically equivalent to the retention time in the 
full-scale system. The wastewater shall be fed at a rate sufficient to 
achieve 90 to 100 percent of the full-scale system residence time.
    6.3.3 Treated wastewater feed. The benchtop bioreactor effluent 
exits at the bottom of the reactor through a tube and proceeds to the 
clarifier.
    6.4 Clarifier. The effluent flows to a separate closed clarifier 
that allows separation of biomass and effluent (e.g., 2-liter pear-
shaped glass separatory funnel, modified by removing the stopcock and 
adding a 25-mm OD glass tube at the bottom). Benchtop bioreactor 
effluent enters the clarifier through a tube inserted to a depth of 0.08 
m (3 in.) through a stopper at the top of the clarifier. System effluent 
flows from a tube inserted through the stopper at the top of the 
clarifier to a drain (or sample bottle when sampling). The underflow 
from the clarifier leaves from the glass tube at the bottom of the 
clarifier. Flexible tubing connects this fitting to the sludge recycle 
pump. This pump is coupled to a variable speed pump drive. The discharge 
from this pump is returned through a tube inserted in a port on the side 
of the benchtop bioreactor. An additional port is provided near the 
bottom of the benchtop bioreactor for sampling the reactor contents. The 
mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor flows into the center of the 
clarifier. The clarified system effluent separates from the biomass and 
flows through an exit near the top of the clarifier. There shall be no 
headspace in the clarifier.
    6.5 Temperature Control Apparatus. Capable of maintaining the system 
at a temperature equal to the temperature of the full-scale system. The 
average temperature should be maintained within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C of the set point.

[[Page 637]]

    6.5.1 Temperature Monitoring Device. A resistance type temperature 
probe or a thermocouple connected to a temperature readout with a 
resolution of 0.1 [deg]C or better.
    6.5.2 Benchtop Bioreactor Heater. The heater is connected to the 
temperature control device.
    6.6 Oxygen Control System. Maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration at the levels present in the full-scale system. Target 
full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentration 
below 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration 
in the benchtop ioreactor within 0.5 mg/L of the target dissolved oxygen 
level. Target full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen 
concentration above 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration in the benchtop bioreactor within 1.5 mg/L of the target 
dissolved oxygen concentration; however, for target full-scale activated 
sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentrations above 2 mg/L, the 
dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor may not drop 
below 1.5 mg/L. If the benchtop bioreactor is outside the control range, 
the dissolved oxygen is noted and the reactor operation is adjusted.
    6.6.1 Dissolved Oxygen Monitor. Dissolved oxygen is monitored with a 
polarographic probe (gas permeable membrane) connected to a dissolved 
oxygen meter (e.g., 0 to 15 mg/L, 0 to 50 [deg]C).
    6.6.2 Benchtop Bioreactor Pressure Monitor. The benchtop bioreactor 
pressure is monitored through a port in the top flange of the reactor. 
This is connected to a gauge control with a span of 13-cm water vacuum 
to 13-cm water pressure or better. A relay is activated when the vacuum 
exceeds an adjustable setpoint which opens a solenoid valve (normally 
closed), admitting oxygen to the system. The vacuum setpoint controlling 
oxygen addition to the system shall be set at approximately 2.5 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 cm water and maintained at this setting except 
during brief periods when the dissolved oxygen concentration is 
adjusted.
    6.7 Connecting Tubing. All connecting tubing shall be Teflon or 
equivalent in impermeability. The only exception to this specification 
is the tubing directly inside the pump head of the wastewater feed pump, 
which may be Viton, Silicone or another type of flexible tubing.

    Note: Mention of trade names or products does not constitute 
endorsement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Wastewater. Obtain a representative sample of wastewater at the 
inlet to the full-scale treatment plant if there is an existing full-
scale treatment plant (see section 6.3). If there is no existing full-
scale treatment plant, obtain the wastewater sample as close to the 
point of determination as possible. Collect the sample by pumping the 
wastewater into the 20-L collapsible container. The loss of volatiles 
shall be minimized from the wastewater by collapsing the container 
before filling, by minimizing the time of filling, and by avoiding a 
headspace in the container after filling. If the wastewater requires the 
addition of nutrients to support the biomass growth and maintain biomass 
characteristics, those nutrients are added and mixed with the container 
contents after the container is filled.
    7.2 Biomass. Obtain the biomass or activated sludge used for rate 
constant determination in the bench-scale process from the existing 
full-scale process or from a representative biomass culture (e.g., 
biomass that has been developed for a future full-scale process). This 
biomass is preferentially obtained from a thickened acclimated mixed 
liquor sample. Collect the sample either by bailing from the mixed 
liquor in the aeration tank with a weighted container, or by collecting 
aeration tank effluent at the effluent overflow weir. Transport the 
sample to the laboratory within no more than 4 hours of collection. 
Maintain the biomass concentration in the benchtop bioreactor at the 
level of the full-scale system +10 percent throughout the sampling 
period of the test method.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    8.1 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation. Charge the mixed liquor to the 
benchtop bioreactor, minimizing headspace over the liquid surface to 
minimize entrainment of mixed liquor in the circulating gas. Fasten the 
benchtop bioreactor headplate to the reactor over the liquid surface. 
Maintain the temperature of the contents of the benchtop bioreactor 
system at the temperature of the target full-scale system, <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]C, throughout the testing period. Monitor and 
record the temperature of the benchtop bioreactor contents at least to 
the nearest 0.1 [deg]C.
    8.1.1 Wastewater Storage. Collect the wastewater sample in the 20-L 
collapsible container. Store the container at 4 [deg]C throughout the 
testing period. Connect the container to the benchtop bioreactor feed 
pump.
    8.1.2 Wastewater Flow Rate.
    8.1.2.1 The hydraulic residence time of the aeration tank is 
calculated as the ratio of the volume of the tank (L) to the flow rate 
(L/min). At the beginning of a test, the container shall be connected to 
the feed pump and solution shall be pumped to the benchtop bioreactor at 
the required flow rate to achieve the calculated hydraulic residence 
time of wastewater in the aeration tank.

[[Page 638]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.547

Where:

Q<INF>test</INF> = wastewater flow rate (L/min)
Q<INF>fs</INF> = average flow rate of full-scale process (L/min)
V<INF>fs</INF> = volume of full-scale aeration tank (L)

    8.1.2.2 The target flow rate in the test apparatus is the same as 
the flow rate in the target full-scale process multiplied by the ratio 
of benchtop bioreactor volume (e.g., 6 L) to the volume of the full-
scale aeration tank. The hydraulic residence time shall be maintained at 
90 to 100 percent of the residence time maintained in the full-scale 
unit. A nominal flow rate is set on the pump based on a pump 
calibration. Changes in the elasticity of the tubing in the pump head 
and the accumulation of material in the tubing affect this calibration. 
The nominal pumping rate shall be changed as necessary based on 
volumetric flow measurements. Discharge the benchtop bioreactor effluent 
to a wastewater storage, treatment, or disposal facility, except during 
sampling or flow measurement periods.
    8.1.3 Sludge Recycle Rate. Set the sludge recycle rate at a rate 
sufficient to prevent accumulation in the bottom of the clarifier. Set 
the air circulation rate sufficient to maintain the biomass in 
suspension.
    8.1.4 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation and Maintenance. Temperature, 
dissolved oxygen concentration, exit vent flow rate, benchtop bioreactor 
effluent flow rate, and air circulation rate shall be measured and 
recorded three times throughout each day of benchtop bioreactor 
operation. If other parameters (such as pH) are measured and maintained 
in the target full-scale unit, these parameters, where appropriate, 
shall be monitored and maintained to target full-scale specifications in 
the benchtop bioreactor. At the beginning of each sampling period 
(Section 8.2), sample the benchtop bioreactor contents for suspended 
solids analysis. Take this sample by loosening a clamp on a length of 
tubing attached to the lower side port. Determine the suspended solids 
gravimetrically by the Gooch crucible/glass fiber filter method for 
total suspended solids, in accordance with Standard Methods\3\ or 
equivalent. When necessary, sludge shall be wasted from the lower side 
port of the benchtop bioreactor, and the volume that is wasted shall be 
replaced with an equal volume of the reactor effluent. Add thickened 
activated sludge mixed liquor as necessary to the benchtop bioreactor to 
increase the suspended solids concentration to the desired level. Pump 
this mixed liquor to the benchtop bioreactor through the upper side port 
(Item 24 in Figure 304A-1). Change the membrane on the dissolved oxygen 
probe before starting the test. Calibrate the oxygen probe immediately 
before the start of the test and each time the membrane is changed.
    8.1.5 Inspection and Correction Procedures. If the feed line tubing 
becomes clogged, replace with new tubing. If the feed flow rate is not 
within 5 percent of target flow any time the flow rate is measured, 
reset pump or check the flow measuring device and measure flow rate 
again until target flow rate is achieved.
    8.2 Test Sampling. At least two and one half hydraulic residence 
times after the system has reached the targeted specifications shall be 
permitted to elapse before the first sample is taken. Effluent samples 
of the clarifier discharge (Item 20 in Figure 304A-1) and the influent 
wastewater feed are collected in 40-mL septum vials to which two drops 
of 1:10 hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water have been added. Sample the 
clarifier discharge directly from the drain line. These samples will be 
composed of the entire flow from the system for a period of several 
minutes. Feed samples shall be taken from the feed pump suction line 
after temporarily stopping the benchtop bioreactor feed, removing a 
connector, and squeezing the collapsible feed container. Store both 
influent and effluent samples at 4 [deg]C immediately after collection 
and analyze within 8 hours of collection.
    8.2.1 Frequency of Sampling. During the test, sample and analyze the 
wastewater feed and the clarifier effluent at least six times. The 
sampling intervals shall be separated by at least 8 hours. During any 
individual sampling interval, sample the wastewater feed simultaneously 
with or immediately after the effluent sample. Calculate the relative 
standard deviation (RSD) of the amount removed (i.e., effluent 
concentration--wastewater feed concentration). The RSD values shall be < 
15 percent. If an RSD value is <ls-thn-eq> 15 percent, continue sampling 
and analyzing influent and effluent sets of samples until the RSD values 
are within specifications.
    8.2.2 Sampling After Exposure of System to Atmosphere. If, after 
starting sampling procedures, the benchtop bioreactor system is exposed 
to the atmosphere (due to leaks, maintenance, etc.), allow at least one 
hydraulic residence time to elapse before resuming sampling.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Dissolved Oxygen. Fluctuation in dissolved oxygen concentration 
may occur for

[[Page 639]]

numerous reasons, including undetected gas leaks, increases and 
decreases in mixed liquor suspended solids resulting from cell growth 
and solids loss in the effluent stream, changes in diffuser performance, 
cycling of effluent flow rate, and overcorrection due to faulty or 
sluggish dissolved oxygen probe response. Control the dissolved oxygen 
concentration in the benchtop bioreactor by changing the proportion of 
oxygen in the circulating aeration gas. Should the dissolved oxygen 
concentration drift below the designated experimental condition, bleed a 
small amount of aeration gas from the system on the pressure side (i.e., 
immediately upstream of one of the diffusers). This will create a vacuum 
in the system, triggering the pressure sensitive relay to open the 
solenoid valve and admit oxygen to the system. Should the dissolved 
oxygen concentration drift above the designated experimental condition, 
slow or stop the oxygen input to the system until the dissolved oxygen 
concentration approaches the correct level.
    9.2 Sludge Wasting.
    9.2.1 Determine the suspended solids concentration (section 8.1.4) 
at the beginning of a test, and once per day thereafter during the test. 
If the test is completed within a two day period, determine the 
suspended solids concentration after the final sample set is taken. If 
the suspended solids concentration exceeds the specified concentration, 
remove a fraction of the sludge from the benchtop bioreactor. The 
required volume of mixed liquor to remove is determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.548

Where:

V<INF>w</INF> is the wasted volume (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and
S<INF>s</INF> is the specified solids (g/L).

    9.2.2 Remove the mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor by 
loosening a clamp on the mixed liquor sampling tube and allowing the 
required volume to drain to a graduated flask. Clamp the tube when the 
correct volume has been wasted. Replace the volume of the liquid wasted 
by pouring the same volume of effluent back into the benchtop 
bioreactor. Dispose of the waste sludge properly.
    9.3 Sludge Makeup. In the event that the suspended solids 
concentration is lower than the specifications, add makeup sludge back 
into the benchtop bioreactor. Determine the amount of sludge added by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.549

Where:

V<INF>w</INF> is the volume of sludge to add (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>w</INF> is the solids in the makeup sludge (g/L),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and S<INF>s</INF> is the 
specified solids (g/L).

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Wastewater Pump Calibration. Determine the wastewater flow rate 
by collecting the system effluent for a time period of at least one 
hour, and measuring the volume with a graduated cylinder. Record the 
collection time period and volume collected. Determine flow rate. Adjust 
the pump speed to deliver the specified flow rate.
    10.2 Calibration Standards. Prepare calibration standards from pure 
certified standards in an aqueous medium. Prepare and analyze three 
concentrations of calibration standards for each target component (or 
for a mixture of components) in triplicate daily throughout the analyses 
of the test samples. At each concentration level, a single calibration 
shall be within 5 percent of the average of the three calibration 
results. The low and medium calibration standards shall bracket the 
expected concentration of the effluent (treated) wastewater. The medium 
and high standards shall bracket the expected influent concentration.

                       11.0 Analytical Procedures

    11.1 Analysis. If the identity of the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater is not known, a representative sample of the wastewater shall 
be analyzed in order to identify all of the compounds of interest 
present. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry screening method is 
recommended.
    11.1.1 After identifying the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater, develop and/or use one or more analytical techniques capable 
of measuring each of those compounds (more than one analytical technique 
may be required, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater). 
Test Method 18, found in appendix A of 40 CFR 60, may be used as a 
guideline in developing the analytical technique. Purge and trap 
techniques may be used for analysis providing the target components are 
sufficiently volatile to make this technique appropriate. The limit of 
quantitation for each compound shall be determined (see reference 1). If 
the effluent concentration of any target compound is below the limit of 
quantitation determined for that compound, the operation of the Method 
304 unit may be altered to attempt to increase the effluent 
concentration above the limit of quantitation. Modifications to the 
method shall be approved prior to the test. The request should be 
addressed to Method 304 contact, Emissions Measurement Center, Mail Drop 
19, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 
27711.

Method 304B: Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds 
                            (Scrubber Option)

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of biodegradation rates of organic compounds in an activated sludge 
process. The test method is designed to evaluate the ability of an 
aerobic biological reaction system to degrade or destroy specific 
components in waste streams. The method may also be used to determine 
the effects of changes in wastewater composition on operation. The 
biodegradation rates determined by utilizing this method are not 
representative of a full-scale system. Full-scale systems embody 
biodegradation and air

[[Page 643]]

emissions in competing reactions. This method measures biodegradation in 
absence of air emissions. The rates measured by this method shall be 
used in conjunction with the procedures listed in appendix C of this 
part to calculate the fraction emitted to the air versus the fraction 
biodegraded.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 A self-contained benchtop bioreactor system is assembled in the 
laboratory. A sample of mixed liquor is added and the waste stream is 
then fed continuously. The benchtop bioreactor is operated under 
conditions nearly identical to the target full-scale activated sludge 
process, except that air emissions are not a factor. The benchtop 
bioreactor temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, average 
residence time in the reactor, waste composition, biomass concentration, 
and biomass composition of the target full-scale process are the 
parameters which are duplicated in the laboratory system. Biomass shall 
be removed from the target full-scale activated sludge unit and held for 
no more than 4 hours prior to use in the benchtop bioreactor. If 
antifoaming agents are used in the full-scale system, they shall also be 
used in the benchtop bioreactor. The feed flowing into and the effluent 
exiting the benchtop bioreactor are analyzed to determine the 
biodegradation rates of the target compounds. The choice of analytical 
methodology for measuring the compounds of interest at the inlet and 
outlet to the benchtop bioreactor are left to the discretion of the 
source, except where validated methods are available.

                      4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 If explosive gases are produced as a byproduct of biodegradation 
and could realistically pose a hazard, closely monitor headspace 
concentration of these gases to ensure laboratory safety. Placement of 
the benchtop bioreactor system inside a laboratory hood is recommended 
regardless of byproducts produced.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Figure 304B-1 illustrates a typical laboratory apparatus used 
to measure biodegradation rates. While the following description refers 
to Figure 304B-1, the EPA recognizes that alternative reactor 
configurations, such as alternative reactor shapes and locations of 
probes and the feed inlet, will also meet the intent of this method. 
Ensure that the benchtop bioreactor system is self-contained and 
isolated from the atmosphere by leak-checking fittings, tubing, etc.
    6.1 Benchtop Bioreactor. The biological reaction is conducted in a 
biological oxidation reactor of at least 6-liters capacity. The benchtop 
bioreactor is sealed and equipped with internal probes for controlling 
and monitoring dissolved oxygen and internal temperature. The top of the 
benchtop bioreactor is equipped for aerators, gas flow ports, and 
instrumentation (while ensuring that no leaks to the atmosphere exist 
around the fittings).
    6.2 Aeration gas. Aeration gas is added to the benchtop bioreactor 
through three diffusers, which are glass tubes that extend to the bottom 
fifth of the reactor depth. A pure oxygen pressurized cylinder is 
recommended in order to maintain the specified oxygen concentration. 
Install a blower (e.g., Diaphragm Type, 15 SCFH capacity) to blow the 
aeration gas into the benchtop bioreactor diffusers. Measure the 
aeration gas flow rate with a rotameter (e.g., 0-15 SCFH recommended). 
The aeration gas will rise through the benchtop bioreactor, dissolving 
oxygen into the mixture in the process. The aeration gas must provide 
sufficient agitation to keep the solids in suspension. Provide an exit 
for the aeration gas from the top flange of the benchtop bioreactor 
through a water-cooled (e.g., Allihn-type) vertical condenser. Install 
the condenser through a gas-tight fitting in the benchtop bioreactor 
closure. Design the system so that at least 10 percent of the gas flows 
through an alkaline scrubber containing 175 mL of 45 percent by weight 
solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 5 drops of 0.2 percent 
alizarin yellow dye. Route the balance of the gas through an adjustable 
scrubber bypass. Route all of the gas through a 1-L knock-out flask to 
remove entrained moisture and then to the intake of the blower. The 
blower recirculates the gas to the benchtop bioreactor.
    6.3 Wastewater Feed. Supply the wastewater feed to the benchtop 
bioreactor in a collapsible low-density polyethylene container or 
collapsible liner in a container (e.g., 20 L) equipped with a spigot cap 
(collapsible containers or liners of other material may be required due 
to the permeability of some volatile compounds through polyethylene). 
Obtain the wastewater feed by sampling the wastewater feed in the target 
process. A representative sample of wastewater shall be obtained from 
the piping leading to the aeration tank. This sample may be obtained 
from existing sampling valves at the discharge of the wastewater feed 
pump, or collected from a pipe discharging to the aeration tank, or by 
pumping from a well-mixed equalization tank upstream from the aeration 
tank. Alternatively, wastewater can be pumped continuously to the 
laboratory apparatus from a bleed stream taken from the equalization 
tank of the full-scale treatment system.
    6.3.1 Refrigeration System. Keep the wastewater feed cool by ice or 
by refrigeration to 4 [deg]C. If using a bleed stream from the

[[Page 644]]

equalization tank, refrigeration is not required if the residence time 
in the bleed stream is less than five minutes.
    6.3.2 Wastewater Feed Pump. The wastewater is pumped from the 
refrigerated container using a variable-speed peristaltic pump drive 
equipped with a peristaltic pump head. Add the feed solution to the 
benchtop bioreactor through a fitting on the top flange. Determine the 
rate of feed addition to provide a retention time in the benchtop 
bioreactor that is numerically equivalent to the retention time in the 
target full-scale system. The wastewater shall be fed at a rate 
sufficient to achieve 90 to 100 percent of the target full-scale system 
residence time.
    6.3.3 Treated wastewater feed. The benchtop bioreactor effluent 
exits at the bottom of the reactor through a tube and proceeds to the 
clarifier.
    6.4 Clarifier. The effluent flows to a separate closed clarifier 
that allows separation of biomass and effluent (e.g., 2-liter pear-
shaped glass separatory funnel, modified by removing the stopcock and 
adding a 25-mm OD glass tube at the bottom). Benchtop bioreactor 
effluent enters the clarifier through a tube inserted to a depth of 0.08 
m (3 in.) through a stopper at the top of the clarifier. System effluent 
flows from a tube inserted through the stopper at the top of the 
clarifier to a drain (or sample bottle when sampling). The underflow 
from the clarifier leaves from the glass tube at the bottom of the 
clarifier. Flexible tubing connects this fitting to the sludge recycle 
pump. This pump is coupled to a variable speed pump drive. The discharge 
from this pump is returned through a tube inserted in a port on the side 
of the benchtop bioreactor. An additional port is provided near the 
bottom of the benchtop bioreactor for sampling the reactor contents. The 
mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor flows into the center of the 
clarifier. The clarified system effluent separates from the biomass and 
flows through an exit near the top of the clarifier. There shall be no 
headspace in the clarifier.
    6.5 Temperature Control Apparatus. Capable of maintaining the system 
at a temperature equal to the temperature of the full-scale system. The 
average temperature should be maintained within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C of the set point.
    6.5.1 Temperature Monitoring Device. A resistance type temperature 
probe or a thermocouple connected to a temperature readout with a 
resolution of 0.1 [deg]C or better.
    6.5.2 Benchtop Bioreactor Heater. The heater is connected to the 
temperature control device.
    6.6 Oxygen Control System. Maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration at the levels present in the full-scale system. Target 
full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentration 
below 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration 
in the benchtop bioreactor within 0.5 mg/L of the target dissolved 
oxygen level. Target full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved 
oxygen concentration above 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved 
oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor within 1.5 mg/L of the 
target dissolved oxygen concentration; however, for target full-scale 
activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentrations above 2 
mg/L, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor may 
not drop below 1.5 mg/L. If the benchtop bioreactor is outside the 
control range, the dissolved oxygen is noted and the reactor operation 
is adjusted.
    6.6.1 Dissolved Oxygen Monitor. Dissolved oxygen is monitored with a 
polarographic probe (gas permeable membrane) connected to a dissolved 
oxygen meter (e.g., 0 to 15 mg/L, 0 to 50 [deg]C).
    6.6.2 Benchtop Bioreactor Pressure Monitor. The benchtop bioreactor 
pressure is monitored through a port in the top flange of the reactor. 
This is connected to a gauge control with a span of 13-cm water vacuum 
to 13-cm water pressure or better. A relay is activated when the vacuum 
exceeds an adjustable setpoint which opens a solenoid valve (normally 
closed), admitting oxygen to the system. The vacuum setpoint controlling 
oxygen addition to the system shall be set at approximately 2.5 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 cm water and maintained at this setting except 
during brief periods when the dissolved oxygen concentration is 
adjusted.
    6.7 Connecting Tubing. All connecting tubing shall be Teflon or 
equivalent in impermeability. The only exception to this specification 
is the tubing directly inside the pump head of the wastewater feed pump, 
which may be Viton, Silicone or another type of flexible tubing.

    Note: Mention of trade names or products does not constitute 
endorsement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

                       7.0. Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Wastewater. Obtain a representative sample of wastewater at the 
inlet to the full-scale treatment plant if there is an existing full-
scale treatment plant (See Section 6.3). If there is no existing full-
scale treatment plant, obtain the wastewater sample as close to the 
point of determination as possible. Collect the sample by pumping the 
wastewater into the 20-L collapsible container. The loss of volatiles 
shall be minimized from the wastewater by collapsing the container 
before filling, by minimizing the time of filling, and by avoiding a 
headspace in the container after filling. If the wastewater requires the 
addition of nutrients to support the biomass growth and maintain biomass 
characteristics, those nutrients are added

[[Page 645]]

and mixed with the container contents after the container is filled.
    7.2 Biomass. Obtain the biomass or activated sludge used for rate 
constant determination in the bench-scale process from the existing 
full-scale process or from a representative biomass culture (e.g., 
biomass that has been developed for a future full-scale process). This 
biomass is preferentially obtained from a thickened acclimated mixed 
liquor sample. Collect the sample either by bailing from the mixed 
liquor in the aeration tank with a weighted container, or by collecting 
aeration tank effluent at the effluent overflow weir. Transport the 
sample to the laboratory within no more than 4 hours of collection. 
Maintain the biomass concentration in the benchtop bioreactor at the 
level of the target full-scale system +10 percent throughout the 
sampling period of the test method.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    8.1 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation. Charge the mixed liquor to the 
benchtop bioreactor, minimizing headspace over the liquid surface to 
minimize entrainment of mixed liquor in the circulating gas. Fasten the 
benchtop bioreactor headplate to the reactor over the liquid surface. 
Maintain the temperature of the contents of the benchtop bioreactor 
system at the temperature of the target full-scale system, <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]C, throughout the testing period. Monitor and 
record the temperature of the reactor contents at least to the nearest 
0.1 [deg]C.
    8.1.1 Wastewater Storage. Collect the wastewater sample in the 20-L 
collapsible container. Store the container at 4 [deg]C throughout the 
testing period. Connect the container to the benchtop bioreactor feed 
pump.
    8.1.2 Wastewater Flow Rate.
    8.1.2.1 The hydraulic residence time of the aeration tank is 
calculated as the ratio of the volume of the tank (L) to the flow rate 
(L/min). At the beginning of a test, the container shall be connected to 
the feed pump and solution shall be pumped to the benchtop bioreactor at 
the required flow rate to achieve the calculated hydraulic residence 
time of wastewater in the aeration tank.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.555

Where:

Q<INF>test</INF> = wastewater flow rate (L/min)
Q<INF>fs</INF> = average flow rate of full-scale process (L/min)
V<INF>fs</INF> = volume of full-scale aeration tank (L)

    8.1.2.2 The target flow rate in the test apparatus is the same as 
the flow rate in the target full-scale process multiplied by the ratio 
of benchtop bioreactor volume (e.g., 6 L) to the volume of the full-
scale aeration tank. The hydraulic residence time shall be maintained at 
90 to 100 percent of the residence time maintained in the target full-
scale unit. A nominal flow rate is set on the pump based on a pump 
calibration. Changes in the elasticity of the tubing in the pump head 
and the accumulation of material in the tubing affect this calibration. 
The nominal pumping rate shall be changed as necessary based on 
volumetric flow measurements. Discharge the benchtop bioreactor effluent 
to a wastewater storage, treatment, or disposal facility, except during 
sampling or flow measurement periods.
    8.1.3 Sludge Recycle Rate. Set the sludge recycle rate at a rate 
sufficient to prevent accumulation in the bottom of the clarifier. Set 
the air circulation rate sufficient to maintain the biomass in 
suspension.
    8.1.4 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation and Maintenance. Temperature, 
dissolved oxygen concentration, flow rate, and air circulation rate 
shall be measured and recorded three times throughout each day of 
testing. If other parameters (such as pH) are measured and maintained in 
the target full-scale unit, these parameters shall, where appropriate, 
be monitored and maintained to full-scale specifications in the benchtop 
bioreactor. At the beginning of each sampling period (section 8.2), 
sample the benchtop bioreactor contents for suspended solids analysis. 
Take this sample by loosening a clamp on a length of tubing attached to 
the lower side port. Determine the suspended solids gravimetrically by 
the Gooch crucible/glass fiber filter method for total suspended solids, 
in accordance with Standard Methods \3\ or equivalent. When necessary, 
sludge shall be wasted from the lower side port of the benchtop 
bioreactor, and the volume that is wasted shall be replaced with an 
equal volume of the benchtop bioreactor effluent. Add thickened 
activated sludge mixed liquor as necessary to the benchtop bioreactor to 
increase the suspended solids concentration to the desired level. Pump 
this mixed liquor to the benchtop bioreactor through the upper side port 
(Item 24 in Figure 304B-1). Change the

[[Page 646]]

membrane on the dissolved oxygen probe before starting the test. 
Calibrate the oxygen probe immediately before the start of the test and 
each time the membrane is changed. The scrubber solution shall be 
replaced each weekday with 175 mL 45 percent W/W KOH solution to which 
five drops of 0.2 percent alizarin yellow indicator in water have been 
added. The potassium hydroxide solution in the alkaline scrubber shall 
be changed if the alizarin yellow dye color changes.
    8.1.5 Inspection and Correction Procedures. If the feed line tubing 
becomes clogged, replace with new tubing. If the feed flow rate is not 
within 5 percent of target flow any time the flow rate is measured, 
reset pump or check the flow measuring device and measure flow rate 
again until target flow rate is achieved.
    8.2 Test Sampling. At least two and one half hydraulic residence 
times after the system has reached the targeted specifications shall be 
permitted to elapse before the first sample is taken. Effluent samples 
of the clarifier discharge (Item 20 in Figure 304B-1) and the influent 
wastewater feed are collected in 40-mL septum vials to which two drops 
of 1:10 hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water have been added. Sample the 
clarifier discharge directly from the drain line. These samples will be 
composed of the entire flow from the system for a period of several 
minutes. Feed samples shall be taken from the feed pump suction line 
after temporarily stopping the benchtop bioreactor feed, removing a 
connector, and squeezing the collapsible feed container. Store both 
influent and effluent samples at 4 [deg]C immediately after collection 
and analyze within 8 hours of collection.
    8.2.1 Frequency of Sampling. During the test, sample and analyze the 
wastewater feed and the clarifier effluent at least six times. The 
sampling intervals shall be separated by at least 8 hours. During any 
individual sampling interval, sample the wastewater feed simultaneously 
with or immediately after the effluent sample. Calculate the RSD of the 
amount removed (i.e., effluent concentration--wastewater feed 
concentration). The RSD values shall be <15 percent. If an RSD value is 
<ls-thn-eq>15 percent, continue sampling and analyzing influent and 
effluent sets of samples until the RSD values are within specifications.
    8.2.2 Sampling After Exposure of System to Atmosphere. If, after 
starting sampling procedures, the benchtop bioreactor system is exposed 
to the atmosphere (due to leaks, maintenance, etc.), allow at least one 
hydraulic residence time to elapse before resuming sampling.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Dissolved Oxygen. Fluctuation in dissolved oxygen concentration 
may occur for numerous reasons, including undetected gas leaks, 
increases and decreases in mixed liquor suspended solids resulting from 
cell growth and solids loss in the effluent stream, changes in diffuser 
performance, cycling of effluent flow rate, and overcorrection due to 
faulty or sluggish dissolved oxygen probe response. Control the 
dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor by changing 
the proportion of oxygen in the circulating aeration gas. Should the 
dissolved oxygen concentration drift below the designated experimental 
condition, bleed a small amount of aeration gas from the system on the 
pressure side (i.e., immediately upstream of one of the diffusers). This 
will create a vacuum in the system, triggering the pressure sensitive 
relay to open the solenoid valve and admit oxygen to the system. Should 
the dissolved oxygen concentration drift above the designated 
experimental condition, slow or stop the oxygen input to the system 
until the dissolved oxygen concentration approaches the correct level.
    9.2 Sludge Wasting.
    9.2.1 Determine the suspended solids concentration (section 8.1.4) 
at the beginning of a test, and once per day thereafter during the test. 
If the test is completed within a two day period, determine the 
suspended solids concentration after the final sample set is taken. If 
the suspended solids concentration exceeds the specified concentration, 
remove a fraction of the sludge from the benchtop bioreactor. The 
required volume of mixed liquor to remove is determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.556

Where:

V<INF>w</INF> is the wasted volume (Liters),

flask. Clamp the tube when the correct volume has been wasted. Replace 
the volume of the liquid wasted by pouring the same volume of effluent 
back into the benchtop bioreactor. Dispose of the waste sludge properly.
    9.3 Sludge Makeup. In the event that the suspended solids 
concentration is lower than the specifications, add makeup sludge back 
into the benchtop bioreactor. Determine the amount of sludge added by 
the following equation:

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardizations

    10.1 Wastewater Pump Calibration. Determine the wastewater flow rate 
by collecting the system effluent for a time period of at least one 
hour, and measuring the volume with a graduated cylinder. Record the 
collection time period and volume collected. Determine flow rate. Adjust 
the pump speed to deliver the specified flow rate.
    10.2 Calibration Standards. Prepare calibration standards from pure 
certified standards in an aqueous medium. Prepare and analyze three 
concentrations of calibration standards for each target component (or 
for a mixture of components) in triplicate daily throughout the analyses 
of the test samples. At each concentration level, a single calibration 
shall be within 5 percent of the average of the three calibration 
results. The low and medium calibration standards shall bracket the 
expected concentration of the effluent (treated) wastewater. The medium 
and high standards shall bracket the expected influent concentration.

                     11.0 Analytical Test Procedures

    11.1 Analysis. If the identity of the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater is not known, a representative sample of the wastewater shall 
be analyzed in order to identify all of the compounds of interest 
present. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry screening method is 
recommended.
    11.1.1 After identifying the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater, develop and/or use one or more analytical technique capable 
of measuring each of those compounds (more than one analytical technique 
may be required, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater). 
Method 18, found in appendix A of 40 CFR 60, may be used as a guideline 
in developing the analytical technique. Purge and trap techniques may be 
used for analysis providing the target components are sufficiently 
volatile to make this technique appropriate. The limit of quantitation 
for each compound shall be determined.\1\ If the effluent concentration 
of any target compound is below the limit of quantitation determined for 
that compound, the operation of the Method 304 unit may be altered to 
attempt to increase the effluent concentration above the limit of 
quantitation. Modifications to the method shall be approved prior to the 
test. The request should be addressed to Method 304 contact, Emissions 
Measurement Center, Mail Drop 19, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 The heated purge conditions established by Method 25D (40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A) are used to remove VOs from a 10 gram sample of 
waste suspended in a 50/50 solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and 
water. The purged VOs are quantified by using the sample collection and 
analytical techniques (e.g. gas chromatography) appropriate for the VOs 
present in the waste. The recovery efficiency of the sample collection 
and analytical technique is determined for each waste matrix. A 
correction factor is determined for each compound (if acceptable 
recovery criteria requirements are met of 70 to 130 percent recovery for 
every target compound), and the measured waste concentration is 
corrected with the correction factor for each compound. A minimum of 
three replicate waste samples shall be analyzed.

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    6.1 Method 25D Purge Apparatus.
    6.1.1 Purge Chamber. The purge chamber shall accommodate the 10 gram 
sample of waste suspended in a matrix of 50 mL of PEG and 50 mL of 
deionized, hydrocarbon-free water. Three fittings are used on the glass 
chamber top. Two <greek-i>7 Ace-threads are used for the purge gas inlet 
and outlet connections. A <greek-i>50 Ace-thread is used to connect the 
top of the chamber to the base (see Figure 305-1). The base of the 
chamber has a side-arm equipped with a <greek-i>22 Sovirel fitting to 
allow for easy sample introductions into the chamber. The dimensions of 
the chamber are shown in Figure 305-1.
    6.1.2 Flow Distribution Device (FDD). The FDD enhances the gas-to-
liquid contact for improved purging efficiency. The FDD is a 6 mm OD 
(0.2 in) by 30 cm (12 in) long glass tube equipped with four arm 
bubblers as shown in Figure 305-1. Each arm shall have an opening of 1 
mm (0.04 in) in diameter.
    6.1.3 Coalescing Filter. The coalescing filter serves to discourage 
aerosol formation of sample gas once it leaves the purge chamber. The 
glass filter has a fritted disc mounted 10 cm (3.9 in) from the bottom. 
Two <greek-i>7 Ace-threads are used for the inlet and outlet 
connections. The dimensions of the chamber are shown in Figure 305-2.
    6.1.4 Oven. A forced convection airflow oven capable of maintaining 
the purge chamber and coalescing filter at 75 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C (167 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.6 [deg]F).
    6.1.5 Toggle Valve. An on/off valve constructed from brass or 
stainless steel rated to 100 psig. This valve is placed in line between 
the purge nitrogen source and the flow controller.
    6.1.6 Flow Controller. High-quality stainless steel flow controller 
capable of restricting a flow of nitrogen to 6 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.06 L/min (0.2 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.002 ft\3\/min) 
at 40 psig.
    6.1.7 Polyethylene Glycol Cleaning System.
    6.1.7.1 Round-Bottom Flask. One liter, three-neck glass round-bottom 
flask for cleaning PEG. Standard taper 24/40 joints are mounted on each 
neck.
    6.1.7.2 Heating Mantle. Capable of heating contents of the 1-L flask 
to 120 [deg]C (248 [deg]F).
    6.1.7.3 Nitrogen Bubbler. Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> or glass tube, 
0.25 in OD (6.35 mm).
    6.1.7.4 Temperature Sensor. Partial immersion glass thermometer.
    6.1.7.5 Hose Adapter. Glass with 24/40 standard tapered joint.
    6.2 Volatile Organic Recovery System.
    6.2.1 Splitter Valve (Optional). Stainless steel cross-pattern valve 
capable of splitting nominal flow rates from the purge flow of 6 L/min 
(0.2 ft\3\/min). The valve shall be maintained at 75 + 2 [deg]C (167 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.6 [deg]F) in the heated zone and shall be placed 
downstream of the coalescing filter. It is recommended that 0.125 in OD 
(3.175 mm) tubing be used to direct the split vent flow from the heated 
zone. The back pressure caused by the 0.125 in OD (3.175 mm) tubing is 
critical for maintaining proper split valve operation.

    Note: The splitter valve design is optional; it may be used in cases 
where the concentration of a pollutant would saturate the adsorbents.

    6.2.2 Injection Port. Stainless steel 1/4 in OD (6.35 mm) 
compression fitting tee with a 6 mm (0.2 in) septum fixed on the top 
port. The injection port is the point of entry for the recovery study 
solution. If using a gaseous standard to determine recovery efficiency, 
connect the gaseous standard to the injection port of the tee.
    6.2.3 Knockout Trap (Optional but Recommended). A 25 mL capacity 
glass reservoir body with a full-stem impinger (to avoid leaks, a 
modified midget glass impinger with a screw cap and ball/socket clamps 
on the inlet and outlet is recommended). The empty

[[Page 651]]

impinger is placed in an ice water bath between the injection port and 
the sorbent cartridge. Its purpose is to reduce the water content of the 
purge gas (saturated at 75 [deg]C (167 [deg]F)) before the sorbent 
cartridge.
    6.2.4 Insulated Ice Bath. A 350 mL dewar or other type of insulated 
bath is used to maintain ice water around the knockout trap.
    6.2.5 Sorbent Cartridges. Commercially available glass or stainless 
steel cartridge packed with one or more appropriate sorbents. The amount 
of adsorbent packed in the cartridge depends on the breakthrough volume 
of the test compounds but is limited by back pressure caused by the 
packing (not to exceed 7 psig). More than one sorbent cartridge placed 
in series may be necessary depending upon the mixture of the measured 
components.
    6.2.6 Volumetric Glassware. Type A glass 10 mL volumetric flasks for 
measuring a final volume from the water catch in the knockout trap.
    6.2.7 Thermal Desorption Unit. A clam-shell type oven, used for the 
desorption of direct thermal desorption sorbent tubes. The oven shall be 
capable of increasing the temperature of the desorption tubes rapidly to 
recommended desorption temperature.
    6.2.8 Ultrasonic Bath. Small bath used to agitate sorbent material 
and desorption solvent. Ice water shall be used in the bath because of 
heat transfer caused by operation of the bath.
    6.2.9 Desorption Vials. Four-dram (15 mL) capacity borosilicate 
glass vials with Teflon-lined caps.
    6.3 Analytical System. A gas chromatograph (GC) is commonly used to 
separate and quantify compounds from the sample collection and recovery 
procedure. Method 18 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) may be used as a 
guideline for determining the appropriate GC column and GC detector 
based on the test compounds to be determined. Other types of analytical 
instrumentation may be used (HPLC) in lieu of GC systems as long as the 
recovery efficiency criteria of this method are met.
    6.3.1 Gas Chromatograph (GC). The GC shall be equipped with a 
constant-temperature liquid injection port or a heated sampling loop/
valve system, as appropriate. The GC oven shall be temperature-
programmable over the useful range of the GC column. The choice of 
detectors is based on the test compounds to be determined.
    6.3.2 GC Column. Select the appropriate GC column based on (1) 
literature review or previous experience, (2) polarity of the analytes, 
(3) capacity of the column, or (4) resolving power (e.g., length, 
diameter, film thickness) required.
    6.3.3 Data System. A programmable electronic integrator for 
recording, analyzing, and storing the signal generated by the detector.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Method 25D Purge Apparatus.
    7.1.1 Polyethylene Glycol (PEG). Ninety-eight percent pure organic 
polymer with an average molecular weight of 400 g/mol. Volatile organics 
are removed from the PEG prior to use by heating to 120 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C (248 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>9 [deg]F) and 
purging with pure nitrogen at 1 L/min (0.04 ft\3\/min) for 2 hours. 
After purging and heating, the PEG is maintained at room temperature 
under a nitrogen purge maintained at 1 L/min (0.04 ft\3\/min) until 
used. A typical apparatus used to clean the PEG is shown in Figure 305-
3.
    7.1.2 Water. Organic-free deionized water is required.
    7.1.3 Nitrogen. High-purity nitrogen (less than 0.5 ppm total 
hydrocarbons) is used to remove test compounds from the purge matrix. 
The source of nitrogen shall be regulated continuously to 40 psig before 
the on/off toggle valve.
    7.2 Volatile Organic Recovery System.
    7.2.1 Water. Organic-free deionized water is required.
    7.2.2 Desorption Solvent (when used). Appropriate high-purity (99.99 
percent) solvent for desorption shall be used. Analysis shall be 
performed (utilizing the same analytical technique as that used in the 
analysis of the waste samples) on each lot to determine purity.
    7.3 Analytical System. The gases required for GC operation shall be 
of the highest obtainable purity (hydrocarbon free). Consult the 
operating manual for recommended settings.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    8.1 Assemble the glassware and associated fittings (see Figures 305-
3 and 305-4, as appropriate) and leak-check the system (approximately 7 
psig is the target pressure). After an initial leak check, mark the 
pressure gauge and use the initial checkpoint to monitor for leaks 
throughout subsequent analyses. If the pressure in the system drops 
below the target pressure at any time during analysis, that analysis 
shall be considered invalid.
    8.2 Recovery Efficiency Determination. Determine the individual 
recovery efficiency (RE) for each of the target compounds in duplicate 
before the waste samples are analyzed. To determine the RE, generate a 
water blank (Section 11.1) and use the injection port to introduce a 
known volume of spike solution (or certified gaseous standard) 
containing all of the target compounds at the levels expected in the 
waste sample. Introduce the spike solution immediately after the 
nitrogen purge has been started (Section

[[Page 652]]

8.3.2). Follow the procedures outlined in Section 8.3.3. Analyze the 
recovery efficiency samples using the techniques described in Section 
11.2. Determine the recovery efficiency (Equation 305-1, Section 12.2) 
by comparing the amount of compound recovered to the theoretical amount 
spiked. Determine the RE twice for each compound; the relative standard 
deviation, (RSD) shall be <=10 percent for each compound. If the RSD for 
any compound is not <= 10 percent, modify the sampling/analytical 
procedure and complete an RE study in duplicate, or continue determining 
RE until the RSD meets the acceptable criteria. The average RE shall be 
0.70 <= RE <= 1.30 for each compound. If the average RE does not meet 
these criteria, an alternative sample collection and/or analysis 
technique shall be developed and the recovery efficiency determination 
shall be repeated for that compound until the criteria are met for every 
target compound. Example modifications of the sampling/analytical system 
include changing the adsorbent material, changing the desorption 
solvent, utilizing direct thermal desorption of test compounds from the 
sorbent tubes, utilizing another analytical technique.
    8.3 Sample Collection and Recovery.
    8.3.1 The sample collection procedure in Method 25D shall be used to 
collect (into a preweighed vial) 10 g of waste into PEG, cool, and ship 
to the laboratory. Remove the sample container from the cooler and wipe 
the exterior to remove any ice or water. Weigh the container and sample 
to the nearest 0.01 g and record the weight. Pour the sample from the 
container into the purge flask. Rinse the sample container three times 
with approximately 6 mL of PEG (or the volume needed to total 50 mL of 
PEG in the purge flask), transferring the rinses to the purge flask. Add 
50 mL of organic-free deionized water to the purge flask. Cap the purge 
flask tightly in between each rinse and after adding all the components 
into the flask.
    8.3.2 Allow the oven to equilibrate to 75 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C (167 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.6 [deg]F). Begin the sample recovery 
process by turning the toggle valve on, thus allowing a 6 L/min flow of 
pure nitrogen through the purge chamber.
    8.3.3 Stop the purge after 30 min. Immediately remove the sorbent 
tube(s) from the apparatus and cap both ends. Remove the knockout trap 
and transfer the water catch to a 10 mL volumetric flask. Rinse the trap 
with organic-free deionized water and transfer the rinse to the 
volumetric flask. Dilute to the 10 mL mark with water. Transfer the 
water sample to a sample vial and store at 4 [deg]C (39.2 [deg]F) with 
zero headspace. The analysis of the contents of the water knockout trap 
is optional for this method. If the target compounds are water soluble, 
analysis of the water is recommended; meeting the recovery efficiency 
criteria in these cases would be difficult without adding the amount 
captured in the knockout trap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 The analytical instrument shall be calibrated with a minimum of 
three levels of standards for each compound whose concentrations bracket 
the concentration of test compounds from the sorbent tubes. Liquid 
calibration standards shall be used for calibration in the analysis of 
the solvent extracts. The liquid calibration standards shall be prepared 
in the desorption solvent matrix. The calibration standards may be 
prepared and injected individually or as a mixture. If thermal 
desorption and focusing (onto another sorbent or cryogen focusing) are 
used, a certified gaseous mixture or a series of gaseous standards shall 
be used for calibration of the instrument. The gaseous standards shall 
be focused and analyzed in the same manner as the samples.
    10.2 The analytical system shall be certified free from contaminants 
before a calibration is performed (see Section 11.1). The calibration 
standards are used to determine the linearity of the analytical system. 
Perform an initial calibration and linearity check by analyzing the 
three calibration standards for each target compound in triplicate 
starting with the lowest level and continuing to the highest level. If 
the triplicate analyses do not agree within 5 percent of their average, 
additional analyses will be needed until the 5 percent criteria is met. 
Calculate the response factor (Equation 305-3, Section 12.4) from the 
average area counts of the injections for each concentration level. 
Average the response factors of the standards for each compound. The 
linearity of the detector is acceptable if the response

[[Page 653]]

factor of each compound at a particular concentration is within 10 
percent of the overall mean response factor for that compound. Analyze 
daily a mid-level calibration standard in duplicate and calculate a new 
response factor. Compare the daily response factor average to the 
average response factor calculated for the mid-level calibration during 
the initial linearity check; repeat the three-level calibration 
procedure if the daily average response factor differs from the initial 
linearity check mid-level response factor by more than 10 percent. 
Otherwise, proceed with the sample analysis.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Water Blank Analysis. A water blank shall be analyzed daily to 
determine the cleanliness of the purge and recovery system. A water 
blank is generated by adding 60 mL of organic-free deionized water to 50 
mL of PEG in the purge chamber. Treat the blank as described in Sections 
8.3.2 and 8.3.3. The purpose of the water blank is to insure that no 
contaminants exist in the sampling and analytical apparatus which would 
interfere with the quantitation of the target compounds. If contaminants 
are present, locate the source of contamination, remove it, and repeat 
the water blank analysis.
    11.2 Sample Analysis. Sample analysis in the context of this method 
refers to techniques to remove the target compounds from the sorbent 
tubes, separate them using a chromatography technique, and quantify them 
with an appropriate detector. Two types of sample extraction techniques 
typically used for sorbents include solvent desorption or direct thermal 
desorption of test compounds to a secondary focusing unit (either 
sorbent or cryogen based). The test compounds are then typically 
transferred to a GC system for analysis. Other analytical systems may be 
used (e.g., HPLC) in lieu of GC systems as long as the recovery 
efficiency criteria of this method are met.
    11.2.1 Recover the test compounds from the sorbent tubes that 
require solvent desorption by transferring the adsorbent material to a 
sample vial containing the desorption solvent. The desorption solvent 
shall be the same as the solvent used to prepare calibration standards. 
The volume of solvent depends on the amount of adsorbed material to be 
desorbed (1.0 mL per 100 mg of adsorbent material) and also on the 
amount of test compounds present. Final volume adjustment and or 
dilution can be made so that the concentration of test compounds in the 
desorption solvent is bracketed by the concentration of the calibration 
solutions. Ultrasonicate the desorption solvent for 15 min in an ice 
bath. Allow the sample to sit for a period of time so that the adsorbent 
material can settle to the bottom of the vial. Transfer the solvent with 
a pasteur pipet (minimizing the amount of adsorbent material taken) to 
another vial and store at 4 [deg]C (39.2 [deg]F).
    11.2.2 Analyze the desorption solvent or direct thermal desorption 
tubes from each sample using the same analytical parameters used for the 
calibration standard. Calculate the total weight detected for each 
compound (Equation 305-4, Section 12.5). The slope (area/amount) and y-
intercept are calculated from the line bracketed between the two closest 
calibration points. Correct the concentration of each waste sample with 
the appropriate recovery efficiency factor and the split flow ratio (if 
used). The final concentration of each individual test compound is 
calculated by dividing the corrected measured weight for that compound 
by the weight of the original sample determined in Section 8.3.1 
(Equation 305-5, Section 12.6).
    11.2.3 Repeat the analysis for the three samples collected in 
Section 8.3. Report the corrected concentration of each of the waste 
samples, average waste concentration, and relative standard deviation 
(Equation 305-6, Section 12.7).

Method 306--Determination of Chromium Emissions From Decorative and Hard 
 Chromium Electroplating and Chromium Anodizing Operations--Isokinetic 
                                 Method

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A. Therefore, to obtain 
reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough 
knowledge of at least Method 5.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analytes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Analyte                  CAS No.            Sensitivity
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chromium......................  7440-47-3........  See Sec. 13.2.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.2 Applicability. This method applies to the determination of 
chromium (Cr) in emissions from decorative and hard chrome 
electroplating facilities, chromium anodizing operations, and continuous 
chromium plating operations at iron and steel facilities.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives. [Reserved]

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Sampling. An emission sample is extracted isokinetically from 
the source using an unheated Method 5 sampling train (40 CFR Part 60, 
Appendix A), with a glass nozzle and probe liner, but with the filter 
omitted. The sample time shall be at least two hours. The Cr emissions 
are collected in an alkaline solution containing 0.1 N sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH) or 0.1 N sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<INF>3</INF>). The collected 
samples are recovered using an alkaline solution and are then 
transported to the laboratory for analysis.
    2.2 Analysis.
    2.2.1 Total chromium samples with high chromium concentrations 
(<ls-thn-eq>=35 [micro]g/L) may be analyzed using inductively coupled 
plasma emission spectrometry (ICP) at 267.72 nm.

    Note: The ICP analysis is applicable for this method only when the 
solution analyzed has a Cr concentration greater than or equal to 35 
[micro]g/L or five times the method detection limit as determined 
according to Appendix B in 40 CFR Part 136.


[[Page 659]]


    2.2.2 Alternatively, when lower total chromium concentrations (<35 
[micro]g/L) are encountered, a portion of the alkaline sample solution 
may be digested with nitric acid and analyzed by graphite furnace atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) at 357.9 nm.
    2.2.3 If it is desirable to determine hexavalent chromium 
(Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>) emissions, the samples may be analyzed using an ion 
chromatograph equipped with a post-column reactor (IC/PCR) and a visible 
wavelength detector. To increase sensitivity for trace levels of 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>, a preconcentration system may be used in conjunction 
with the IC/PCR.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Total Chromium--measured chromium content that includes both 
major chromium oxidation states (Cr<SUP>+3</SUP>, Cr<SUP>+3</SUP>).
    3.2 May--Implies an optional operation.
    3.3 Digestion--The analytical operation involving the complete (or 
nearly complete) dissolution of the sample in order to ensure the 
complete solubilization of the element (analyte) to be measured.
    3.4 Interferences--Physical, chemical, or spectral phenomena that 
may produce a high or low bias in the analytical result.
    3.5 Analytical System--All components of the analytical process 
including the sample digestion and measurement apparatus.
    3.6 Sample Recovery--The quantitative transfer of sample from the 
collection apparatus to the sample preparation (digestion, etc.) 
apparatus. This term should not be confused with analytical recovery.
    3.7 Matrix Modifier--A chemical modification to the sample during 
GFAAS determinations to ensure that the analyte is not lost during the 
measurement process (prior to the atomization stage)
    3.8 Calibration Reference Standards--Quality control standards used 
to check the accuracy of the instrument calibration curve prior to 
sample analysis.
    3.9 Continuing Check Standard--Quality control standards used to 
verify that unacceptable drift in the measurement system has not 
occurred.
    3.10 Calibration Blank--A blank used to verify that there has been 
no unacceptable shift in the baseline either immediately following 
calibration or during the course of the analytical measurement.
    3.11 Interference Check--An analytical/measurement operation that 
ascertains whether a measurable interference in the sample exists.
    3.12 Interelement Correction Factors--Factors used to correct for 
interfering elements that produce a false signal (high bias).
    3.13 Duplicate Sample Analysis--Either the repeat measurement of a 
single solution or the measurement of duplicate preparations of the same 
sample. It is important to be aware of which approach is required for a 
particular type of measurement. For example, no digestion is required 
for the ICP determination and the duplicate instrument measurement is 
therefore adequate whereas duplicate digestion/instrument measurements 
are required for GFAAS.
    3.14 Matrix Spiking--Analytical spikes that have been added to the 
actual sample matrix either before (Section 9.2.5.2) or after (Section 
9.1.6). Spikes added to the sample prior to a preparation technique 
(e.g., digestion) allow for the assessment of an overall method accuracy 
while those added after only provide for the measurement accuracy 
determination.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 ICP Interferences.
    4.1.1 ICP Spectral Interferences. Spectral interferences are caused 
by: overlap of a spectral line from another element; unresolved overlap 
of molecular band spectra; background contribution from continuous or 
recombination phenomena; and, stray light from the line emission of 
high-concentrated elements. Spectral overlap may be compensated for by 
correcting the raw data with a computer and measuring the interfering 
element. At the 267.72 nm Cr analytical wavelength, iron, manganese, and 
uranium are potential interfering elements. Background and stray light 
interferences can usually be compensated for by a background correction 
adjacent to the analytical line. Unresolved overlap requires the 
selection of an alternative chromium wavelength. Consult the instrument 
manufacturer's operation manual for interference correction procedures.
    4.1.2 ICP Physical Interferences. High levels of dissolved solids in 
the samples may cause significant inaccuracies due to salt buildup at 
the nebulizer and torch tips. This problem can be controlled by diluting 
the sample or by extending the rinse times between sample analyses. 
Standards shall be prepared in the same solution matrix as the samples 
(i.e., 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>).
    4.1.3 ICP Chemical Interferences. These include molecular compound 
formation, ionization effects and solute vaporization effects, and are 
usually not significant in the ICP procedure, especially if the 
standards and samples are matrix matched.
    4.2 GFAAS Interferences.
    4.2.1 GFAAS Chemical Interferences. Low concentrations of calcium 
and/or phosphate may cause interferences; at concentrations above 200 
[micro]g/L, calcium's effect is constant and eliminates the effect of 
phosphate. Calcium nitrate is therefore added to the concentrated 
analyte to ensure a known constant effect. Other matrix modifiers 
recommended by the instrument manufacturer may also be considered.
    4.2.2 GFAAS Cyanide Band Interferences. Nitrogen should not be used 
as the purge gas due to cyanide band interference.

[[Page 660]]

    4.2.3 GFAAS Spectral Interferences. Background correction may be 
required because of possible significant levels of nonspecific 
absorption and scattering at the 357.9 nm analytical wavelength.
    4.2.4 GFAAS Background Interferences. Zeeman or Smith-Hieftje 
background correction is recommended for interferences resulting from 
high levels of dissolved solids in the alkaline impinger solutions.
    4.3 IC/PCR Interferences.
    4.3.1 IC/PCR Chemical Interferences. Components in the sample matrix 
may cause Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> to convert to trivalent chromium 
(Cr<SUP>+3</SUP>) or cause Cr<SUP>+3</SUP> to convert to 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>. The chromatographic separation of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> using 
ion chromatography reduces the potential for other metals to interfere 
with the post column reaction. For the IC/PCR analysis, only compounds 
that coelute with Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and affect the diphenylcarbazide 
reaction will cause interference.
    4.3.2 IC/PCR Background Interferences. Periodic analyses of reagent 
water blanks are used to demonstrate that the analytical system is 
essentially free of contamination. Sample cross-contamination can occur 
when high-level and low-level samples or standards are analyzed 
alternately and can be eliminated by thorough purging of the sample 
loop. Purging of the sample can easily be achieved by increasing the 
injection volume to ten times the size of the sample loop.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to 
determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to 
performing this test method.
    5.2 Hexavalent chromium compounds have been listed as carcinogens 
although chromium (III) compounds show little or no toxicity. Chromium 
can be a skin and respiratory irritant.

    6.1 Sampling Train.
    6.1.1 A schematic of the sampling train used in this method is shown 
in Figure 306-1. The train is the same as shown in Method 5, Section 6.0 
(40 CFR part 60, appendix A) except that the probe liner is unheated, 
the particulate filter is omitted, and quartz or borosilicate glass must 
be used for the probe nozzle and liner in place of stainless steel.
    6.1.2 Probe fittings of plastic such as Teflon, polypropylene, etc. 
are recommended over metal fittings to prevent contamination. If 
desired, a single combined probe nozzle and liner may be used, but such 
a single glass assembly is not a requirement of this methodology.

recommended, but other recording devices and integration techniques are 
acceptable provided the repeatability criteria and the linearity 
criteria for the calibration curve described in Section 10.4 can be 
satisfied. A sample loading system is required if preconcentration is 
employed.

[[Page 661]]

    6.3.4.2 Analytical Column. A high performance ion chromatograph 
(HPIC) non-metallic column with anion separation characteristics and a 
high loading capacity designed for separation of metal chelating 
compounds to prevent metal interference. Resolution described in Section 
11.6 must be obtained. A non-metallic guard column with the same ion-
exchange material is recommended.
    6.3.4.3 Preconcentration Column (for older instruments). An HPIC 
non-metallic column with acceptable anion retention characteristics and 
sample loading rates must be used as described in Section 11.6.

    Note: Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents should conform to the 
specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of 
the American Chemical Society (ACS reagent grade). Where such 
specifications are not available, use the best available grade. Reagents 
should be checked by the appropriate analysis prior to field use to 
assure that contamination is below the analytical detection limit for 
the ICP or GFAAS total chromium analysis; and that contamination is 
below the analytical detection limit for Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> using IC/PCR 
for direct injection or, if selected, preconcentration.

    8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Holding Times, Storage, and 
                                Transport

    Note: Prior to sample collection, consideration should be given to 
the type of analysis (Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> or total Cr) that will be 
performed. Which analysis option(s) will be performed will determine 
which sample recovery and storage procedures will be required to process 
the sample (See Figures 306-3 and 306-4).

    8.1 Sample Collection. Same as Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A), with the following exceptions.
    8.1.1 Omit the particulate filter and filter holder from the 
sampling train. Use a glass nozzle and probe liner instead of stainless 
steel. Do not heat the probe. Place 100 mL of 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N 
NaHCO<INF>3</INF> in each of the first two impingers, and record the 
data for each run on a data sheet such as shown in Figure 306-2.
    8.1.2 Clean all glassware prior to sampling in hot soapy water 
designed for laboratory cleaning of glassware. Next, rinse the glassware 
three times with tap water, followed by three additional rinses with 
reagent water. Then soak the glassware in 10% (v/v) HNO<INF>3</INF> 
solution for a minimum of 4 hours, rinse three times with reagent water, 
and allow to air dry. Cover all glassware openings where contamination 
can occur with Parafilm, or equivalent, until the sampling train is 
assembled for sampling.
    8.1.3 Train Operation. Follow the basic procedures outlined in 
Method 5 in conjunction with the following instructions. Train sampling 
rate shall not exceed 0.030 m\3\/min (1.0 cfm) during a run.
    8.2 Sample Recovery. Follow the basic procedures of Method 5, with 
the exceptions noted.
    8.2.1 A particulate filter is not recovered from this train.
    8.2.2 Tester shall select either the total Cr or Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> 
sample recovery option.
    8.2.3 Samples to be analyzed for both total Cr and Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>, 
shall be recovered using the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> sample option (Section 
8.2.6).
    8.2.4 A field reagent blank shall be collected for either of the Cr 
or the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> analysis. If both analyses (Cr and 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>) are to be conducted on the samples, collect separate 
reagent blanks for each analysis.

    Note: Since particulate matter is not usually present at chromium

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 ICP Quality Control.
    9.1.1 ICP Calibration Reference Standards. Prepare a calibration 
reference standard using the same alkaline matrix as the calibration 
standards; it should be at least 10 times the instrumental detection 
limit.
    9.1.1.1 This reference standard must be prepared from a different Cr 
stock solution source than that used for preparation of the calibration 
curve standards.
    9.1.1.2 Prior to sample analysis, analyze at least one reference 
standard.
    9.1.1.3 The calibration reference standard must be measured within 
10 percent of it's true value for the curve to be considered valid.

performed.
    9.1.2 ICP Continuing Check Standard.
    9.1.2.1 Perform analysis of the check standard with the field 
samples as described in Section 11.2 (at least after every 10 samples, 
and at the end of the analytical run).
    9.1.2.2 The check standard can either be the mid-range calibration 
standard or the reference standard. The results of the check standard 
shall agree within 10 percent of the expected value; if not, terminate 
the analyses, correct the problem, recalibrate the instrument, and rerun 
all samples analyzed subsequent to the last acceptable check standard 
analysis.

    9.1.3.1 Perform analysis of the calibration blank with the field 
samples as described in Section 11.2 (at least after every 10 samples, 
and at the end of the analytical run).
    9.1.3.2 The results of the calibration blank shall agree within 
three standard deviations of the mean blank value. If not, analyze the 
calibration blank two more times and average the results. If the average 
is not within three standard deviations of the background mean, 
terminate the analyses, correct the problem, recalibrate, and reanalyze 
all samples analyzed subsequent to the last acceptable calibration blank 
analysis.
    9.1.4 ICP Interference Check. Prepare an interference check solution 
that contains known concentrations of interfering elements that will 
provide an adequate test of the correction factors in the event of 
potential spectral interferences.
    9.1.4.1 Two potential interferences, iron and manganese, may be 
prepared as 1000 [micro]g/mL and 200 [micro]g/mL solutions, 
respectively. The solutions should be prepared in dilute HNO<INF>3</INF> 
(1-5 percent). Particular care must be used to ensure that the solutions 
and/or salts used to prepare the solutions are of ICP grade purity 
(i.e., that no measurable Cr contamination exists in the salts/
solutions). Commercially prepared interfering element check standards 
are available.
    9.1.4.2 Verify the interelement correction factors every three 
months by analyzing the interference check solution. The correction 
factors are calculated according to the instrument manufacturer's 
directions. If the interelement correction factors are used properly, no 
false Cr should be detected.
    9.1.4.3 Negative results with an absolute value greater than three 
(3) times the detection limit are usually the results of the background 
correction position being set incorrectly. Scan the spectral region to 
ensure that the correction position has not been placed on an 
interfering peak.
    9.1.5 ICP Duplicate Sample Analysis. Perform one duplicate sample 
analysis for each compliance sample batch (3 runs).
    9.1.5.1 As there is no sample preparation required for the ICP

achieved the second time, perform corrective action to identify and 
correct the problem before analyzing the sample for a third time.
    9.1.6 ICP Matrix Spiking. Spiked samples shall be prepared and 
analyzed daily to ensure that there are no matrix effects, that samples 
and standards have been matrix-matched, and that the laboratory 
equipment is operating properly.
    9.1.6.1 Spiked sample recovery analyses should indicate a recovery 
for the Cr spike of between 75 and 125 percent.
    9.1.6.2 Cr levels in the spiked sample should provide final solution 
concentrations that are within the linear portion of the calibration 
curve, as well as, at a concentration level at least: equal to that of 
the original sample; and, ten (10) times the detection limit.

may indicate that the graphite tube should be replaced.
    9.2.3.3 The results of the calibration blank shall agree within 
three standard deviations of the mean blank value.
    9.2.3.4 If not, analyze the calibration blank two more times and

standards are matrix matched. Flush the system with the calibration 
blank between each standard.
    10.2.3 Use the average intensity of multiple exposures (3 or more) 
for both standardization and sample analysis to reduce random error.

[[Page 666]]

Section 11.6.

                       11.0 Analytical Procedures

    Note: The method determines the chromium concentration in [micro]g 
Cr/mL. It is important that the analyst measure the field sample volume 
prior to analyzing the sample. This will allow for conversion of 
[micro]g Cr/mL to [micro]g Cr/sample.

    11.1 ICP Sample Preparation.
    11.1.1 The ICP analysis is performed directly on the alkaline 
impinger solution; acid digestion is not necessary, provided the samples 
and standards are matrix matched.
    11.1.2 The ICP analysis should only be employed when the solution 
analyzed has a Cr concentration greater than 35 [micro]g/L or five times 
the method detection limit as determined according to Appendix B in 40 
CFR Part 136 or by other commonly accepted analytical procedures.
    11.2 ICP Sample Analysis.
    11.2.1 The ICP analysis is applicable for the determination of total 
chromium only.
    11.2.2 ICP Blanks. Two types of blanks are required for the ICP 
analysis.
    11.2.2.1 Calibration Blank. The calibration blank is used in 
establishing the calibration curve. For the calibration blank, use 
either 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, whichever is used for the 
impinger absorbing solution. The calibration blank can be prepared fresh 
in the laboratory; it does not have to be prepared from the same batch 
of solution that was used in the field. A sufficient quantity should be 
prepared to flush the system between standards and samples.
    11.2.2.2 Field Reagent Blank. The field reagent blank is collected 
in the field during the testing program. The field reagent blank 
(Section 8.2.4) is an aliquot of the absorbing solution prepared in 
Section 7.1.2. The reagent blank is used to assess possible 
contamination resulting from sample processing.
    11.2.3 ICP Instrument Adjustment.
    11.2.3.1 Adjust the ICP instrument for proper operating parameters 
including wavelength, background correction settings (if necessary), and 
interfering element correction settings (if necessary).
    11.2.3.2 The instrument must be allowed to become thermally stable 
before beginning measurements (usually requiring at least 30 min of 
operation prior to calibration). During this warmup period, the optical 
calibration and torch position optimization may be performed (consult 
the operator's manual).
    11.2.4 ICP Instrument Calibration.
    11.2.4.1 Calibrate the instrument according to the instrument 
manufacturer's recommended procedures, and the procedures specified in 
Section 10.2.
    11.2.4.2 Prior to analyzing the field samples, reanalyze the highest 
calibration standard as if it were a sample.
    11.2.4.3 Concentration values obtained should not deviate from the 
actual values or from the established control limits by more than 5 
percent, whichever is lower (see Sections 9.1 and 10.2).
    11.2.4.4 If they do, follow the recommendations of the instrument 
manufacturer to correct the problem.
    11.2.5 ICP Operational Quality Control Procedures.
    11.2.5.1 Flush the system with the calibration blank solution for at 
least 1 min before the analysis of each sample or standard.
    11.2.5.2 Analyze the continuing check standard and the calibration 
blank after each batch of 10 samples.
    11.2.5.3 Use the average intensity of multiple exposures for both 
standardization and sample analysis to reduce random error.
    11.2.6 ICP Sample Dilution.
    11.2.6.1 Dilute and reanalyze samples that are more concentrated 
than the linear calibration limit or use an alternate, less sensitive Cr 
wavelength for which quality control data have already been established.

[[Page 667]]

    11.2.6.2 When dilutions are performed, the appropriate factors must 
be applied to sample measurement results.
    11.2.7 Reporting Analytical Results. All analytical results should 
be reported in [micro]g Cr/mL using three significant figures. Field 
sample volumes (mL) must be reported also.
    11.3 GFAAS Sample Preparation.
    11.3.1 GFAAS Acid Digestion. An acid digestion of the alkaline 
impinger solution is required for the GFAAS analysis.
    11.3.1.1 In a beaker, add 10 mL of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> to a 
100 mL sample aliquot that has been well mixed. Cover the beaker with a 
watch glass. Place the beaker on a hot plate and reflux the sample to 
near dryness. Add another 5 mL of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> to 
complete the digestion. Again, carefully reflux the sample volume to 
near dryness. Rinse the beaker walls and watch glass with reagent water.
    11.3.1.2 The final concentration of HNO<INF>3</INF> in the solution 
should be 1 percent (v/v).
    11.3.1.3 Transfer the digested sample to a 50-mL volumetric flask. 
Add 0.5 mL of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> and 1 mL of the 10 [micro]g/
mL of Ca(NO<INF>3</INF>)<INF>2</INF>. Dilute to 50 mL with reagent 
water.
    11.3.2 HNO<INF>3</INF> Concentration. A different final volume may 
be used based on the expected Cr concentration, but the HNO<INF>3</INF> 
concentration must be maintained at 1 percent (v/v).
    11.4 GFAAS Sample Analysis.
    11.4.1 The GFAAS analysis is applicable for the determination of 
total chromium only.
    11.4.2 GFAAS Blanks. Two types of blanks are required for the GFAAS 
analysis.
    11.4.2.1 Calibration Blank. The 1.0 percent HNO<INF>3</INF> is the 
calibration blank which is used in establishing the calibration curve.
    11.4.2.2 Field Reagent Blank. An aliquot of the 0.1 N NaOH solution 
or the 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> prepared in Section 7.1.2 is collected 
for the field reagent blank. The field reagent blank is used to assess 
possible contamination resulting from processing the sample.
    11.4.2.2.1 The reagent blank must be subjected to the entire series 
of sample preparation and analytical procedures, including the acid 
digestion.
    11.4.2.2.2 The reagent blank's final solution must contain the same 
acid concentration as the sample solutions.
    11.4.3 GFAAS Instrument Adjustment.
    11.4.3.1 The 357.9 nm wavelength line shall be used.
    11.4.3.2 Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all other 
spectrophotometer operating parameters.
    11.4.4 Furnace Operational Parameters. Parameters suggested by the 
manufacturer should be employed as guidelines.
    11.4.4.1 Temperature-sensing mechanisms and temperature controllers 
can vary between instruments and/or with time; the validity of the 
furnace operating parameters must be periodically confirmed by 
systematically altering the furnace parameters while analyzing a 
standard. In this manner, losses of analyte due to higher-than-necessary 
temperature settings or losses in sensitivity due to less than optimum 
settings can be minimized.
    11.4.4.2 Similar verification of furnace operating parameters may be 
required for complex sample matrices (consult instrument manual for 
additional information). Calibrate the GFAAS system following the 
procedures specified in Section 10.3.
    11.4.5 GFAAS Operational Quality Control Procedures.
    11.4.5.1 Introduce a measured aliquot of digested sample into the 
furnace and atomize.
    11.4.5.2 If the measured concentration exceeds the calibration 
range, the sample should be diluted with the calibration blank solution 
(1.0 percent HNO<INF>3</INF>) and reanalyzed.
    11.4.5.3 Consult the operator's manual for suggested injection 
volumes. The use of multiple injections can improve accuracy and assist 
in detecting furnace pipetting errors.
    11.4.5.4 Analyze a minimum of one matrix-matched reagent blank per 
sample batch to determine if contamination or any memory effects are 
occurring.
    11.4.5.5 Analyze a calibration blank and a continuing check standard 
after approximately every batch of 10 sample injections.
    11.4.6 GFAAS Sample Dilution.
    11.4.6.1 Dilute and reanalyze samples that are more concentrated 
than the instrument calibration range.
    11.4.6.2 If dilutions are performed, the appropriate factors must be 
applied to sample measurement results.
    11.4.7 Reporting Analytical Results.
    11.4.7.1 Calculate the Cr concentrations by the method of standard 
additions (see operator's manual) or, from direct calibration. All 
dilution and/or concentration factors must be used when calculating the 
results.
    11.4.7.2 Analytical results should be reported in [micro]g Cr/mL 
using three significant figures. Field sample volumes (mL) must be 
reported also.
    11.5 IC/PCR Sample Preparation.
    11.5.1 Sample pH. Measure and record the sample pH prior to 
analysis.
    11.5.2 Sample Filtration. Prior to preconcentration and/or analysis, 
filter all field samples through a 0.45-[micro]m filter. The filtration 
step should be conducted just prior to sample injection/analysis.
    11.5.2.1 Use a portion of the sample to rinse the syringe filtration 
unit and acetate filter and then collect the required volume of 
filtrate.
    11.5.2.2 Retain the filter if total Cr is to be determined also.
    11.5.3 Sample Preconcentration (older instruments).

[[Page 668]]

    11.5.3.1 For older instruments, a preconcentration system may be 
used in conjunction with the IC/PCR to increase sensitivity for trace 
levels of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>.
    11.5.3.2 The preconcentration is accomplished by selectively 
retaining the analyte on a solid absorbent, followed by removal of the 
analyte from the absorbent (consult instrument manual).
    11.5.3.3 For a manual system, position the injection valve so that 
the eluent displaces the concentrated Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> sample, 
transferring it from the preconcentration column and onto the IC anion 
separation column.
    11.6 IC/PCR Sample Analyses.
    11.6.1 The IC/PCR analysis is applicable for hexavalent chromium 
measurements only.
    11.6.2 IC/PCR Blanks. Two types of blanks are required for the IC/
PCR analysis.
    11.6.2.1 Calibration Blank. The calibration blank is used in 
establishing the analytical curve. For the calibration blank, use either 
0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, whichever is used for the 
impinger solution. The calibration blank can be prepared fresh in the 
laboratory; it does not have to be prepared from the same batch of 
absorbing solution that is used in the field.
    11.6.2.2 Field Reagent Blank. An aliquot of the 0.1 N NaOH solution 
or the 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> solution prepared in Section 7.1.2 is 
collected for the field reagent blank. The field reagent blank is used 
to assess possible contamination resulting from processing the sample.
    11.6.3 Stabilized Baseline. Prior to sample analysis, establish a 
stable baseline with the detector set at the required attenuation by 
setting the eluent and post-column reagent flow rates according to the 
manufacturers recommendations.

    Note: As long as the ratio of eluent flow rate to PCR flow rate 
remains constant, the standard curve should remain linear. Inject a 
sample of reagent water to ensure that no Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> appears in the 
water blank.

    11.6.4 Sample Injection Loop. Size of injection loop is based on 
standard/sample concentrations and the selected attenuator setting.
    11.6.4.1 A 50-[micro]L loop is normally sufficient for most higher 
concentrations.
    11.6.4.2 The sample volume used to load the injection loop should be 
at least 10 times the loop size so that all tubing in contact with the 
sample is thoroughly flushed with the new sample to prevent cross 
contamination.
    11.6.5 IC/PCR Instrument Calibration.
    11.6.5.1 First, inject the calibration standards prepared, as 
described in Section 7.3.8 to correspond to the appropriate 
concentration range, starting with the lowest standard first.
    11.6.5.2 Check the performance of the instrument and verify the 
calibration using data gathered from analyses of laboratory blanks, 
calibration standards, and a quality control sample.
    11.6.5.3 Verify the calibration by analyzing a calibration reference 
standard. If the measured concentration exceeds the established value by 
more than 10 percent, perform a second analysis. If the measured 
concentration still exceeds the established value by more than 10 
percent, terminate the analysis until the problem can be identified and 
corrected.
    11.6.6 IC/PCR Instrument Operation.
    11.6.6.1 Inject the calibration reference standard (as described in 
Section 9.3.1), followed by the field reagent blank (Section 8.2.4), and 
the field samples.
    11.6.6.1.1 Standards (and QC standards) and samples are injected 
into the sample loop of the desired size (use a larger size loop for 
greater sensitivity). The Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> is collected on the resin bed 
of the column.
    11.6.6.1.2 After separation from other sample components, the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> forms a specific complex in the post-column reactor with 
the DPC reaction solution, and the complex is detected by visible 
absorbance at a maximum wavelength of 540 nm.
    11.6.6.1.3 The amount of absorbance measured is proportional to the 
concentration of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> complex formed.
    11.6.6.1.4 The IC retention time and the absorbance of the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> complex with known Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> standards analyzed 
under identical conditions must be compared to provide both qualitative 
and quantitative analyses.
    11.6.6.1.5 If a sample peak appears near the expected retention time 
of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> ion, spike the sample according to Section 9.3.4 
to verify peak identity.
    11.6.7 IC/PCR Operational Quality Control Procedures.
    11.6.7.1 Samples should be at a pH <ls-thn-eq>=8.5 for NaOH and 
<ls-thn-eq>=8.0 if using NaHCO<INF>3</INF>; document any discrepancies.
    11.6.7.2 Refrigerated samples should be allowed to equilibrate to 
ambient temperature prior to preparation and analysis.
    11.6.7.3 Repeat the injection of the calibration standards at the 
end of the analytical run to assess instrument drift. Measure areas or 
heights of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/DPC complex chromatogram peaks.
    11.6.7.4 To ensure the precision of the sample injection (manual or 
autosampler), the response for the second set of injected standards must 
be within 10 percent of the average response.
    11.6.7.5 If the 10 percent criteria duplicate injection cannot be 
achieved, identify the source of the problem and rerun the calibration 
standards.
    11.6.7.6 Use peak areas or peak heights from the injections of 
calibration standards to generate a linear calibration curve. From

[[Page 669]]

the calibration curve, determine the concentrations of the field 
samples.
    11.6.8 IC/PCR Sample Dilution.
    11.6.8.1 Samples having concentrations higher than the established 
calibration range must be diluted into the calibration range and re-
analyzed.
    11.6.8.2 If dilutions are performed, the appropriate factors must be 
applied to sample measurement results.
    11.6.9 Reporting Analytical Results. Results should be reported in 
[micro]g Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/mL using three significant figures. Field 
sample volumes (mL) must be reported also.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Pretest Calculations.
    12.1.1 Pretest Protocol (Site Test Plan).
    12.1.1.1 The pretest protocol should define and address the test 
data quality objectives (DQOs), with all assumptions, that will be 
required by the end user (enforcement authority); what data are needed? 
why are the data needed? how will the data be used? what are method 
detection limits? and what are estimated target analyte levels for the 
following test parameters.
    12.1.1.1.1 Estimated source concentration for total chromium and/or 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>.
    12.1.1.1.2 Estimated minimum sampling time and/or volume required to 
meet method detection limit requirements (Appendix B 40 CFR Part 136) 
for measurement of total chromium and/or Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>.
    12.1.1.1.3 Demonstrate that planned sampling parameters will meet 
DQOs. The protocol must demonstrate that the planned sampling parameters 
calculated by the tester will meet the needs of the source and the 
enforcement authority.
    12.1.1.2 The pre-test protocol should include information on 
equipment, logistics, personnel, process operation, and other resources 
necessary for an efficient and coordinated test.
    12.1.1.3 At a minimum, the pre-test protocol should identify and be 
approved by the source, the tester, the analytical laboratory, and the 
regulatory enforcement authority. The tester should not proceed with the 
compliance testing before obtaining approval from the enforcement 
authority.
    12.1.2 Post Test Calculations.
    12.1.2.1 Perform the calculations, retaining one extra decimal 
figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures after final 
calculations.

    12.1.2.9 Isokinetic Variation, Acceptable Results. Same as Method 5.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Range. The recommended working range for all of the three 
analytical techniques starts at five times the analytical detection 
limit (see also Section 13.2.2). The upper limit of all three techniques 
can be extended indefinitely by appropriate dilution.
    13.2 Sensitivity.
    13.2.1 Analytical Sensitivity. The estimated instrumental detection 
limits listed are provided as a guide for an instrumental limit. The 
actual method detection limits are sample and instrument dependent and 
may vary as the sample matrix varies.
    13.2.1.2 ICP Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated detection 
limits for ICP, as reported in Method 6010A and the recently revised 
Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), are 7.0 [micro]g Cr/L and 4.7 
[micro]g Cr/L, respectively.
    13.2.1.3 GFAAS Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated 
detection limit for GFAAS, as reported in Methods 7000A and 7191 of SW-
846 (Reference 1), is 1 [micro]g Cr/L.
    13.2.1.4 IC/PCR Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum detection limit 
for IC/PCR with a preconcentrator, as reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 
of SW-846 (Reference 1), is 0.05 [micro]g Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/L.
    1.3.2.1.5 Determination of Detection Limits. The laboratory 
performing the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> measurements must determine the method 
detection limit on a quarterly basis using a suitable procedure such as 
that found in 40 CFR, part 136, appendix B. The determination should be 
made on samples in the appropriate alkaline matrix. Normally this 
involves the preparation (if applicable) and consecutive measurement of 
seven (7) separate aliquots of a sample with a concentration <5 times 
the expected detection limit. The detection limit is 3.14 times the 
standard deviation of these results.
    13.2.2 In-stack Sensitivity. The in-stack sensitivity depends upon 
the analytical detection limit, the volume of stack gas sampled, the 
total volume of the impinger absorbing solution plus the rinses, and, in 
some cases, dilution or concentration factors from sample preparation. 
Using the analytical detection limits given in Sections 13.2.1.1, 
13.2.1.2, and 13.2.1.3; a stack gas sample volume of 1.7 dscm; a total 
liquid sample volume of 500 mL; and the digestion concentration factor 
of 1/2 for the GFAAS analysis; the corresponding in-stack detection 
limits are 0.0014 mg Cr/dscm to 0.0021 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00015 mg 
Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000015 mg Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/dscm for IC/PCR with 
preconcentration.

    Note: It is recommended that the concentration of Cr in the 
analytical solutions be at least five times the analytical detection 
limit to optimize sensitivity in the analyses. Using this guideline and 
the same assumptions for impinger sample volume, stack gas sample 
volume, and the digestion concentration factor for the GFAAS analysis 
(500 mL,1.7 dscm, and 1/2, respectively), the recommended minimum stack 
concentrations for optimum sensitivity are 0.0068 mg Cr/dscm to 0.0103 
mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00074 mg Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000074 mg 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/dscm for IC/PCR with preconcentration. If required, the 
in-stack detection limits can be improved by either increasing the stack 
gas sample volume, further reducing the volume of the digested sample 
for GFAAS, improving the analytical detection limits, or any combination 
of the three.

    13.3 Precision.
    13.3.1 The following precision data have been reported for the three 
analytical methods. In each case, when the sampling precision is 
combined with the reported analytical precision, the resulting overall 
precision may decrease.
    13.3.2 Bias data is also reported for GFAAS.
    13.4 ICP Precision.
    13.4.1 As reported in Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), in an 
EPA round-robin Phase 1 study, seven laboratories applied the

[[Page 671]]

ICP technique to acid/distilled water matrices that had been spiked with 
various metal concentrates. For true values of 10, 50, and 150 [micro]g 
Cr/L; the mean reported values were 10, 50, and 149 [micro]g Cr/L; and 
the mean percent relative standard deviations were 18, 3.3, and 3.8 
percent, respectively.
    13.4.2 In another multi laboratory study cited in Method 6010B, a 
mean relative standard of 8.2 percent was reported for an aqueous sample 
concentration of approximately 3750 [micro]g Cr/L.
    13.5 GFAAS Precision. As reported in Method 7191 of SW-846 
(Reference 1), in a single laboratory (EMSL), using Cincinnati, Ohio tap 
water spiked at concentrations of 19, 48, and 77 [micro]g Cr/L, the 
standard deviations were <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1, <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.2, and <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.8, respectively. 
Recoveries at these levels were 97 percent, 101 percent, and 102 
percent, respectively.
    13.6 IC/PCR Precision. As reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 of SW-
846 (Reference 1), the precision of IC/PCR with sample preconcentration 
is 5 to 10 percent. The overall precision for sewage sludge incinerators 
emitting 120 ng/dscm of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and 3.5 [micro]g/dscm of total 
Cr was 25 percent and 9 percent, respectively; and for hazardous waste 
incinerators emitting 300 ng/dscm of C<SUP>+6</SUP> the precision was 20 
percent.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 The only materials used in this method that could be considered 
pollutants are the chromium standards used for instrument calibration 
and acids used in the cleaning of the collection and measurement 
containers/labware, in the preparation of standards, and in the acid 
digestion of samples. Both reagents can be stored in the same waste 
container.
    14.2 Cleaning solutions containing acids should be prepared in 
volumes consistent with use to minimize the disposal of excessive 
volumes of acid.
    14.3 To the extent possible, the containers/vessels used to collect 
and prepare samples should be cleaned and reused to minimize the 
generation of solid waste.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 It is the responsibility of the laboratory and the sampling 
team to comply with all federal, state, and local regulations governing 
waste management, particularly the discharge regulations, hazardous 
waste identification rules, and land disposal restrictions; and to 
protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all 
releases from field operations.
    15.2 For further information on waste management, consult The Waste 
Management Manual for Laboratory Personnel and Less is Better--

  Method 306A--Determination of Chromium Emissions From Decorative and 
     Hard Chromium Electroplating and Chromium Anodizing Operations

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A and in this part. 
Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should 
have a thorough knowledge of at least Methods 5 and 306.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analyte. Chromium. CAS Number (7440-47-3).
    1.2 Applicability.

[[Page 674]]

    1.2.1 This method applies to the determination of chromium (Cr) in 
emissions from decorative and hard chromium electroplating facilities, 
chromium anodizing operations, and continuous chromium plating at iron 
and steel facilities. The method is less expensive and less complex to 
conduct than Method 306. Correctly applied, the precision and bias of 
the sample results should be comparable to those obtained with the 
isokinetic Method 306. This method is applicable for the determination 
of air emissions under nominal ambient moisture, temperature, and 
pressure conditions.
    1.2.2 The method is also applicable to electroplating and anodizing 
sources controlled by wet scrubbers.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives.
    1.3.1 Pretest Protocol.
    1.3.1.1 The pretest protocol should define and address the test data 
quality objectives (DQOs), with all assumptions, that will be required 
by the end user (enforcement authority); what data are needed? why are 
the data needed? how will data be used? what are method detection 
limits? and what are estimated target analyte levels for the following 
test parameters.
    1.3.1.1.1 Estimated source concentration for total chromium and/or 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>.
    1.3.1.1.2 Estimated minimum sampling time and/or volume required to 
meet method detection limit requirements (Appendix B 40 CFR Part 136) 
for measurement of total chromium and/or Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>.
    1.3.1.1.3 Demonstrate that planned sampling parameters will meet 
DQOs. The protocol must demonstrate that the planned sampling parameters 
calculated by the tester will meet the needs of the source and the 
enforcement authority.
    1.3.1.2 The pre-test protocol should include information on 
equipment, logistics, personnel, process operation, and other resources 
necessary for an efficient and coordinated performance test.
    1.3.1.3 At a minimum, the pre-test protocol should identify and be 
approved by the source, the tester, the analytical laboratory, and the 
regulatory enforcement authority. The tester should not proceed with the 
compliance testing before obtaining approval from the enforcement 
authority.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Sampling.
    2.1.1 An emission sample is extracted from the source at a constant 
sampling rate determined by a critical orifice and collected in a 
sampling train composed of a probe and impingers. The proportional 
sampling time at the cross sectional traverse points is varied according 
to the stack gas velocity at each point. The total sample time must be 
at least two hours.
    2.1.2 The chromium emission concentration is determined by the same 
analytical procedures described in Method 306: inductively-coupled 
plasma emission spectrometry (ICP), graphite furnace atomic absorption 
spectrometry (GFAAS), or ion chromatography with a post-column reactor 
(IC/PCR).
    2.1.2.1 Total chromium samples with high chromium concentrations 
(<ls-thn-eq>=35 [micro]g/L) may be analyzed using inductively coupled 
plasma emission spectrometry (ICP) at 267.72 nm.

    Note: The ICP analysis is applicable for this method only when the 
solution analyzed has a Cr concentration greater than or equal to 35 
[micro]g/L or five times the method detection limit as determined 
according to Appendix B in 40 CFR Part 136.

    2.1.2.2 Alternatively, when lower total chromium concentrations (<35 
[micro]g/L) are encountered, a portion of the alkaline sample solution 
may be digested with nitric acid and analyzed by graphite furnace atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) at 357.9 nm.
    2.1.2.3 If it is desirable to determine hexavalent chromium 
(Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>) emissions, the samples may be analyzed using an ion 
chromatograph equipped with a post-column reactor (IC/PCR) and a visible 
wavelength detector. To increase sensitivity for trace levels of 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>, a preconcentration system may be used in conjunction 
with the IC/PCR.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.

    6.1 Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train is shown in 
Figure 306A-1. The individual components of the train are available 
commercially, however, some fabrication and assembly are required.
    6.1.1 Probe Nozzle/Tubing and Sheath.
    6.1.1.1 Use approximately 6.4-mm (\1/4\-in.) inside diameter (ID) 
glass or rigid plastic tubing approximately 20 cm (8 in.) in length with 
a short 90 degree bend at one end to form the sampling nozzle. Grind a 
slight taper on the nozzle end before making the bend. Attach the nozzle 
to flexible tubing of sufficient length to enable collection of a sample 
from the stack.
    6.1.1.2 Use a straight piece of larger diameter rigid tubing (such 
as metal conduit or plastic water pipe) to form a sheath that begins 
about 2.5 cm (1 in.) from the 90 [deg] bend on the nozzle and encases 
and supports the flexible tubing.
    6.1.2 Type S Pitot Tube. Same as Method 2, Section 6.1 (40 CFR part 
60, appendix A).

polypropylene, or polyvinyl chloride)  6.4-mm (\1/4\-in.) to 9.5-mm (\3/
8\-in.) ID to connect the train components.
    6.1.4.2 A combination of rigid plastic tubing and thin wall flexible 
tubing may be used as long as tubing walls do not collapse when leak-
checking the train. Metal tubing cannot be used.
    6.1.5 Impingers. Three, one-quart capacity, glass canning jars with 
vacuum seal lids, or three Greenburg-Smith (GS) design impingers 
connected in series, or equivalent, may be used.
    6.1.5.1 One-quart glass canning jar. Three separate jar containers 
are required: (1) the first jar contains the absorbing solution; (2) the 
second is empty and is used to collect any reagent carried over from the 
first container; and (3) the third contains the desiccant drying agent.
    6.1.5.2 Canning Jar Connectors. The jar containers are connected by 
leak-tight inlet and outlet tubes installed in the lids of each 
container for assembly with the train. The tubes may be made of  6.4 mm 
(\1/4\-in.) ID glass or rigid plastic tubing. For the inlet tube of the 
first impinger, heat the glass or plastic tubing and draw until the 
tubing separates. Fabricate the necked tip to form an orifice tip that 
is approximately 2.4 mm (\3/32\-in.) ID.
    6.1.5.2.1 When assembling the first container, place the orifice tip 
end of the tube approximately 4.8 mm (\3/16\-in.) above the inside 
bottom of the jar.
    6.1.5.2.2 For the second container, the inlet tube need not be drawn 
and sized, but the tip should be approximately 25 mm (1 in.) above the 
bottom of the jar.
    6.1.5.2.3 The inlet tube of the third container should extend to 
approximately 12.7 mm (\1/2\-in.) above the bottom of the jar.
    6.1.5.2.4 Extend the outlet tube for each container approximately 50 
mm (2 in.) above the jar lid and downward through the lid, approximately 
12.7 mm (\1/2\-in.) beneath the bottom of the lid.
    6.1.5.3 Greenburg-Smith Impingers. Three separate impingers of the 
Greenburg-Smith (GS) design as described in Section 6.0 of Method 5 are 
required. The first GS impinger shall have a standard tip (orifice/
plate), and the second and third GS impingers shall be modified by 
replacing the orifice/plate tube with a 13 mm (\1/2\-in.) ID glass tube, 
having an unrestricted opening located 13 mm (\1/2\-in.) from the bottom 
of the outer flask.
    6.1.5.4 Greenburg-Smith Connectors. The GS impingers shall be 
connected by leak-free ground glass ``U'' tube connectors or by leak-
free non-contaminating flexible tubing. The first impinger shall contain 
the absorbing solution, the second is empty and the third contains the 
desiccant drying agent.
    6.1.6 Manometer. Inclined/vertical type, or equivalent device, as 
described in Section 6.2 of Method 2 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A).
    6.1.7 Critical Orifice. The critical orifice is a small restriction 
in the sample line that is located upstream of the vacuum pump. The 
orifice produces a constant sampling flow rate that is approximately 
0.021 cubic meters per minute (m3/min) or 0.75 cubic feet per minute 
(cfm).
    6.1.7.1 The critical orifice can be constructed by sealing a 2.4-mm 
(\3/32\-in.) ID brass tube approximately 14.3 mm (\9/16\-in.) in length 
inside a second brass tube that is approximately 8 mm (\5/16\-in.) ID 
and 14.3-mm (\9/16\-in.) in length .
    6.1.7.2 Materials other than brass can be used to construct the 
critical orifice as long as the flow through the sampling train can be 
maintained at approximately 0.021 cubic meter per minute (0.75) cfm.
    6.1.8 Connecting Hardware. Standard pipe and fittings, 9.5-mm (\3/
8\-in.), 6.4-mm (\1/4\-in.)

orifice and the vacuum pump.
    6.1.10 Pump Oiler. A glass oil reservoir with a wick mounted at the 
vacuum pump inlet that lubricates the pump vanes. The oiler should be an 
in-line type and not vented to the atmosphere. See EMTIC Guideline 
Document No. GD-041.WPD for additional information.
    6.1.11 Vacuum Pump. Gast Model 0522-V103-G18DX, or equivalent,

    6.1.12 Oil Trap/Muffler. An empty glass oil reservoir without wick 
mounted at the pump outlet to control the pump noise and prevent oil 
from reaching the dry gas meter.
    6.1.13 By-pass Fine Adjust Valve (Optional). Needle valve assembly 
6.4-mm (\1/4\-in.), Whitey 1 RF 4-A, or equivalent, that allows for 
adjustment of the train vacuum.
    6.1.13.1 A fine-adjustment valve is positioned in the optional pump 
by-pass system that allows the gas flow to recirculate through the pump. 
This by-pass system allows the tester to control/reduce the maximum 
leak-check vacuum pressure produced by the pump.
    6.1.13.1.1 The tester must conduct the post test leak check at a 
vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum vacuum encountered during 
the sampling run.
    6.1.13.1.2 The pump by-pass assembly is not required, but is 
recommended if the tester intends to leak-check the 306A train at the 
vacuum experienced during a run.
    6.1.14 Dry Gas Meter. An Equimeter Model 110 test meter or, 
equivalent with temperature sensor(s) installed (inlet/outlet) to 
monitor the meter temperature. If only one temperature sensor is 
installed, locate the sensor at the outlet side of the meter. The dry 
gas meter must be capable of measuring the gaseous volume to within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2% of the true volume.

    Note: The Method 306 sampling train is also commercially available 
and may be used to perform the Method 306A tests. The sampling train may 
be assembled as specified in Method 306A with the sampling rate being 
operated at the delta H<INF>@</INF> specified for the calibrated orifice 
located in the meter box. The Method 306 train is then operated as 
described in Method 306A.

    6.2 Barometer. Mercury aneroid barometer, or other barometer 
equivalent, capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mm H<INF>g</INF> (0.1 in. H<INF>g</INF>).
    6.2.1 A preliminary check of the barometer shall be made against a 
mercury-in-glass reference barometer or its equivalent.
    6.2.2 Tester may elect to obtain the absolute barometric pressure 
from a nearby National Weather Service station.
    6.2.2.1 The station value (which is the absolute barometric 
pressure) must be adjusted for elevation differences between the weather 
station and the sampling location. Either subtract 2.5 mm H<INF>g</INF> 
(0.1 in. H<INF>g</INF>) from the station value per 30 m (100 ft) of 
elevation increase or add the same for an elevation decrease.
    6.2.2.2 If the field barometer cannot be adjusted to agree within 
0.1 in. H<INF>g</INF> of the reference barometric, repair or discard the 
unit. The barometer pressure measurement shall be recorded on the 
sampling data sheet.
    6.3 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, Section 6.2 (40 CFR Part 60, 
Appendix A), with the following exceptions:
    6.3.1 Probe-Liner and Probe-Nozzle Brushes. Brushes are not 
necessary for sample recovery. If a probe brush is used, it must be non-
metallic.
    6.3.2 Wash Bottles. Polyethylene wash bottle, for sample recovery 
absorbing solution.
    6.3.3 Sample Recovery Solution. Use 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N 
NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, whichever is used as the impinger absorbing solution, 
to replace the acetone.
    6.3.4 Sample Storage Containers.
    6.3.4.1 Glass Canning Jar. The first canning jar container of the 
sampling train may serve as the sample shipping container. A new lid and 
sealing plastic wrap shall be substituted for the container lid 
assembly.
    6.3.4.2 Polyethylene or Glass Containers. Transfer the Greenburg-
Smith impinger contents to precleaned polyethylene or glass containers. 
The samples shall be stored and shipped in 250-mL, 500-mL or 1000-mL 
polyethylene or glass containers with leak-free, non metal screw caps.
    6.3.5 pH Indicator Strip, for Cr <SUP>+6</SUP> Samples. pH indicator 
strips, or equivalent, capable of determining the pH of solutions 
between the range of 7 and 12, at 0.5 pH increments.
    6.3.6 Plastic Storage Containers. Air tight containers to store 
silica gel.
    6.4 Analysis. Same as Method 306, Section 6.3.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards.

    Note: Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents shall conform to the 
specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of 
the American Chemical Society (ACS reagent grade). Where such 
specifications are not available, use the best available grade. It is 
recommended, but not required, that reagents be checked by the 
appropriate analysis prior to field use to assure that contamination is 
below the analytical detection limit for the ICP or GFAAS total chromium 
analysis; and that contamination is below the analytical detection limit 
for

[[Page 677]]

Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> using IC/PCR for direct injection or, if selected, 
preconcentration.

    7.1 Sampling.
    7.1.1 Water. Reagent water that conforms to ASTM Specification D1193 
Type II (incorporated by reference see Sec. 63.14). All references to 
water in the method refer to reagent water unless otherwise specified. 
It is recommended that water blanks be checked prior to preparing the 
sampling reagents to ensure that the Cr content is less than three (3) 
times the anticipated detection limit of the analytical method.
    7.1.2 Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) Absorbing Solution, 0.1 N. Dissolve 
4.0 g of sodium hydroxide in 1 liter of water to obtain a pH of 
approximately 8.5.
    7.1.3 Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO<INF>3</INF>) Absorbing Solution, 0.1 
N. Dissolve approximately 8.5 g of sodium bicarbonate in 1 liter of 
water to obtain a pH of approximately 8.3.
    7.1.4 Chromium Contamination.
    7.1.4.1 The absorbing solution shall not exceed the QC criteria 
noted in Method 306, Section 7.1.1 (<=3 times the instrument detection 
limit).
    7.1.4.2 When the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> content in the field samples 
exceeds the blank concentration by at least a factor of ten (10), 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> blank levels <=10 times the detection limit will be 
allowed.

    Note: At sources with high concentrations of acids and/or 
SO<INF>2</INF>, the concentration of NaOH or NaHCO<INF>3</INF> should be 
<ls-thn-eq>=0.5 N to insure that the pH of the solution remains at or 
above 8.5 for NaOH and 8.0 for NaHCO<INF>3</INF> during and after 
sampling.

    7.1.3 Desiccant. Silica Gel, 6-16 mesh, indicating type. 
Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the 
approval of the Administrator.
    7.2 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 306, Section 7.2.
    7.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis. Same as Method 306, Section 
7.3.
    7.4 Glassware Cleaning Reagents. Same as Method 306, Section 7.4.

 8.0 Sample Collection, Recovery, Preservation, Holding Times, Storage, 
                              and Transport

    Note: Prior to sample collection, consideration should be given as 
to the type of analysis (Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> or total Cr) that will be 
performed. Deciding which analysis will be performed will enable the 
tester to determine which appropriate sample recovery and storage 
procedures will be required to process the sample.

    8.1 Sample Collection.
    8.1.1 Pretest Preparation.
    8.1.1.1 Selection of Measurement Site. Locate the sampling ports as 
specified in Section 11.0 of Method 1 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A).
    8.1.1.2 Location of Traverse Points.
    8.1.1.2.1 Locate the traverse points as specified in Section 11.0 of 
Method 1 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A). Use a total of 24 sampling points 
for round ducts and 24 or 25 points for rectangular ducts. Mark the 
pitot and sampling probe to identify the sample traversing points.
    8.1.1.2.2 For round ducts less than 12 inches in diameter, use a 
total of 16 points.
    8.1.1.3 Velocity Pressure Traverse. Perform an initial velocity 
traverse before obtaining samples. The Figure 306A-2 data sheet may be 
used to record velocity traverse data.
    8.1.1.3.1 To demonstrate that the flow rate is constant over several 
days of testing, perform complete traverses at the beginning and end of 
each day's test effort, and calculate the deviation of the flow rate for 
each daily period. The beginning and end flow rates are considered 
constant if the deviation does not exceed 10 percent. If the flow rate 
exceeds the 10 percent criteria, either correct the inconsistent flow 
rate problem, or obtain the Administrator's approval for the test 
results.
    8.1.1.3.2 Perform traverses as specified in Section 8.0 of Method 2, 
but record only the [Delta]p (velocity pressure) values for each 
sampling point. If a mass emission rate is desired, stack velocity 
pressures shall be recorded before and after each test, and an average 
stack velocity pressure determined for the testing period.
    8.1.1.4 Verification of Absence of Cyclonic Flow. Check for cyclonic 
flow during the initial traverse to verify that it does not exist. 
Perform the cyclonic flow check as specified in Section 11.4 of Method 1 
(40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A).
    8.1.1.4.1 If cyclonic flow is present, verify that the absolute 
average angle of the tangential flow does not exceed 20 degrees. If the 
average value exceeds 20 degrees at the sampling location, the flow 
condition in the stack is unacceptable for testing.
    8.1.1.4.2 Alternative procedures, subject to approval of the 
Administrator, e.g., installing straightening vanes to eliminate the 
cyclonic flow, must be implemented prior to conducting the testing.
    8.1.1.5 Stack Gas Moisture Measurements. Not required. Measuring the 
moisture content is optional when a mass emission rate is to be 
calculated.
    8.1.1.5.1 The tester may elect to either measure the actual stack 
gas moisture during the sampling run or utilize a nominal moisture value 
of 2 percent.
    8.1.1.5.2 For additional information on determining sampling train 
moisture, please refer to Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
    8.1.1.6 Stack Temperature Measurements. If a mass emission rate is 
to be calculated, a temperature sensor must be placed either near the 
center of the stack, or attached to the pitot tube as described in 
Section 8.3 of Method 2. Stack temperature measurements,

[[Page 678]]

shall be recorded before and after each test, and an average stack 
temperature determined for the testing period.
    8.1.1.7 Point Sampling Times. Since the sampling rate of the train 
(0.75 cfm) is maintained constant by the critical orifice, it is 
necessary to calculate specific sampling times for each traverse point 
in order to obtain a proportional sample.
    8.1.1.7.1 If the sampling period (3 runs) is to be completed in a 
single day, the point sampling times shall be calculated only once.
    8.1.1.7.2 If the sampling period is to occur over several days, the 
sampling times must be calculated daily using the initial velocity 
pressure data recorded for that day. Determine the average of the 
[Delta]p values obtained during the velocity traverse (Figure 306A-2).
    8.1.1.7.3 If the stack diameter is less than 12 inches, use 7.5 
minutes in place of 5 minutes in the equation and 16 sampling points 
instead of 24 or 25 points. Calculate the sampling times for each 
traverse point using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.579

Where:
n = Sampling point number.
[Delta]p = Average pressure differential across pitot tube, mm 
H<INF>2</INF>O (in. H<INF>2</INF>O).
[Delta]P<INF>avg</INF> = Average of [Delta]p values, mm H<INF>2</INF>O 
(in. H<INF>2</INF>O).

    Note: Convert the decimal fractions for minutes to seconds.

    8.1.1.8 Pretest Preparation. It is recommended, but not required, 
that all items which will be in contact with the sample be cleaned prior 
to performing the testing to avoid possible sample contamination 
(positive chromium bias). These items include, but are not limited to: 
Sampling probe, connecting tubing, impingers, and jar containers.
    8.1.1.8.1 Sample train components should be: (1) Rinsed with hot tap 
water; (2) washed with hot soapy water; (3) rinsed with tap water; (4) 
rinsed with reagent water; (5) soaked in a 10 percent (v/v) nitric acid 
solution for at least four hours; and (6) rinsed throughly with reagent 
water before use.
    8.1.1.8.2 At a minimum, the tester should, rinse the probe, 
connecting tubing, and first and second impingers twice with either 0.1 
N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or 0.1 N sodium bicarbonate 
(NaHCO<INF>3</INF>) and discard the rinse solution.
    8.1.1.8.3 If separate sample shipping containers are to be used, 
these also should be precleaned using the specified cleaning procedures.
    8.1.1.9 Preparation of Sampling Train. Assemble the sampling train 
as shown in Figure 306A-1. Secure the nozzle-liner assembly to the outer 
sheath to prevent movement when sampling.
    8.1.1.9.1 Place 250 mL of 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> 
absorbing solution into the first jar container or impinger. The second 
jar/impinger is to remain empty. Place 6 to 16 mesh indicating silica 
gel, or equivalent desiccant into the third jar/impinger until the 
container is half full ( 300 to 400 g).
    8.1.1.9.2 Place a small cotton ball in the outlet exit tube of the 
third jar to collect small silica gel particles that may dislodge and 
impair the pump and/or gas meter.
    8.1.1.10 Pretest Leak-Check. A pretest leak-check is recommended, 
but not required. If the tester opts to conduct the pretest leak-check, 
the following procedures shall be performed: (1) Place the jar/impinger 
containers into an ice bath and wait 10 minutes for the ice to cool the 
containers before performing the leak check and/or start sampling; (2) 
to perform the leak check, seal the nozzle using a piece of clear 
plastic wrap placed over the end of a finger and switch on the pump; and 
(3) the train system leak rate should not exceed 0.02 cfm at a vacuum of 
380 mm Hg (15 in. Hg) or greater. If the leak rate does exceed the 0.02 
cfm requirement, identify and repair the leak area and perform the leak 
check again.

    Note: Use caution when releasing the vacuum following the leak 
check. Always allow air to slowly flow through the nozzle end of the 
train system while the pump is still operating. Switching off the pump 
with vacuum on the system may result in the silica gel being pulled into 
the second jar container.

    8.1.1.11 Leak-Checks During Sample Run. If, during the sampling run, 
a component (e.g., jar container) exchange becomes necessary, a leak-
check shall be conducted immediately before the component exchange is 
made. The leak-check shall be performed according to the procedure 
outlined in Section 8.1.1.10 of this method. If the leakage rate is 
found to be <= 0.02 cfm at the maximum operating vacuum, the results are 
acceptable. If,

[[Page 679]]

however, a higher leak rate is obtained, either record the leakage rate 
and correct the sample volume as shown in Section 12.3 of Method 5 or 
void the sample and initiate a replacement run. Following the component 
change, leak-checks are optional, but are recommended as are the pretest 
leak-checks.
    8.1.1.12 Post Test Leak Check. Remove the probe assembly and 
flexible tubing from the first jar/impinger container. Seal the inlet 
tube of the first container using clear plastic wrap and switch on the 
pump. The vacuum in the line between the pump and the critical orifice 
must be <ls-thn-eq>=15 in. Hg. Record the vacuum gauge measurement along 
with the leak rate observed on the train system.
    8.1.1.12.1 If the leak rate does not exceed 0.02 cfm, the results 
are acceptable and no sample volume correction is necessary.
    8.1.1.12.2 If, however, a higher leak rate is obtained 
(<ls-thn-eq>0.02 cfm), the tester shall either record the leakage rate 
and correct the sample volume as shown in Section 12.3 of Method 5, or 
void the sampling run and initiate a replacement run. After completing 
the leak-check, slowly release the vacuum at the first container while 
the pump is still operating. Afterwards, switch-off the pump.
    8.1.2 Sample Train Operation.
    8.1.2.1 Data Recording. Record all pertinent process and sampling 
data on the data sheet (see Figure 306A-3). Ensure that the process 
operation is suitable for sample collection.
    8.1.2.2 Starting the Test. Place the probe/nozzle into the duct at 
the first sampling point and switch on the pump. Start the sampling 
using the time interval calculated for the first point. When the first 
point sampling time has been completed, move to the second point and 
continue to sample for the time interval calculated for that point; 
sample each point on the traverse in this manner. Maintain ice around 
the sample containers during the run.
    8.1.2.3 Critical Flow. The sample line between the critical orifice 
and the pump must operate at a vacuum of <ls-thn-eq>= 380 mm Hg 
(<ls-thn-eq>=15 in. Hg) in order for critical flow to be maintained. 
This vacuum must be monitored and documented using the vacuum gauge 
located between the critical orifice and the pump.

    Note: Theoretically, critical flow for air occurs when the ratio of 
the orifice outlet absolute pressure to the orifice inlet absolute 
pressure is less than a factor of 0.53. This means that the system 
vacuum should be at least <ls-thn-eq>= 356 mm Hg (<ls-thn-eq>= 14 in. 
Hg) at sea level and  305 mm Hg ( 12 in. Hg) at higher elevations.

    8.1.2.4 Completion of Test.
    8.1.2.4.1 Circular Stacks. Complete the first port traverse and 
switch off the pump. Testers may opt to perform a leak-check between the 
port changes to verify the leak rate however, this is not mandatory. 
Move the sampling train to the next sampling port and repeat the 
sequence. Be sure to record the final dry gas meter reading after 
completing the test run. After performing the post test leak check, 
disconnect the jar/impinger containers from the pump and meter assembly 
and transport the probe, connecting tubing, and containers to the sample 
recovery area.
    8.1.2.4.2 Rectangle Stacks. Complete each port traverse as per the 
instructions provided in 8.1.2.4.1.

    Note: If an approximate mass emission rate is to be calculated, 
measure and record the stack velocity pressure and temperature before 
and after the test run.

    8.2 Sample Recovery. After the train has been transferred to the 
sample recovery area, disconnect the tubing that connects the jar/
impingers. The tester shall select either the total Cr or 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> sample recovery option. Samples to be analyzed for both 
total Cr and Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> shall be recovered using the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> sample option (Section 8.2.2).

    Note: Collect a reagent blank sample for each of the total Cr or the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> analytical options. If both analyses (Cr and 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>) are to be conducted on the samples, collect separate 
reagent blanks for each analysis.

    8.2.1 Total Cr Sample Option.
    8.2.1.1 Shipping Container No. 1. The first jar container may either 
be used to store and transport the sample, or if GS impingers are used, 
samples may be stored and shipped in precleaned 250-mL, 500-mL or 1000-
mL polyethylene or glass bottles with leak-free, non-metal screw caps.
    8.2.1.1.1 Unscrew the lid from the first jar/impinger container.
    8.2.1.1.2 Lift the inner tube assembly almost out of the container, 
and using the wash bottle containing fresh absorbing solution, rinse the 
outside of the tube that was immersed in the container solution; rinse 
the inside of the tube as well, by rinsing twice from the top of the 
tube down through the inner tube into the container.
    8.2.1.2 Recover the contents of the second jar/impinger container by 
removing the lid and pouring any contents into the first shipping 
container.
    8.2.1.2.1 Rinse twice, using fresh absorbing solution, the inner 
walls of the second container including the inside and outside of the 
inner tube.
    8.2.1.2.2 Rinse the connecting tubing between the first and second 
sample containers with absorbing solution and place the rinses into the 
first container.
    8.2.1.3 Position the nozzle, probe and connecting plastic tubing in 
a vertical position so that the tubing forms a ``U''.
    8.2.1.3.1 Using the wash bottle, partially fill the tubing with 
fresh absorbing solution. Raise and lower the end of the plastic tubing

[[Page 680]]

several times to allow the solution to contact the internal surfaces. Do 
not allow the solution to overflow or part of the sample will be lost. 
Place the nozzle end of the probe over the mouth of the first container 
and elevate the plastic tubing so that the solution flows into the 
sample container.
    8.2.1.3.2 Repeat the probe/tubing sample recovery procedure but 
allow the solution to flow out the opposite end of the plastic tubing 
into the sample container. Repeat the entire sample recovery procedure 
once again.
    8.2.1.4 Use approximately 200 to 300 mL of the 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N 
NaHCO<INF>3</INF> absorbing solution during the rinsing of the probe 
nozzle, probe liner, sample containers, and connecting tubing.
    8.2.1.5 Place a piece of clear plastic wrap over the mouth of the 
sample jar to seal the shipping container. Use a standard lid and band 
assembly to seal and secure the sample in the jar.
    8.2.1.5.1 Label the jar clearly to identify its contents, sample

emission sample.
    8.2.2.2 After measuring the pH of the first container, follow sample 
recovery procedures described in Sections 8.2.1.1 through 8.2.1.5.

    Note: Since particulate matter is not usually present at chromium 
electroplating and/or chromium anodizing facilities, it is not necessary 
to filter the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> samples unless there is observed sediment 
in the collected solutions. If it is necessary to filter the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> solutions, please refer to the EPA Method 0061,

Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> must be analyzed within 14 days of collection.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Same as Method 306, Section 9.0.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Tester shall maintain a performance log of all calibration 
results.

    10.1 Pitot Tube. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be calibrated 
according to the procedures outlined in Section 10.1 of Method 2.
    10.2 Temperature Sensor. Use the procedure in Section 10.3 of Method 
2 to calibrate the in-stack temperature sensor.
    10.3 Metering System.
    10.3.1 Sample Train Dry Gas Meter Calibration. Calibrations may be 
performed as described in Section 16.2 of Method 5 by either the 
manufacturer, a firm who provides calibration services, or the tester.
    10.3.2 Dry Gas Meter Calibration Coefficient (Y<INF>m</INF>). The 
meter calibration coefficient (Y<INF>m</INF>) must be determined prior 
to the initial use of the meter, and following each field test program. 
If the dry gas meter is new, the manufacturer will have specified the 
Y<INF>m</INF> value for the meter. This Y<INF>m</INF> value can be used 
as the pretest value for the first test. For subsequent tests, the 
tester must use the Y<INF>m</INF> value established during the pretest 
calibration.
    10.3.3 Calibration Orifice. The manufacturer may have included a 
calibration orifice and a summary spreadsheet with the meter that may be 
used for calibration purposes. The spreadsheet will provide data 
necessary to determine the calibration for the orifice and meter 
(standard cubic feet volume, sample time, etc.). These data were 
produced when the initial Y<INF>m</INF> value was determined for the 
meter.

[[Page 681]]

    10.3.4 Y<INF>m</INF> Meter Value Verification or Meter Calibration.
    10.3.4.1 The Y<INF>m</INF> meter value may be determined by 
replacing the sampling train critical orifice with the calibration 
orifice. Replace the critical orifice assembly by installing the 
calibration orifice in the same location. The inlet side of the 
calibration orifice is to be left open to the atmosphere and is not to 
be reconnected to the sample train during the calibration procedure.
    10.3.4.2 If the vacuum pump is cold, switch on the pump and allow it 
to operate (become warm) for several minutes prior to starting the 
calibration. After stopping the pump, record the initial dry gas meter 
volume and meter temperature.
    10.3.4.3 Perform the calibration for the number of minutes specified 
by the manufacturer's data sheet (usually 5 minutes). Stop the pump and 
record the final dry gas meter volume and temperature. Subtract the 
start volume from the stop volume to obtain the V<INF>m</INF> and 
average the meter temperatures (t<INF>m</INF>).
    10.3.5 Y<INF>m</INF> Value Calculation. Y<INF>m</INF> is the 
calculated value for the dry gas meter. Calculate Y<INF>m</INF> using 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.580

Where:

P<INF>bar</INF> = Barometric pressure at meter, mm Hg, (in. Hg).
P<INF>std</INF> = Standard absolute pressure,
Metric = 760 mm Hg.
English = 29.92 in. Hg.
t<INF>m</INF> = Average dry gas meter temperature, [deg]C, ([deg]F).
T<INF>m</INF> = Absolute average dry gas meter temperature,
Metric [deg]K = 273 + tm ([deg]C).
English [deg]R = 460 + t<INF>m</INF>([deg]F).
T<INF>std</INF> = Standard absolute temperature,
Metric = 293 [deg]K.
English = 528 [deg]R.
V<INF>m</INF> = Volume of gas sample as measured (actual) by dry gas 
meter, dcm,(dcf).
V<INF>m(std),mfg</INF> = Volume of gas sample measured by manufacture's 
calibrated orifice and dry gas meter, corrected to standard conditions 
(pressure/temperature) dscm (dscf).
Y<INF>m</INF> = Dry gas meter calibration factor, (dimensionless).

    10.3.6 Y<INF>m</INF> Comparison. Compare the Y<INF>m</INF> value 
provided by the manufacturer (Section 10.3.3) or the pretest 
Y<INF>m</INF> value to the post test Y<INF>m</INF> value using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.581

    10.3.6.1 If this ratio is between 0.95 and 1.05, the designated 
Y<INF>m</INF> value for the meter is acceptable for use in later 
calculations.
    10.3.6.1.1 If the value is outside the specified range, the test 
series shall either be: 1) voided and the samples discarded; or 2) 
calculations for the test series shall be conducted using whichever 
meter coefficient value (i.e., manufacturers's/pretest Y<INF>m</INF> 
value or post test Y<INF>m</INF> value) produces the lowest sample 
volume.
    10.3.6.1.2 If the post test dry gas meter Y<INF>m</INF> value 
differs by more than 5% as compared to the pretest value, either perform 
the calibration again to determine acceptability or return the meter to 
the manufacturer for recalibration.
    10.3.6.1.3 The calibration may also be conducted as specified in 
Section 10.3 or Section 16.0 of Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), 
except that it is only necessary to check the calibration at one flow 
rate of  0.75 cfm.
    10.3.6.1.4 The calibration of the dry gas meter must be verified 
after each field test program using the same procedures.

    Note: The tester may elect to use the Y<INF>m</INF> post test value 
for the next pretest Y<INF>m</INF> value; e.g., Test 1 post test 
Y<INF>m</INF> value and Test 2 pretest Y<INF>m</INF> value would be the 
same.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Range. The recommended working range for all of the three 
analytical techniques starts at five times the analytical detection 
limit (see also Method 306, Section 13.2.2). The upper limit of all 
three techniques can be extended indefinitely by appropriate dilution.
    13.2 Sensitivity.
    13.2.1 Analytical Sensitivity. The estimated instrumental detection 
limits listed are provided as a guide for an instrumental limit. The 
actual method detection limits

[[Page 685]]

are sample and instrument dependent and may vary as the sample matrix 
varies.
    13.2.1.1 ICP Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated detection 
limits for ICP, as reported in Method 6010A and the recently revised 
Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), are 7.0 [micro]g Cr/L and 4.7 
[micro]g Cr/L, respectively.
    13.2.1.2 GFAAS Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated 
detection limit for GFAAS, as reported in Methods 7000A and 7191 of SW-
846 (Reference 1), is 1.0 [micro]g Cr/L.
    13.2.1.3 IC/PCR Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum detection limit 
for IC/PCR with a preconcentrator, as reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 
of SW-846 (Reference 1), is 0.05 [micro]g Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/L.
    13.2.2 In-stack Sensitivity. The in-stack sensitivity depends upon 
the analytical detection limit, the volume of stack gas sampled, and the 
total volume of the impinger absorbing solution plus the rinses. Using 
the analytical detection limits given in Sections 13.2.1.1, 13.2.1.2, 
and 13.2.1.3; a stack gas sample volume of 1.7 dscm; and a total liquid 
sample volume of 500 mL; the corresponding in-stack detection limits are 
0.0014 mg Cr/dscm to 0.0021 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00029 mg Cr/dscm for 
GFAAS, and 0.000015 mg Cr<SUP>+36</SUP>/dscm for IC/PCR with 
preconcentration.

    Note: It is recommended that the concentration of Cr in the 
analytical solutions be at least five times the analytical detection 
limit to optimize sensitivity in the analyses. Using this guideline and 
the same assumptions for impinger sample volume and stack gas sample 
volume (500 mL and 1.7 dscm, respectively), the recommended minimum 
stack concentrations for optimum sensitivity are 0.0068 mg Cr/dscm to 
0.0103 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.0015 mg Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000074 mg 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> dscm for IC/PCR with preconcentration. If required, the 
in-stack detection limits can be improved by either increasing the 
sampling time, the stack gas sample volume, reducing the volume of the 
digested sample for GFAAS, improving the analytical detection limits, or 
any combination of the three.

    13.3 Precision.
    13.3.1 The following precision data have been reported for the three 
analytical methods. In each case, when the sampling precision is 
combined with the reported analytical precision, the resulting overall 
precision may decrease.
    13.3.2 Bias data is also reported for GFAAS.
    13.4 ICP Precision.
    13.4.1 As reported in Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), in an 
EPA round-robin Phase 1 study, seven laboratories applied the ICP 
technique to acid/distilled water matrices that had been spiked with 
various metal concentrates. For true values of 10, 50, and 150 [micro]g 
Cr/L; the mean reported values were 10, 50, and 149 [micro]g Cr/L; and 
the mean percent relative standard deviations were 18, 3.3, and 3.8 
percent, respectively.
    13.4.2 In another multilaboratory study cited in Method 6010B, a 
mean relative standard of 8.2 percent was reported for an aqueous sample 
concentration of approximately 3750 [micro]g Cr/L.
    13.5 GFAAS Precision. As reported in Method 7191 of SW-846 
(Reference 1), in a single laboratory (EMSL), using Cincinnati, Ohio tap 
water spiked at concentrations of 19, 48, and 77 [micro]g Cr/L, the 
standard deviations were <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1, <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.2, and <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.8, respectively. 
Recoveries at these levels were 97 percent, 101 percent, and 102 
percent, respectively.
    13.6 IC/PCR Precision. As reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 of SW-
846 (Reference 1), the precision of IC/PCR with sample preconcentration 
is 5 to 10 percent; the overall precision for sewage sludge incinerators 
emitting 120 ng/dscm of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and 3.5 [micro]g/dscm of total 
Cr is 25 percent and 9 percent, respectively; and for hazardous waste 
incinerators emitting 300 ng/dscm of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> the precision is 20 
percent.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 The only materials used in this method that could be considered 
pollutants are the chromium standards used for instrument calibration 
and acids used in the cleaning of the collection and measurement 
containers/labware, in the preparation of standards, and in the acid 
digestion of samples. Both reagents can be stored in the same waste 
container.
    14.2 Cleaning solutions containing acids should be prepared in 
volumes consistent with use to minimize the disposal of excessive 
volumes of acid.
    14.3 To the extent possible, the containers/vessels used to collect 
and prepare samples should be cleaned and reused to minimize the 
generation of solid waste.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 It is the responsibility of the laboratory and the sampling 
team to comply with all federal, state, and local regulations governing 
waste management, particularly the discharge regulations, hazardous 
waste identification rules, and land disposal restrictions; and to 
protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all 
releases from field operations.
    15.2 For further information on waste management, consult The Waste 
Management Manual for Laboratory Personnel and Less is Better-Laboratory 
Chemical Management for Waste Reduction, available from the American 
Chemical Society's Department of Government Relations and Science 
Policy, 1155 16th Street NW, Washington, DC 20036.

 Method 306B--Surface Tension Measurement for Tanks Used at Decorative 
        Chromium Electroplating and Chromium Anodizing Facilities

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A and in this part. 
Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should 
have a thorough knowledge of at least Methods 5 and 306.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analyte. Not applicable.
    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable to all decorative 
chromium plating and

[[Page 690]]

chromium anodizing operations, and continuous chromium plating at iron 
and steel facilities where a wetting agent is used in the tank as the 
primary mechanism for reducing emissions from the surface of the plating 
solution.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 During an electroplating or anodizing operation, gas bubbles 
generated during the process rise to the surface of the liquid and 
burst. Upon bursting, tiny droplets of chromic acid become entrained in 
ambient air. The addition of a wetting agent to the tank bath reduces 
the surface tension of the liquid and diminishes the formation of these 
droplets.
    2.2 This method determines the surface tension of the bath using a 
stalagmometer or a tensiometer to confirm that there is sufficient

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Procedure. The surface tension of the tank bath may be measured 
by using a tensiometer, a stalagmometer or any other equivalent surface 
tension measuring device approved by the Administrator for measuring 
surface tension in dynes per centimeter. If the tensiometer is used, the 
procedures specified in ASTM Method D 1331-89 must be followed. If a 
stalagmometer or other device is used to measure surface tension, the 
instructions provided with the measuring device must be followed.
    11.2 Frequency of Measurements.
    11.2.1 Measurements of the bath surface tension are performed using 
a progressive system which decreases the frequency of surface tension 
measurements required when the proper surface tension is maintained.
    11.2.1.1 Initially, following the compliance date, surface tension 
measurements must be conducted once every 4 hours of tank operation for 
the first 40 hours of tank operation.
    11.2.1.2 Once there are no exceedances during a period of 40 hours 
of tank operation, measurements may be conducted once every 8 hours of 
tank operation.
    11.2.1.3 Once there are no exceedances during a second period of 40 
consecutive hours of tank operation, measurements may be conducted once 
every 40 hours of tank operation on an on-going basis, until an 
exceedance occurs. The maximum time interval for measurements is once 
every 40 hours of tank operation.
    11.2.2 If a measurement of the surface tension of the solution is 
above the 45 dynes per centimeter limit, or above an alternate surface 
tension limit established during the performance test, the time interval 
shall revert back to the original monitoring schedule of once every 4 
hours. A subsequent decrease in frequency would then be allowed 
according to Section 11.2.1.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Log Book of Surface Tension Measurements and Fume Suppressant 
Additions.
    12.1.1 The surface tension of the plating or anodizing tank bath 
must be measured as specified in Section 11.2.
    12.1.2 The measurements must be recorded in the log book. In 
addition to the record of surface tension measurements, the frequency of 
fume suppressant maintenance additions and the amount of fume 
suppressant added during each maintenance addition must be recorded in 
the log book.
    12.1.3 The log book will be readily available for inspection by 
regulatory personnel.
    12.2 Instructions for Apparatus Used in Measuring Surface Tension.
    12.2.1 Included with the log book must be a copy of the instructions 
for the apparatus used for measuring the surface tension of the plating 
or anodizing bath.

 Method 307--Determination of Emissions From Halogenated Solvent Vapor 
            Cleaning Machines Using a Liquid Level Procedure

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable to the determination of 
the halogenated solvent emissions from solvent vapor cleaners in the 
idling mode.
    1.2 Principle. The solvent level in the solvent cleaning machine is 
measured using inclined liquid level indicators. The change in liquid 
level corresponds directly to the amount of solvent lost from the 
solvent cleaning machine.

                              2. Apparatus

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.

    2.1 Inclined Liquid Level Indicator. A schematic of the inclined 
liquid level indicators used in this method is shown in figure 307-1; 
two inclined liquid level indicators having 0.05 centimeters divisions 
or smaller shall be used. The liquid level indicators shall be made of 
glass, Teflon, or any similar material that will not react with the 
solvent being used. A 6-inch by 1-inch slope is recommended; however the 
slope may vary depending on the size and design of the solvent cleaning 
machine.

    Note: It is important that the inclined liquid level indicators be 
constructed with ease of reading in mind. The inclined liquid level 
indicators should also be mounted so that they can be raised or lowered 
if necessary to suit the solvent cleaning machine size.

    2.2 Horizontal Indicator. Device to check the inclined liquid level 
indicators orientation relative to horizontal.
    2.3 Velocity Meter. Hotwire and vane anemometers, or other devices 
capable of measuring the flow rates ranging from 0 to 15.2 meters per 
minute across the solvent cleaning machine.

                              3. Procedure

    3.1 Connection of the Inclined Liquid Level Indicator. Connect one 
of the inclined liquid level indicators to the boiling sump drain and 
the other inclined liquid level indicator to the immersion sump drain 
using Teflon tubing and the appropriate fittings. A schematic diagram is 
shown in figure 307-2.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.076

    3.2 Positioning of Velocity Meter. Position the velocity meter so 
that it measures the flow rate of the air passing directly across the 
solvent cleaning machine.
    3.3 Level the Inclined Liquid Level Indicators.
    3.4 Initial Inclined Liquid Level Indicator Readings. Open the sump 
drainage valves. Allow the solvent cleaning machine to operate long 
enough for the vapor zone to form and the system to stabilize (check 
with manufacturer). Record the inclined liquid level indicators readings 
and the starting time on the data sheet. A sample data sheet is provided 
in figure 307-3.

    1.1 Analyte. Methanol. Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) No. 67-56-1.
    1.2 Applicability. This method applies to the measurement of 
methanol emissions from specified stationary sources.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    A gas sample is extracted from the sampling point in the stack. The 
methanol is collected in deionized distilled water and adsorbed on 
silica gel. The sample is returned to the laboratory where the methanol 
in the water fraction is separated from other organic compounds with a 
gas chromatograph (GC) and is then measured by a flame ionization 
detector (FID). The fraction adsorbed on silica gel is extracted with an 
aqueous solution of n-propanol and is then separated and measured by GC/
FID.

water around the impinger.

[[Page 695]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15AP98.014

    8.1.2 Leak Check. A leak check prior to the sampling run is 
optional; however, a leak check after the sampling run is mandatory. The 
leak-check procedure is as follows:
    Temporarily attach a suitable (e.g., 0-to 40-ml/min) rotameter to 
the outlet of the DGM, and place a vacuum gauge at or near the probe 
inlet. Plug the probe inlet, pull a vacuum of at least 250 mm (10 inch) 
Hg, and note the flow rate as indicated by the rotameter. A leakage rate 
not in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate is acceptable.

    Note: Carefully release the probe inlet plug before turning off the 
pump.

    8.1.3 Sample Collection. Record the initial DGM reading and 
barometric pressure. To begin sampling, position the tip of the Teflon 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP> tubing at the sampling point, connect the tubing to the 
impinger, and start the pump. Adjust the sample flow to a constant rate 
between 200 and 1000 ml/min as indicated by the rotameter. Maintain this 
constant rate (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent) during the entire 
sampling run. Take readings (DGM, temperatures at DGM and at impinger 
outlet, and rate meter) at least every 5 minutes. Add more ice during 
the run to keep the temperature of the gases leaving the last impinger 
at 20 [deg]C (68 [deg]F) or less. At the conclusion of each run,

[[Page 696]]

turn off the pump, remove the Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> tubing from the 
stack, and record the final readings. Conduct a leak check as in section 
8.1.2. (This leak check is mandatory.) If a leak is found, void the test 
run or use procedures acceptable to the Administrator to adjust the 
sample volume for the leakage.
    8.2 Sample Recovery. The following items are required for sample 
recovery:
    8.2.1 Impinger. Disconnect the impinger. Pour the contents of the 
midget impinger into a graduated cylinder. Rinse the midget impinger and 
the connecting tubes with water, and add the rinses to the graduated 
cylinder. Record the sample volume. Transfer the sample to a glass vial 
and cap with a Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> septum. Discard any excess 
sample. Place the samples in an ice chest for shipment to the 
laboratory.
    8.2.2. Adsorbent Tubes. Seal the silica gel adsorbent tubes and 
place them in an ice chest for shipment to the laboratory.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Miscellaneous Quality Control Measures. The following quality

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Metering System. The following items are required for the 
metering system:
    10.1.1 Initial Calibration.
    10.1.1.1 Before its initial use in the field, first leak-check the 
metering system (drying tube, needle valve, pump, rotameter, and DGM) as 
follows: Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to the drying tube, and pull 
a vacuum of 250 mm (10 inch) Hg; plug or pinch off the outlet of the 
flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum shall remain stable 
for at least 30 seconds. Carefully release the vacuum gauge before 
releasing the flow meter end.
    10.1.1.2 Next, remove the drying tube, and calibrate the metering 
system (at the sampling flow rate specified by the method) as follows: 
Connect an appropriately sized wet test meter (e.g., 1 liter per 
revolution (0.035 cubic feet per revolution)) to the inlet of the drying 
tube. Make three independent calibrations runs, using at least five 
revolutions of the DGM per run. Calculate the calibration factor, Y (wet 
test meter calibration volume divided by the DGM volume, both volumes 
adjusted to the same reference temperature and pressure), for each run, 
and average the results. If any Y-value deviates by more than 2 percent 
from the average, the metering system is unacceptable for use. 
Otherwise, use the average as the calibration factor for subsequent test 
runs.
    10.1.2 Posttest Calibration Check. After each field test series, 
conduct a calibration check as in section 10.1.1 above, except for the 
following variations: (a) The leak check is not to be conducted, (b) 
three, or more revolutions of the DGM may be used, and (c) only two 
independent runs need be made. If the calibration factor does not 
deviate by more than 5 percent from the initial calibration factor 
(determined in section 10.1.1), then the DGM volumes obtained during the 
test series are acceptable. If the calibration factor deviates by more 
than 5 percent, recalibrate the metering system as in section 10.1.1, 
and for the calculations, use the calibration factor (initial or 
recalibration) that yields the lower gas volume for each test run.
    10.1.3 Temperature Sensors. Calibrate against mercury-in-glass 
thermometers.
    10.1.4 Rotameter. The rotameter need not be calibrated, but should 
be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer's instruction.
    10.1.5 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer.
    10.2 Gas Chromatograph. The following procedures are required for 
the gas chromatograph:
    10.2.1 Initial Calibration. Inject 1 [micro]l of each of the 
standards prepared in sections 7.2.3.3 and 7.2.3.4 into the GC and 
record the response. Repeat the injections for each standard until two 
successive injections agree within 5 percent. Using the mean response 
for each calibration standard, prepare a linear least squares equation 
relating the response to the mass of methanol in the sample. Perform the 
calibration before analyzing each set of samples.
    10.2.2 Continuing Calibration. At the beginning of each day, analyze 
the mid level calibration standard as described in section 10.5.1. The 
response from the daily analysis must agree with the response from the 
initial calibration within 10 percent. If it does not, the initial 
calibration must be repeated.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Gas Chromatograph Operating Conditions. The following operating 
conditions are required for the GC:
    11.1.1 Injector. Configured for capillary column, splitless, 200 
[deg]C (392 [deg]F).
    11.1.2 Carrier. Helium at 10 ml/min.
    11.1.3 Oven. Initially at 45 [deg]C for 3 minutes; then raise by 10 
[deg]C to 70 [deg]C; then raise by 70 [deg]C/min to 200 [deg]C.
    11.2 Impinger Sample. Inject 1 [micro]l of the stored sample into 
the GC. Repeat the injection and average the results. If the sample 
response is above that of the highest calibration standard, either 
dilute the sample until

[[Page 697]]

it is in the measurement range of the calibration line or prepare 
additional calibration standards. If the sample response is below that 
of the lowest calibration standard, prepare additional calibration 
standards. If additional calibration standards are prepared, there shall 
be at least two that bracket the response of the sample. These standards 
should produce approximately 50 percent and 150 percent of the response 
of the sample.
    11.3 Silica Gel Adsorbent Sample. The following items are required 
for the silica gel adsorbent samples:
    11.3.1 Preparation of Samples. Extract the front and backup sections 
of the adsorbent tube separately. With a file, score the glass adsorbent 
tube in front of the first section of silica gel. Break the tube open. 
Remove and discard the glass wool. Transfer the first section of the 
silica gel to a 5-ml glass vial and stopper the vial. Remove the spacer 
between the first and second section of the adsorbent tube and discard 
it. Transfer the second section of silica gel to a separate 5-ml glass 
vial and stopper the vial.
    11.3.2 Desorption of Samples. Add 3 ml of the 10 percent n-propanol 
solution to each of the stoppered vials and shake or vibrate the vials 
for 30 minutes.
    11.3.3 Inject a 1-[micro]l aliquot of the diluted sample from each 
vial into the GC. Repeat the injection and average the results. If the 
sample response is above that of the highest calibration standard, 
either dilute the sample until it is in the measurement range of the 
calibration line or prepare additional calibration standards. If the 
sample response is below that of the lowest calibration standard, 
prepare additional calibration standards. If additional calibration 
standards are prepared, there shall be at least two that bracket the 
response of the sample. These standards should produce approximately 50 
percent and 150 percent of the response of the sample.

    1.1 Data Quality Objectives:
    In the production of ethylene-propylene terpolymer crumb rubber, the 
polymer is recovered from solution by flashing off the solvent with 
steam and hot water. The resulting water-crumb slurry is then pumped to 
the finishing units. Certain amounts of solvent (hexane being the most 
commonly used solvent) and diene monomer remain in the crumb. The 
analyst uses the following procedure to determine those amounts.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 The crumb rubber sample is dissolved in toluene to which heptane 
has been added as an internal standard. Acetone is then added to this 
solution to precipitate the crumb, and the supernatant is analyzed for 
hexane and diene by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization 
detector (FID).

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Included in text as needed.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 None known.
    4.2 Benzene, introduced as a contaminant in the toluene solvent, 
elutes between methyl cyclopentane and cyclohexane. However, the benzene 
peak is completely resolved.
    4.3 2,2-dimethyl pentane, a minor component of the hexane used in 
our process, elutes just prior to methyl cyclopentane. It is included as 
``hexane'' in the analysis whether it is integrated separately or 
included in the methyl cyclopentane peak.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 This procedure does not purport to address all of the safety 
concerns associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this procedure to establish appropriate safety and health practices 
and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
    5.2 Chemicals used in this analysis are flammable and hazardous (see 
specific toxicity information below). Avoid contact with sources of 
ignition during sample prep. All handling should be done beneath a hood. 
Playtex or nitrile gloves recommended.
    5.3 Hexane is toxic by ingestion and inhalation. Vapor inhalation 
causes irritation of nasal and respiratory passages, headache, 
dizziness, nausea, central nervous system depression. Chronic 
overexposure can cause severe nerve damage. May cause irritation on 
contact with skin or eyes. May cause damage to kidneys.
    5.4 Termonomer may be harmful by inhalation, ingestion, or skin 
absorption. Vapor or mist is irritating to the eyes, mucous membranes, 
and upper respiratory tract. Causes skin irritation.
    5.5 Toluene is harmful or fatal if swallowed. Vapor harmful if 
inhaled. Symptoms: headache, dizziness, hallucinations, distorted 
perceptions, changes in motor activity, nausea, diarrhea, respiratory 
irritation, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, liver, 
kidney and lung damage. Contact can cause severe eye irritation. May 
cause skin irritation. Causes irritation of eyes, nose, and throat.
    5.6 Acetone, at high concentrations or prolonged overexposure, may 
cause headache, dizziness, irritation of eyes and respiratory tract, 
loss of strength, and narcosis. Eye contact causes severe irritation; 
skin contact may cause mild irritation. Concentrations of 20,000 ppm are 
immediately dangerous to life and health.
    5.7 Heptane is harmful if inhaled or swallowed. May be harmful if 
absorbed through the skin. Vapor or mist is irritating to the eyes, 
mucous membranes, and upper respiratory tract. Prolonged or repeated 
exposure to skin causes defatting and dermatitis.
    5.8 The steam oven used to dry the polymer in this procedure is set 
at 110 [deg]C. Wear leather gloves when removing bottles from the oven.

    7.5.6 Purity Check: Analyze according to section 11.2. NOTE: You 
must ``precipitate'' the sample with an equal part of acetone (thus 
duplicating actual test conditions--see section 11.1 of this method, 
sample prep) before analyzing. Analyze the reagent 3 times to quantify 
the C<INF>6</INF> and termonomer interferences. Inspect the results to 
ensure good agreement among the three runs (within 10%).
    7.5.7 Tag the bottle with the following information:

     POLYMER DISSOLVING SOLUTION FOR C<INF>6</INF> IN CRUMB ANALYSIS
     PREPARER'S NAME
     DATE
     CALS FILE ID'S OF THE THREE ANALYSES FOR PURITY (from section 7.5.6 
of this method)

    7.6 Quality Control Solution: the quality control solution is 
prepared by adding specific amounts of mixed hexanes (barge hexane), n-
nonane and termonomer to some polymer dissolving solution. Nonane elutes 
in the same approximate time region as termonomer and is used to 
quantify in that region because it has a longer shelf life.

[[Page 702]]

Termonomer, having a high tendency to polymerize, is used in the QC 
solution only to ensure that both termonomer isomers elute at the proper 
time.
    First, a concentrated stock solution is prepared; the final QC 
solution can then be prepared by diluting the stock solution.
    7.6.1 In preparation of stock solution, fill a 1-liter volumetric 
flask partially with polymer dissolving solution (PDS)--see section 7.5 
of this method. Add 20.0 ml barge hexane, 5.0 ml n-nonane, and 3 ml 
termonomer. Finish filling the volumetric to the mark with PDS.
    7.6.2 In preparation of quality control solution, dilute the quality 
control stock solution (above) precisely 1:10 with PDS, i.e. 10 ml of 
stock solution made up to 100 ml (volumetric flask) with PDS. Pour the 
solution into a 4 oz. Boston round bottle and store in the refrigerator.

             8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1 Line up facility to catch crumb samples. The facility is a 
special facility where the sample is drawn.
    8.1.1 Ensure that the cock valve beneath facility is closed.
    8.1.2 Line up the system from the slurry line cock valve to the cock 
valve at the nozzle on the stripper.
    8.1.3 Allow the system to flush through facility for a period of 30 
seconds.
    8.2 Catch a slurry crumb sample.
    8.2.1 Simultaneously close the cock valves upstream and downstream 
of facility.
    8.2.2 Close the cock valve beneath the slurry line in service.
    8.2.3 Line up the cooling tower water through the sample bomb water 
jacket to the sewer for a minimum of 30 minutes.
    8.2.4 Place the sample catching basket beneath facility and open the 
cock valve underneath the bomb to retrieve the rubber crumb.
    8.2.5 If no rubber falls by gravity into the basket, line up 
nitrogen to the bleeder upstream of the sample bomb and force the rubber 
into the basket.
    8.2.6 Close the cock valve underneath the sample bomb.
    8.3 Fill a plastic ``Whirl-pak'' sample bag with slurry crumb and 
send it to the lab immediately.
    8.4 Once the sample reaches the lab, it should be prepped as soon as 
possible to avoid hexane loss through evaporation. Samples which have 
lain untouched for more than 30 minutes should be discarded.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    Quality control is monitored via a computer program that tracks 
analyses of a prepared QC sample (from section 7.6.2 of this method). 
The QC sample result is entered daily into the program, which plots the 
result as a data point on a statistical chart. If the data point does 
not satisfy the ``in-control'' criteria (as defined by the lab quality 
facilitator), an ``out-of-control'' flag appears, mandating corrective 
action.
    In addition, the area of the n-heptane peak is monitored so that any 
errors in making up the polymer dissolving solution will be caught and 
corrected. Refer to section 12.4 of this method.

    9.1 Fill an autosampler vial with the quality control solution (from 
section 7.6.2 of this method) and analyze on the GC as normal (per 
section 11 of this method).
    9.2 Add the concentrations of the 5 hexane isomers as they appear on 
the CALS printout. Also include the 2,2-dimethyl-pentane peak just ahead 
of the methyl cyclopentane (the fourth major isomer) peak in the event 
that the peak integration split this peak out. Do not include the 
benzene peak in the sum. Note the nonane concentration. Record both 
results (total hexane and nonane) in the QC computer program. If out of 
control, and GC appears to be functioning within normal parameters, 
reanalyze a fresh control sample. If the fresh QC is not in control, 
check stock solution for contaminants or make up a new QC sample with 
the toluene currently in use. If instrument remains out-of-control, more 
thorough GC troubleshooting may be needed.
    Also, verify that the instrument has detected both isomers of 
termonomer (quantification not necessary--see section 7.0 of this 
method).
    9.3 Recovery efficiency must be determined for high ethylene 
concentration, low ethylene concentration, E-P terpolymer, or oil 
extended samples and whenever modifications are made to the method. 
Recovery shall be between 70 and 130 percent. All test results must be 
corrected by the recovery efficiency value (R).
    9.3.1 Approximately 10 grams of wet EPDM crumb (equivalent to about 
5 grams of dry rubber) shall be added to six sample bottles containing 
100 ml of hexane in crumb polymer dissolving solution (toluene 
containing 0.3 gram n-heptane/100 ml solution). The polymer shall be 
dissolved by agitating the bottles on a shaker for 4 hours. The polymer 
shall be precipitated using 100 ml acetone.
    9.3.2 The supernatant liquid shall be decanted from the polymer. 
Care shall be taken to remove as much of the liquid phase from the 
sample as possible to minimize the effect of retained liquid phase upon 
the next cycle of the analysis. The supernatant liquid shall be analyzed 
by gas chromatography using an internal standard quantitation method 
with heptane as the internal standard.
    9.3.3 The precipitated polymer from the steps described above shall 
be redissolved using toluene as the solvent. No heptane shall be added 
to the sample in the second

[[Page 703]]

dissolving step. The toluene solvent and acetone precipitant shall be 
determined to be free of interfering compounds.
    9.3.4 The rubber which was dissolved in the toluene shall be 
precipitated with acetone as before, and the supernatant liquid decanted 
from the precipitated polymer. The liquid shall be analyzed by gas 
chromatography and the rubber phase dried in a steam-oven to determine 
the final polymer weight.
    9.3.5 The ratios of the areas of the hexane peaks and of the heptane 
internal standard peak shall be calculated for each of the six samples 
in the two analysis cycles outlined above. The area ratios of the total 
hexane to heptane (R1) shall be determined for the two analysis cycles 
of the sample set. The ratio of the values of R1 from the second 
analysis cycle to the first cycle shall be determined to give a second 
ratio (R2).

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    The procedure for preparing a Quality Control sample with the 
internal standard in it is outlined in section 7.6 of this method.

    10.1 The relative FID response factors for n-heptane, the internal 
standard, versus the various hexane isomers and termonomer are 
relatively constant and should seldom need to be altered. However 
Baseline construction is a most critical factor in the production of 
good data. For this reason, close attention should be paid to peak 
integration. Procedures for handling peak integration will depend upon 
the data system used.
    10.2 If recalibration of the analysis is needed, make up a 
calibration blend of the internal standard and the analytes as detailed 
below and analyze it using the analytical method used for the samples.
    10.2.1 Weigh 5 g heptane into a tared scintillation vial to five 
places.
    10.2.2 Add 0.2 ml termonomer to the vial and reweigh.
    10.2.3 Add 0.5 ml hexane to the vial and reweigh.
    10.2.4 Cap, and shake vigorously to mix.
    10.2.5 Calculate the weights of termonomer and of hexane added and 
divide their weights by the weight of the n-heptane added. The result is 
the known of given value for the calibration.
    10.2.6 Add 0.4 ml of this mixture to a mixture of 100 ml toluene and 
100 ml of acetone. Cap and shake vigorously to mix.
    10.2.7 Analyze the sample.
    10.2.8 Divide the termonomer area and the total areas of the hexane 
peaks by the n-heptane area. This result is the ``found'' value for the 
calibration.
    10.2.9 Divide the appropriate ``known'' value from 10.2.5 by the 
found value from 10.2.8. The result is the response factor for the 
analyte in question. Previous work has shown that the standard deviation 
of the calibration method is about 1% relative.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION
    11.1.1 Tare an 8oz sample bottle--Tag attached, cap off; record 
weight and sample ID on tag in pencil.
    11.1.2 Place crumb sample in bottle: RLA-3: 10 g (gives a dry wt. of 
5.5 g).
    11.1.3 Dispense 100ml of PDS into each bottle. SAMPLE SHOULD BE 
PLACED INTO SOLUTION ASAP TO AVOID HEXANE LOSS--Using ``Dispensette'' 
pipettor. Before dispensing, ``purge'' the dispensette (25% of its 
volume) into a waste bottle to eliminate any voids.
    11.1.4 Tightly cap bottles and load samples into shaker.
    11.1.5 Insure that ``ON-OFF'' switch on the shaker itself is ``ON.''
    11.1.6 Locate shaker timer. Insure that toggle switch atop timer 
control box is in the middle (``off'') position. If display reads 
``04:00'' (4 hours), move toggle switch to the left position. Shaker 
should begin operating.
    11.1.7 After shaker stops, add 100 ml acetone to each sample to 
precipitate polymer. Shake minimum of 5 minutes on shaker--Vistalon 
sample may not have fully dissolved; nevertheless, for purposes of 
consistency, 4 hours is the agreed-upon dissolving time.
    11.1.8 Using a 5-ml glass Luer-lock syringe and Acrodisc filter, 
filter some of the supernatant liquid into an autosampler vial; crimp 
the vial and load it into the GC autosampler for analysis (section 11.2 
of this method)--The samples are filtered to prevent polymer buildup in 
the GC. Clean the syringes in toluene.
    11.1.9 Decant remaining supernatant into a hydrocarbon waste sink, 
being careful not to discard any of the polymer. Place bottle of 
precipitate into the steam oven and dry for six hours--Some grades of 
Vistalon produce very small particles in the precipitate, thus making 
complete decanting impossible without discarding some polymer. In this 
case, decant as much as possible and put into the oven as is, allowing 
the oven to drive off remaining supernatant (this practice is avoided 
for environmental reasons). WARNING: OVEN IS HOT--110 [deg]C (230 
[deg]F).
    11.1.10 Cool, weigh and record final weight of bottle.
    11.2 GC ANALYSIS
    11.2.1 Initiate the CALS computer channel.
    11.2.2 Enter the correct instrument method into the GC's integrator.
    11.2.3 Load sample vial(s) into autosampler.
    11.2.4 Start the integrator.
    11.2.5 When analysis is complete, plot CALS run to check baseline 
skim.

[[Page 704]]

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Add the concentrations of the hexane peaks as they appear on 
the CALS printout. Do not include the benzene peak in the sum.
    12.2 Subtract any hexane interferences found in the PDS (see section 
7.5.6 of this method); record the result.
    12.3 Note the termonomer concentration on the CALS printout. 
Subtract any termonomer interference found in the PDS and record this 
result in a ``% termonomer by GC'' column in a logbook.
    12.4 Record the area (from CALS printout) of the heptane internal 
standard peak in a ``C7 area'' column in the logbook. This helps track 
instrument performance over the long term.
    12.5 After obtaining the final dry weight of polymer used (Section 
11.1.10 of this method), record that result in a ``dry wt.'' column of 
the logbook (for oil extended polymer, the amount of oil extracted is 
added to the dry rubber weight).
    12.6 Divide the %C6 by the dry weight to obtain the total PHR hexane 
in crumb. Similarly, divide the % termonomer by the dry weight to obtain 
the total PHR termonomer in crumb. Note that PHR is an abbreviation for 
``parts per hundred''. Record both the hexane and termonomer results in 
the logbook.
    12.7 Correct all results by the recovery efficiency value (R).

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 The method has been shown to provide 100% recovery of the 
hexane analyte. The method was found to give a 6% relative standard 
deviation when the same six portions of the same sample were carried 
through the procedure. Note: These values are examples; each sample 
type, as specified in Section 9.3, must be tested for sample recovery.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 Dispose of all hydrocarbon liquids in the appropriate disposal 
sink system; never pour hydrocarbons down a water sink.
    14.2 As discussed in section 11.1.9 of this method, the analyst can 
minimize venting hydrocarbon vapor to the atmosphere by decanting as 
much hydrocarbon liquid as possible before oven drying.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 The Technician conducting the analysis should follow the proper 
waste management practices for their laboratory location.

 Method 310C--Determination of Residual N-Hexane in EPDM Rubber Through 
                           Gas Chromatography

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 This method describes a procedure for the determination of 
residual hexane in EPDM wet crumb rubber in the 0.01--2% range by 
solvent extraction of the hexane followed by gas chromatographic 
analysis where the hexane is detected by flame ionization and quantified 
via an internal standard.
    1.2 This method may involve hazardous materials operations and 
equipment. This method does not purport to address all the safety 
problems associated with it use, if any. It is the responsibility of the 
user to consult and establish appropriate safety and health practices 
and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

                               2.0 Summary

    2.1 Residual hexane contained in wet pieces of EPDM polymer is 
extracted with MIBK. A known amount of an internal standard (IS) is 
added to the extract which is subsequently analyzed via gas 
chromatography where the hexane and IS are separated and detected 
utilizing a megabore column and flame ionization detection (FID). From 
the response to the hexane and the IS, the amount of hexane in the EPDM 
polymer is calculated.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Hexane--refers to n-hexane
    3.2 Heptane--refers to n-heptane
    3.3 MIBK--methyl isobutyl ketone (4 methyl 2--Pentanone)

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Material eluting at or near the hexane and/or the IS will cause 
erroneous results. Prior to extraction, solvent blanks must be analyzed 
to confirm the absence of interfering peaks.

                          8.0 Sample Collection

    8.1 Trap a sample of the EPDM crumb slurry in the sampling 
apparatus. Allow the crumb slurry to circulate through the sampling 
apparatus for 5 minutes; then close off the values at the bottom and top 
of the sampling apparatus, trapping the crumb slurry. Run cooling water 
through the water jacket for a minimum of 30 minutes. Expel the cooled 
crumb slurry into a sample catching basket. If the crumb does not fall 
by gravity, force it out with demineralized water or nitrogen. Send the 
crumb slurry to the lab for analysis.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 The Royalene crumb sample is extracted three times with MIBK 
containing an internal standard. The hexane from each extraction is 
added together to obtain a total hexane content. The percent hexane in 
the first extraction is then calculated and used as the recovery factor 
for the analysis.
    9.2 Follow this test method through section 11.4 of the method. 
After removing the sample of the first extraction to be run on the gas 
chromatograph, drain off the remainder of the extraction solvent, 
retaining the crumb sample in the sample jar. Rinse the crumb with 
demineralized water to remove any MIBK left on the surface of the crumb. 
Repeat the extraction procedure with fresh MIBK with internal standard 
two more times.
    9.3 After the third extraction, proceed to section 11.5 of this 
method and obtain the percent hexane in each extraction. Use the sample 
weight obtained in section 12.1 of this method to calculate the percent 
hexane in each of the extracts.
    9.4 Add the percent hexane obtained from the three extractions for a 
total percent hexane in the sample.
    9.5 Use the following equations to determine the recovery factor 
(R):
    % Recovery of the first extraction=(% hexane in the first extract/
total % hexane)x100
    Recovery Factor (R)=(% Hexane Recovered in the first extract)/100

                            10.0 Calibration

    10.1 Preparation of Internal Standard (IS) solution:
    Accuracy weigh 30 grams of n-heptane into a 1000 ml volumetric 
flask. Dilute to the mark with reagent grade MIBK. Label this Solution 
``A''. Pipette 100 mls. of Solution A into a 4 liter volumetric flask. 
Fill the flask to the mark with reagent MIBK. Label this Solution ``B''. 
Solution ``B'' will have a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml of heptane.
    10.2 Preparation of Hexane Standard Solution (HS):
    Using a 50 uL syringe, weigh by difference, 20 mg of n-hexane into a 
50 ml volumetric flask containing approximately 40 ml of Solution B. 
Fill the flask to the mark with Solution B and mix well.
    10.3 Conditions for GC analysis of standards and samples:
    Temperature:
    Initial=40 [deg]C
    Final=150 [deg]C
    Injector=160 [deg]C
    Detector=280 [deg]C
    Program Rate=5.0 [deg]C/min

    Initial Time=5 minutes Final Time=6 minutes
    Flow Rate=5.0 ml/min
    Sensitivity=detector response must be adjusted to keep the hexane 
and IS on scale.
    10.4 Fill an autosampler vial with the HS, analyze it three times 
and calculate a Hexane Relative Response Factor (RF) as follows:

RF=(A<INF>IS</INF> x C<INF>HS</INF> x P<INF>HS</INF>)/(A<INF>HS</INF> x 
C<INF>IS</INF> x P<INF>IS</INF>) (1)

Where:
A<INF>IS</INF>=Area of IS peak (Heptane)
A<INF>HS</INF>=Area of peak (Hexane Standard)
C<INF>HS</INF>=Mg of Hexane/50 ml HS
C<INF>IS</INF>=Mg of Heptane/50 ml IS Solution B
P<INF>IS</INF>=Purity of the IS n-heptane
P<INF>HS</INF>=Purity of the HS n-hexane

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Weight 10 grams of wet crumb into a tared (W1), wide mouth 4 
oz. jar.
    11.2 Pipette 50 ml of Solution B into the jar with the wet crumb 
rubber.
    11.3 Screw the cap on tightly and place it on a shaker for 4 hours.
    11.4 Remove the sample from the shaker and fill an autosampler vial 
with the MIBK extract.
    11.5 Analyze the sample two times.
    11.6 Analyze the HS twice, followed by the samples. Inject the HS 
twice at the end of each 10 samples or at the end of the run.

                            12.0 Calculations

    12.1 Drain off the remainder of the MIBK extract from the polymer in 
the 4 oz. jar. Retain all the polymer in the jar. Place the uncovered 
jar and polymer in a heated vacuum oven until the polymer is dry. 
Reweigh the jar and polymer (W2) and calculate the dried sample weight 
of the polymer as follows:

    Dried SW=W2--W1 (2)


[[Page 706]]


    12.2 Should the polymer be oil extended, pipette 10 ml of the MIBK 
extract into a tared evaporating dish (W1) and evaporate to dryness on a 
steam plate.
    Reweigh the evaporating dish containing the extracted oil (W2). 
Calculate the oil content of the polymer as follows:

    Gram of oil extracted =5 (W2--W1) (3)

% Hexane in polymer=(A<INF>s</INF>xRFxC<INF>IS</INF>xP<INF>IS</INF>)/
(A<INF>IS</INF>xSW) (4)

Where:

A<INF>s</INF>=Area of sample hexane sample peak.
A<INF>IS</INF>=Area of IS peak in sample.
C<INF>IS</INF>=Concentration of IS in 50 ml.
P<INF>IS</INF>=Purity of IS.
SW=Weight of dried rubber after extraction. (For oil extended polymer, 
the amount of oil extracted is added to the dry rubber weight).
% Corrected Hexane=(% Hexane in Polymer)/R (5)
R=Recovery factor determined in section 9 of this method.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Performance must be determined for each sample type by 
following the procedures in section 9 of this method.

                          14.0 Waste Generation

Method 311--Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and 
          Coatings by Direct Injection Into a Gas Chromatograph

                        1. Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for determination of 
most compounds designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as 
volatile hazardous air pollutants (HAP's) (See Reference 1) that are 
contained in paints and coatings. Styrene, ethyl acrylate, and methyl 
methacrylate can be measured by ASTM D 4827-93 or ASTM D 4747-87. 
Formaldehyde can be measured by ASTM PS 9-94 or ASTM D 1979-91. Toluene 
diisocyanate can be measured in urethane prepolymers by ASTM D 3432-89. 
Method 311 applies only to those volatile HAP's which are added to the 
coating when it is manufactured, not to those which may form as the 
coating cures (reaction products or cure volatiles). A separate or 
modified test procedure must be used to measure these reaction products 
or cure volatiles in order to determine the total volatile HAP emissions 
from a coating. Cure volatiles are a significant component of the total 
HAP content of some coatings. The term ``coating'' used in this method 
shall be understood to mean paints and coatings.
    1.2 Principle. The method uses the principle of gas chromatographic 
separation and quantification using a detector that responds to 
concentration differences. Because there are many potential analytical 
systems or sets of operating conditions that may represent useable 
methods for determining the concentrations of the compounds cited in 
Section 1.1 in the applicable matrices, all systems that employ this 
principle, but differ only in details of equipment and operation, may be 
used as alternative methods, provided that the prescribed quality 
control, calibration, and method performance requirements are met. 
Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include information 
relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, but not 
limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, injection 
port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.

                          2. Summary of Method

    Whole coating is added to dimethylformamide and a suitable internal 
standard compound is added. An aliquot of the sample mixture is injected 
onto a chromatographic column containing a stationary phase that 
separates the analytes from each other and from other volatile compounds 
contained in the sample. The concentrations of the analytes are 
determined by comparing the detector responses for the sample to the 
responses obtained using known concentrations of the analytes.

                        3. Definitions [Reserved]

                            4. Interferences

    4.1 Coating samples of unknown composition may contain the compound 
used as the internal standard. Whether or not this is the case may be 
determined by following the procedures of Section 11 and deleting the 
addition of the internal standard specified in Section 11.5.3. If 
necessary, a different internal standard may be used.
    4.2 The GC column and operating conditions developed for one coating 
formulation may not ensure adequate resolution of target analytes for 
other coating formulations. Some formulations may contain nontarget 
analytes that coelute with target analytes. If there is any doubt about 
the identification or resolution of any gas chromatograph (GC) peak, it 
may be necessary to analyze the sample using a different GC column or 
different GC operating conditions.
    4.3 Cross-contamination may occur whenever high-level and low-level 
samples are analyzed sequentially. The order of sample

[[Page 707]]

analyses specified in Section 11.7 is designed to minimize this problem.
    4.4 Cross-contamination may also occur if the devices used to 
transfer coating during the sample preparation process or for injecting 
the sample into the GC are not adequately cleaned between uses. All such 
devices should be cleaned with acetone or other suitable solvent and 
checked for plugs or cracks before and after each use.

                                5. Safety

    5.1 Many solvents used in coatings are hazardous. Precautions should 
be taken to avoid unnecessary inhalation and skin or eye contact. This 
method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This 
test method does not purport to address all of the safety problems 
associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this 
test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to 
determine the applicability of regulatory limitations in regards to the 
performance of this test method.
    5.2 Dimethylformamide is harmful if inhaled or absorbed through the 
skin. The user should obtain relevant health and safety information from 
the manufacturer. Dimethylformamide should be used only with adequate 
ventilation. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and clothing. In case of 
contact, immediately flush skin or eyes with plenty of water for at 
least 15 minutes. If eyes are affected, consult a physician. Remove and 
wash contaminated clothing before reuse.
    5.3 User's manuals for the gas chromatograph and other related 
equipment should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken 
related to their use.

                        6. Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include 
information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, 
but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, 
injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.

    6.1 Sample Collection.
    6.1.1 Sampling Containers. Dual-seal sampling containers, four to 
eight fluid ounce capacity, should be used to collect the samples. Glass 
sample bottles or plastic containers with volatile organic compound 
(VOC) impermeable walls must be used for corrosive substances (e.g., 
etch primers and certain coating catalysts such as methyl ethyl ketone 
(MEK) peroxide). Sample containers, caps, and inner seal liners must be 
inert to the compounds in the sample and must be selected on a case-by-
case basis.
    6.1.1.1 Other routine sampling supplies needed include waterproof 
marking pens, tubing, scrappers/spatulas, clean rags, paper towels, 
cooler/ice, long handle tongs, and mixing/stirring paddles.
    6.1.2 Personal safety equipment needed includes eye protection, 
respiratory protection, a hard hat, gloves, steel toe shoes, etc.
    6.1.3 Shipping supplies needed include shipping boxes, packing 
material, shipping labels, strapping tape, etc.
    6.1.4 Data recording forms and labels needed include coating data 
sheets and sample can labels.

    Note: The actual requirements will depend upon the conditions 
existing at the source sampled.

    6.2 Laboratory Equipment and Supplies.
    6.2.1 Gas Chromatograph (GC). Any instrument equipped with a flame 
ionization detector and capable of being temperature programmed may be 
used. Optionally, other types of detectors (e.g., a mass spectrometer), 
and any necessary interfaces, may be used provided that the detector 
system yields an appropriate and reproducible response to the analytes 
in the injected sample. Autosampler injection may be used, if available.
    6.2.2 Recorder. If available, an electronic data station or 
integrator may be used to record the gas chromatogram and associated 
data. If a strip chart recorder is used, it must meet the following 
criteria: A 1 to 10 millivolt (mV) linear response with a full scale 
response time of 2 seconds or less and a maximum noise level of <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.03 percent of full scale. Other types of recorders may 
be used as appropriate to the specific detector installed provided that 
the recorder has a full scale response time of 2 seconds or less and a 
maximum noise level of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.03 percent of full scale.
    6.2.3 Column. The column must be constructed of materials that do 
not react with components of the sample (e.g., fused silica, stainless 
steel, glass). The column should be of appropriate physical dimensions 
(e.g., length, internal diameter) and contain sufficient suitable 
stationary phase to allow separation of the analytes. DB-5, DB-Wax, and 
FFAP columns are commonly used for paint analysis; however, it is the 
responsibility of each analyst to select appropriate columns and 
stationary phases.
    6.2.4 Tube and Tube Fittings. Supplies to connect the GC and gas 
cylinders.
    6.2.5 Pressure Regulators. Devices used to regulate the pressure 
between gas cylinders and the GC.
    6.2.6 Flow Meter. A device used to determine the carrier gas flow 
rate through the GC. Either a digital flow meter or a soap film bubble 
meter may be used to measure gas flow rates.
    6.2.7 Septa. Seals on the GC injection port through which liquid or 
gas samples can be injected using a syringe.

[[Page 708]]

    6.2.8 Liquid Charging Devices. Devices used to inject samples into 
the GC such as clean and graduated 1, 5, and 10 microliter ([micro]l) 
capacity syringes.
    6.2.9 Vials. Containers that can be sealed with a septum in which 
samples may be prepared or stored. The recommended size is 25 ml 
capacity. Mininert <SUP>[reg]</SUP> valves have been found satisfactory 
and are available from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Illinois.
    6.2.10 Balance. Device used to determine the weights of standards 
and samples. An analytical balance capable of accurately weighing to 
0.0001 g is required.

                        7. Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Purity of Reagents. Reagent grade chemicals shall be used in all 
tests. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents shall conform to the 
specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American 
Chemical Society, where such specifications are available. Other grades 
may be used provided it is first ascertained that the reagent is of 
sufficient purity to permit its use without lessening the accuracy of 
determination.
    7.2 Carrier Gas. Helium carrier gas shall have a purity of 99.995 
percent or higher. High purity nitrogen may also be used. Other carrier 
gases that are appropriate for the column system and analyte may also be 
used. Ultra-high purity grade hydrogen gas and zero-grade air shall be 
used for the flame ionization detector.
    7.3 Dimethylformamide (DMF). Solvent for all standards and samples. 
Some other suitable solvent may be used if DMF is not compatible with 
the sample or coelutes with a target analyte.

    Note: DMF may coelute with ethylbenzene or p-xylene under the 
conditions described in the note under Section 6.2.3.

    7.4 Internal Standard Materials. The internal standard material is 
used in the quantitation of the analytes for this method. It shall be 
gas chromatography spectrophotometric quality or, if this grade is not 
available, the highest quality available. Obtain the assay for the 
internal standard material and maintain at that purity during use. The 
recommended internal standard material is 1-propanol; however, selection 
of an appropriate internal standard material for the particular coating 
and GC conditions used is the responsibility of each analyst.
    7.5 Reference Standard Materials. The reference standard materials 
are the chemicals cited in Section 1.1 which are of known identity and 
purity and which are used to assist in the identification and 
quantification of the analytes of this method. They shall be the highest 
quality available. Obtain the assays for the reference standard 
materials and maintain at those purities during use.
    7.6 Stock Reference Standards. Stock reference standards are 
dilutions of the reference standard materials that may be used on a 
daily basis to prepare calibration standards, calibration check 
standards, and quality control check standards. Stock reference 
standards may be prepared from the reference standard materials or 
purchased as certified solutions.
    7.6.1 Stock reference standards should be prepared in 
dimethylformamide for each analyte expected in the coating samples to be 
analyzed. The concentrations of analytes in the stock reference 
standards are not specified but must be adequate to prepare the 
calibration standards required in the method. A stock reference standard 
may contain more than one analyte provided all analytes are chemically 
compatible and no analytes coelute. The actual concentrations prepared 
must be known to within 0.1 percent (e.g., 0.1000 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.0001 g/g solution). The following procedure is 
suggested. Place about 35 ml of dimethylformamide into a tared ground-
glass stoppered 50 ml volumetric flask. Weigh the flask to the nearest 
0.1 mg. Add 12.5 g of the reference standard material and reweigh the 
flask. Dilute to volume with dimethylformamide and reweigh. Stopper the 
flask and mix the contents by inverting the flask several times. 
Calculate the concentration in grams per gram of solution from the net 
gain in weights, correcting for the assayed purity of the reference 
standard material.

    Note: Although a glass-stoppered volumetric flask is convenient, any 
suitable glass container may be used because stock reference standards 
are prepared by weight.

    7.6.2 Transfer the stock reference standard solution into one or 
more Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store, with minimal headspace, at 
-10 [deg]C to 0 [deg]C and protect from light.
    7.6.3 Prepare fresh stock reference standards every six months, or 
sooner if analysis results from daily calibration check standards 
indicate a problem. Fresh stock reference standards for very volatile 
HAP's may have to be prepared more frequently.
    7.7 Calibration Standards. Calibration standards are used to 
determine the response of the detector to known amounts of reference 
material. Calibration standards must be prepared at a minimum of three 
concentration levels from the stock reference standards (see Section 
7.6). Prepare the calibration standards in dimethylformamide (see 
Section 7.3). The lowest concentration standard should contain a 
concentration of analyte equivalent either to a concentration of no more 
than 0.01% of the analyte in a coating or to a concentration that is 
lower than the actual concentration of the analyte in the coating, 
whichever concentration is higher. The highest concentration standard

[[Page 709]]

should contain a concentration of analyte equivalent to slightly more 
than the highest concentration expected for the analyte in a coating. 
The remaining calibration standard should contain a concentration of 
analyte roughly at the midpoint of the range defined by the lowest and 
highest concentration calibration standards. The concentration range of 
the standards should thus correspond to the expected range of analyte 
concentrations in the prepared coating samples (see Section 11.5). Each 
calibration standard should contain each analyte for detection by this 
method expected in the actual coating samples (e.g., some or all of the 
compounds listed in Section 1.1 may be included). Each calibration 
standard should also contain an appropriate amount of internal standard 
material (response for the internal standard material is within 25 to 75 
percent of full scale on the attenuation setting for the particular 
reference standard concentration level). Calibration Standards should be 
stored for 1 week only in sealed vials with minimal headspace. If the 
stock reference standards were prepared as specified in Section 7.6, the 
calibration standards may be prepared by either weighing each addition 
of the stock reference standard or by adding known volumes of the stock 
reference standard and calculating the mass of the standard reference 
material added. Alternative 1 (Section 7.7.1) specifies the procedure to 
be followed when the stock reference standard is added by volume. 
Alternative 2 (Section 7.7.2) specifies the procedure to be followed 
when the stock reference standard is added by weight.

    Note: To assist with determining the appropriate amount of internal 
standard to add, as required here and in other sections of this method, 
the analyst may find it advantageous to prepare a curve showing the area 
response versus the amount of internal standard injected into the GC.

    7.7.1 Preparation Alternative 1. Determine the amount of each stock 
reference standard and dimethylformamide solvent needed to prepare 
approximately 25 ml of the specific calibration concentration level 
desired. To a tared 25 ml vial that can be sealed with a crimp-on or 
Mininert <SUP>[reg]</SUP> valve, add the total amount of 
dimethylformamide calculated to be needed. As quickly as practical, add 
the calculated amount of each stock reference standard using new pipets 
(or pipet tips) for each stock reference standard. Reweigh the vial and 
seal it. Using the known weights of the standard reference materials per 
ml in the stock reference standards, the volumes added, and the total 
weight of all reagents added to the vial, calculate the weight percent 
of each standard reference material in the calibration standard 
prepared. Repeat this process for each calibration standard to be 
prepared.
    7.7.2 Preparation Alternative 2. Determine the amount of each stock 
reference standard and dimethylformamide solvent needed to prepare 
approximately 25 ml of the specific calibration concentration level 
desired. To a tared 25 ml vial that can be sealed with a crimp-on or 
Mininert <SUP>[reg]</SUP> valve, add the total amount of 
dimethylformamide calculated to be needed. As quickly as practical, add 
the calculated amount of a stock reference standard using a new pipet 
(or pipet tip) and reweigh the vial. Repeat this process for each stock 
reference standard to be added. Seal the vial after obtaining the final 
weight. Using the known weight percents of the standard reference 
materials in the stock reference standards, the weights of the stock 
reference standards added, and the total weight of all reagents added to 
the vial, calculate the weight percent of each standard reference 
material in the calibration standard prepared. Repeat this process for 
each calibration standard to be prepared.

       8. Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage

    8.1 Copies of material safety data sheets (MSDS's) for each sample 
should be obtained prior to sampling. The MSDS's contain information on 
the ingredients, and physical and chemical properties data. The MSDS's 
also contain recommendations for proper handling or required safety 
precautions. Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include 
information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, 
but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, 
injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.
    8.2 A copy of the blender's worksheet can be requested to obtain 
data on the exact coating being sampled. A blank coating data sheet form 
(see Section 18) may also be used. The manufacturer's formulation 
information from the product data sheet should also be obtained.
    8.3 Prior to sample collection, thoroughly mix the coating to ensure 
that a representative, homogeneous sample is obtained. It is preferred 
that this be accomplished using a coating can shaker or similar device; 
however, when necessary, this may be accomplished using mechanical 
agitation or circulation systems.
    8.3.1 Water-thinned coatings tend to incorporate or entrain air 
bubbles if stirred too vigorously; mix these types of coatings slowly 
and only as long as necessary to homogenize.
    8.3.2 Each component of multicomponent coatings that harden when 
mixed must be sampled separately. The component mix ratios must be 
obtained at the facility at the time of sampling and submitted to the 
analytical laboratory.

[[Page 710]]

    8.4 Sample Collection. Samples must be collected in a manner that 
prevents or minimizes loss of volatile components and that does not 
contaminate the coating reservoir. A suggested procedure is as follows. 
Select a sample collection container which has a capacity at least 25 
percent greater than the container in which the sample is to be 
transported. Make sure both sample containers are clean and dry. Using 
clean, long-handled tongs, turn the sample collection container upside 
down and lower it into the coating reservoir. The mouth of the sample 
collection container should be at approximately the midpoint of the 
reservoir (do not take the sample from the top surface). Turn the sample 
collection container over and slowly bring it to the top of the coating 
reservoir. Rapidly pour the collected coating into the sample container, 
filling it completely. It is important to fill the sample container 
completely to avoid any loss of volatiles due to volatilization into the 
headspace. Return any unused coating to the reservoir or dispose as 
appropriate.

    Note: If a company requests a set of samples for its own analysis, a 
separate set of samples, using new sample containers, should be taken at 
the same time.

    8.5 Once the sample is collected, place the sample container on a 
firm surface and insert the inner seal in the container by placing the 
seal inside the rim of the container, inverting a screw cap, and 
pressing down on the screw cap which will evenly force the inner seal 
into the container for a tight fit. Using clean towels or rags, remove 
all residual coating material from the outside of the sample container 
after inserting the inner seal. Screw the cap onto the container.
    8.5.1 Affix a sample label (see Section 18) clearly identifying the 
sample, date collected, and person collecting the sample.
    8.5.2 Prepare the sample for transportation to the laboratory. The 
sample should be maintained at the coating's recommended storage 
temperature specified on the Material Safety Data Sheet, or, if no 
temperature is specified, the sample should be maintained within the 
range of 5 [deg]C to 38 [deg]C.
    8.9 The shipping container should adhere to U.S. Department of 
Transportation specification DOT 12-B. Coating samples are considered 
hazardous materials; appropriate shipping procedures should be followed.

                           9. Quality Control

    9.1 Laboratories using this method should operate a formal quality 
control program. The minimum requirements of the program should consist 
of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing 
analysis of blanks and quality control samples to evaluate and document 
quality data. The laboratory must maintain records to document the 
quality of the data generated. When results indicate atypical method 
performance, a quality control check standard (see Section 9.4) must be 
analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-
control mode of operation.
    9.2 Before processing any samples, the analyst must demonstrate, 
through analysis of a reagent blank, that there are no interferences 
from the analytical system, glassware, and reagents that would bias the 
sample analysis results. Each time a set of analytical samples is 
processed or there is a change in reagents, a reagent blank should be 
processed as a safeguard against chronic laboratory contamination. The 
blank samples should be carried through all stages of the sample 
preparation and measurement steps.
    9.3 Required instrument quality control parameters are found in the 
following sections:
    9.3.1 Baseline stability must be demonstrated to be <=5 percent of 
full scale using the procedures given in Section 10.1.
    9.3.2 The GC calibration is not valid unless the retention time (RT) 
for each analyte at each concentration is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 min of the retention time measured for that analyte 
in the stock standard.
    9.3.3 The retention time (RT) of any sample analyte must be within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 min of the average RT of the analyte in the 
calibration standards for the analyte to be considered tentatively 
identified.
    9.3.4 The GC system must be calibrated as specified in Section 10.2.
    9.3.5 A one-point daily calibration check must be performed as 
specified in Section 10.3.
    9.4 To establish the ability to generate results having acceptable 
accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following 
operations.
    9.4.1 Prepare a quality control check standard (QCCS) containing 
each analyte expected in the coating samples at a concentration expected 
to result in a response between 25 percent and 75 percent of the limits 
of the calibration curve when the sample is prepared as described in 
Section 11.5. The QCCS may be prepared from reference standard materials 
or purchased as certified solutions. If prepared in the laboratory, the 
QCCS must be prepared independently from the calibration standards.
    9.4.2 Analyze three aliquots of the QCCS according to the method 
beginning in Section 11.5.3 and calculate the weight percent of each 
analyte using Equation 1, Section 12.
    9.4.3 Calculate the mean weight percent (X) for each analyte from 
the three results obtained in Section 9.4.2.
    9.4.4 Calculate the percent accuracy for each analyte using the 
known concentrations (Ti) in the QCCS using Equation 3, Section 12.

[[Page 711]]

    9.4.5 Calculate the percent relative standard deviation (percent 
RSD) for each analyte using Equation 7, Section 12, substituting the 
appropriate values for the relative response factors (RRF's) in said 
equation.
    9.4.6 If the percent accuracy (Section 9.4.4) for all analytes is 
within the range 90 percent to 110 percent and the percent RSD (Section 
9.4.5) for all analytes is <=20 percent, system performance is 
acceptable and sample analysis may begin. If these criteria are not met 
for any analyte, then system performance is not acceptable for that 
analyte and the test must be repeated for those analytes only. Repeated 
failures indicate a general problem with the measurement system that 
must be located and corrected. In this case, the entire test, beginning 
at Section 9.4.1, must be repeated after the problem is corrected.
    9.5 Great care must be exercised to maintain the integrity of all 
standards. It is recommended that all standards be stored at -10 [deg]C 
to 0 [deg]C in screw-cap amber glass bottles with Teflon liners.
    9.6 Unless otherwise specified, all weights are to be recorded 
within 0.1 mg.

                  10. Calibration and Standardization.

    10.1 Column Baseline Drift. Before each calibration and series of 
determinations and before the daily calibration check, condition the 
column using procedures developed by the laboratory or as specified by 
the column supplier. Operate the GC at initial (i.e., before sample 
injection) conditions on the lowest attenuation to be used during sample 
analysis. Adjust the recorder pen to zero on the chart and obtain a 
baseline for at least one minute. Initiate the GC operating cycle that 
would be used for sample analysis. On the recorder chart, mark the pen 
position at the end of the simulated sample analysis cycle. Baseline 
drift is defined as the absolute difference in the pen positions at the 
beginning and end of the cycle in the direction perpendicular to the 
chart movement. Calculate the percent baseline drift by dividing the 
baseline drift by the chart width representing full-scale deflection and 
multiply the result by 100.
    10.2 Calibration of GC. Bring all stock standards and calibration 
standards to room temperature while establishing the GC at the 
determined operating conditions.
    10.2.1 Retention Times (RT's) for Individual Compounds.

    Note: The procedures of this subsection are required only for the 
initial calibration. However, it is good laboratory practice to follow 
these procedures for some or all analytes before each calibration. The 
procedures were written for chromatograms output to a strip chart 
recorder. More modern instruments (e.g., integrators and electronic data 
stations) determine and print out or display retention times 
automatically.

    The RT for each analyte should be determined before calibration. 
This provides a positive identification for each peak observed from the 
calibration standards. Inject an appropriate volume (see Note in Section 
11.5.2) of one of the stock reference standards into the gas 
chromatograph and record on the chart the pen position at the time of 
the injection (see Section 7.6.1). Dilute an aliquot of the stock 
reference standard as required in dimethylformamide to achieve a 
concentration that will result in an on-scale response. Operate the gas 
chromatograph according to the determined procedures. Select the peak(s) 
that correspond to the analyte(s) [and internal standard, if used] and 
measure the retention time(s). If a chart recorder is used, measure the 
distance(s) on the chart from the injection point to the peak maxima. 
These distances, divided by the chart speed, are defined as the RT's of 
the analytes in question. Repeat this process for each of the stock 
reference standard solutions.

    Note: If gas chromatography with mass spectrometer detection (GC-MS) 
is used, a stock reference standard may contain a group of analytes, 
provided all analytes are adequately separated during the analysis. Mass 
spectral library matching can be used to identify the analyte associated 
with each peak in the gas chromatogram. The retention time for the 
analyte then becomes the retention time of its peak in the chromatogram.

    10.2.2 Calibration. The GC must be calibrated using a minimum of 
three concentration levels of each potential analyte. (See Section 7.7 
for instructions on preparation of the calibration standards.) Beginning 
with the lowest concentration level calibration standard, carry out the 
analysis procedure as described beginning in Section 11.7. Repeat the 
procedure for each progressively higher concentration level until all 
calibration standards have been analyzed.
    10.2.2.1 Calculate the RT's for the internal standard and for each 
analyte in the calibration standards at each concentration level as 
described in Section 10.2.1. The RT's for the internal standard must not 
vary by more than 0.10 minutes. Identify each analyte by comparison of 
the RT's for peak maxima to the RT's determined in Section 10.2.1.
    10.2.2.2 Compare the retention times (RT's) for each potential 
analyte in the calibration standards for each concentration level to the 
retention times determined in Section 10.2.1. The calibration is not 
valid unless all RT's for all analytes meet the criteria given in 
Section 9.3.2.
    10.2.2.3 Tabulate the area responses and the concentrations for the 
internal standard and each analyte in the calibration standards. 
Calculate the response factor for the

[[Page 712]]

internal standard (RF<INF>is</INF>) and the response factor for each 
compound relative to the internal standard (RRF) for each concentration 
level using Equations 5 and 6, Section 12.
    10.2.2.4 Using the RRF's from the calibration, calculate the percent 
relative standard deviation (percent RSD) for each analyte in the 
calibration standard using Equation 7, Section 12. The percent RSD for 
each individual calibration analyte must be less than 15 percent. This 
criterion must be met in order for the calibration to be valid. If the 
criterion is met, the mean RRF's determined above are to be used until 
the next calibration.
    10.3 Daily Calibration Checks. The calibration curve (Section 
10.2.2) must be checked and verified at least once each day that samples 
are analyzed. This is accomplished by analyzing a calibration standard 
that is at a concentration near the midpoint of the working range and 
performing the checks in Sections 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and 10.3.3.
    10.3.1 For each analyte in the calibration standard, calculate the 
percent difference in the RRF from the last calibration using Equation 
8, Section 12. If the percent difference for each calibration analyte is 
less than 10 percent, the last calibration curve is assumed to be valid. 
If the percent difference for any analyte is greater than 5 percent, the 
analyst should consider this a warning limit. If the percent difference 
for any one calibration analyte exceeds 10 percent, corrective action 
must be taken. If no source of the problem can be determined after 
corrective action has been taken, a new three-point (minimum) 
calibration must be generated. This criterion must be met before 
quantitative analysis begins.
    10.3.2 If the RF<INF>is</INF> for the internal standard changes by 
more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20 percent from the last daily 
calibration check, the system must be inspected for malfunctions and 
corrections made as appropriate.
    10.3.3 The retention times for the internal standard and all 
calibration check analytes must be evaluated. If the retention time for 
the internal standard or for any calibration check analyte changes by 
more than 0.10 min from the last calibration, the system must be 
inspected for malfunctions and corrections made as required.

                              11. Procedure

    11.1 All samples and standards must be allowed to warm to room 
temperature before analysis. Observe the given order of ingredient 
addition to minimize loss of volatiles.
    11.2 Bring the GC system to the determined operating conditions and 
condition the column as described in Section 10.1.

    Note: The temperature of the injection port may be an especially 
critical parameter. Information about the proper temperature may be 
found on the CPDS.

    11.3 Perform the daily calibration checks as described in Section 
10.3. Samples are not to be analyzed until the criteria in Section 10.3 
are met.
    11.4 Place the as-received coating sample on a paint shaker, or 
similar device, and shake the sample for a minimum of 5 minutes to 
achieve homogenization.
    11.5 Note: The steps in this section must be performed rapidly and 
without interruption to avoid loss of volatile organics. These steps 
must be performed in a laboratory hood free from solvent vapors. All 
weights must be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mg.
    11.5.1 Add 16 g of dimethylformamide to each of two tared vials (A 
and B) capable of being septum sealed.
    11.5.2 To each vial add a weight of coating that will result in the 
response for the major constituent being in the upper half of the linear 
range of the calibration curve.

    Note: The magnitude of the response obviously depends on the amount 
of sample injected into the GC as specified in Section 11.8. This volume 
must be the same as used for preparation of the calibration curve, 
otherwise shifts in compound retention times may occur. If a sample is 
prepared that results in a response outside the limits of the 
calibration curve, new samples must be prepared; changing the volume 
injected to bring the response within the calibration curve limits is 
not permitted.

    11.5.3 Add a weight of internal standard to each vial (A and B) that 
will result in the response for the internal standard being between 25 
percent and 75 percent of the linear range of the calibration curve.
    11.5.4 Seal the vials with crimp-on or Mininert <SUP>[reg]</SUP> 
septum seals.
    11.6 Shake the vials containing the prepared coating samples for 60 
seconds. Allow the vials to stand undisturbed for ten minutes. If solids 
have not settled out on the bottom after 10 minutes, then centrifuge at 
1,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The analyst also has the option of injecting 
the sample without allowing the solids to settle.
    11.7 Analyses should be conducted in the following order: daily 
calibration check sample, method blank, up to 10 injections from sample 
vials (i.e., one injection each from up to five pairs of vials, which 
corresponds to analysis of 5 coating samples).
    11.8 Inject the prescribed volume of supernatant from the 
calibration check sample, the method blank, and the sample vials onto 
the chromatographic column and record the chromatograms while operating 
the system under the specified operating conditions.

    Note: The analyst has the option of injecting the unseparated 
sample.

                   12. Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Qualitative Analysis. An analyte (e.g., those cited in Section 
1.1) is considered tentatively identified if two criteria are satisfied: 
(1) elution of the sample analyte within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 min 
of the average GC retention time of the same analyte in the calibration 
standard; and (2) either (a) confirmation of the identity of the 
compound by spectral matching on a gas chromatograph equipped with a 
mass selective detector or (b) elution of the sample analyte within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 min of the average GC retention time of the 
same analyte in the calibration standard analyzed on a dissimilar GC 
column.
    12.1.1 The RT of the sample analyte must meet the criteria specified 
in Section 9.3.3.
    12.1.2 When doubt exists as to the identification of a peak or the 
resolution of two or more components possibly comprising one peak, 
additional confirmatory techniques (listed in Section 12.1) must be 
used.
    12.2 Quantitative Analysis. When an analyte has been identified, the 
quantification of that compound will be based on the internal standard 
technique.
    12.2.1 A single analysis consists of one injection from each of two 
sample vials (A and B) prepared using the same coating. Calculate the 
concentration of each identified analyte in the sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.003

    12.2.2 Report results for duplicate analysis (sample vials A and B) 
without correction.
    12.3 Precision Data. Calculate the percent difference between the 
measured concentrations of each analyte in vials A and B as follows.
    12.3.1 Calculate the weight percent of the analyte in each of the 
two sample vials as described in Section 12.2.1.
    12.3.2 Calculate the percent difference for each analyte as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.004
    
where A<INF>i</INF> and B<INF>i</INF> are the measured concentrations of 
the analyte in vials A and B.
    12.4 Calculate the percent accuracy for analytes in the QCCS (See 
Section 9.4) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.005

where X<INF>x</INF> is the mean measured value and T<INF>x</INF> is the 
known true value of the analyte in the QCCS.
    12.5 Obtain retention times (RT's) from data station or integrator 
or, for chromatograms from a chart recorder, calculate the RT's for 
analytes in the calibration standards (See Section 10.2.2.2) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.006


[[Page 714]]


    12.6 Calculate the response factor for the internal standard (See 
Section 10.2.2.3) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.007

where:
    A<INF>is</INF> = Area response of the internal standard.
    C<INF>is</INF> = Weight percent of the internal standard.
    12.7 Calculate the relative response factors for analytes in the 
calibration standards (See Section 10.2.2.3) as follows:
where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.008

    RRF<INF>x</INF> = Relative response factor for an individual 
analyte.
    A<INF>x</INF> = Area response of the analyte being measured.
    C<INF>x</INF> = Weight percent of the analyte being measured.
    12.8 Calculate the percent relative standard deviation of the 
relative response factors for analytes in the calibration standards (See 
Section 10.2.2.4) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.009

    12.9 Calculate the percent difference in the relative response 
factors between the calibration curve and the daily calibration checks 
(See Section 10.3) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.010

                          16. Waste Management

    16.1 The coating samples and laboratory standards and reagents may 
contain compounds which require management as hazardous waste. It is the 
laboratory's responsibility to ensure all wastes are managed in 
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
    16.2 To avoid excessive laboratory waste, obtain only enough sample 
for laboratory analysis.
    16.3 It is recommended that discarded waste coating solids, used 
rags, used paper towels, and other nonglass or nonsharp waste materials 
be placed in a plastic bag before disposal. A separate container, 
designated ``For Sharp Objects Only,'' is recommended for collection of 
discarded glassware and other sharp-edge items used in the laboratory. 
It is recommended that unused or excess samples and reagents be placed 
in a solvent-resistant plastic or metal container with a lid or cover 
designed for flammable liquids. This container should not be stored in 
the area where analytical work is performed. It is recommended that a 
record be kept of all compounds placed in the container for 
identification of the contents upon disposal.

Method 312A--Determination of Styrene in Latex Styrene-Butadiene Rubber, 
                       Through Gas Chromatography

                        1. Scope and Application

    1.1 This method describes a procedure for determining parts per 
million (ppm) styrene monomer (CAS No. 100-42-5) in aqueous samples, 
including latex samples and styrene stripper water.
    1.2 The sample is separated in a gas chromatograph equipped with a 
packed column and a flame ionization detector.

[[Page 720]]

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 This method utilizes a packed column gas chromatograph with a 
flame ionization detector to determine the concentration of residual 
styrene in styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) latex samples.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 The definitions are included in the text as needed.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 In order to reduce matrix effects and emulsify the styrene, 
similar styrene free latex is added to the internal standard. There are 
no known interferences.
    4.2 The operating parameters are selected to obtain resolution 
necessary to determine styrene monomer concentrations in latex.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 It is the responsibility of the user of this procedure to 
establish appropriate safety and health practices.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    6.1 Adjustable bottle-top dispenser, set to deliver 3 ml. (for 
internal standard), Brinkmann Dispensette, or equivalent.
    6.2 Pipettor, set to 10 ml., Oxford Macro-set, or equivalent.
    6.3 Volumetric flask, 100-ml, with stopper.
    6.4 Hewlett Packard Model 5710A dual channel gas chromatograph 
equipped with flame ionization detector.
    6.4.1 11 ft. x \1/8\ in. stainless steel column packed with 10% TCEP 
on 100/120 mesh Chromosorb P, or equivalent.
    6.4.2 Perkin Elmer Model 023 strip chart recorder, or equivalent.
    6.5 Helium carrier gas, zero grade.
    6.6 Liquid syringe, 25-[micro]l.
    6.7 Digital MicroVAX 3100 computer with VG Multichrom software, or 
equivalent data handling system.
    6.6 Wire Screens, circular, 70-mm, 80-mesh diamond weave.
    6.7 DEHA--(N,N-Diethyl hydroxylamine), 97+% purity, CAS No. 3710-84-
7
    6.8 p-Dioxane, CAS No. 123-91-1

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Internal standard preparation.
    7.1.1 Pipette 5 ml p-dioxane into a 1000-ml volumetric flask and 
fill to the mark with distilled water and mix thoroughly.
    7.2 Calibration solution preparation.
    7.2.1 Pipette 10 ml styrene-free latex (eg: NBR latex) into a 100-ml 
volumetric flask.
    7.2.2 Add 3 ml internal standard (section 7.1.1 of this method).
    7.2.3 Weigh exactly 10 [micro]l fresh styrene and record the weight.
    7.2.4 Inject the styrene into the flask and mix well.
    7.2.5 Add 2 drops of DEHA, fill to the mark with water and mix well 
again.
    7.2.6 Calculate concentration of the calibration solution as 
follows:

    mg/l styrene=(mg styrene added)/0.1 L

            8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage

    8.1 A representative SBR emulsion sample should be caught in a 
clean, dry 6-oz. teflon lined glass container. Close it properly to 
assure no sample leakage.
    8.2 The container should be labeled with sample identification, date 
and time.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 The instrument is calibrated by injecting calibration solution 
(Section 7.2 of this method) five times.
    9.2 The retention time for components of interest and relative 
response of monomer to the internal standard is determined.
    9.3 Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample type 
and whenever modifications are made to the method.
    9.3.1 A set of six latex samples shall be collected. Two samples 
shall be prepared for analysis from each sample. Each sample shall be 
analyzed in duplicate.
    9.3.2 The second set of six latex samples shall be analyzed in 
duplicate before spiking each sample with approximately 1000 ppm 
styrene. The spiked samples shall be analyzed in duplicate.
    9.3.3 For each hydrocarbon, calculate the average recovery 
efficiency (R) using the following equations:

where:
R=[Sigma](R<INF>n</INF>)/6

where:
R<INF>n</INF>=(c<INF>ns</INF>-c<INF>v</INF>)/S<INF>n</INF>

n=sample number
c<INF>ns</INF>=concentration of compound measured in spiked sample 
number n.
c<INF>nu</INF>= concentration of compound measured in unspiked sample 
number n.
S<INF>n</INF>=theoretical concentration of compound spiked into sample 
n.
    9.3.4 A value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.3.5 R is used to correct all reported results for each compound by 
dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

                10.0 Calibration and Instrument Settings

    10.1 Injection port temperature, 250 [deg]C.
    10.2 Oven temperature, 110 [deg]C, isothermal.
    10.3 Carrier gas flow, 25 cc/min.
    10.4 Detector temperature, 250 [deg]C.
    10.5 Range, 1X.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Turn on recorder and adjust baseline to zero.

[[Page 721]]

    11.2 Prepare sample.
    11.2.1 For latex samples, add 3 ml Internal Standard (section 7.1 of 
this method) to a 100-ml volumetric flask. Pipet 10 ml sample into the 
flask using the Oxford pipettor, dilute to the 100-ml mark with water, 
and shake well.
    11.2.2 For water samples, add 3 ml Internal Standard (section 7.1 of 
this method) to a 100-ml volumetric flask and fill to the mark with 
sample. Shake well.
    11.3 Flush syringe with sample.
    11.4 Carefully inject 2 [micro]l of sample into the gas 
chromatograph column injection port and press the start button.
    11.5 When the run is complete the computer will print a report of 
the analysis.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculation

    12.1 For samples that are prepared as in section 11.2.1 of this 
method:

ppm styrene = AxD

Where:
A = ``ppm'' readout from computer
D = dilution factor (10 for latex samples)

    12.2 For samples that are prepared as in section 11.2.2 of this 
method, ppm styrene is read directly from the computer.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 This test has a standard deviation (1) of 3.3 ppm at 100 ppm 
styrene. The average Spike Recovery from six samples at 1000 ppm Styrene 
was 96.7 percent. The test method was validated using 926 ppm styrene 
standard. Six analysis of the same standard provided average 97.7 
percent recovery. Note: These are example recoveries and do not replace 
quality assurance procedures in this method.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 Waste generation should be minimized where possible. Sample 
size should be an amount necessary to adequately run the analysis.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 All waste shall be handled in accordance with Federal and State 
environmental regulations.

  Method 312B--Determination of Residual Styrene in Styrene-Butadiene 
           (SBR) Rubber Latex by Capillary Gas Chromatography

                                1.0 Scope

    1.1 This method is applicable to SBR latex solutions.
    1.2 This method quantitatively determines residual styrene 
concentrations in SBR latex solutions at levels from 80 to 1200 ppm.

                         2.0 Principle of Method

    2.1 A weighed sample of a latex solution is coagulated with an ethyl 
alcohol (EtOH) solution containing a specific amount of alpha-methyl 
styrene (AMS) as the internal standard. The extract of this coagulation 
is then injected into a gas chromatograph and separated into individual 
components. Quantification is achieved by the method of internal 
standardization.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 For each sample type, 12 samples of SBR latex shall be obtained 
from the process for the recovery study. Half the vials and caps shall 
be tared, labeled ``spiked'', and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials 
are labeled ``unspiked'' and need not be tared, but are also numbered 1 
through 6.
    9.2 The six vials labeled ``spiked'' shall be spiked with an amount 
of styrene to approximate 50% of the solution's expected residual 
styrene level.
    9.3 The spiked samples shall be shaken for several hours and allowed 
to cool to room temperature before analysis.
    9.4 The six samples of unspiked solution shall be coagulated and a 
mean styrene value shall be determined, along with the standard 
deviation, and the percent relative standard deviation.
    9.5 The six samples of the spiked solution shall be coagulated and 
the results of the analyses shall be determined using the following 
equations:

M<INF>r</INF>=M<INF>s</INF>-M<INF>u</INF>
R=M<INF>r</INF>/S

where:
M<INF>u</INF>=Mean value of styrene in the unspiked sample

    9.7 R is used to correct all reported results for each compound by 
dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

respectively. The percent relative standard deviations (%RSD) were 1% or 
less at all levels. Five degrees of freedom were used for all precision 
data except at the 80 ppm level, where nine degrees of freedom were 
used. Note: These are example results and do not replace quality 
assurance procedures in this method.

Where
A<INF>x</INF> = Peak area of alpha methyl styrene
A<INF>is</INF> = Peak area of styrene
W<INF>x</INF> = Weight of alpha methyl styrene
W<INF>is</INF> = Weight of styrene (.00100)
F<INF>x</INF> = Analyzed response factor = 1

    8.4 No special storage conditions are required.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 The laboratory is required to operate a formal quality control 
program. This consists of an initial demonstration of the capability of 
the method as well as ongoing analysis of standards, blanks, and spiked 
samples to demonstrate continued performance.
    9.1.1 When the method is first set up, a calibration is run and the 
recovery efficiency for each type of sample must be determined.
    9.1.2 If new types of samples are being analyzed, then recovery 
efficiency for each new type of sample must be determined. New type 
includes any change, such as polymer type, physical form or a 
significant change in the composition of the matrix.
    9.2 Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample type 
and whenever modifications are made to the method.
    9.2.1 In determining the recovery efficiency, the quadruplet 
sampling system shall be used. Six sets of samples (for a total of 24) 
shall be taken. In each quadruplet set, half of the samples (two out of 
the four) shall be spiked with styrene.
    9.2.2 Prepare the samples as described in section 8 of this method. 
To the vials labeled

[[Page 725]]

``spiked'', add a known amount of styrene that is expected to be present 
in the latex.
    9.2.3 Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. 
Record the concentrations of styrene reported for each pair of spiked 
and unspiked samples with the same vial number.
    9.2.4 For each hydrocarbon, calculate the average recovery 
efficiency (R) using the following equation:

R=[Sigma](R<INF>n</INF>)/12

Where: n = sample number
R<INF>n</INF>=(M<INF>s</INF>-M<INF>u</INF>)/S
M<INF>s</INF>=total mass of compound (styrene) measured in spiked sample 
([micro]g)
M<INF>u</INF>=total mass of compound (styrene) measured in unspiked 
sample ([micro]g)
S=theoretical mass of compound (styrene) spiked into sample ([micro]g)
R=fraction of spiked compound (styrene) recovered

    9.2.5 A different R value should be obtained for each sample type. A 
value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.2.6 R is used to correct all reported results for each compound by 
dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

                            10.0 Calibration

    A styrene control sample will be tested weekly to confirm the FID 
response and calibration.

    10.1 Using the Styrene Certification Solution prepared in 7.8.1, 
perform test analysis as described in 7.8.2 using the equation in 
7.8.2.3 to calculate results.
    10.2 Calculate the weight of styrene in the styrene control sample 
using the following equation:

W<INF>sty</INF>=(F<INF>x</INF> xA<INF>sty</INF> 
xW<INF>is</INF>)A<INF>is</INF>

    The instrument can be considered calibrated if the weight of the 
styrene analyzed is within range of 0.00097-0.00103gms.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Using an auto pipet, add 25ml of Internal Standard Solution to 
a 4 oz. wide-mouth bottle.
    11.2 Using a calibrated auto pipet, add 5.0 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01g latex to the bottle containing the 25ml of 
Internal Standard Solution.
    11.3 Cap the bottle and place on the wrist action shaker. Shake the 
sample for a minimum of five minutes using the timer on the shaker. 
Remove from shaker.
    11.4 Using a disposable pipet, fill the 2ml sample vial with the 
clear alcohol extract. (If the extract is not clear, it should be 
filtered using a funnel and filter paper.) Cap and seal the vial.
    11.5 Place the sample in the autosampler tray and start the GC and 
Integrator. The sample will be injected into the GC by the auto-
injector, and the Integrator will print the results.
    11.6 Gas Chromatograph Conditions

micrometer film thickness

                            12.0 Calculations

    12.1 The integrator is programmed to do the following calculation at 
the end of the analysis:

%ResidualStyrene=(A<INF>x</INF> XW<INF>is</INF>)/(A<INF>is</INF> 
XW<INF>x</INF>)XF<INF>x</INF> X100

Where:
A<INF>x</INF>=Peak area of styrene
A<INF>is</INF>=Peak area of internal standard
W<INF>x</INF>=Weight of sample = 5g
W<INF>is</INF>=Weight of internal std. = 0.00125g
F<INF>x</INF>=Analyzed response factor = 1.0

    12.2 The response factor is determined by analyzing a solution of 
0.02g of styrene and 0.02g of alpha methyl styrene in 100ml of 2-
propanol. Calculate the factor by the following equation:

F<INF>x</INF>=(W<INF>x</INF> xA<INF>is</INF>)/(W<INF>is</INF> 
xA<INF>x</INF>)

Where:
W<INF>x</INF>=Weight of styrene
A<INF>x</INF>=Peak area of styrene
W<INF>is</INF>=Weight of alpha methyl styrene
A<INF>is</INF>=Peak area of alpha methyl styrene

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Performance must be determined for each sample type by 
following the procedures in section 9 of this method.

   Method 313A--Determination of Residual Hydrocarbons in Rubber Crumb

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 This method determines residual toluene and styrene in stripper 
crumb of the of the following types of rubber: polybutadiene (PBR) and 
styrene/butadiene rubber (SBR), both derived from solution 
polymerization processes that utilize toluene as the polymerization 
solvent.

[[Page 726]]

    1.2 The method is applicable to a wide range of concentrations of 
toluene and styrene provided that calibration standards cover the 
desired range. It is applicable at least over the range of 0.01 to 10.0 
% residual toluene and from 0.1 to 3.0 % residual styrene. It is 
probably applicable over a wider range, but this must be verified prior 
to use.
    1.3 The method may also be applicable to other process samples as 
long as they are of a similar composition to stripper crumb. See section 
3.1 of this method for a description of stripper crumb.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 The wet crumb is placed in a sealed vial and run on a headspace 
sampler which heats the vial to a specified temperature for a specific 
time and then injects a known volume of vapor into a capillary GC. The 
concentration of each component in the vapor is proportional to the 
level of that component in the crumb sample and does not depend on water 
content of the crumb.
    2.2 Identification of each component is performed by comparing the 
retention times to those of known standards.
    2.3 Results are calculated by the external standard method since 
injections are all performed in an identical manner. The response for 
each component is compared with that obtained from dosed samples of 
crumb.
    2.4 Measured results of each compound are corrected by dividing each 
by the average recovery efficiency determined for the same compound in 
the same sample type.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Stripper crumb refers to pieces of rubber resulting from the 
steam stripping of a toluene solution of the same polymer in a water 
slurry. The primary component of this will be polymer with lesser 
amounts of entrained water and residual toluene and other hydrocarbons. 
The amounts of hydrocarbons present must be such that the crumb is a 
solid material, generally less that 10 % of the dry rubber weight.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Contamination is not normally a problem since samples are sealed 
into vials immediately on sampling.
    4.2 Cross contamination in the headspace sampler should not be a 
problem if the correct sampler settings are used. This should be 
verified by running a blank sample immediately following a normal or 
high sample. Settings may be modified if necessary if this proves to be 
a problem, or a blank sample may be inserted between samples.
    4.3 Interferences may occur if volatile hydrocarbons are present 
which have retention times close to that of the components of interest. 
Since the solvent makeup of the processes involved are normally fairly 
well defined this should not be a problem. If it is found to be the 
case, switching to a different chromatographic column will probably 
resolve the situation.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 The chemicals specified in this method should all be handled 
according to standard laboratory practices as well as any special 
precautions that may be listed in the MSDS for that compound.
    5.2 Sampling of strippers or other process streams may involve high 
pressures and temperatures or may have the potential for exposure to 
chemical fumes. Only personnel who have been trained in the specific 
sampling procedures required for that process should perform this 
operation. An understanding of the process involved is necessary. Proper 
personal protective equipment should be worn. Any sampling devices 
should be inspected prior to use. A detailed sampling procedure which 
specifies exactly how to obtain the sample must be written and followed.

    7.3 Dry rubber of same type as the stripper crumb samples.

             8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1 Collect a sample of crumb in a manner appropriate for the 
process equipment being sampled.
    8.1.1 If conditions permit, this may be done by passing a stream of 
the crumb slurry through a strainer, thus separating the crumb from the 
water. Allow the water to drain freely, do not attempt to squeeze any 
water from the crumb. Results will not depend on the exact water content 
of the samples. Immediately place several pieces of crumb directly into 
a headspace vial. This should be done with rubber gloves to protect the 
hands from both the heat and from contact with residual hydrocarbons. 
The vial should be between \1/4\ and \1/3\ full. Results do not depend 
on sample size as long as there is sufficient sample to reach an 
equilibrium vapor pressure in the headspace of the vial. Cap and seal 
the vial. Prepare each sample at least in duplicate. This is to minimize 
the effect of the variation that naturally occurs in the composition of 
non homogeneous crumb. The free water is not analyzed by this method and 
should be disposed of appropriately along with any unused rubber crumb.
    8.1.2 Alternatively the process can be sampled in a specially 
constructed sealed bomb which can then be transported to the laboratory. 
The bomb is then cooled to ambient temperature by applying a stream of 
running water. The bomb can then be opened and the crumb separated from 
the water and the vials filled as described in section 8.1.1 of this 
method. The bomb may be stored up to 8 hours prior to transferring the 
crumb into vials.
    8.2 The sealed headspace vials may be run immediately or may be 
stored up to 72 hours prior to running. It is possible that even longer 
storage times may be acceptable, but this must be verified for the 
particular type of sample being analyzed (see section 9.2.3 of this 
method). The main concern here is that some types of rubber eventually 
may flow, thus compacting the crumb so that the surface area is reduced. 
This may have some effect on the headspace equilibration.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 The laboratory is required to operate a formal quality control 
program. This consists of an initial demonstration of the capability of 
the method as well as ongoing analysis of standards, blanks and spiked 
samples to demonstrate continued performance.
    9.1.1 When the method is first set up a calibration is run 
(described in section 10 of this method) and an initial demonstration of 
method capability is performed (described in section 9.2 of this 
method). Also recovery efficiency for each type of sample must be 
determined (see section 9.4 of this method).
    9.1.2 It is permissible to modify this method in order to improve 
separations or make other improvements, provided that all performance 
specifications are met. Each time a modification to the method is made 
it is necessary to repeat the calibration (section 10 of this method), 
the demonstration of method performance (section 9.2 of this method) and 
the recovery efficiency for each type of sample (section 9.4 of this 
method).
    9.1.3 Ongoing performance should be monitored by running a spiked 
rubber standard. If this test fails to demonstrate that the analysis is 
in control, then corrective action must be taken. This method is 
described in section 9.3 of this method.
    9.1.4 If new types of samples are being analyzed then recovery 
efficiency for each new type of sample must be determined. New type 
includes any change, such as polymer type, physical form or a 
significant change in the composition of the matrix.
    9.2 Initial demonstration of method capability to establish the 
accuracy and precision of the method. This is to be run following the 
calibration described in section 10 of this method.
    9.2.1 Prepare a series of identical spiked rubber standards as 
described in section 9.3 of this method. A sufficient number to 
determine statistical information on the test should be run. Ten may be 
a suitable number, depending on the quality control methodology used at 
the laboratory running the tests. These are run in the same manner as 
unknown samples (see section 11 of this method).
    9.2.2 Determine mean and standard deviation for the results. Use 
these to determine the capability of the method and to calculate 
suitable control limits for the ongoing performance check which will 
utilize the same standards.
    9.2.3 Prepare several additional spiked rubber standards and run 2 
each day to determine the suitability of storage of the samples for 24, 
48 and 72 hours or longer if longer storage times are desired.
    9.3 A spiked rubber standard should be run on a regular basis to 
verify system performance. This would probably be done daily if samples 
are run daily. This is prepared in the same manner as the calibration 
standards (section 10.1 of this method), except that only one 
concentration of toluene and styrene is prepared. Choose concentrations 
of toluene and styrene that fall in the middle of the range expected in 
the stripper crumb and then do not change these unless there is a major 
change in the composition of the unknowns. If it becomes necessary to 
change the composition of this standard the initial performance 
demonstration must be repeated with the new standard (section 9.2 of 
this method).

[[Page 728]]

    9.3.1 Each day prepare one spiked rubber standard to be run the 
following day. The dry rubber may be prepared in bulk and stored for any 
length of time consistent with the shelf life of the product. The 
addition of water and hydrocarbons must be performed daily and all the 
steps described under section 10.1 of this method must be followed.
    9.3.2 Run the spiked rubber standard prepared the previous day. 
Record the results and plot on an appropriate control chart or other 
means of determining statistical control.
    9.3.3 If the results for the standard indicate that the test is out 
of control then corrective action must be taken. This may include a 
check on procedures, instrument settings, maintenance or recalibration. 
Samples may be stored (see section 8.2 of this method) until compliance 
is demonstrated.
    9.4 Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample type 
and whenever modifications are made to the method.
    9.4.1 For each sample type collect 12 samples from the process 
(section 8.1 of this method). This should be done when the process is 
operating in a normal manner and residual hydrocarbon levels are in the 
normal range. Half the vials and caps should be tared, labeled 
``spiked'' and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials are labeled 
``unspiked'' and need not be tared but are also numbered 1 through 6. 
Immediately on sampling, the vials should be capped to prevent loss of 
volatiles. Allow all the samples to cool completely to ambient 
temperature. Reweigh each of the vials labeled ``spiked'' to determine 
the weight of wet crumb inside.
    9.4.2 The dry weight of rubber present in the wet crumb is estimated 
by multiplying the weight of wet crumb by the fraction of nonvolatiles 
typical for the sample. If this is not known, an additional quantity of 
crumb may be sampled, weighed, dried in an oven and reweighed to 
determine the fraction of volatiles and nonvolatiles prior to starting 
this procedure.
    9.4.3 To the vials labeled ``spiked'' add an amount of a mixture of 
toluene and styrene that is between 40 and 60 % of the amount expected 
in the crumb. This is done by removing the cap, adding the mixture by 
syringe, touching the tip of the needle to the sample in order to remove 
the drop and then immediately recapping the vials. The mixture is not 
added through the septum, because a punctured septum may leak and vent 
vapors as the vial is heated. The weights of toluene and styrene added 
may be calculated from the volumes of the mixture added, its composition 
and density, or may be determined by the weight of the vials and caps 
prior to and after addition. The exact dry weight of rubber present and 
the concentration of residual toluene and styrene are not known at this 
time so an exact calculation of the concentration of hydrocarbons is not 
possible until the test is completed.
    9.4.4 Place all the vials onto a shaker or tumbler for 24 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 hours. This is essential in order for the hydrocarbons 
to be evenly distributed and completely absorbed into the rubber. If 
this is not followed the toluene and styrene will be mostly at the 
surface of the rubber and high results will be obtained.
    9.4.5 Remove the vials from the shaker and tap them so that all the 
crumb settles to the bottom of the vials. Allow them to stand for 1 hour 
prior to analysis to allow any liquid to drain fully to the bottom.
    9.4.6 Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. 
Record the concentrations of toluene and styrene reported for each pair 
of spiked and unspiked samples with the same vial number.
    9.4.7 Open each of the vials labeled ``spiked'', remove all the 
rubber crumb and place it into a tarred drying pan. Place in a 100 deg C 
oven for two hours, cool and reweigh. Subtract the weight of the tare to 
give the dry weight of rubber in each spiked vial. Calculate the 
concentration of toluene and styrene spiked into each vial as percent of 
dry rubber weight. This will be slightly different for each vial since 
the weights of dry rubber will be different.
    9.4.8 For each hydrocarbon calculate the average recovery efficiency 
(R) using the following equations:

R=R--[Sigma](P<INF>n</INF>)/6 (average of the 6 individual R<INF>n</INF> 
values)

Where:
R<INF>n</INF>=(C<INF>ns</INF>--C<INF>nu)</INF> / S<INF>n</INF>

Where:
n=vial number
Cns=concentration of compound measured in spiked sample number n.
Cnu=concentration of compound measured in unspiked sample number n.
Sn=theoretical concentration of compound spiked into sample n calculated 
in step 9.4.7

    9.4.9 A different R value should be obtained for each compound 
(styrene and toluene) and for each sample type.
    9.4.10 A value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.4.11 R is used to correct all reported results for each compound 
by dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type (see section 12.2 of this method.)

                            10.0 Calibration

    10.1 Calibration standards are prepared by dosing known amounts of 
the hydrocarbons of interest into vials containing known amounts of 
rubber and water.
    10.1.1 Cut a sufficient quantity of dry rubber of the same type as 
will be analyzed into pieces about the same size as that of the crumb. 
Place these in a single layer on a

[[Page 729]]

piece of aluminum foil or other suitable surface and place into a forced 
air oven at 100 [deg]C for four hours. This is to remove any residual 
hydrocarbons that may be present. This step may be performed in advance.
    10.1.2 Into each of a series of vials add 3.0 g of the dry rubber.
    10.1.3 Into each vial add 1.0 ml distilled water or an amount that 
is close to the amount that will be present in the unknowns. The exact 
amount of water present does not have much effect on the analysis, but 
it is necessary to have a saturated environment. The water will also aid 
in the uniform distribution of the spiked hydrocarbons over the surface 
of the rubber after the vials are placed on the shaker (in step 10.1.5 
of this method).
    10.1.4 Into each vial add varying amounts of toluene and styrene by 
microliter syringe and cap the vials immediately to prevent loss. The 
tip of the needle should be carefully touched to the rubber in order to 
transfer the last drop to the rubber. Toluene and styrene may first be 
mixed together in suitable proportions and added together if desired. 
The weights of toluene and styrene added may be calculated from the 
volumes of the mixture added, its composition and density, or may be 
determined by the weight of the vials and caps prior to and after 
addition. Concentrations of added hydrocarbons are calculated as percent 
of the dry rubber weight. At least 5 standards should be prepared with 
the amounts of hydrocarbons added being calculated to cover the entire 
range possible in the unknowns. Retain two samples with no added 
hydrocarbons as blanks.
    10.1.5 Place all the vials onto a shaker or tumbler for 24 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 hours. This is essential in order for the hydrocarbons 
to be evenly distributed and completely absorbed into the rubber. If 
this is not followed the toluene and styrene will be mostly at the 
surface of the rubber and high results will be obtained.
    10.1.6 Remove the vials from the shaker and tap them so that all the 
crumb settles to the bottom of the vials. Allow them to stand for 1 hour 
prior to analysis to allow any liquid to drain fully to the bottom.
    10.2 Run the standards and blanks in the same manner as described 
for unknowns (section 11 of this method), starting with a blank, then in 
order of increasing hydrocarbon content and ending with the other blank.
    10.3 Verify that the blanks are sufficiently free from toluene and 
styrene or any interfering hydrocarbons.
    10.3.1 It is possible that trace levels may be present even in dry 
product. If levels are high enough that they will interfere with the 
calibration then the drying procedure in section 10.1.1 of this method 
should be reviewed and modified as needed to ensure that suitable 
standards can be prepared.
    10.3.2 It is possible that the final blank is contaminated by the 
previous standard. If this is the case review and modify the sampler 
parameters as needed to eliminate this problem. If necessary it is 
possible to run blank samples between regular samples in order to reduce 
this problem, though it should not be necessary if the sampler is 
properly set up.
    10.4 Enter the amounts of toluene and styrene added to each of the 
samples (as calculated in section 10.1.4 of this method) into the 
calibration table and perform a calibration utilizing the external 
standard method of analysis.
    10.5 At low concentrations the calibration should be close to 
linear. If a wide range of levels are to be determined it may be 
desirable to apply a nonlinear calibration to get the best fit.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Place the vials in the tray of the headspace sampler. Enter the 
starting and ending positions through the console of the sampler. For 
unknown samples each is run in duplicate to minimize the effect of 
variations in crumb composition. If excessive variation is noted it may 
be desirable to run more than two of each sample.
    11.2 Make sure the correct method is loaded on the Chemstation. Turn 
on the gas flows and light the FID flame.
    11.3 Start the sequence on the Chemstation. Press the START button 
on the headspace unit. The samples will be automatically injected after 
equilibrating for 30 minutes in the oven. As each sample is completed 
the Chemstation will calculate and print out the results as percent 
toluene and styrene in the crumb based on the dry weight of rubber.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 For each set of duplicate samples calculate the average of the 
measured concentration of toluene and styrene. If more than two 
replicates of each sample are run calculate the average over all 
replicates.
    12.2 For each sample correct the measured amounts of toluene and 
styrene using the following equation:

Corrected Result = C<INF>m</INF>/R

Where:
C<INF>m</INF> = Average measured concentration for that compound.
R = Recovery efficiency for that compound in the same sample type (see 
section 9.4 of this method)

    12.3 Report the recovery efficiency (R) and the corrected results of 
toluene and styrene for each sample.

[[Page 730]]

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 This method can be very sensitive and reproducible. The actual 
performance depends largely on the exact nature of the samples being 
analyzed. Actual performance must be determined by each laboratory for 
each sample type.
    13.2 The main source of variation is the actual variation in the 
composition of non homogeneous crumb in a stripping system and the small 
sample sizes employed here. It therefore is the responsibility of each 
laboratory to determine the optimum number of replicates of each sample 
required to obtain accurate results.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 Samples should be kept sealed when possible in order to prevent 
evaporation of hydrocarbons.
    14.2 When drying of samples is required it should be done in an oven 
which vents into a suitable device that can trap the hydrocarbons 
released.
    14.3 Dispose of samples as described in section 15.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 Excess stripper crumb and water as well as the contents of the 
used sample vials should be properly disposed of in accordance with 
local and federal regulations.
    15.2 Preferably this will be accomplished by having a system of 
returning unused and spent samples to the process.

   Method 313B--The Determination of Residual Hydrocarbon in Solution 
                Polymers by Capillary Gas Chromatography

                                1.0 Scope

    1.1 This method is applicable to solution polymerized polybutadiene 
(PBD).
    1.2 This method quantitatively determines n-hexane in wet crumb 
polymer at levels from 0.08 to 0.15% by weight.
    1.3 This method may be extended to the determination of other 
hydrocarbons in solution produced polymers with proper experimentation 
and documentation.

                         2.0 Principle of Method

    2.1 A weighed sample of polymer is dissolved in chloroform and the 
cement is coagulated with an isopropyl alcohol solution containing a 
specific amount of alpha-methyl styrene (AMS) as the internal standard. 
The extract of this coagulation is then injected into a gas 
chromatograph and separated into individual components. Quantification 
is achieved by the method of internal standardization.

             8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1 A sampling device similar to Figure 1 is used to collect a non-
vented crumb rubber sample at a location that is after the stripping 
operation but before the sample is exposed to the atmosphere.
    8.2 The crumb rubber is allowed to cool before opening the sampling 
device and removing the sample.

collected in the sampling basket.
    8.4 One pound of crumb rubber sample is placed into a polyethylene 
bag. The bag is labeled with the time, date and sample location.
    8.5 The sample should be delivered to the laboratory for testing 
within one hour of sampling.
    8.6 Laboratory testing will be done within 3 hours of the sampling

time exceeds 3 hours in which case refrigeration of the samples is 
recommended.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 For each sample type, 12 samples shall be obtained from the 
process for the recovery study. Half of the vials and caps shall be 
tared, labeled ``spiked'', and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials 
shall be labeled ``unspiked'' and need not be tared, but are also 
numbered 1 through 6.
    9.2 Determine the % moisture content of the crumb sample. After 
determining the % moisture content, the correction factor for 
calculating the dry crumb weight can be determined by using the equation 
in section 12.2 of this method.
    9.3 Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. Record 
the concentrations of the n-hexane content of the mixed hexane reported 
for each pair of spiked and unspiked samples.
    9.4 For the recovery study, each sample of crumb shall be dissolved 
in chloroform containing a known amount of mixed hexane solvent.
    9.5 For each hydrocarbon, calculate the recovery efficiency (R) 
using the following equations:

M<INF>r</INF>=M<INF>s</INF>-M<INF>u</INF>
R=M<INF>r</INF>/S

Where:
M<INF>u</INF>=Measured amount of compound in the unspiked sample
M<INF>s</INF>=Measured amount of compound in the spiked sample
M<INF>r</INF>=Measured amount of the spiked compound
S=Amount of compound added to the spiked sample
R=Fraction of spiked compound recovered

    9.6 Normally a value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.7 R is used to correct all reported results for each compound by 
dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

  Extractable Matter (MCEM) From Selected Sources at Primary Aluminum 
                          Production Facilities

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, 
persons using this

[[Page 733]]

method should have a thorough knowledge of at least the following 
additional test methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 5 of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analytes. Particulate matter (PM). No CAS number assigned. 
Methylene chloride extractable matter (MCEM). No CAS number assigned.
    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the simultaneous 
determination of PM and MCEM when specified in an applicable regulation. 
This method was developed by consensus with the Aluminum Association and 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and has limited precision 
estimates for MCEM; it should have similar precision to Method 5 for PM 
in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A since the procedures are similar for PM.
    1.3 Data quality objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    Particulate matter and MCEM are withdrawn isokinetically from the 
source. PM is collected on a glass fiber filter maintained at a 
temperature in the range of 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F) or such other temperature as specified 
by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the 
Administrator for a particular application. The PM mass, which includes 
any material that condenses on the probe and is subsequently removed in 
an acetone rinse or on the filter at or above the filtration 
temperature, is determined gravimetrically after removal of uncombined 
water. MCEM is then determined by adding a methylene chloride rinse of 
the probe and filter holder, extracting the condensable hydrocarbons 
collected in the impinger water, adding an acetone rinse followed by a 
methylene chloride rinse of the sampling train components after the 
filter and before the silica gel impinger, and determining residue 
gravimetrically after evaporating the solvents.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the EPA.

    6.1 Sample collection. The following items are required for sample 
collection:
    6.1.1 Sampling train. A schematic of the sampling train used in this 
method is shown in Figure 5-1, Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 
Complete construction details are given in APTD-0581 (Reference 2 in 
section 17.0 of this method); commercial models of this train are also 
available. For changes from APTD-0581 and for allowable modifications of 
the train shown in Figure 5-1, Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, see 
the following subsections.

    Note: The operating and maintenance procedures for the sampling 
train are described in APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in section 17.0 of this 
method). Since correct usage is important in obtaining valid results, 
all users should read APTD-0576 and adopt the operating and maintenance 
procedures outlined in it, unless otherwise specified herein. The use of 
grease for sealing sampling train components is not recommended because 
many greases are soluble in methylene chloride. The sampling train 
consists of the following components:

    6.1.1.1 Probe nozzle. Glass or glass lined with sharp, tapered 
leading edge. The angle of taper shall be <=30 [deg], and the taper 
shall be on the outside to preserve a constant internal diameter. The 
probe nozzle shall be of the button-hook or elbow design, unless 
otherwise specified by the Administrator. Other materials of 
construction may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. 
A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling should be 
available. Typical nozzle sizes range from 0.32 to 1.27 cm (\1/8\ to \1/
2\ in.) inside diameter (ID) in increments of 0.16 cm (\1/16\ in.). 
Larger nozzle sizes are also available if higher volume sampling trains 
are used. Each nozzle shall be calibrated according to the procedures 
outlined in section 10.0 of this method.
    6.1.1.2 Probe liner. Borosilicate or quartz glass tubing with a 
heating system capable of maintaining a probe gas temperature at the 
exit end during sampling of 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C 
(248<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F), or such other temperature as 
specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the 
Administrator for a particular application. Because the actual 
temperature at the outlet of the probe is not usually monitored during 
sampling, probes constructed according to APTD-0581 and using the 
calibration curves of APTD-0576 (or calibrated according to the 
procedure outlined in APTD-0576) will be considered acceptable. Either 
borosilicate or quartz glass probe liners may be used for stack 
temperatures up to about 480 [deg]C (900

[[Page 734]]

[deg]F); quartz liners shall be used for temperatures between 480 and 
900 [deg]C (900 and 1,650 [deg]F). Both types of liners may be used at 
higher temperatures than specified for short periods of time, subject to 
the approval of the Administrator. The softening temperature for 
borosilicate glass is 820 [deg]C (1,500 [deg]F) and for quartz glass it 
is 1,500 [deg]C (2,700 [deg]F).
    6.1.1.3 Pitot tube. Type S, as described in section 6.1 of Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other device approved by the 
Administrator. The pitot tube shall be attached to the probe (as shown 
in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to allow constant 
monitoring of the stack gas velocity. The impact (high pressure) opening 
plane of the pitot tube shall be even with or above the nozzle entry 
plane (see Method 2, Figure 2-6b, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) during 
sampling. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall have a known coefficient, 
determined as outlined in section 10.0 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    6.1.1.4 Differential pressure gauge. Inclined manometer or 
equivalent device (two), as described in section 6.2 of Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A. One manometer shall be used for velocity head (Dp) 
readings, and the other, for orifice differential pressure readings.
    6.1.1.5 Filter holder. Borosilicate glass, with a glass frit filter 
support and a silicone rubber gasket. The holder design shall provide a 
positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter. The 
holder shall be attached immediately at the outlet of the probe (or 
cyclone, if used).
    6.1.1.6 Filter heating system. Any heating system capable of 
maintaining a temperature around the filter holder of 120 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F) during 
sampling, or such other temperature as specified by an applicable 
subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for a 
particular application. Alternatively, the tester may opt to operate the 
equipment at a temperature lower than that specified. A temperature 
gauge capable of measuring temperature to within 3 [deg]C (5.4 [deg]F) 
shall be installed so that the temperature around the filter holder can 
be regulated and monitored during sampling. Heating systems other than 
the one shown in APTD-0581 may be used.
    6.1.1.7 Temperature sensor. A temperature sensor capable of 
measuring temperature to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 [deg]C (5.4 
[deg]F) shall be installed so that the sensing tip of the temperature 
sensor is in direct contact with the sample gas, and the temperature 
around the filter holder can be regulated and monitored during sampling.
    6.1.1.8 Condenser. The following system shall be used to determine 
the stack gas moisture content: four glass impingers connected in series 
with leak-free ground glass fittings. The first, third, and fourth 
impingers shall be of the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing 
the tip with a 1.3 cm (1/2 in.) ID glass tube extending to about 1.3 cm 
(1/2 in.) from the bottom of the flask. The second impinger shall be of 
the Greenburg-Smith design with the standard tip. The first and second 
impingers shall contain known quantities of water (section 8.3.1 of this 
method), the third shall be empty, and the fourth shall contain a known 
weight of silica gel or equivalent desiccant. A temperature sensor 
capable of measuring temperature to within 1 [deg]C (2 [deg]F) shall be 
placed at the outlet of the fourth impinger for monitoring.
    6.1.1.9 Metering system. Vacuum gauge, leak-free pump, temperature 
sensors capable of measuring temperature to within 3 [deg]C (5.4 
[deg]F), dry gas meter (DGM) capable of measuring volume to within 2 
percent, and related equipment, as shown in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A. Other metering systems capable of maintaining 
sampling rates within 10 percent of isokinetic and of determining sample 
volumes to within 2 percent may be used, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator. When the metering system is used in conjunction with a 
pitot tube, the system shall allow periodic checks of isokinetic rates.
    6.1.1.10 Sampling trains using metering systems designed for higher 
flow rates than that described in APTD-0581 or APTD-0576 may be used 
provided that the specifications of this method are met.
    6.1.2 Barometer. Mercury, aneroid, or other barometer capable of 
measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm (0.1 in.) Hg.

    Note: The barometric reading may be obtained from a nearby National 
Weather Service station. In this case, the station value (which is the 
absolute barometric pressure) shall be requested and an adjustment for 
elevation differences between the weather station and sampling point 
shall be made at a rate of minus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) 
elevation increase or plus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) 
elevation decrease.

    6.1.3 Gas density determination equipment. Temperature sensor and 
pressure gauge, as described in sections 6.3 and 6.4 of Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, and gas analyzer, if necessary, as described in 
Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The temperature sensor shall, 
preferably, be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling probe 
in a fixed configuration, such that the tip of the sensor extends beyond 
the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any metal. 
Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in the 
field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in the 
field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement 
with respect to the Type S pitot tube openings (see Method 2, Figure 2-
4, 40

[[Page 735]]

CFR part 60, appendix A). As a second alternative, if a difference of 
not more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be 
introduced, the temperature sensor need not be attached to the probe or 
pitot tube. (This alternative is subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.)
    6.2 Sample recovery. The following items are required for sample 
recovery:
    6.2.1 Probe-liner and probe-nozzle brushes. Nylon or Teflon 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP> bristle brushes with stainless steel wire handles. The 
probe brush shall have extensions (at least as long as the probe) 
constructed of stainless steel, nylon, Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP>, or 
similarly inert material. The brushes shall be properly sized and shaped 
to brush out the probe liner and nozzle.
    6.2.2 Wash bottles. Glass wash bottles are recommended. Polyethylene 
or tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) wash bottles may be used, but they may 
introduce a positive bias due to contamination from the bottle. It is 
recommended that acetone not be stored in polyethylene or TFE bottles 
for longer than a month.
    6.2.3 Glass sample storage containers. Chemically resistant, 
borosilicate glass bottles, for acetone and methylene chloride washes 
and impinger water, 500 ml or 1,000 ml. Screw-cap liners shall either be 
rubber-backed Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> or shall be constructed so as to 
be leak-free and resistant to chemical attack by acetone or methylene 
chloride. (Narrow-mouth glass bottles have been found to be less prone 
to leakage.) Alternatively, polyethylene bottles may be used.
    6.2.4 Petri dishes. For filter samples, glass, unless otherwise 
specified by the Administrator.
    6.2.5 Graduated cylinder and/or balance. To measure condensed water, 
acetone wash and methylene chloride wash used during field recovery of 
the samples, to within 1 ml or 1 g. Graduated cylinders shall have 
subdivisions no greater than 2 ml. Most laboratory balances are capable 
of weighing to the nearest 0.5 g or less. Any such balance is suitable 
for use here and in section 6.3.4 of this method.
    6.2.6 Plastic storage containers. Air-tight containers to store 
silica gel.
    6.2.7 Funnel and rubber policeman. To aid in transfer of silica gel 
to container; not necessary if silica gel is weighed in the field.
    6.2.8 Funnel. Glass or polyethylene, to aid in sample recovery.
    6.3 Sample analysis. The following equipment is required for sample 
analysis:
    6.3.1 Glass or Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> weighing dishes.
    6.3.2 Desiccator. It is recommended that fresh desiccant be used to 
minimize the chance for positive bias due to absorption of organic 
material during drying.
    6.3.3 Analytical balance. To measure to within 0.l mg.
    6.3.4 Balance. To measure to within 0.5 g.
    6.3.5 Beakers. 250 ml.
    6.3.6 Hygrometer. To measure the relative humidity of the laboratory 
environment.
    6.3.7 Temperature sensor. To measure the temperature of the 
laboratory environment.
    6.3.8 Buchner fritted funnel. 30 ml size, fine (<50 micron)-porosity 
fritted glass.
    6.3.9 Pressure filtration apparatus.
    6.3.10 Aluminum dish. Flat bottom, smooth sides, and flanged top, 18 
mm deep and with an inside diameter of approximately 60 mm.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.l Sample collection. The following reagents are required for 
sample collection:
    7.1.1 Filters. Glass fiber filters, without organic binder, 
exhibiting at least 99.95 percent efficiency (<0.05 percent penetration) 
on 0.3 micron dioctyl phthalate smoke particles. The filter efficiency 
test shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM Method D 2986-95A 
(incorporated by reference in Sec. 63.841 of this part). Test data from 
the supplier's quality control program are sufficient for this purpose. 
In sources containing S0<INF>2</INF> or S0<INF>3</INF>, the filter 
material must be of a type that is unreactive to S0<INF>2</INF> or 
S0<INF>3</INF>. Reference 10 in section 17.0 of this method may be used 
to select the appropriate filter.
    7.1.2 Silica gel. Indicating type, 6 to l6 mesh. If previously used, 
dry at l75 [deg]C (350 [deg]F) for 2 hours. New silica gel may be used 
as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or 
better) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
    7.1.3 Water. When analysis of the material caught in the impingers 
is required, deionized distilled water shall be used. Run blanks prior 
to field use to eliminate a high blank on test samples.
    7.1.4 Crushed ice.
    7.1.5 Stopcock grease. Acetone-insoluble, heat-stable silicone 
grease. This is not necessary if screw-on connectors with Teflon'' 
sleeves, or similar, are used. Alternatively, other types of stopcock 
grease may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. 
[Caution: Many stopcock greases are methylene chloride-soluble. Use 
sparingly and carefully remove prior to recovery to prevent 
contamination of the MCEM analysis.]
    7.2 Sample recovery. The following reagents are required for sample 
recovery:
    7.2.1 Acetone. Acetone with blank values < 1 ppm, by weight residue, 
is required. Acetone blanks may be run prior to field use, and only 
acetone with low blank values may be used. In no case shall a blank 
value of greater than 1E-06 of the weight of acetone used be subtracted 
from the sample weight.

    Note: This is more restrictive than Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. At least one vendor (Supelco Incorporated located in 
Bellefonte, Pennsylvania) lists <1 mg/l as

[[Page 736]]

residue for its Environmental Analysis Solvents.

    7.2.2 Methylene chloride. Methylene chloride with a blank value <1.5 
ppm, by weight, residue. Methylene chloride blanks may be run prior to 
field use, and only methylene chloride with low blank values may be 
used. In no case shall a blank value of greater than 1.6E-06 of the 
weight of methylene chloride used be subtracted from the sample weight.

    Note: A least one vendor quotes <1 mg/l for Environmental Analysis 
Solvents-grade methylene chloride.

    7.3 Sample analysis. The following reagents are required for sample 
analysis:
    7.3.l Acetone. Same as in section 7.2.1 of this method.
    7.3.2 Desiccant. Anhydrous calcium sulfate, indicating type. 
Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the 
approval of the Administrator.
    7.3.3 Methylene chloride. Same as in section 7.2.2 of this method.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    Note: The complexity of this method is such that, in order to obtain 
reliable results, testers should be trained and experienced with the 
test procedures.

    8.11 Pretest preparation. It is suggested that sampling equipment be 
maintained according to the procedures described in APTD-0576.
    8.1.1 Weigh several 200 g to 300 g portions of silica gel in 
airtight containers to the nearest 0.5 g. Record on each container the 
total weight of the silica gel plus container. As an alternative, the 
silica gel need not be preweighed but may be weighed directly in its 
impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.
    8.1.2 A batch of glass fiber filters, no more than 50 at a time, 
should placed in a soxhlet extraction apparatus and extracted using 
methylene chloride for at least 16 hours. After extraction, check 
filters visually against light for irregularities, flaws, or pinhole 
leaks. Label the shipping containers (glass or plastic petri dishes), 
and keep the filters in these containers at all times except during 
sampling and weighing.
    8.1.3 Desiccate the filters at 20 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.6 [deg]C 
(68 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 [deg]F) and ambient pressure for at least 
24 hours and weigh at intervals of at least 6 hours to a constant 
weight, i.e., <0.5 mg change from previous weighing; record results to 
the nearest 0.1 mg. During each weighing the filter must not be exposed 
to the laboratory atmosphere for longer than 2 minutes and a relative 
humidity above 50 percent. Alternatively (unless otherwise specified by 
the Administrator), the filters may be oven-dried at 104 [deg]C (220 
[deg]F) for 2 to 3 hours, desiccated for 2 hours, and weighed. 
Procedures other than those described, which account for relative 
humidity effects, may be used, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.
    8.2 Preliminary determinations.
    8.2.1 Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling 
points according to Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or as specified 
by the Administrator. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and the 
range of velocity heads using Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; it 
is recommended that a leak check of the pitot lines (see section 8.1 of 
Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) be performed. Determine the 
moisture content using Approximation Method 4 (section 1.2 of Method 4, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A) or its alternatives to make isokinetic 
sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight, as 
described in section 8.6 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; if 
integrated Method 3 sampling is used for molecular weight determination, 
the integrated bag sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and for 
the same total length of time as, the particulate sample run.
    8.2.2 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads such 
that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain 
isokinetic sampling rates. During the run, do not change the nozzle 
size. Ensure that the proper differential pressure gauge is chosen for 
the range of velocity heads encountered (see section 8.2 of Method 2, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A).
    8.2.3 Select a suitable probe liner and probe length such that all 
traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, consider sampling from 
opposite sides of the stack to reduce the required probe length.
    8.2.4 Select a total sampling time greater than or equal to the 
minimum total sampling time specified in the test procedures for the 
specific industry such that: (1) The sampling time per point is not less 
than 2 minutes (or some greater time interval as specified by the 
Administrator); and (2) the sample volume taken (corrected to standard 
conditions) will exceed the required minimum total gas sample volume. 
The latter is based on an approximate average sampling rate.
    8.2.5 The sampling time at each point shall be the same. It is 
recommended that the number of minutes sampled at each point be an 
integer or an integer plus one-half minute, in order to eliminate 
timekeeping errors.
    8.2.6 In some circumstances (e.g., batch cycles), it may be 
necessary to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to 
obtain smaller gas sample volumes. In these cases, the Administrator's 
approval must first be obtained.
    8.3 Preparation of sampling train.

[[Page 737]]

    8.3.1 During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep 
all openings where contamination can occur covered until just prior to 
assembly or until sampling is about to begin. Place l00 ml of water in 
each of the first two impingers, leave the third impinger empty, and 
transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of preweighed silica gel from its 
container to the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be used, but care 
should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and carried out from 
the impinger during sampling. Place the container in a clean place for 
later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of the 
silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and 
recorded.
    8.3.2 Using a tweezer or clean disposable surgical gloves, place a 
labeled (identified) and weighed filter in the filter holder. Be sure 
that the filter is properly centered and the gasket properly placed so 
as to prevent the sample gas stream from circumventing the filter. Check 
the filter for tears after assembly is completed.
    8.3.3 When glass liners are used, install the selected nozzle using 
a Viton A 0-ring when stack temperatures are less than 260 [deg]C (500 
[deg]F) and an asbestos string gasket when temperatures are higher. See 
APTD-0576 for details. Mark the probe with heat-resistant tape or by 
some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct 
for each sampling point.
    8.3.4 Set up the train as in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, using (if necessary) a very light coat of silicone grease on 
all ground glass joints, greasing only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) 
to avoid possibility of contamination by the silicone grease. Subject to 
the approval of the Administrator, a glass cyclone may be used between 
the probe and filter holder when the total particulate catch is expected 
to exceed 100 mg or when water droplets are present in the stack gas.
    8.3.5 Place crushed ice around the impingers.
    8.4 Leak-check procedures.
    8.4.1 Leak check of metering system shown in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A. That portion of the sampling train from the 
pump to the orifice meter should be leak-checked prior to initial use 
and after each shipment. Leakage after the pump will result in less 
volume being recorded than is actually sampled. The following procedure 
is suggested (see Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A): 
Close the main valve on the meter box. Insert a one-hole rubber stopper 
with rubber tubing attached into the orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect 
and vent the low side of the orifice manometer. Close off the low side 
orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in.) water 
column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch off the tubing, and 
observe the manometer for 1 minute. A loss of pressure on the manometer 
indicates a leak in the meter box; leaks, if present, must be corrected.
    8.4.2 Pretest leak check. A pretest leak-check is recommended but 
not required. If the pretest leak-check is conducted, the following 
procedure should be used.
    8.4.2.1 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set 
the filter and probe heating systems to the desired operating 
temperatures. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. If a Viton A 
0-ring or other leak-free connection is used in assembling the probe 
nozzle to the probe liner, leak-check the train at the sampling site by 
plugging the nozzle and pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum.

    Note: A lower vacuum may be used, provided that it is not exceeded 
during the test.

    8.4.2.2 If an asbestos string is used, do not connect the probe to 
the train during the leak check. Instead, leak-check the train by first 
plugging the inlet to the filter holder (cyclone, if applicable) and 
pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. (See NOTE in section 8.4.2.1 of 
this method). Then connect the probe to the train and perform the leak 
check at approximately 25 mm (1 in.) Hg vacuum; alternatively, the probe 
may be leak-checked with the rest of the sampling train, in one step, at 
380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. Leakage rates in excess of 4 percent of the 
average sampling rate or 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm), whichever is less, 
are unacceptable.
    8.4.2.3 The following leak check instructions for the sampling train 
described in APTD-0576 and APTD-058l may be helpful. Start the pump with 
the bypass valve fully open and the coarse adjust valve completely 
closed. Partially open the coarse adjust valve and slowly close the 
bypass valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not reverse the 
direction of the bypass valve, as this will cause water to back up into 
the filter holder. If the desired vacuum is exceeded, either leak-check 
at this higher vacuum or end the leak check as shown below and start 
over.
    8.4.2.4 When the leak check is completed, first slowly remove the 
plug from the inlet to the probe, filter holder, or cyclone (if 
applicable) and immediately turn off the vacuum pump. This prevents the 
water in the impingers from being forced backward into the filter holder 
and the silica gel from being entrained backward into the third 
impinger.
    8.4.3 Leak checks during sample run. If, during the sampling run, a 
component (e.g., filter assembly or impinger) change becomes necessary, 
a leak check shall be conducted immediately before the change is made. 
The leak check shall be done according to the procedure outlined in 
section 8.4.2 of this method, except that it shall be done at a vacuum 
equal to or greater than the maximum value recorded up to that point in 
the test. If

[[Page 738]]

the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 
cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the 
results are acceptable, and no correction will need to be applied to the 
total volume of dry gas metered; if, however, a higher leakage rate is 
obtained, either record the leakage rate and plan to correct the sample 
volume as shown in section 12.3 of this method or void the sample run.

    Note: Immediately after component changes, leak checks are optional; 
if such leak checks are done, the procedure outlined in section 8.4.2 of 
this method should be used.

    8.4.4 Post-test leak check. A leak check is mandatory at the 
conclusion of each sampling run. The leak check shall be performed in 
accordance with the procedures outlined in section 8.4.2 of this method, 
except that it shall be conducted at a vacuum equal to or greater than 
the maximum value reached during the sampling run. If the leakage rate 
is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent 
of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are 
acceptable, and no correction need be applied to the total volume of dry 
gas metered. If, however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, either 
record the leakage rate and correct the sample volume, as shown in 
section 12.4 of this method, or void the sampling run.
    8.5 Sampling train operation. During the sampling run, maintain an 
isokinetic sampling rate (within l0 percent of true isokinetic unless 
otherwise specified by the Administrator) and a temperature around the 
filter of 120 14 [deg]C (248 25 [deg]F), or such other temperature as 
specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the 
Administrator.
    8.5.1 For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as 
the one shown in Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Be 
sure to record the initial reading. Record the DGM readings at the 
beginning and end of each sampling time increment, when changes in flow 
rates are made, before and after each leak-check, and when sampling is 
halted. Take other readings indicated by Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A at least once at each sample point during each time 
increment and additional readings when significant changes (20 percent 
variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional adjustments 
in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the manometer level 
and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature changes, make 
periodic checks during the traverse.
    8.5.2 Clean the portholes prior to the test run to minimize the 
chance of sampling deposited material. To begin sampling, remove the 
nozzle cap and verify that the filter and probe heating systems are up 
to temperature and that the pitot tube and probe are properly 
positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point with the tip 
pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump and 
adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs are available, 
which aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate 
without excessive computations. These nomographs are designed for use 
when the Type S pitot tube coefficient (C<INF>p</INF>) is 0.85 <greek-i> 
0.02 and the stack gas equivalent density (dry molecular weight) is 29 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>4. APTD-0576 details the procedure for using the 
nomographs. If C<INF>p</INF> and M<INF>d</INF> are outside the above-
stated ranges, do not use the nomographs unless appropriate steps (see 
Reference 7 in section 17.0 of this method) are taken to compensate for 
the deviations.
    8.5.3 When the stack is under significant negative pressure (height 
of impinger stem), close the coarse adjust valve before inserting the 
probe into the stack to prevent water from backing into the filter 
holder. If necessary, the pump may be turned on with the coarse adjust 
valve closed.
    8.5.4 When the probe is in position, block off the openings around 
the probe and porthole to prevent unrepresentative dilution of the gas 
stream.
    8.5.5 Traverse the stack cross-section, as required by Method 1, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A or as specified by the Administrator, being 
careful not to bump the probe nozzle into the stack walls when sampling 
near the walls or when removing or inserting the probe through the 
portholes; this minimizes the chance of extracting deposited material.
    8.5.6 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the 
temperature around the filter holder at the proper level; add more ice 
and, if necessary, salt to maintain a temperature of less than 20 [deg]C 
(68 [deg]F) at the condenser/silica gel outlet. Also, periodically check 
the level and zero of the manometer.
    8.5.7 If the pressure drop across the filter becomes too high, 
making isokinetic sampling difficult to maintain, the filter may be 
replaced in the midst of the sample run. It is recommended that another 
complete filter assembly be used rather than attempting to change the 
filter itself. Before a new filter assembly is installed, conduct a leak 
check (see section 8.4.3 of this method). The total PM weight shall 
include the summation of the filter assembly catches.
    8.5.8 A single train shall be used for the entire sample run, except 
in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more separate 
ducts or at two or more different locations within the same duct, or in 
cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of trains. In all 
other situations, the use of two or more trains will be subject to the 
approval of the Administrator.

    Note: When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of the 
front-half and (if applicable) impinger catches from each train shall be 
performed, unless identical nozzle

[[Page 739]]

sizes were used in all trains, in which case the front-half catches from 
the individual trains may be combined (as may the impinger catches) and 
one analysis of the front-half catch and one analysis of the impinger 
catch may be performed.

    8.5.9 At the end of the sample run, turn off the coarse adjust 
valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, 
record the final DGM reading, and then conduct a post-test leak check, 
as outlined in section 8.4.4 of this method. Also leak-check the pitot 
lines as described in section 8.1 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A. The lines must pass this leak check in order to validate the velocity 
head data.
    8.6 Calculation of percent isokinetic. Calculate percent isokinetic 
(see Calculations, section 12.12 of this method) to determine whether a 
run was valid or another test run should be made. If there was 
difficulty in maintaining isokinetic rates because of source conditions, 
consult the Administrator for possible variance on the isokinetic rates.
    8.7 Sample recovery.
    8.7.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is 
removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the 
probe to cool.
    8.7.2 When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external PM 
near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap over it to prevent 
losing or gaining PM. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the 
sampling train is cooling down. This would create a vacuum in the filter 
holder, thus drawing water from the impingers into the filter holder.
    8.7.3 Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, remove the 
probe from the sample train, wipe off the silicone grease, and cap the 
open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that 
might be present. Wipe off the silicone grease from the filter inlet 
where the probe was fastened and cap it. Remove the umbilical cord from 
the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used 
between the first impinger or condenser and the filter holder, 
disconnect the line at the filter holder and let any condensed water or 
liquid drain into the impingers or condenser. After wiping off the 
silicone grease, cap off the filter holder outlet and impinger inlet. 
Ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps may be used to close 
these openings.
    8.7.4 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to the cleanup 
area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so that the 
chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be minimized.
    8.7.5 Save a portion of the acetone and methylene chloride used for 
cleanup as blanks. Take 200 ml of each solvent directly from the wash 
bottle being used and place it in glass sample containers labeled 
``acetone blank'' and ``methylene chloride blank,'' respectively.
    8.7.6 Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and note any 
abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows:
    8.7.6.1 Container No. 1. Carefully remove the filter from the filter 
holder, and place it in its identified petri dish container. Use a pair 
of tweezers and/or clean disposable surgical gloves to handle the 
filter. If it is necessary to fold the filter, do so such that the PM 
cake is inside the fold. Using a dry nylon bristle brush and/or a sharp-
edged blade, carefully transfer to the petri dish any PM and/or filter 
fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket. Seal the container.
    8.7.6.2 Container No. 2. Taking care to see that dust on the outside 
of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, 
quantitatively recover PM or any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe 
fitting, probe liner, and front half of the filter holder by washing 
these components with acetone and placing the wash in a glass container. 
Perform the acetone rinse as follows:
    8.7.6.2.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle and clean the inside 
surface by rinsing with acetone from a wash bottle and brushing with a 
nylon bristle brush. Brush until the acetone rinse shows no visible 
particles, after which make a final rinse of the inside surface with 
acetone.
    8.7.6.2.2 Brush and rinse the inside parts of the Swagelok fitting 
with acetone in a similar way until no visible particles remain.
    8.7.6.2.3 Rinse the probe liner with acetone by tilting and rotating 
the probe while squirting acetone into its upper end so that all inside 
surfaces are wetted with acetone. Let the acetone drain from the lower 
end into the sample container. A funnel (glass or polyethylene) may be 
used to aid in transferring liquid washes to the container. Follow the 
acetone rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined 
position, squirt acetone into the upper end as the probe brush is being 
pushed with a twisting action through the probe, hold a sample container 
under the lower end of the probe, and catch any acetone and PM that is 
brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or 
more until no visible PM is carried out with the acetone or until none 
remains in the probe liner on visual inspection. With stainless steel or 
other metal probes, run the brush through in the above-described manner 
at least six times, since metal probes have small crevices in which PM 
can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with acetone and quantitatively 
collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make 
a final acetone rinse of the probe as described above.
    8.7.6.2.4 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to 
minimize sample

[[Page 740]]

losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from 
contamination.
    8.7.6.2.5 After ensuring that all joints have been wiped clean of 
silicone grease, clean the inside of the front half of the filter holder 
by rubbing the surfaces with a nylon bristle brush and rinsing with 
acetone. Rinse each surface three times or more if needed to remove 
visible particulate. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. 
Carefully rinse out the glass cyclone also (if applicable).
    8.7.6.2.6 After rinsing the nozzle, probe, and front half of the 
filter holder with acetone, repeat the entire procedure with methylene 
chloride and save in a separate No. 2M container.
    8.7.6.2.7 After acetone and methylene chloride washings and PM have 
been collected in the proper sample containers, tighten the lid on the 
sample containers so that acetone and methylene chloride will not leak 
out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid 
level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label each 
container to identify clearly its contents.
    8.7.6.3 Container No. 3. Note the color of the indicating silica gel 
to determine whether it has been completely spent, and make a notation 
of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth impinger to 
its original container and seal the container. A funnel may make it 
easier to pour the silica gel without spilling. A rubber policeman may 
be used as an aid in removing the silica gel from the impinger. It is 
not necessary to remove the small amount of dust particles that may 
adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to remove. Since the gain 
in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use any water 
or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available 
in the field, follow the procedure for Container No. 3 in section 11.2.3 
of this method.
    8.7.6.4 Impinger water. Treat the impingers as follows:
    8.7.6.4.1 Make a notation of any color or film in the liquid catch. 
Measure the liquid that is in the first three impingers to within 1 ml 
by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to within 0.5 g by using 
a balance (if one is available). Record the volume or weight of liquid 
present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content 
of the effluent gas.
    8.7.6.4.2 Following the determination of the volume of liquid 
present, rinse the back half of the train with water, add it to the 
impinger catch, and store it in a container labeled 3W (water).
    8.7.6.4.3 Following the water rinse, rinse the back half of the 
train with acetone to remove the excess water to enhance subsequent 
organic recovery with methylene chloride and quantitatively recover to a 
container labeled 3S (solvent) followed by at least three sequential 
rinsings with aliquots of methylene chloride. Quantitatively recover to 
the same container labeled 3S. Record separately the amount of both 
acetone and methylene chloride used to the nearest 1 ml or 0.5g.

    Note: Because the subsequent analytical finish is gravimetric, it is 
okay to recover both solvents to the same container. This would not be 
recommended if other analytical finishes were required.

    8.8 Sample transport. Whenever possible, containers should be 
shipped in such a way that they remain upright at all times.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9.2 Volume metering system checks. The following quality control 
procedures are suggested to check the volume metering system calibration 
values at the field test site prior to sample collection. These 
procedures are optional.
    9.2.1 Meter orifice check. Using the calibration data obtained 
during the calibration procedure described in section 10.3 of this 
method, determine the [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> for the metering system 
orifice. The [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> is the orifice pressure differential 
in units of in. H<INF>2</INF>0 that correlates to 0.75 cfm of air at 528 
[deg]R and 29.92 in. Hg. The [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> is calculated as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.008

Where

0.0319 = (0.0567 in. Hg/ [deg]R)(0.75 cfm)\2\;
[Delta]H = Average pressure differential across the orifice meter, in. 
H<INF>2</INF>0;

[[Page 741]]

T<INF>m</INF> = Absolute average DGM temperature, [deg]R;
[Theta] = Total sampling time, min;
P<INF>bar</INF> = Barometric pressure, in. Hg;
Y = DGM calibration factor, dimensionless;
V<INF>m</INF> = Volume of gas sample as measured by DGM, dcf.

    9.2.1.1 Before beginning the field test (a set of three runs usually 
constitutes a field test), operate the metering system (i.e., pump, 
volume meter, and orifice) at the [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> pressure 
differential for 10 minutes. Record the volume collected, the DGM 
temperature, and the barometric pressure. Calculate a DGM calibration 
check value, Y<INF>c</INF>, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.009

Where

Y<INF>c</INF> = DGM calibration check value, dimensionless;
10 = Run time, min.

    9.2.1.2 Compare the Y<INF>c</INF> value with the dry gas meter 
calibration factor Y to determine that: 0.97 Y < Y<INF>c</INF> < 1.03Y. 
If the Y<INF>c</INF> value is not within this range, the volume metering 
system should be investigated before beginning the test.
    9.2.2 Calibrated critical orifice. A calibrated critical orifice, 
calibrated against a wet test meter or spirometer and designed to be 
inserted at the inlet of the sampling meter box, may be used as a 
quality control check by following the procedure of section 16.2 of this 
method.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.

    10.1 Probe nozzle. Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their 
initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the ID of the 
nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in.). Make three separate 
measurements using different diameters each time, and obtain the average 
of the measurements. The difference between the high and low numbers 
shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in.). When nozzles become nicked, dented, 
or corroded, they shall be reshaped, sharpened, and recalibrated before 
use. Each nozzle shall be permanently and uniquely identified.
    10.2 Pitot tube assembly. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be 
calibrated according to the procedure outlined in section 10.1 of Method 
2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    10.3 Metering system.
    10.3.1 Calibration prior to use. Before its initial use in the 
field, the metering system shall be calibrated as follows: Connect the 
metering system inlet to the outlet of a wet test meter that is accurate 
to within 1 percent. Refer to Figure 5-5 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. The wet test meter should have a capacity of 30 liters/
revolution (1 ft\3\/rev). A spirometer of 400 liters (14 ft\3\) or more 
capacity, or equivalent, may be used for this calibration, although a 
wet test meter is usually more practical. The wet test meter should be 
periodically calibrated with a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter 
to ensure the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test 
meters of other sizes may be used, provided that the specified 
accuracies of the procedure are maintained. Run the metering system pump 
for about 15 minutes with the orifice manometer indicating a median 
reading, as expected in field use, to allow the pump to warm up and to 
permit the interior surface of the wet test meter to be thoroughly 
wetted. Then, at each of a minimum of three orifice manometer settings, 
pass an exact quantity of gas through the wet test meter and note the 
gas volume indicated by the DGM. Also note the barometric pressure and 
the temperatures of the wet test meter, the inlet of the DGM, and the 
outlet of the DGM. Select the highest and lowest orifice settings to 
bracket the expected field operating range of the orifice. Use a minimum 
volume of 0.15 m\3\ (5 cf) at all orifice settings. Record all the data 
on a form similar to Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, 
and calculate Y (the DGM calibration factor) and [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> 
(the orifice calibration factor) at each orifice setting, as shown on 
Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Allowable tolerances 
for individual Y and [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> values are given in Figure 5-6 
of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Use the average of the Y values 
in the calculations in section 12 of this method.
    10.3.1.1 Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested 
that a leak check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm 
pumps, the normal leak check procedure will not detect leakages within 
the pump. For these cases the following leak check procedure is 
suggested: make a 10-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 
cfm); at the end of the run, take the difference of the measured wet 
test meter and DGM volumes; divide the difference by 10 to get the leak 
rate. The leak rate should not exceed 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm).
    10.3.2 Calibration after use. After each field use, the calibration 
of the metering system shall be checked by performing three calibration 
runs at a single, intermediate orifice setting (based on the previous 
field test) with the vacuum set at the maximum value reached during the 
test series. To adjust the vacuum, insert a valve between the wet test 
meter and the inlet of the metering system. Calculate the average value 
of the DGM calibration factor. If the value has changed by more than 5 
percent, recalibrate the meter over the full range of orifice settings, 
as previously detailed.


[[Page 742]]


    Note: Alternative procedures, e.g., rechecking the orifice meter 
coefficient, may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.

    10.3.3 Acceptable variation in calibration. If the DGM coefficient 
values obtained before and after a test series differ by more than 5 
percent, either the test series shall be voided or calculations for the 
test series shall be performed using whichever meter coefficient value 
(i.e., before or after) gives the lower value of total sample volume.
    10.4 Probe heater calibration. Use a heat source to generate air 
heated to selected temperatures that approximate those expected to occur 
in the sources to be sampled. Pass this air through the probe at a 
typical sample flow rate while measuring the probe inlet and outlet 
temperatures at various probe heater settings. For each air temperature 
generated, construct a graph of probe heating system setting versus 
probe outlet temperature. The procedure outlined in APTD-0576 can also 
be used. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be 
calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used. Also, probes 
with outlet temperature monitoring capabilities do not require 
calibration.

    Note: The probe heating system shall be calibrated before its 
initial use in the field.

    10.5 Temperature sensors. Use the procedure in section 10.3 of 
Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to calibrate in-stack temperature 
sensors. Dial thermometers, such as are used for the DGM and condenser 
outlet, shall be calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers.
    10.6 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Record the data required on a sheet such as the one shown in 
Figure 315-1 of this method.
    11.2 Handle each sample container as follows:
    11.2.1 Container No. 1.
    11.2.1.1 PM analysis. Leave the contents in the shipping container 
or transfer the filter and any loose PM from the sample container to a 
tared glass weighing dish. Desiccate for 24 hours in a desiccator 
containing anhydrous calcium sulfate. Weigh to a constant weight and 
report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. For purposes of this section, 
the term ``constant weight'' means a difference of no more than 0.5 mg 
or 1 percent of total weight less tare weight, whichever is greater, 
between two consecutive weighings, with no less than 6 hours of 
desiccation time between weighings (overnight desiccation is a common 
practice). If a third weighing is required and it agrees within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 mg, then the results of the second weighing should 
be used. For quality assurance purposes, record and report each 
individual weighing; if more than three weighings are required, note 
this in the results for the subsequent MCEM results.
    11.2.1.2 MCEM analysis. Transfer the filter and contents 
quantitatively into a beaker. Add 100 ml of methylene chloride and cover 
with aluminum foil. Sonicate for 3 minutes then allow to stand for 20 
minutes. Set up the filtration apparatus. Decant the solution into a 
clean Buchner fritted funnel. Immediately pressure filter the solution 
through the tube into another clean, dry beaker. Continue decanting and 
pressure filtration until all the solvent is transferred. Rinse the 
beaker and filter with 10 to 20 ml methylene chloride, decant into the 
Buchner fritted funnel and pressure filter. Place the beaker on a low-
temperature hot plate (maximum 40 [deg]C) and slowly evaporate almost to 
dryness. Transfer the remaining last few milliliters of solution 
quantitatively from the beaker (using at least three aliquots of 
methylene chloride rinse) to a tared clean dry aluminum dish and 
evaporate to complete dryness. Remove from heat once solvent is 
evaporated. Reweigh the dish after a 30-minute equilibrium in the 
balance room and determine the weight to the nearest 0.1 mg. Conduct a 
methylene chloride blank run in an identical fashion.
    11.2.2 Container No. 2.
    11.2.2.1 PM analysis. Note the level of liquid in the container, and 
confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. 
If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample 
or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct 
the final results. Measure the liquid in this container either 
volumetrically to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 ml or gravimetrically to 1 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 g. Transfer the contents to a tared 250 ml 
beaker and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. 
Desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the 
results to the nearest 0.1 mg.
    11.2.2.2 MCEM analysis. Add 25 ml methylene chloride to the beaker 
and cover with aluminum foil. Sonicate for 3 minutes then allow to stand 
for 20 minutes; combine with contents of Container No. 2M and pressure 
filter and evaporate as described for Container 1 in section 11.2.1.2 of 
this method.

                         Notes for MCEM Analysis

    1. Light finger pressure only is necessary on 24/40 adaptor. A 
Chemplast adapter <greek-i>15055-240 has been found satisfactory.
    2. Avoid aluminum dishes made with fluted sides, as these may 
promote solvent ``creep,'' resulting in possible sample loss.
    3. If multiple samples are being run, rinse the Buchner fritted 
funnel twice between samples with 5 ml solvent using pressure 
filtration. After the second rinse, continue the flow of air until the 
glass frit is completely

[[Page 743]]

dry. Clean the Buchner fritted funnels thoroughly after filtering five 
or six samples.

    11.2.3 Container No. 3. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel 
plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. This step may be 
conducted in the field.
    11.2.4 Container 3W (impinger water).
    11.2.4.1 MCEM analysis. Transfer the solution into a 1,000 ml 
separatory funnel quantitatively with methylene chloride washes. Add 
enough solvent to total approximately 50 ml, if necessary. Shake the 
funnel for 1 minute, allow the phases to separate, and drain the solvent 
layer into a 250 ml beaker. Repeat the extraction twice. Evaporate with 
low heat (less than 40 [deg]C) until near dryness. Transfer the 
remaining few milliliters of solvent quantitatively with small solvent 
washes into a clean, dry, tared aluminum dish and evaporate to dryness. 
Remove from heat once solvent is evaporated. Reweigh the dish after a 
30-minute equilibration in the balance room and determine the weight to 
the nearest 0.1 mg.

    11.2.5 Container 3S (solvent).
    11.2.5.1 MCEM analysis. Transfer the mixed solvent to 250 ml 
beaker(s). Evaporate and weigh following the procedures detailed for 
container 3W in section 11.2.4 of this method.
    11.2.6 Blank containers. Measure the distilled water, acetone, or 
methylene chloride in each container either volumetrically or 
gravimetrically. Transfer the ``solvent'' to a tared 250 ml beaker, and 
evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. (Conduct a 
solvent blank on the distilled deionized water blank in an identical 
fashion to that described in section 11.2.4.1 of this method.) Desiccate 
for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the 
nearest 0.l mg.

    Note: The contents of Containers No. 2, 3W, and 3M as well as the 
blank containers may be evaporated at temperatures higher than ambient. 
If evaporation is done at an elevated temperature, the temperature must 
be below the boiling point of the solvent; also, to prevent ``bumping,'' 
the evaporation process must be closely supervised, and the contents of 
the beaker must be swirled occasionally to maintain an even temperature. 
Use extreme care, as acetone and methylene chloride are highly flammable 
and have a low flash point.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

conditions is given in section 4.0 of Method 4, 40 CFR part 60, appendix

to the standard, and ``I'' is over 110 percent or less than 90 percent, 
the Administrator may opt to accept the results. Reference 4 in the 
Bibliography may be used to make acceptability judgments. If ``I'' is 
judged to be unacceptable, reject the results, and repeat the test.

                       16.0 Alternative Procedures

    16.1 Dry gas meter as a calibration standard. A DGM may be used as a 
calibration standard for volume measurements in place of the wet test 
meter specified in section 16.1 of this method, provided that it is 
calibrated initially and recalibrated periodically as follows:

[[Page 746]]

    16.1.1 Standard dry gas meter calibration.
    16.1.1.1. The DGM to be calibrated and used as a secondary reference 
meter should be of high quality and have an appropriately sized 
capacity, e.g., 3 liters/rev (0.1 ft \3\/rev). A spirometer (400 liters 
or more capacity), or equivalent, may be used for this calibration, 
although a wet test meter is usually more practical. The wet test meter 
should have a capacity of 30 liters/rev (1 ft \3\/rev) and be capable of 
measuring volume to within 1.0 percent; wet test meters should be 
checked against a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure 
the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test meters of 
other sizes may be used, provided that the specified accuracies of the 
procedure are maintained.
    16.1.1.2 Set up the components as shown in Figure 5-7 of Method 5, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A spirometer, or equivalent, may be used in 
place of the wet test meter in the system. Run the pump for at least 5 
minutes at a flow rate of about 10 liters/min (0.35 cfm) to condition 
the interior surface of the wet test meter. The pressure drop indicated 
by the manometer at the inlet side of the DGM should be minimized (no 
greater than 100 mm H<INF>2</INF>O [4 in. H<INF>2</INF>O] at a flow rate 
of 30 liters/min [1 cfm]). This can be accomplished by using large-
diameter tubing connections and straight pipe fittings.
    16.1.1.3 Collect the data as shown in the example data sheet (see 
Figure 5-8 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). Make triplicate 
runs at each of the flow rates and at no less than five different flow 
rates. The range of flow rates should be between 10 and 34 liters/min 
(0.35 and 1.2 cfm) or over the expected operating range.
    16.1.1.4 Calculate flow rate, Q, for each run using the wet test 
meter volume, V<INF>w</INF>, and the run time, q. Calculate the DGM 
coefficient, Y<INF>ds</INF>, for each run. These calculations are as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.017

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.018

Where

K<INF>1</INF> = 0.3858 for international system of units (SI); 17.64 for 
English units;
P<INF>bar</INF> = Barometric pressure, mm Hg (in Hg);
V<INF>w</INF> = Wet test meter volume, liter (ft\3\);
t<INF>w</INF> = Average wet test meter temperature, [deg]C ([deg]F);
t<INF>std</INF> = 273 [deg]C for SI units; 460 [deg]F for English units;
[Theta] = Run time, min;
t<INF>ds</INF> = Average dry gas meter temperature, [deg]C ([deg]F);
V<INF>ds</INF> = Dry gas meter volume, liter (ft\3\);
[Delta]p = Dry gas meter inlet differential pressure, mm H<INF>2</INF>O 
(in H<INF>2</INF>O).

    16.1.1.5 Compare the three Y<INF>ds</INF> values at each of the flow 
rates and determine the maximum and minimum values. The difference 
between the maximum and minimum values at each flow rate should be no 
greater than 0.030. Extra sets of triplicate runs may be made in order 
to complete this requirement. In addition, the meter coefficients should 
be between 0.95 and 1.05. If these specifications cannot be met in three 
sets of successive triplicate runs, the meter is not suitable as a 
calibration standard and should not be used as such. If these 
specifications are met, average the three Y<INF>ds</INF> values at each 
flow rate resulting in five average meter coefficients, Y<INF>ds</INF>.
    16.1.1.6 Prepare a curve of meter coefficient, Y<INF>ds</INF>, 
versus flow rate, Q, for the DGM. This curve shall be used as a 
reference when the meter is used to calibrate other DGMs and to 
determine whether recalibration is required.
    16.1.2 Standard dry gas meter recalibration.
    16.1.2.1 Recalibrate the standard DGM against a wet test meter or 
spirometer annually or after every 200 hours of operation, whichever 
comes first. This requirement is valid provided the standard DGM is kept 
in a laboratory and, if transported, cared for as any other laboratory 
instrument. Abuse to the standard meter may cause a change in the 
calibration and will require more frequent recalibrations.
    16.1.2.2 As an alternative to full recalibration, a two-point 
calibration check may be made. Follow the same procedure and equipment 
arrangement as for a full recalibration, but run the meter at only two 
flow rates (suggested rates are 14 and 28 liters/min [0.5 and 1.0 cfm]). 
Calculate the meter coefficients for these two points, and compare the

[[Page 747]]

values with the meter calibration curve. If the two coefficients are 
within 1.5 percent of the calibration curve values at the same flow 
rates, the meter need not be recalibrated until the next date for a 
recalibration check.
    6.2 Critical orifices as calibration standards. Critical orifices 
may be used as calibration standards in place of the wet test meter 
specified in section 10.3 of this method, provided that they are 
selected, calibrated, and used as follows:
    16.2.1 Selection of critical orifices.
    16.2.1.1 The procedure that follows describes the use of hypodermic 
needles or stainless steel needle tubing that has been found suitable 
for use as critical orifices. Other materials and critical orifice 
designs may be used provided the orifices act as true critical orifices; 
i.e., a critical vacuum can be obtained, as described in section 
7.2.2.2.3 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Select five critical 
orifices that are appropriately sized to cover the range of flow rates 
between 10 and 34 liters/min or the expected operating range. Two of the 
critical orifices should bracket the expected operating range. A minimum 
of three critical orifices will be needed to calibrate a Method 5 DGM; 
the other two critical orifices can serve as spares and provide better 
selection for bracketing the range of operating flow rates. The needle 
sizes and tubing lengths shown in Table 315-1 give the approximate flow 
rates indicated in the table.
    16.2.1.2 These needles can be adapted to a Method 5 type sampling 
train as follows: Insert a serum bottle stopper, 13x20 mm sleeve type, 
into a 0.5 in Swagelok quick connect. Insert the needle into the stopper 
as shown in Figure 5-9 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.2 Critical orifice calibration. The procedure described in this 
section uses the Method 5 meter box configuration with a DGM as 
described in section 6.1.1.9 of this method to calibrate the critical 
orifices. Other schemes may be used, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.
    16.2.2.1 Calibration of meter box. The critical orifices must be 
calibrated in the same configuration as they will be used; i.e., there 
should be no connections to the inlet of the orifice.
    16.2.2.1.1 Before calibrating the meter box, leak-check the system 
as follows: Fully open the coarse adjust valve and completely close the 
bypass valve. Plug the inlet. Then turn on the pump and determine 
whether there is any leakage. The leakage rate shall be zero; i.e., no 
detectable movement of the DGM dial shall be seen for 1 minute.
    16.2.2.1.2 Check also for leakages in that portion of the sampling 
train between the pump and the orifice meter. See section 5.6 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A for the procedure; make any corrections, 
if necessary. If leakage is detected, check for cracked gaskets, loose 
fittings, worn 0-rings, etc. and make the necessary repairs.
    16.2.2.1.3 After determining that the meter box is leakless, 
calibrate the meter box according to the procedure given in section 5.3 
of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Make sure that the wet test 
meter meets the requirements stated in section 7.1.1.1 of Method 5, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A. Check the water level in the wet test meter. 
Record the DGM calibration factor, Y.
    16.2.2.2 Calibration of critical orifices. Set up the apparatus as 
shown in Figure 5-10 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.2.2.1 Allow a warm-up time of 15 minutes. This step is 
important to equilibrate the temperature conditions through the DGM.
    16.2.2.2.2 Leak-check the system as in section 7.2.2.1.1 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The leakage rate shall be zero.
    16.2.2.2.3 Before calibrating the critical orifice, determine its 
suitability and the appropriate operating vacuum as follows: turn on the 
pump, fully open the coarse adjust valve, and adjust the bypass valve to 
give a vacuum reading corresponding to about half of atmospheric 
pressure. Observe the meter box orifice manometer reading, DH. Slowly 
increase the vacuum reading until a stable reading is obtained on the 
meter box orifice manometer. Record the critical vacuum for each 
orifice. Orifices that do not reach a critical value shall not be used.
    16.2.2.2.4 Obtain the barometric pressure using a barometer as 
described in section 6.1.2 of this method. Record the barometric 
pressure, P<INF>bar</INF>, in mm Hg (in. Hg).
    16.2.2.2.5 Conduct duplicate runs at a vacuum of 25 to 50 mm Hg (1 
to 2 in. Hg) above the critical vacuum. The runs shall be at least 5 
minutes each. The DGM volume readings shall be in increments of complete 
revolutions of the DGM. As a guideline, the times should not differ by 
more than 3.0 seconds (this includes allowance for changes in the DGM 
temperatures) to achieve <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent in K'. Record 
the information listed in Figure 5-11 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    16.2.2.2.6 Calculate K' using Equation 315-11.

[[Page 748]]

where

K' = Critical orifice coefficient, [m\3\)([deg]K)<SUP>1/2</SUP>]/[(mm 
Hg)(min)] [(ft\3\)([deg]R)<SUP>1/2</SUP>)]/[(in. Hg)(min)]
T<INF>amb</INF> = Absolute ambient temperature, [deg]K ([deg]R).

    16.2.2.2.7 Average the K' values. The individual K' values should 
not differ by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent from the 
average.
    16.2.3 Using the critical orifices as calibration standards.
    16.2.3.1 Record the barometric pressure.
    16.2.3.2 Calibrate the metering system according to the procedure 
outlined in sections 7.2.2.2.1 to 7.2.2.2.5 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. Record the information listed in Figure 5-12 of Method 5, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.3.3 Calculate the standard volumes of air passed through the 
DGM and the critical orifices, and calculate the DGM calibration factor, 
Y, using the equations below:

V<INF>m(std)</INF> = K<INF>1</INF> V<INF>m</INF> [P<INF>bar</INF> + 
([Delta]H/13.6)]/T<INF>m</INF> Eq. 315-12
V<INF>cr(std)</INF> = K' (P<INF>bar</INF> [Theta])/
T<INF>amb</INF><SUP>1/2</SUP> Eq. 315-13
Y = V<INF>cr(std)</INF>/V<INF>m(std)</INF> Eq. 315-14
where

V<INF>cr(std)</INF> = Volume of gas sample passed through the critical 
orifice, corrected to standard conditions, dscm (dscf).
K' = 0.3858 [deg]K/mm Hg for metric units
= 17.64 [deg]R/in Hg for English units.

    16.2.3.4 Average the DGM calibration values for each of the flow 
rates. The calibration factor, Y, at each of the flow rates should not 
differ by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent from the average.
    16.2.3.5 To determine the need for recalibrating the critical 
orifices, compare the DGM Y factors obtained from two adjacent orifices 
each time a DGM is calibrated; for example, when checking orifice 13/
2.5, use orifices 12/10.2 and 13/5.1. If any critical orifice yields a 
DGM Y factor differing by more than 2 percent from the others, 
recalibrate the critical orifice according to section 7.2.2.2 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

   Method 316--Sampling and Analysis for Formaldehyde Emissions From 
  Stationary Sources in the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries

                            1.0 Introduction

    This method is applicable to the determination of formaldehyde, CAS 
Registry number 50-00-0, from stationary sources in the mineral wool and 
wool fiber glass industries. High purity water is used to collect the 
formaldehyde. The formaldehyde concentrations in the stack samples are 
determined using the modified pararosaniline method. Formaldehyde can be 
detected as low as 8.8 x 10\10\ lbs/cu ft (11.3 ppbv) or as high as 1.8 
x 10\3\ lbs/cu ft (23,000,000 ppbv), at standard conditions over a 1 
hour sampling period, sampling approximately 30 cu ft.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    Gaseous and particulate pollutants are withdrawn isokinetically from 
an emission source and are collected in high purity water. Formaldehyde 
present in the emissions is highly soluble in high purity water. The 
high purity water containing formaldehyde is then analyzed using the 
modified pararosaniline method. Formaldehyde in the sample reacts with 
acidic pararosaniline, and the sodium sulfite, forming a purple 
chromophore. The intensity of the purple color, measured 
spectrophotometrically, provides an accurate and precise measure of the 
formaldehyde concentration in the sample.

                             3.0 Definitions

    See the definitions in the General Provisions of this Subpart.

                            4.0 Interferences

    Sulfite and cyanide in solution interfere with the pararosaniline 
method. A procedure to overcome the interference by each compound has 
been described by Miksch, et al.

                          5.0 Safety [Reserved]

                       6.0 Apparatus and Materials

    6.1 A schematic of the sampling train is shown in Figure 1. This 
sampling train configuration is adapted from EPA Method 5, 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A, procedures.

[[Page 751]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.050

    The sampling train consists of the following components: probe 
nozzle, probe liner, pitot tube, differential pressure gauge, impingers, 
metering system, barometer, and gas density determination equipment.
    6.1.1 Probe Nozzle: Quartz, glass, or stainless steel with sharp, 
tapered (30 [deg] angle) leading edge. The taper shall be on the outside 
to preserve a constant inner diameter. The nozzle shall be buttonhook or 
elbow design. A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling 
should be available in increments of 0.15 cm (\1/16\ in), e.g., 0.32 to 
1.27 cm (\1/8\ to \1/2\ in), or larger if higher volume sampling trains 
are used. Each nozzle shall be calibrated according to the procedure 
outlined in Section 10.1.
    6.1.2 Probe Liner: Borosilicate glass or quartz shall be used for 
the probe liner. The probe shall be maintained at a temperature of 120 
[deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 [deg]F <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F).
    6.1.3 Pitot Tube: The pitot tube shall be Type S, as described in 
Section 2.1 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or any other 
appropriate device. The pitot tube shall be attached to the probe to 
allow constant monitoring of the stack gas velocity. The impact (high 
pressure) opening plane of the pitot tube shall be even with or above 
the nozzle entry plane (see Figure 2-6b, EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A) during sampling. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall have a 
known coefficient, determined as outlined in Section 4 of EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    6.1.4 Differential Pressure Gauge: The differential pressure gauge 
shall be an inclined manometer or equivalent device as described in 
Section 2.2 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. One manometer 
shall be used for velocity-head reading and the other for orifice 
differential pressure readings.
    6.1.5 Impingers: The sampling train requires a minimum of four 
impingers, connected as shown in Figure 1, with ground glass (or 
equivalent) vacuum-tight fittings. For the first, third, and fourth 
impingers, use the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing the tip 
with a 1.3 cm inside diameters (\1/2\ in) glass tube extending to 1.3 cm 
(\1/2\ in) from the bottom of the flask. For the second impinger, use a 
Greenburg-Smith impinger with the standard tip. Place a thermometer 
capable of measuring temperature

[[Page 752]]

to within 1 [deg]C (2 [deg]F) at the outlet of the fourth impinger for 
monitoring purposes.
    6.1.6 Metering System: The necessary components are a vacuum gauge, 
leak-free pump, thermometers capable of measuring temperatures within 3 
[deg]C (5.4 [deg]F), dry-gas meter capable of measuring volume to within 
1 percent, and related equipment as shown in Figure 1. At a minimum, the 
pump should be capable of 4 cfm free flow, and the dry gas meter should 
have a recording capacity of 0-999.9 cu ft with a resolution of 0.005 cu 
ft. Other metering systems may be used which are capable of maintaining 
sample volumes to within 2 percent. The metering system may be used in 
conjunction with a pitot tube to enable checks of isokinetic sampling 
rates.
    6.1.7 Barometer: The barometer may be mercury, aneroid, or other 
barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm Hg 
(0.1 in Hg). In many cases, the barometric reading may be obtained from 
a nearby National Weather Service Station, in which case the station 
value (which is the absolute barometric pressure) is requested and an 
adjustment for elevation differences between the weather station and 
sampling point is applied at a rate of minus 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) per 
30 m (100 ft) elevation increase (rate is plus 2.5 mm Hg per 30 m (100 
ft) of elevation decrease).
    6.1.8 Gas Density Determination Equipment: Temperature sensor and 
pressure gauge (as described in Sections 2.3 and 2.3 of EPA Method 2, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A), and gas analyzer, if necessary (as described 
in EPA Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). The temperature sensor 
ideally should be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling 
probe in a fixed configuration such that the top of the sensor extends 
beyond the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any 
metal. Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in 
the field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in 
the field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement 
with respect to the Type S pitot openings (see Figure 2-7, EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A). As a second alternative, if a difference of 
no more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be 
introduced, the temperature gauge need not be attached to the probe or 
pitot tube.
    6.2 Sample Recovery
    6.2.1 Probe Liner: Probe nozzle and brushes; bristle brushes with 
stainless steel wire handles are required. The probe brush shall have 
extensions of stainless steel, Teflon \TM\, or inert material at least 
as long as the probe. The brushes shall be properly sized and shaped to 
brush out the probe liner, the probe nozzle, and the impingers.
    6.2.2 Wash Bottles: One wash bottle is required. Polyethylene, 
Teflon \TM\, or glass wash bottles may be used for sample recovery.
    6.2.3 Graduated Cylinder and/or Balance: A graduated cylinder or 
balance is required to measure condensed water to the nearest 1 ml or 1 
g. Graduated cylinders shall have division not <ls-thn-eq>2 ml. 
Laboratory balances capable of weighing to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 g 
are required.
    6.2.4 Polyethylene Storage Containers: 500 ml wide-mouth 
polyethylene bottles are required to store impinger water samples.
    6.2.5 Rubber Policeman and Funnel: A rubber policeman and funnel are 
required to aid the transfer of material into and out of containers in 
the field.
    6.3 Sample Analysis
    6.3.1 Spectrophotometer--B&L 70, 710, 2000, etc., or equivalent; 1 
cm pathlength cuvette holder.
    6.3.2 Disposable polystyrene cuvettes, pathlengh 1 cm, volume of 
about 4.5 ml.
    6.3.3 Pipettors--Fixed-volume Oxford pipet (250 [micro]l; 500 
[micro]l; 1000 [micro]l); adjustable volume Oxford or equivalent 
pipettor 1-5 ml model, set to 2.50 ml.
    6.3.4 Pipet tips for pipettors above.
    6.3.5 Parafilm, 2 [deg] wide; cut into about 1'' squares.

                              7.0 Reagents

    7.1 High purity water: All references to water in this method refer 
to high purity water (ASTM Type I water or equivalent). The water purity 
will dictate the lower limits of formaldehyde quantification.
    7.2 Silica Gel: Silica gel shall be indicting type, 6-16 mesh. If 
the silica gel has been used previously, dry at 175 [deg]C (350 [deg]F) 
for 2 hours before using. New silica gel may be used as received. 
Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or better) may be 
used.
    7.3 Crushed Ice: Quantities ranging from 10-50 lbs may be necessary 
during a sampling run, depending upon ambient temperature. Samples which 
have been taken must be stored and shipped cold; sufficient ice for this 
purpose must be allowed.
    7.4 Quaternary ammonium compound stock solution: Prepare a stock 
solution of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (98 percent minimum assay, 
reagent grade) by dissolving 1.0 gram in 1000 ml water. This solution 
contains nominally 1000 [micro]g/ml quaternary ammonium compound, and is 
used as a biocide for some sources which are prone to microbial 
contamination.
    7.5 Pararosaniline: Weigh 0.16 grams pararosaniline (free base; 
assay of 95 percent or greater, C.I. 42500; Sigma P7632 has been found 
to be acceptable) into a 100 ml flask. Exercise care, since 
pararosaniline is a dye and will stain. Using a wash bottle with high-
purity water, rinse the walls of the flask. Add no more than 25 ml 
water. Then,

[[Page 753]]

carefully add 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the flask. The 
flask will become warm after the addition of acid. Add a magnetic stir 
bar to the flask, cap, and place on a magnetic stirrer for approximately 
4 hours. Then, add additional water so the total volume is 100 ml. This 
solution is stable for several months when stored tightly capped at room 
temperature.
    7.6 Sodium sulfite: Weigh 0.10 grams anhydrous sodium sulfite into a 
100 ml flask. Dilute to the mark with high purity water. Invert 15-20 
times to mix and dissolve the sodium sulfite. This solution must be 
prepared fresh every day.
    7.7 Formaldehyde standard solution: Pipet exactly 2.70 ml of 37 
percent formaldehyde solution into a 1000 ml volumetric flask which 
contains about 500 ml of high-purity water. Dilute to the mark with 
high-purity water. This solution contains nominally 1000 [micro]g/ml of 
formaldehyde, and is used to prepare the working formaldehyde standards. 
The exact formaldehyde concentration may be determined if needed by 
suitable modification of the sodium sulfite method (Reference: J.F. 
Walker, Formaldehyde (Third Edition), 1964.). The 1000 [micro]g/ml 
formaldehyde stock solution is stable for at least a year if kept 
tightly closed, with the neck of the flask sealed with Parafilm. Store 
at room temperature.
    7.8 Working formaldehyde standards: Pipet exactly 10.0 ml of the 
1000 [micro]g/ml formaldehyde stock solution into a 100 ml volumetric 
flask which is about half full of high-purity water. Dilute to the mark 
with high-purity water, and invert 15-20 times to mix thoroughly. This 
solution contains nominally 100 [micro]g/ml formaldehyde. Prepare the 
working standards from this 100 [micro]g/ml standard solution and using

The 100 [micro]g/ml stock solution is stable for 4 weeks if kept 
refrigerated between analyses. The working standards (0.25-3.00 
[micro]g/ml) should be prepared fresh every day, consistent with good 
laboratory practice for trace analysis. If the laboratory water is not 
of sufficient purity, it may be necessary to prepare the working 
standards every day. The laboratory must establish that the working 
standards are stable--DO NOT assume that your working standards are 
stable for more than a day unless you have verified this by actual 
testing for several series of working standards.

                          8.0 Sample Collection

    8.1 Because of the complexity of this method, field personnel should 
be trained in and experienced with the test procedures in order to 
obtain reliable results.

                       8.2 Laboratory Preparation

    8.2.1 All the components shall be maintained and calibrated 
according to the procedure described in APTD-0576, unless otherwise 
specified.
    8.2.2 Weigh several 200 to 300 g portions of silica gel in airtight 
containers to the nearest 0.5 g. Record on each container the total 
weight of the silica gel plus containers. As an alternative to 
preweighing the silica gel, it may instead be weighed directly in the 
impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.
    8.3 Preliminary Field Determinations
    8.3.1 Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling 
points according to EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other 
relevant criteria. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and range 
of velocity heads using EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A 
leak-check of the pitot lines according to Section 3.1 of EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, must be performed. Determine the stack gas 
moisture content using EPA Approximation Method 4,40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, or its alternatives to establish estimates of isokinetic 
sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight, as 
described in EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Section 3.6. If 
integrated EPA Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, sampling is used 
for molecular weight determination, the integrated bag sample shall be 
taken simultaneously with, and for the same total length of time as, the 
sample run.
    8.3.2 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads so 
that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain 
isokinetic sampling rates below 28 l/min (1.0 cfm). During the run do 
not change the nozzle. Ensure that the proper differential pressure 
gauge is chosen for the range of velocity heads encountered (see Section 
2.2 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
    8.3.3 Select a suitable probe liner and probe length so that all 
traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, to reduce the length 
of the probe, consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack.
    8.3.4 A minimum of 30 cu ft of sample volume is suggested for 
emission sources with stack concentrations not greater than 23,000,000 
ppbv. Additional sample volume shall be collected as necessitated by the 
capacity of the water reagent and analytical detection limit constraint. 
Reduced sample volume may be collected as long as the final 
concentration of formaldehyde in the stack

[[Page 754]]

sample is greater than 10 (ten) times the detection limit.
    8.3.5 Determine the total length of sampling time needed to obtain 
the identified minimum volume by comparing the anticipated average 
sampling rate with the volume requirement. Allocate the same time to all 
traverse points defined by EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. To 
avoid timekeeping errors, the length of time sampled at each traverse 
point should be an integer or an integer plus 0.5 min.
    8.3.6 In some circumstances (e.g., batch cycles) it may be necessary 
to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to obtain smaller 
gas-volume samples. In these cases, careful documentation must be 
maintained in order to allow accurate calculations of concentrations.
    8.4 Preparation of Collection Train
    8.4.1 During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep 
all openings where contamination can occur covered with Teflon\TM\ film 
or aluminum foil until just prior to assembly or until sampling is about 
to begin.
    8.4.2 Place 100 ml of water in each of the first two impingers, and 
leave the third impinger empty. If additional capacity is required for 
high expected concentrations of formaldehyde in the stack gas, 200 ml of 
water per impinger may be used or additional impingers may be used for 
sampling. Transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of pre-weighed silica gel 
from its container to the fourth impinger. Care should be taken to 
ensure that the silica gel is not entrained and carried out from the 
impinger during sampling. Place the silica gel container in a clean 
place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of 
the silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and 
recorded.
    8.4.3 With a glass or quartz liner, install the selected nozzle 
using a Viton-A O-ring when stack temperatures are <260 [deg]C (500 
[deg]F) and a woven glass-fiber gasket when temperatures are higher. See 
APTD-0576 for details. Other connection systems utilizing either 316 
stainless steel or Teflon\TM\ ferrules may be used. Mark the probe with 
heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper 
distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.
    8.4.4 Assemble the train as shown in Figure 1. During assembly, a 
very light coating of silicone grease may be used on ground-glass joints 
of the impingers, but the silicone grease should be limited to the outer 
portion (see APTD-0576) of the ground-glass joints to minimize silicone 
grease contamination. If necessary, Teflon\TM\ tape may be used to seal 
leaks. Connect all temperature sensors to an appropriate potentiometer/
display unit. Check all temperature sensors at ambient temperatures.
    8.4.5 Place crushed ice all around the impingers.
    8.4.6 Turn on and set the probe heating system at the desired 
operating temperature. Allow time for the temperature to stabilize.
    8.5 Leak-Check Procedures
    8.5.1 Pre-test Leak-check: Recommended, but not required. If the 
tester elects to conduct the pre-test leak-check, the following 
procedure shall be used.
    8.5.1.1 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set 
probe heating system at the desired operating temperature. Allow time 
for the temperature to stabilize. If a Viton-a O-ring or other leak-free 
connection is used in assembling the probe nozzle to the probe liner, 
leak-check the train at the sampling site by plugging the nozzle and 
pulling a 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum.

    Note: A lower vacuum may be used, provided that the lower vacuum is 
not exceeded during the test.

    If a woven glass fiber gasket is used, do not connect the probe to 
the train during the leak-check. Instead, leak-check the train by first 
attaching a carbon-filled leak-check impinger to the inlet and then 
plugging the inlet and pulling a 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum. (A lower 
vacuum may be used if this lower vacuum is not exceeded during the 
test.) Next connect the probe to the train and leak-check at about 25 mm 
Hg (1 in Hg) vacuum. Alternatively, leak-check the probe with the rest 
of the sampling train in one step at 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum. 
Leakage rates in excess of (a) 4 percent of the average sampling rate or 
(b) 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm), whichever is less, are unacceptable.
    8.5.1.2 The following leak-check instructions for the sampling train 
described in APTD-0576 and APTD-0581 may be helpful. Start the pump with 
the fine-adjust valve fully open and coarse-valve completely closed. 
Partially open the coarse-adjust valve and slowly close the fine-adjust 
valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not reverse direction of 
the fine-adjust valve, as liquid will back up into the train. If the 
desired vacuum is exceeded, either perform the leak-check at this higher 
vacuum or end the leak-check, as described below, and start over.
    8.5.1.3 When the leak-check is completed, first slowly remove the 
plug from the inlet to the probe. When the vacuum drops to 127 mm (5 in) 
Hg or less, immediately close the coarse-adjust valve. Switch off the 
pumping system and reopen the fine-adjust valve. Do not reopen the fine-
adjust valve until the coarse-adjust valve has been closed to prevent 
the liquid in the impingers from being forced backward in the sampling 
line and silica gel from being entrained backward into the third 
impinger.
    8.5.2 Leak-checks During Sampling Run:

[[Page 755]]

    8.5.2.1 If, during the sampling run, a component change (e.g., 
impinger) becomes necessary, a leak-check shall be conducted immediately 
after the interruption of sampling and before the change is made. The 
leak-check shall be done according to the procedure described in Section 
10.3.3, except that it shall be done at a vacuum greater than or equal 
to the maximum value recorded up to that point in the test. If the 
leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.0057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) 
or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the 
results are acceptable. If a higher leakage rate is obtained, the tester 
must void the sampling run.

    Note: Any correction of the sample volume by calculation reduces the 
integrity of the pollutant concentration data generated and must be 
avoided.

    8.5.2.2 Immediately after component changes, leak-checks are 
optional. If performed, the procedure described in section 8.5.1.1 shall 
be used.
    8.5.3 Post-test Leak-check:
    8.5.3.1 A leak-check is mandatory at the conclusion of each sampling 
run. The leak-check shall be done with the same procedures as the pre-
test leak-check, except that the post-test leak-check shall be conducted 
at a vacuum greater than or equal to the maximum value reached during 
the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 
0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate 
(whichever is less), the results are acceptable. If, however, a higher 
leakage rate is obtained, the tester shall record the leakage rate and 
void the sampling run.
    8.6 Sampling Train Operation
    8.6.1 During the sampling run, maintain an isokinetic sampling rate 
to within 10 percent of true isokinetic, below 28 l/min (1.0 cfm). 
Maintain a temperature around the probe of 120 [deg]C <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 [deg] <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F).
    8.6.2 For each run, record the data on a data sheet such as the one 
shown in Figure 2. Be sure to record the initial dry-gas meter reading. 
Record the dry-gas meter readings at the beginning and end of each 
sampling time increment, when changes in flow rates are made, before and 
after each leak-check, and when sampling is halted. Take other readings 
required by Figure 2 at least once at each sample point during each time 
increment and additional readings when significant adjustments (20 
percent variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional 
adjustments in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the 
manometer level and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature 
changes, make periodic checks during the traverse.

    8.6.3 Clean the stack access ports prior to the test run to 
eliminate the chance of sampling deposited material. To begin sampling, 
remove the nozzle cap, verify that the probe heating system are at the 
specified temperature, and verify that the pitot tube and probe are 
properly positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point, 
with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start 
the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs, which 
aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate without 
excessive computations, are available. These nomographs are designed for 
use when the Type S pitot tube coefficient is 0.84 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.02 and the stack gas equivalent density (dry molecular 
weight) is equal to 29 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>4. APTD-0576 details the 
procedure for using the nomographs. If the stack gas molecular weight 
and the pitot tube coefficient are outside the above ranges, do not use 
the nomographs unless appropriate steps are taken to compensate for the 
deviations.
    8.6.4 When the stack is under significant negative pressure 
(equivalent to the height of the impinger stem), take care to close the 
coarse-adjust valve before inserting the probe into the stack in order 
to prevent liquid from backing up through the train. If necessary, a low 
vacuum on the train may have to be started prior to entering the stack.
    8.6.5 When the probe is in position, block off the openings around 
the probe and stack access port to prevent unrepresentative dilution of 
the gas stream.
    8.6.6 Traverse the stack cross section, as required by EPA Method 1, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, being careful not to bump the probe nozzle 
into the stack walls when sampling near the walls or when removing or 
inserting the probe through the access port, in order to minimize the 
chance of extracting deposited material.
    8.6.7 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the 
temperature around the probe at the proper levels. Add more ice and, if 
necessary, salt, to maintain a temperature of <20 [deg]C (68 [deg]F) at 
the silica gel outlet.
    8.6.8 A single train shall be used for the entire sampling run, 
except in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more 
separate ducts or at two or more different locations within the same 
duct, or in cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of 
trains. An additional train or trains may also be used for sampling when 
the capacity of a single train is exceeded.
    8.6.9 When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of 
components from each train shall be performed. If multiple trains have 
been used because the capacity of a single train would be exceeded, 
first impingers from each train may be combined, and second impingers 
from each train may be combined.
    8.6.10 At the end of the sampling run, turn off the coarse-adjust 
valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, 
record the final dry gas meter reading, and conduct a post-test leak-
check. Also, check the pitot lines as described in EPA Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A. The lines must pass this leak-check in order to 
validate the velocity-head data.
    8.6.11 Calculate percent isokineticity (see Method 2) to determine 
whether the run was valid or another test should be made.
    8.7 Sample Preservation and Handling
    8.7.1 Samples from most sources applicable to this method have 
acceptable holding times using normal handling practices (shipping 
samples iced, storing in refrigerator at 2 [deg]C until analysis). 
However, forming section stacks and other sources using waste water 
sprays may be subject to microbial contamination. For these sources, a 
biocide (quaternary ammonium compound solution) may be added to 
collected samples to improve sample stability and method ruggedness.
    8.7.2 Sample holding time: Samples should be analyzed within 14 days 
of collection. Samples must be refrigerated/kept cold for the entire 
period preceding analysis. After the samples have been brought to room

[[Page 758]]

temperature for analysis, any analyses needed should be performed on the 
same day. Repeated cycles of warming the samples to room temperature/
refrigerating/rewarming, then analyzing again, etc., have not been 
investigated in depth to evaluate if analyte levels remain stable for 
all sources.
    8.7.3 Additional studies will be performed to evaluate whether 
longer sample holding times are feasible for this method.
    8.8 Sample Recovery
    8.8.1 Preparation:
    8.8.1.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is 
removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the 
probe to cool. When the probe can be handled safely, wipe off all 
external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a 
cap over the tip to prevent losing or gaining particulate matter. Do not 
cap the probe tightly while the sampling train is cooling because a 
vacuum will be created, drawing liquid from the impingers back through 
the sampling train.
    8.8.1.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove 
the probe from the sampling train and cap the open outlet, being careful 
not to lose any condensate that might be present. Remove the umbilical 
cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is 
used, let any condensed water or liquid drain into the impingers. Cap 
off any open impinger inlets and outlets. Ground glass stoppers, Teflon 
\TM\ caps, or caps of other inert materials may be used to seal all 
openings.
    8.8.1.3 Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to an area that is 
clean and protected from wind so that the chances of contaminating or 
losing the sample are minimized.
    8.8.1.4 Inspect the train before and during disassembly, and note 
any abnormal conditions.
    8.8.1.5 Save a portion of the washing solution (high purity water) 
used for cleanup as a blank.
    8.8.2 Sample Containers:
    8.8.2.1 Container 1: Probe and Impinger Catches. Using a graduated 
cylinder, measure to the nearest ml, and record the volume of the 
solution in the first three impingers. Alternatively, the solution may 
be weighed to the nearest 0.5 g. Include any condensate in the probe in 
this determination. Transfer the combined impinger solution from the 
graduated cylinder into the polyethylene bottle. Taking care that dust 
on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into 
the sample, clean all surfaces to which the sample is exposed (including 
the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, first three impingers, and 
impinger connectors) with water. Use less than 400 ml for the entire 
waste (250 ml would be better, if possible). Add the rinse water to the 
sample container.
    8.8.2.1.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle and rinse the inside 
surface with water from a wash bottle. Brush with a bristle brush and 
rinse until the rinse shows no visible particles, after which make a 
final rinse of the inside surface. Brush and rinse the inside parts of 
the Swagelok (or equivalent) fitting with water in a similar way.
    8.8.2.1.2 Rinse the probe liner with water. While squirting the 
water into the upper end of the probe, tilt and rotate the probe so that 
all inside surfaces will be wetted with water. Let the water drain from 
the lower end into the sample container. The tester may use a funnel 
(glass or polyethylene) to aid in transferring the liquid washes to the 
container. Follow the rinse with a bristle brush. Hold the probe in an 
inclined position, and squirt water into the upper end as the probe 
brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe. Hold the 
sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any 
water and particulate matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the 
brush through the probe three times or more. Rinse the brush with water 
and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After 
the brushing, make a final rinse of the probe as describe above.

    Note: Two people should clean the probe in order to minimize sample 
losses. Between sampling runs, brushes must be kept clean and free from 
contamination.

    8.8.2.1.3 Rinse the inside surface of each of the first three 
impingers (and connecting tubing) three separate times. Use a small 
portion of water for each rinse, and brush each surface to which the 
sample is exposed with a bristle brush to ensure recovery of fine 
particulate matter. Make a final rinse of each surface and of the brush, 
using water.
    8.8.2.1.4 After all water washing and particulate matter have been 
collected in the sample container, tighten the lid so the sample will 
not leak out when the container is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the 
height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during 
transport. Label the container clearly to identify its contents.
    8.8.2.1.5 If the first two impingers are to be analyzed separately 
to check for breakthrough, separate the contents and rinses of the two 
impingers into individual containers. Care must be taken to avoid 
physical carryover from the first impinger to the second. Any physical 
carryover of collected moisture into the second impinger will invalidate 
a breakthrough assessment.
    8.8.2.2 Container 2: Sample Blank. Prepare a blank by using a 
polyethylene container and adding a volume of water equal to the total 
volume in Container 1. Process the blank in the same manner as Container 
1.
    8.8.2.3 Container 3: Silica Gel. Note the color of the indicating 
silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent

[[Page 759]]

and make a notation of its condition. The impinger containing the silica 
gel may be used as a sample transport container with both ends sealed 
with tightly fitting caps or plugs. Ground-glass stoppers or Teflon \TM\ 
caps maybe used. The silica gel impinger should then be labeled, covered 
with aluminum foil, and packaged on ice for transport to the laboratory. 
If the silica gel is removed from the impinger, the tester may use a 
funnel to pour the silica gel and a rubber policeman to remove the 
silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small 
amount of dust particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are 
difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture 
calculations, do not use water or other liquids to transfer the silica 
gel. If a balance is available in the field, the spent silica gel (or 
silica gel plus impinger) may be weighed to the nearest 0.5 g.
    8.8.2.4 Sample containers should be placed in a cooler, cooled by 
(although not in contact with) ice. Putting sample bottles in Zip-Lock 
\TM\ bags can aid in maintaining the integrity of the sample labels. 
Sample containers should be placed vertically to avoid leakage during 
shipment. Samples should be cooled during shipment so they will be 
received cold at the laboratory. It is critical that samples be chilled 
immediately after recovery. If the source is susceptible to microbial 
contamination from wash water (e.g. forming section stack), add biocide 
as directed in section 8.2.5.
    8.8.2.5 A quaternary ammonium compound can be used as a biocide to 
stabilize samples against microbial degradation following collection. 
Using the stock quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) solution; add 2.5 ml 
QAC solution for every 100 ml of recovered sample volume (estimate of 
volume is satisfactory) immediately after collection. The total volume 
of QAC solution must be accurately known and recorded, to correct for 
any dilution caused by the QAC solution addition.
    8.8.3 Sample Preparation for Analysis 8.8.3.1 The sample should be 
refrigerated if the analysis will not be performed on the day of 
sampling. Allow the sample to warm at room temperature for about two 
hours (if it has been refrigerated) prior to analyzing.
    8.8.3.2 Analyze the sample by the pararosaniline method, as 
described in Section 11. If the color-developed sample has an absorbance 
above the highest standard, a suitable dilution in high purity water 
should be prepared and analyzed.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Sampling: See EPA Manual 600/4-77-02b for Method 5 quality 
control.
    9.2 Analysis: The quality assurance program required for this method 
includes the analysis of the field and method blanks, and procedure 
validations. The positive identification and quantitation of 
formaldehyde are dependent on the integrity of the samples received and 
the precision and accuracy of the analytical methodology. Quality 
assurance procedures for this method are designed to monitor the 
performance of the analytical methodology and to provide the required 
information to take corrective action if problems are observed in 
laboratory operations or in field sampling activities.
    9.2.1 Field Blanks: Field blanks must be submitted with the samples 
collected at each sampling site. The field blanks include the sample 
bottles containing aliquots of sample recover water, and water reagent. 
At a minimum, one complete sampling train will be assembled in the field 
staging area, taken to the sampling area, and leak-checked at the 
beginning and end of the testing (or for the same total number of times 
as the actual sampling train). The probe of the blank train must be 
heated during the sample test. The train will be recovered as if it were 
an actual test sample. No gaseous sample will be passed through the 
blank sampling train.
    9.2.2 Blank Correction: The field blank formaldehyde concentrations 
will be subtracted from the appropriate sample formaldehyde 
concentrations. Blank formaldehyde concentrations above 0.25 [micro]g/ml 
should be considered suspect, and subtraction from the sample 
formaldehyde concentrations should be performed in a manner acceptable 
to the Administrator.
    9.2.3 Method Blanks: A method blank must be prepared for each set of 
analytical operations, to evaluate contamination and artifacts that can 
be derived from glassware, reagents, and sample handling in the 
laboratory.

                             10 Calibration

    10.1 Probe Nozzle: Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their 
initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the inside 
diameter of the nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in). Make 
measurements at three separate places across the diameter and obtain the 
average of the measurements. The difference between the high and low 
numbers shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in). When the nozzle becomes 
nicked or corroded, it shall be repaired and calibrated, or replaced 
with a calibrated nozzle before use. Each nozzle must be permanently and 
uniquely identified.
    10.2 Pitot Tube: The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be calibrated 
according to the procedure outlined in Section 4 of EPA Method 2, or 
assigned a nominal coefficient of 0.84 if it is not visibly nicked or 
corroded and if it meets design and intercomponent spacing 
specifications.
    10.3 Metering System
    10.3.1 Before its initial use in the field, the metering system 
shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in APTD-

[[Page 760]]

0576. Instead of physically adjusting the dry-gas meter dial readings to 
correspond to the wet-test meter readings, calibration factors may be 
used to correct the gas meter dial readings mathematically to the proper 
values. Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested that a 
leak-check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm pumps, 
the normal leak-check procedure will not delete leakages with the pump. 
For these cases, the following leak-check procedure will apply: Make a 
ten-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm). At the end of 
the run, take the difference of the measured wet-test and dry-gas meter 
volumes and divide the difference by 10 to get the leak rate. The leak 
rate should not exceed 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm).
    10.3.2 After each field use, check the calibration of the metering 
system by performing three calibration runs at a single intermediate 
orifice setting (based on the previous field test). Set the vacuum at 
the maximum value reached during the test series. To adjust the vacuum, 
insert a valve between the wet-test meter and the inlet of the metering 
system. Calculate the average value of the calibration factor. If the 
calibration has changed by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the meter 
over the full range of orifice settings, as outlined in APTD-0576.
    10.3.3 Leak-check of metering system: The portion of the sampling 
train from the pump to the orifice meter (see Figure 1) should be leak-
checked prior to initial use and after each shipment. Leakage after the 
pump will result in less volume being recorded than is actually sampled. 
Use the following procedure: Close the main valve on the meter box. 
Insert a one-hole rubber stopper with rubber tubing attached into the 
orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect and vent the low side of the orifice 
manometer. Close off the low side orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 
13-18 cm (5-7 in) water column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch 
off the tubing and observe the manometer for 1 min. A loss of pressure 
on the manometer indicates a leak in the meter box. Leaks must be 
corrected.

    Note: If the dry-gas meter coefficient values obtained before and 
after a test series differ by <ls-thn-eq>5 percent, either the test 
series must be voided or calculations for test series must be performed 
using whichever meter coefficient value (i.e., before or after) gives 
the lower value of total sample volume.

    10.4 Probe Heater: The probe heating system must be calibrated 
before its initial use in the field according to the procedure outlined 
in APTD-0576. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be 
calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used.
    10.5 Temperature gauges: Use the procedure in section 4.3 of USEPA 
Method 2 to calibrate in-stack temperature gauges. Dial thermometers 
such as are used for the dry gas meter and condenser outlet, shall be 
calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers.
    10.6 Barometer: Adjust the barometer initially and before each test 
series to agree to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) of 
the mercury barometer. Alternately, if a National Weather Service 
Station (NWSS) is located at the same altitude above sea level as the 
test site, the barometric pressure reported by the NWSS may be used.
    10.7 Balance: Calibrate the balance before each test series, using 
Class S standard weights. The weights must be within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent of the standards, or the balance must be 
adjusted to meet these limits.

                       11.0 Procedure for Analysis

    The working formaldehyde standards (0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 
[micro]g/ml) are analyzed and a calibration curve is calculated for each 
day's analysis. The standards should be analyzed first to ensure that 
the method is working properly prior to analyzing the samples. In 
addition, a sample of the high-purity water should also be analyzed and 
used as a ``0'' formaldehyde standard.
    The procedure for analysis of samples and standards is identical: 
Using the pipet set to 2.50 ml, pipet 2.50 ml of the solution to be 
analyzed into a polystyrene cuvette. Using the 250 [micro]l pipet, pipet 
250 [micro]l of the pararosaniline reagent solution into the cuvette. 
Seal the top of the cuvette with a Parafilm square and shake at least 30 
seconds to ensure the solution in the cuvette is well-mixed. Peel back a 
corner of the Parafilm so the next reagent can be added. Using the 250 
[micro]l pipet, pipet 250 [micro]l of the sodium sulfite reagent 
solution into the cuvette. Reseal the cuvette with the Parafilm, and 
again shake for about 30 seconds to mix the solution in the cuvette. 
Record the time of addition of the sodium sulfite and let the color 
develop at room temperature for 60 minutes. Set the spectrophotometer to 
570 nm and set to read in Absorbance Units. The spectrophotometer should 
be equipped with a holder for the 1-cm pathlength cuvettes. Place 
cuvette(s) containing high-purity water in the spectrophotometer and 
adjust to read 0.000 AU.
    After the 60 minutes color development period, read the standard and 
samples in the spectrophotometer. Record the absorbance reading for each 
cuvette. The calibration curve is calculated by linear regression, with 
the formaldehyde concentration as the ``x'' coordinate of the pair, and 
the absorbance reading as the ``y'' coordinate. The procedure is very 
reproducible, and typically will yield values similar to these for the 
calibration curve:

Correlation Coefficient: 0.9999

[[Page 761]]

Slope: 0.50
Y-Intercept: 0.090

The formaldehyde concentration of the samples can be found by using the 
trend-line feature of the calculator or computer program used for the 
linear regression. For example, the TI-55 calculators use the ``X'' key 
(this gives the predicted formaldehyde concentration for the value of 
the absorbance you key in for the sample). Multiply the formaldehyde 
concentration from the sample by the dilution factor, if any, for the 
sample to give the formaldehyde concentration of the original, 
undiluted, sample (units will be micrograms/ml).
    11.1 Notes on the Pararosaniline Procedure
    11.1.1 The pararosaniline method is temperature-sensitive. However, 
the small fluctuations typical of a laboratory will not significantly 
affect the results.
    11.1.2 The calibration curve is linear to beyond 4 ``[micro]g/ml'' 
formaldehyde, however, a research-grade spectrophotometer is required to 
reproducibly read the high absorbance values. Consult your instrument 
manual to evaluate the capability of the spectrophotometer.
    11.1.3 The quality of the laboratory water used to prepare standards 
and make dilutions is critical. It is important that the cautions given 
in the Reagents section be observed. This procedure allows quantitation 
of formaldehyde at very low levels, and thus it is imperative to avoid 
contamination from other sources of formaldehyde and to exercise the 
degree of care required for trace analyses.
    11.1.4 The analyst should become familiar with the operation of the 
Oxford or equivalent pipettors before using them for an analysis. Follow 
the instructions of the manufacturer; one can pipet water into a tared 
container on any analytical balance to check pipet accuracy and 
precision. This will also establish if the proper technique is being 
used. Always use a new tip for each pipetting operation.
    11.1.5 This procedure follows the recommendations of ASTM Standard 
Guide D 3614, reading all solutions versus water in the reference cell. 
This allows the absorbance of the blank to be tracked on a daily basis. 
Refer to ASTM D 3614 for more information.

                            12.0 Calculations

    Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal figure 
beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures after final 
calculations.
    12.1 Calculations of Total Formaldehyde
    12.1.1 To determine the total formaldehyde in mg, use the following 
equation if biocide was not used:
    Total mg formaldehyde=
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.043
    
Where:

C<INF>d</INF> = measured conc. formaldehyde, [micro]g/ml

Where:

C<INF>d</INF> = measured conc. formaldehyde, [micro]g/ml
V = total volume of stack sample, ml
B = total volume of biocide added to sample, ml
DF = dilution factor

    12.2 Formaldehyde concentration (mg/m\3\) in stack gas. Determine 
the formaldehyde concentration (mg/m\3\) in the stack gas using the 
following equation: Formaldehyde concentration (mg/m\3\) =
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.045

Where:

K = 35.31 cu ft/m\3\ for V<INF>m</INF>(std) in English units, or
K = 1.00 m\3\/m\3\ for V<INF>m</INF>(std) in metric units
V<INF>m</INF>(std) = volume of gas sample measured by a dry gas meter, 
corrected to standard conditions, dscm (dscf)

    12.3 Average dry gas meter temperature and average orifice pressure 
drop are obtained from the data sheet.
    12.4 Dry Gas Volume: Calculate V<INF>m</INF>(std) and adjust for 
leakage, if necessary, using the equation in Section 6.3 of EPA Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    12.5 Volume of Water Vapor and Moisture Content: Calculated the 
volume of water vapor and moisture content from equations 5-2 and 5-3 of 
EPA Method 5.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    The precision of this method is estimated to be better than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent, expressed as <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> the 
percent relative standard deviation.

Method 318--Extractive FTIR Method for the Measurement of Emissions From 
             the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    This method has been validated and approved for mineral wool and 
wool fiberglass sources. This method may not be applied to other source 
categories without validation and approval by the Administrator 
according to the procedures in Test Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix 
A. For sources seeking to apply FTIR to other source categories, Test 
Method 320 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) may be utilized.
    1.1 Scope. The analytes measured by this method and their CAS 
numbers are:

Carbon Monoxide 630-08-0
Carbonyl Sulfide 463-58-1
Formaldehyde 50-00-0
Methanol 1455-13-6
Phenol 108-95-2
    1.2 Applicability

    1.2.1 This method is applicable for the determination of 
formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, carbonyl sulfide (COS) and carbon 
monoxide (CO) concentrations in controlled and uncontrolled emissions 
from manufacturing processes using phenolic resins. The compounds are 
analyzed in the mid-infrared spectral region (about 400 to 4000 cm-1 or 
25 to 2.5 [micro]m). Suggested analytical regions are given below (Table 
1). Slight deviations from these recommended regions may be necessary 
due to variations in moisture content and ammonia concentration from 
source to source.

                                       Table 1--Example Analytical Regions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Compound                Analytical region (cm-1) FLm - FUm            Potential interferants
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formaldehyde.....................  2840.93-2679.83.......................  Water, Methane.
Phenol...........................  1231.32-1131.47.......................  Water, Ammonia, Methane.
Methanol.........................  1041.56-1019.95.......................  Water, Ammonia.
COS \a\..........................  2028.4-2091.9.........................  Water, CO2 CO.
CO \a\...........................  2092.1-2191.8.........................  Water, CO2, COS.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\a\ Suggested analytical regions assume about 15 percent moisture and CO2, and that COS and CO have about the
  same absorbance (in the range of 10 to 50 ppm). If CO and COS are hundreds of ppm or higher, then CO2 and
  moisture interference is reduced. If CO or COS is present at high concentration and the other at low
  concentration, then a shorter cell pathlength may be necessary to measure the high concentration component.

1.2.2 This method does not apply when: (a) Polymerization of 
formaldehyde occurs, (b) moisture condenses in either the sampling 
system or the instrumentation, and (c) when moisture content of the gas 
stream is so high relative to the analyte concentrations that it causes 
severe spectral interference.
    1.3 Method Range and Sensitivity
    1.3.1 The analytical range is a function of instrumental design and 
composition of the gas stream. Theoretical detection limits depend, in 
part, on (a) the absorption coefficient of the compound in the 
analytical frequency region, (b) the spectral resolution, (c) 
interferometer sampling time, (d) detector sensitivity and response, and 
(e) absorption pathlength.
    1.3.2 Practically, there is no upper limit to the range. The 
practical lower detection limit is usually higher than the theoretical 
value, and depends on (a) moisture content of the flue gas, (b) presence 
of interferants, and (c) losses in the sampling system. In general, a 22 
meter pathlength cell in a suitable sampling system can achieve 
practical detection limits of 1.5 ppm for three compounds (formaldehyde, 
phenol, and methanol) at moisture levels up to 15 percent by volume. 
Sources with uncontrolled emissions of CO and COS may require a 4 meter 
pathlength cell due to high concentration levels. For these two 
compounds, make sure absorbance of highest concentration component is 
<1.0.
    1.4 Data Quality Objectives
1.4.1 In designing or configuring the system, the analyst first sets the 
data quality objectives, i.e., the desired lower detection limit 
(DL<INF>i</INF>) and the desired analytical uncertainty (AU<INF>i</INF>) 
for each compound. The instrumental parameters (factors b, c, d, and e 
in Section 1.3.1) are then chosen to meet these requirements, using 
Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol.
1.4.2 Data quality for each application is determined, in part, by 
measuring the RMS (Root Mean Square) noise level in each analytical 
spectral region (Appendix C of the FTIR Protocol). The RMS noise is 
defined as the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of the absorbance 
values in an analytical region from the mean absorbance value of the 
region. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol defines the MAU<INF>im</INF> 
(minimum analyte uncertainty of the i\th\ analyte in the m\th\ 
analytical region). The MAU is the minimum analyte concentration for 
which the analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>) can be 
maintained: if the measured analyte concentration is less than 
MAU<INF>i</INF>, then data quality is unacceptable. Table 2 gives some 
example DL and AU values along with calculated areas and MAU values 
using the protocol procedures.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Principle
    2.1.1 Molecules are composed of chemically bonded atoms, which are 
in constant motion. The atomic motions result in bond deformations (bond 
stretching and bond-angle bending). The number of fundamental (or 
independent) vibrational motions depends on the number of atoms (N) in 
the molecule. At typical testing temperatures, most molecules are in the 
ground-state vibrational state for most of their fundamental vibrational 
motions. A molecule can undergo a transition from its ground state (for 
a particular vibration) to the first excited state by absorbing a 
quantum of light at a frequency characteristic of the molecule and the 
molecular motion. Molecules also undergo rotational transitions by 
absorbing energies in the far-infrared or microwave spectral regions. 
Rotational transition absorbencies are superimposed on the vibrational 
absorbencies to give a characteristic shape to each rotational-
vibrational absorbance ``band.''
    2.1.2 Most molecules exhibit more than one absorbance band in 
several frequency regions to produce an infrared spectrum (a 
characteristic pattern of bands or a ``fingerprint'') that is unique to 
each molecule. The infrared spectrum of a molecule depends on its 
structure (bond lengths, bond angles, bond strengths, and atomic 
masses). Even small differences in structure can produce significantly 
different spectra.
    2.1.3 Spectral band intensities vary with the concentration of the 
absorbing compound. Within constraints, the relationship between 
absorbance and sample concentration is linear. Sample spectra are 
compared to reference spectra to determine the species and their 
concentrations.
    2.2 Sampling and Analysis
    2.2.1 Flue gas is continuously extracted from the source, and the 
gas or a portion of the gas is conveyed to the FTIR gas cell, where a 
spectrum of the flue gas is recorded. Absorbance band intensities are 
related to sample concentrations by Beer's Law.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.046

Where:

A<INF>n</INF> = absorbance of the i\th\ component at the given 
frequency, [nu].
a = absorption coefficient of the i\th\ component at the frequency, 
[nu].
b = path length of the cell.
c = concentration of the i\th\ compound in the sample at frequency [nu].

    2.2.2 After identifying a compound from the infrared spectrum, its 
concentration is determined by comparing band intensities in the sample 
spectrum to band intensities in ``reference spectra'' of the 
formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, COS and CO. These reference spectra are 
available in a permanent soft copy from the EPA spectral library on the 
EMTIC bulletin board. The source may also prepare reference spectra 
according to Section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol.

    Note: Reference spectra not prepared according to the FTIR Protocol 
are not acceptable for use in this test method. Documentation detailing 
the FTIR Protocol steps used in preparing any non-EPA reference spectra 
shall be included in each test report submitted by the source.

    2.3 Operator Requirements. The analyst must have some knowledge of 
source sampling and of infrared spectral patterns to operate the 
sampling system and to choose a suitable instrument configuration. The 
analyst should also understand FTIR instrument operation well enough to 
choose an instrument configuration consistent with the data quality 
objectives.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Analytical (or Spectral) Interferences. Water vapor. High 
concentrations of ammonia (hundreds of ppm) may interfere with the 
analysis of low concentrations of methanol (1 to 5 ppm). For CO, carbon 
dioxide and water may be interferants. In cases where COS levels are low 
relative to CO levels, CO and water may be interferants.
    4.2 Sampling System Interferences. Water, if it condenses, and 
ammonia, which reacts with formaldehyde.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Formaldehyde is a suspected carcinogen; therefore, exposure to 
this compound must be limited. Proper monitoring and safety precautions 
must be practiced in any atmosphere with potentially high concentrations 
of CO.
    5.2 This method may involve sampling at locations having high 
positive or negative pressures, high temperatures, elevated heights, 
high concentrations of hazardous or toxic pollutants, or other diverse 
sampling conditions. It is the responsibility of the tester(s) to ensure 
proper safety and health practices, and to determine the applicability 
of regulatory limitations before performing this test method.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    The equipment and supplies are based on the schematic of a sampling 
train shown in Figure 1. Either the evacuated or purged sampling 
technique may be used with this sampling train. Alternatives may be 
used, provided that the data quality objectives of this method are met.

material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes, and to reach gas sampling point.
    6.2 Particulate Filters. A glass wool plug (optional) inserted at 
the probe tip (for large particulate removal) and a filter rated at 1-

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Ethylene (Calibration Transfer Standard). Obtain NIST traceable 
(or Protocol) cylinder gas.
    7.2 Nitrogen. Ultra high purity (UHP) grade.
    7.3 Reference Spectra. Obtain reference spectra for the target 
pollutants at concentrations that bracket (in ppm-meter/K) the emission 
source levels. Also, obtain reference spectra for SF<INF>6</INF> and 
ethylene. Suitable concentrations are 0.0112 to 0.112 (ppm-meter)/K for 
SF<INF>6</INF> and 5.61 (ppm-meter)/K or less for ethylene. The 
reference spectra shall meet the criteria for acceptance outlined in 
Section 2.2.2. The optical density (ppm-meters/K) of the reference 
spectrum must match the optical density of the sample spectrum within 
(less than) 25 percent.

            8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage

    Sampling should be performed in the following sequence: Collect 
background, collect CTS spectrum, collect samples, collect post-test CTS 
spectrum, verify that two copies of all data were stored on separate 
computer media.
    8.1 Pretest Preparations and Evaluations. Using the procedure in 
Section 4.0 of the FTIR Protocol, determine the optimum sampling system 
configuration for sampling the target pollutants. Table 2 gives some 
example values for AU, DL, and MAU. Based on a study (Reference 1), an 
FTIR system using 1 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> resolution, 22 meter path length, 
and a broad band MCT detector was suitable for meeting the requirements 
in Table 2. Other factors that must be determined are:
    a. Test requirements: AU<INF>i</INF>, CMAX<INF>i</INF>, 
DL<INF>i</INF>, OFU<INF>i</INF>, and t<INF>AN</INF> for each.
    b. Interferants: See Table 1.
    c. Sampling system: L<INF>S</INF>', P<INF>min</INF>, P<INF>S</INF>', 
T<INF>S</INF>', t<INF>SS</INF>, V<INF>SS</INF>; fractional error, MIL.
    d. Analytical regions: 1 through N<INF>m</INF>, FL<INF>m</INF>, 
FC<INF>m</INF>, and FU<INF>m</INF>, plus interferants, FFU<INF>m</INF>, 
FFL<INF>m</INF>, wavenumber range FNU to FNL. See Tables 1 and 2.
    8.1.1 If necessary, sample and acquire an initial spectrum. Then 
determine the proper operational pathlength of the instrument to obtain 
non-saturated absorbances of the target analytes.
    8.1.2 Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 1.
    8.2 Sampling System Leak-check. Leak-check from the probe tip to 
pump outlet as follows: Connect a 0- to 250-mL/min rate meter (rotameter 
or bubble meter) to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the 
probe, and note the leakage rate. The leakage rate shall be <=200 mL/
min.
    8.3 Analytical System Leak-check.
    8.3.1 For the evacuated sample technique, close the valve to the 
FTIR cell, and evacuate the absorption cell to the minimum absolute 
pressure P<INF>min</INF>. Close the valve to the pump, and determine the 
change in pressure [Delta]P<INF>v</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.3.2 For both the evacuated sample and purging techniques, 
pressurize the system to about 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure. 
Isolate the pump and determine the change in pressure 
[Delta]P<INF>p</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.3.3 Measure the barometric pressure, P<INF>b</INF> in mmHg.
    8.3.4 Determine the percent leak volume %V<INF>L</INF> for the 
signal integration time t<INF>SS</INF> and for [Delta]P<INF>max</INF>, 
i.e., the larger of [Delta]P<INF>v</INF> or [Delta]P<INF>p</INF>, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.047

Where:

50 = 100% divided by the leak-check time of 2 minutes.

    8.3.5 Leak volumes in excess of 4 percent of the sample system 
volume V<INF>SS</INF> are unacceptable.
    8.4 Background Spectrum. Evacuate the gas cell to <=5 mmHg, and fill 
with dry nitrogen gas to ambient pressure. Verify that no significant 
amounts of absorbing species (for example water vapor and 
CO<INF>2</INF>) are present. Collect a background spectrum, using a 
signal averaging period equal to or greater than the averaging period 
for the sample spectra. Assign a unique file name to the background 
spectrum. Store the spectra of the background interferogram and 
processed single-beam background spectrum on two separate computer media 
(one is used as the back-up). If continuous sampling will be used during 
sample collection, collect the background spectrum with nitrogen gas 
flowing through the cell at the same pressure and temperature as will be 
used during sampling.
    8.5 Pre-Test Calibration Transfer Standard. Evacuate the gas cell to 
<=5 mmHg absolute pressure, and fill the FTIR cell to atmospheric 
pressure with the CTS gas. Or, purge the cell with 10 cell volumes of 
CTS gas. Record the spectrum. If continuous sampling will be used during 
sample collection, collect the CTS spectrum with CTS gas flowing through 
the cell at the same pressure and temperature as will be used during 
sampling.
    8.6 Samples
    8.6.1 Evacuated Samples. Evacuate the absorbance cell to <=5 mmHg 
absolute pressure. Fill the cell with flue gas to ambient pressure and 
record the spectrum. Before taking the next sample, evacuate the cell 
until no further evidence of absorption exists. Repeat this procedure to 
collect at least 8 separate spectra (samples) in 1 hour.
    8.6.2 Purge Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 10 cell volumes of 
flue gas and at least for about 10 minutes. Discontinue the gas cell 
purge, isolate the cell, and record the

[[Page 767]]

sample spectrum and the pressure. Before taking the next sample, purge 
the cell with 10 cell volumes of flue gas.
    8.6.3 Continuous Sampling. Spectra can be collected continuously 
while the FTIR cell is being purged. The sample integration time, 
t<INF>ss</INF>, the sample flow rate through the FTIR gas cell, and the 
total run time must be chosen so that the collected data consist of at 
least 10 spectra with each spectrum being of a separate cell volume of 
flue gas. More spectra can be collected over the run time and the total 
run time (and number of spectra) can be extended as well.
    8.7 Sampling QA, Data Storage and Reporting
    8.7.1 Sample integration times should be sufficient to achieve the 
required signal-to-noise ratios. Obtain an absorbance spectrum by 
filling the cell with nitrogen. Measure the RMSD in each analytical 
region in this absorbance spectrum. Verify that the number of scans is 
sufficient to achieve the target MAU (Table 2).
    8.7.2 Identify all sample spectra with unique file names.
    8.7.3 Store on two separate computer media a copy of sample 
interferograms and processed spectra. The data shall be available to the 
Administrator on request for the length of time specified in the 
applicable regulation.
    8.7.4 For each sample spectrum, document the sampling conditions, 
the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the 
spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, 
temperature, pressure, resolution, integration time), and the spectral 
file name. Keep a hard copy of these data sheets.
    8.8 Signal Transmittance. While sampling, monitor the signal 
transmittance through the instrumental system. If signal transmittance 
(relative to the background) drops below 95 percent in any spectral 
region where the sample does not absorb infrared energy, obtain a new 
background spectrum.
    8.9 Post-run CTS. After each sampling run, record another CTS 
spectrum.
    8.10 Post-test QA
    8.10.1 Inspect the sample spectra immediately after the run to 
verify that the gas matrix composition was close to the expected 
(assumed) gas matrix.
    8.10.2 Verify that the sampling and instrumental parameters were 
appropriate for the conditions encountered. For example, if the moisture 
is much greater than anticipated, it will be necessary to use a shorter 
path length or dilute the sample.
    8.10.3 Compare the pre and post-run CTS spectra. They shall agree to 
within -5 percent. See FTIR Protocol, Appendix E.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    Follow the quality assurance procedures in the method, including the 
analysis of pre and post-run calibration transfer standards (Sections 
8.5 and 8.9) and the post-test quality assurance procedures in Section 
8.10.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The S/N shall be sufficient to 
meet the MAU in each analytical region.
    10.2 Absorbance Pathlength. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing CTS spectra to reference spectra of the calibration gas(es). 
See FTIR Protocol, Appendix E.
    10.3 Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
CTS band(s) and compare to reference CTS spectra to verify instrumental 
resolution.
    10.4 Apodization Function. Choose appropriate apodization function. 
Determine any appropriate mathematical transformations that are required 
to correct instrumental errors by measuring the CTS. Any mathematical 
transformations must be documented and reproducible.
    10.5 FTIR Cell Volume. Evacuate the cell to <=5 mmHg. Measure the 
initial absolute temperature (T<INF>i</INF>) and absolute pressure 
(P<INF>i</INF>). Connect a wet test meter (or a calibrated dry gas 
meter), and slowly draw room air into the cell. Measure the meter volume 
(V<INF>m</INF>), meter absolute temperature (T<INF>m</INF>), and meter 
absolute pressure (P<INF>m</INF>), and the cell final absolute 
temperature (T<INF>f</INF>) and absolute pressure (P<INF>f</INF>). 
Calculate the FTIR cell volume V<INF>ss</INF>, including that of the 
connecting tubing, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.048

As an alternative to the wet test meter/calibrated dry gas meter 
procedure, measure the inside dimensions of the cell cylinder and 
calculate its volume.

                             11.0 Procedure

    Refer to Sections 4.6-4.11, Sections 5, 6, and 7, and the appendices 
of the FTIR Protocol.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    a. Data analysis is performed using appropriate reference spectra 
whose concentrations can be verified using CTS spectra. Various 
analytical programs are available to relate sample absorbance to a 
concentration standard. Calculated concentrations should be verified by 
analyzing spectral baselines after mathematically subtracting scaled 
reference spectra from the sample spectra. A full description of the 
data analysis and calculations may be found in the FTIR Protocol 
(Sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices).

[[Page 768]]

    b. Correct the calculated concentrations in sample spectra for 
differences in absorption pathlength between the reference and sample 
spectra by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.049

Where:

C<INF>corr</INF> = The pathlength corrected concentration.
C<INF>calc</INF> = The initial calculated concentration (output of the 
Multicomp program designed for the compound).
L<INF>r</INF> = The pathlength associated with the reference spectra.
L<INF>s</INF> = The pathlength associated with the sample spectra.
T<INF>s</INF> = The absolute temperature (K) of the sample gas.
T<INF>r</INF> = The absolute gas temperature (K) at which reference 
spectra were recorded.

                    13.0 Reporting and Recordkeeping

    All interferograms used in determining source concentration shall be 
stored for the period of time required in the applicable regulation. The 
Administrator has the option of requesting the interferograms recorded 
during the test in electronic form as part of the test report.

                         14.0 Method Performance

 Method 319--Determination of Filtration Efficiency for Paint Overspray 
                                Arrestors

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 This method applies to the determination of the initial, 
particle size dependent, filtration efficiency for paint arrestors over 
the particle diameter range from 0.3 to 10 [micro]m. The method applies 
to single and multiple stage paint arrestors or paint arrestor media. 
The method is applicable to efficiency determinations from 0 to 99 
percent. Two test aerosols are used--one liquid phase and one solid 
phase. Oleic acid, a low-volatility liquid (CAS Number 112-80-1), is 
used to simulate the behavior of wet paint overspray. The solid-phase 
aerosol is potassium chloride salt (KCl, CAS Number 7447-40-7) and is 
used to simulate the behavior of a dry overspray. The method is limited 
to determination of the initial, clean filtration efficiency of the 
arrestor. Changes in efficiency (either increase or decrease) due to the 
accumulation of paint overspray on and within the arrestor are not 
evaluated.
    1.2 Efficiency is defined as 1--Penetration (e.g., 70 percent 
efficiency is equal to 0.30 penetration). Penetration is based on the 
ratio of the downstream particle concentration to the upstream 
concentration. It is often more useful, from a mathematical or 
statistical point of view, to discuss the upstream and downstream counts 
in terms of penetration rather than the derived efficiency value. Thus, 
this document uses both penetration and efficiency as appropriate.
    1.3 For a paint arrestor system or subsystem which has been tested 
by this method, adding additional filtration devices to the system or 
subsystem shall be assumed to result in an efficiency of at least that 
of the original system without the requirement for additional testing. 
(For example, if the final stage of a three-stage paint arrestor system 
has been tested by itself, then the addition of the other two stages 
shall be assumed to maintain, as a minimum, the filtration efficiency 
provided by the final stage alone. Thus, in this example, if the final 
stage has been shown to meet the filtration requirements of Table 1 of 
Sec. 63.745 of subpart GG, then the final stage in combination with any 
additional paint arrestor stages also passes the filtration 
requirements.)

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 This method applies to the determination of the fractional 
(i.e., particle-size dependent) aerosol penetration of several types of 
paint arrestors. Fractional penetration is computed from aerosol 
concentrations measured upstream and downstream of an arrestor installed 
in a laboratory test rig. The aerosol concentrations upstream and 
downstream of the arrestors are measured with an aerosol analyzer that 
simultaneously counts and sizes the particles in the aerosol stream. The 
aerosol analyzer covers the particle diameter size range from 0.3 to 10 
[micro]m in a minimum of 12 contiguous sizing channels. Each sizing 
channel covers a narrow range of particle diameters. For example, 
Channel 1 may cover from 0.3 to 0.4 [micro]m, Channel 2 from 0.4 to 0.5 
[micro]m, * * * By taking the ratio of the

[[Page 769]]

downstream to upstream counts on a channel by channel basis, the 
penetration is computed for each of the sizing channels.
    2.2 The upstream and downstream aerosol measurements are made while 
injecting the test aerosol into the air stream upstream of the arrestor 
(ambient aerosol is removed with HEPA filters on the inlet of the test 
rig). This test aerosol spans the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 
[micro]m and provides sufficient upstream concentration in each of the 
optical particle counter (OPC) sizing channels to allow accurate 
calculation of penetration, down to penetrations of approximately 0.01 
(i.e., 1 percent penetration; 99 percent efficiency). Results are 
presented as a graph and a data table showing the aerodynamic particle 
diameter and the corresponding fractional efficiency.

                             3.0 Definitions

    Aerodynamic Diameter--diameter of a unit density sphere having the 
same aerodynamic properties as the particle in question.
    Efficiency is defined as equal to 1--Penetration.
    Optical Particle Counter (OPC)--an instrument that counts particles 
by size using light scattering. An OPC gives particle diameters based on 
size, index of refraction, and shape.
    Penetration--the fraction of the aerosol that penetrates the filter 
at a given particle diameter. Penetration equals the downstream 
concentration divided by the upstream concentration.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 The influence of the known interferences (particle losses) are 
negated by correction of the data using blanks.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 There are no specific safety precautions for this method above 
those of good laboratory practice. This standard does not purport to 
address all of the safety problems, if any, associated with its use. It 
is the responsibility of the user of this method to establish 
appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability 
of regulatory limitations prior to use.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    6.1 Test Facility. A schematic diagram of a test duct used in the 
development of the method is shown in Figure 319-1.

[[Page 770]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.008

    6.1.1 The test section, paint spray section, and attached 
transitions are constructed of stainless and galvanized steel. The 
upstream and downstream ducting is 20 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC). The upstream transition provides a 7 [deg] angle of expansion to 
provide a uniform air flow distribution to the paint arrestors. Aerosol 
concentration is

[[Page 771]]

measured upstream and downstream of the test section to obtain the 
challenge and penetrating aerosol concentrations, respectively. Because 
the downstream ducting runs back under the test section, the challenge 
and penetrating aerosol taps are located physically near each other, 
thereby facilitating aerosol sampling and reducing sample-line length. 
The inlet nozzles of the upstream and downstream aerosol probes are 
designed to yield isokinetic sampling conditions.
    6.1.2 The configuration and dimensions of the test duct can deviate 
from those of Figure 319-1 provided that the following key elements are 
maintained: the test duct must meet the criteria specified in Table 319-
1; the inlet air is HEPA filtered; the blower is on the upstream side of 
the duct thereby creating a positive pressure in the duct relative to 
the surrounding room; the challenge air has a temperature between 50 
[deg] and 100 [deg]F and a relative humidity of less than 65 percent; 
the angle of the upstream transition (if used) to the paint arrestor 
must not exceed 7 [deg]; the angle of the downstream transition (if 
used) from the paint arrestor must not exceed 30 [deg]; the test duct 
must provide a means for mixing the challenge aerosol with the upstream 
flow (in lieu of any mixing device, a duct length of 15 duct diameters 
fulfills this requirement); the test duct must provide a means for 
mixing any penetrating aerosol with the downstream flow (in lieu of any 
mixing device, a duct length of 15 duct diameters fulfills this 
requirement); the test section must provide a secure and leak-free 
mounting for single and multiple stage arrestors; and the test duct may 
utilize a 180 [deg] bend in the downstream duct.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.2 Aerosol Generator. The aerosol generator is used to produce a 
stable aerosol covering the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 [micro]m 
diameter. The generator used in the development of this method consists 
of an air atomizing nozzle positioned at the top of a 0.30-m (12-in.) 
diameter, 1.3-m (51-in.) tall, acrylic, transparent, spray tower. This 
tower allows larger sized particles, which would otherwise foul the test 
duct and sample lines, to fall out of the aerosol. It also adds drying 
air to ensure that the KCl droplets dry to solid salt particles. After 
generation, the aerosol passes through an aerosol neutralizer (Kr85 
radioactive source) to neutralize any electrostatic charge on the 
aerosol (electrostatic charge is an unavoidable consequence of most 
aerosol generation methods). To improve the mixing of the aerosol with 
the air stream, the aerosol is injected counter to the airflow. 
Generators of other designs may be used, but they must produce a stable 
aerosol concentration over the 0.3 to 10 [micro]m diameter size range; 
provide a means of ensuring the complete drying of the KCl aerosol; and 
utilize a charge neutralizer to neutralize any electrostatic charge on 
the aerosol. The resultant challenge aerosol must meet the minimum count 
per channel and maximum concentration criteria of Table 319-1.
    6.3 Installation of Paint Arrestor. The paint arrestor is to be 
installed in the test duct in a manner that precludes air bypassing the 
arrestor. Since arrestor media are often sold unmounted, a mounting 
frame may be used to provide back support for the media in addition to 
sealing it into the duct. The mounting frame for 20 in.x20 in. arrestors 
will have minimum open internal dimensions of 18 in. square. Mounting 
frames for 24 in.x24 in. arrestors will have minimum open internal 
dimensions of 22 in. square. The open internal dimensions of the 
mounting frame shall not be less than 75 percent of the approach duct 
dimensions.

[[Page 772]]

    6.4 Optical Particle Counter. The upstream and downstream aerosol 
concentrations are measured with a high-resolution optical particle 
counter (OPC). To ensure comparability of test results, the OPC shall 
utilize an optical design based on wide-angle light scattering and 
provided a minimum of 12 contiguous particle sizing channels from 0.3 to 
10 [micro]m diameter (based on response to PSL) where, for each channel, 
the ratio of the diameter corresponding to the upper channel bound to 
the lower channel bound must not exceed 1.5.
    6.5 Aerosol Sampling System. The upstream and downstream sample 
lines must be made of rigid electrically-grounded metallic tubing having 
a smooth inside surface, and they must be rigidly secured to prevent 
movement during testing. The upstream and downstream sample lines are to 
be nominally identical in geometry. The use of a short length (100 mm 
maximum) of straight flexible tubing to make the final connection to the 
OPC is acceptable. The inlet nozzles of the upstream and downstream 
probes must be sharp-edged and of appropriate entrance diameter to 
maintain isokinetic sampling within 20 percent of the air velocity.
    6.5.1 The sampling system may be designed to acquire the upstream 
and downstream samples using (a) sequential upstream-downstream sampling 
with a single OPC, (b) simultaneous upstream and downstream sampling 
with two OPC's, or (c) sequential upstream-downstream sampling with two 
OPC's.
    6.5.2 When two particle counters are used to acquire the upstream 
and downstream counts, they must be closely matched in flowrate and 
optical design.
    6.6 Airflow Monitor. The volumetric airflow through the system shall 
be measured with a calibrated orifice plate, flow nozzle, or laminar 
flow element. The measurement device must have an accuracy of 5 percent 
or better.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 The liquid test aerosol is reagent grade, 98 percent pure, oleic 
acid (Table 319-2). The solid test aerosol is KCl aerosolized from a 
solution of KCl in water. In addition to the test aerosol, a calibration 
aerosol of monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres is used to 
verify the calibration of the OPC.

            8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage

    8.1 In this test, all sampling occurs in real-time, thus no samples 
are collected that require preservation or storage during the test. The 
paint arrestors are shipped and stored to avoid structural damage or 
soiling. Each arrestor may be shipped in its original box from the 
manufacturer or similar cardboard box. Arrestors are stored at the test 
site in a location that keeps them clean and dry. Each arrestor is 
clearly labeled for tracking purposes.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Table 319-1 lists the QC control limits.
    9.2 The standard deviation ([sigma]) of the penetration (P) for a 
given test at each of the 15 OPC sizing channels is computed from the 
coefficient of variation (CV, the standard deviation divided by the 
mean) of the upstream and downstream measurements as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.009

For a properly operating system, the standard deviation of the 
penetration is < 0.10 at particle diameters from 0.3 to 3 [micro]m and 
less than 0.30 at diameters <ls-thn-eq> 3 [micro]m.
    9.3 Data Quality Objectives (DQO).
    9.3.1 Fractional Penetration. From the triplicate tests of each 
paint arrestor model, the standard deviation for the penetration 
measurements at each particle size (i.e., for each sizing channel of the 
OPC) is computed as:

[[Page 773]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.010

where P<INF>i</INF> represents an individual penetration measurement, 
and P the average of the 3 (n = 3) individual measurements.

    9.3.2 Bias of the fractional penetration values is determined from 
triplicate no-filter and HEPA filter tests. These tests determine the 
measurement bias at 100 percent penetration and 0 percent penetration, 
respectively.
    9.3.3 PSL-Equivalent Light Scattering Diameter. The precision and 
bias of the OPC sizing determination are based on sampling a known 
diameter of PSL and noting whether the particle counts peak in the 
correct channel of the OPC. This is a pass/fail measurement with no 
calculations involved.
    9.3.4 Airflow. The precision of the measurement must be within 5 
percent of the set point.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Optical Particle Counter. The OPC must have an up-to-date 
factory calibration. Check the OPC zero at the beginning and end of each 
test by sampling HEPA-filtered air. Verify the sizing accuracy on a 
daily basis (for days when tests are performed) with 1-size PSL spheres.
    10.2 Airflow Measurement. Airflow measurement devices must have an 
accuracy of 5 percent or better. Manometers used in conjunction with the 
orifice plate must be inspected prior to use for proper level, zero, and 
mechanical integrity. Tubing connections to the manometer must be free 
from kinks and have secure connections.
    10.3 Pressure Drop. Measure pressure drop across the paint arrestor 
with an inclined manometer readable to within 0.01 in. H<INF>2</INF>O. 
Prior to use, the level and zero of the manometer, and all tubing 
connections, must be inspected and adjusted as needed.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Filtration Efficiency. For both the oleic acid and KCl 
challenges, this procedure is performed in triplicate using a new 
arrestor for each test.

    11.1.1.6 Visually confirm the manometer zero and level. Adjust as 
needed.
    11.1.2 Clean Efficiency Test.
    11.1.2.1 Record the date and time upon beginning this section.
    11.1.2.2 Optical Particle Counter.
    11.1.2.2.1 General: Operate the OPC per the manufacturer's 
instructions allowing a minimum of 20 minutes warm up before making any 
measurements.
    11.1.2.2.2 Overload: The OPC will yield inaccurate data if the 
aerosol concentration it is attempting to measure exceeds its operating 
limit. To ensure reliable measurements, the maximum aerosol 
concentration will not exceed 10 percent of the manufacturer's claimed 
upper concentration limit corresponding to a 10 percent count error. If 
this value is exceeded, reduce the aerosol concentration until the 
acceptable conditions are met.
    11.1.2.2.3 Zero Count: Connect a HEPA capsule to the inlet of the 
OPC and obtain printouts for three samples (each a minimum of 1-minute 
each). Record maximum cumulative zero count. If the count rate exceeds 
50 counts per minute, the OPC requires servicing before continuing.
    11.1.2.2.4 PSL Check of OPC Calibration: Confirm the calibration of 
the OPC by sampling a known size PSL aerosol. Aerosolize the PSL using 
an appropriate nebulizer. Record whether the peak count is observed in 
the proper channel. If the peak is not seen in the appropriate channel, 
have the OPC recalibrated.
    11.1.2.3 Test Conditions:
    11.1.2.3.1 Airflow: The test airflow corresponds to a nominal face 
velocity of 120 FPM through the arrestor. For arrestors having nominal 
20 in.x20 in. face dimensions, this measurement corresponds to an 
airflow of 333 cfm. For arrestors having nominal face dimensions of 24 
in.x24 in., this measurement corresponds to an airflow of 480 cfm.
    11.1.2.3.2 Temperature and Relative Humidity: The temperature and 
relative humidity of the challenge air stream will be measured to within 
an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F and <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent RH. To protect the probe from fouling, it may 
be removed during periods of aerosol generation.
    11.1.2.3.3 Barometric Pressure: Use a mercury barometer. Record the 
atmospheric pressure.
    11.1.2.4 Upstream and Downstream Background Counts.
    11.1.2.4.1 With the arrestor installed in the test duct and the 
airflow set at the proper value, turn on the data acquisition computer 
and bring up the data acquisition program.
    11.1.2.4.2 Set the OPC settings for the appropriate test sample 
duration with output for both printer and computer data collection.
    11.1.2.4.3 Obtain one set of upstream-downstream background 
measurements.
    11.1.2.4.4 After obtaining the upstream-downstream measurements, 
stop data acquisition.
    11.1.2.5 Efficiency Measurements:
    11.1.2.5.1 Record the arrestor pressure drop.
    11.1.2.5.2 Turn on the Aerosol Generator. Begin aerosol generation 
and record the operating parameters.
    11.1.2.5.3 Monitor the particle counts. Allow a minimum of 5 minutes 
for the generator to stabilize.
    11.1.2.5.4 Confirm that the total particle count does not exceed the 
predetermined upper limit. Adjust generator as needed.
    11.1.2.5.5 Confirm that a minimum of 50 particle counts are measured 
in the upstream sample in each of the OPC channels per sample. (A 
minimum of 50 counts per channel per sample will yield the required 
minimum 500 counts per channel total for the 10 upstream samples as 
specified in Table 319-1.) Adjust generator or sample time as needed.
    11.1.2.5.6 If you are unable to obtain a stable concentration within 
the concentration limit and with the 50 count minimum per channel, 
adjust the aerosol generator.
    11.1.2.5.7 When the counts are stable, perform repeated upstream-
downstream sampling until 10 upstream-downstream measurements are 
obtained.
    11.1.2.5.8 After collection of the 10 upstream-downstream samples, 
stop data acquisition and allow 2 more minutes for final purging of 
generator.
    11.1.2.5.9 Obtain one additional set of upstream-downstream 
background samples.
    11.1.2.5.10 After obtaining the upstream-downstream background 
samples, stop data acquisition.
    11.1.2.5.11 Record the arrestor pressure drop.
    11.1.2.5.12 Turn off blower.
    11.1.2.5.13 Remove the paint arrestor assembly from the test duct. 
Note any signs of physical deterioration.
    11.1.2.5.14 Remove the arrestor from the frame and place the 
arrestor in an appropriate storage bag.
    11.2 Control Test: 100 Percent Penetration Test. A 100 percent 
penetration test must be performed immediately before each individual 
paint arrestor test using the same challenge aerosol substance (i.e., 
oleic acid or KCl) as to be used in the arrestor test. These tests are 
performed with no arrestor installed in the test housing. This test is a 
relatively stringent test of the adequacy of the overall duct, sampling, 
measurement, and aerosol generation system. The test is performed as a 
normal penetration test except the paint arrestor is not used. A perfect 
system would yield a measured penetration of 1 at all particle sizes. 
Deviations from 1

[[Page 775]]

can occur due to particle losses in the duct, differences in the degree 
of aerosol uniformity (i.e., mixing) at the upstream and downstream 
probes, and differences in particle transport efficiency in the upstream 
and downstream sampling lines.
    11.3 Control Test: 0 Percent Penetration. One 0 percent penetration 
test must be performed at least monthly during testing. The test is 
performed by using a HEPA filter rather than a paint arrestor. This test 
assesses the adequacy of the instrument response time and sample line 
lag.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Analysis. The analytical procedures for the fractional 
penetration and flow velocity measurements are described in Section 11. 
Note that the primary measurements, those of the upstream and downstream 
aerosol concentrations, are performed with the OPC which acquires the 
sample and analyzes it in real time. Because all the test data are 
collected in real time, there are no analytical procedures performed 
subsequent to the actual test, only data analysis.
    12.2 Calculations.
    12.2.1 Penetration.

                              Nomenclature

U = Upstream particle count
D = Downstream particle count
U<INF>b</INF> = Upstream background count
D<INF>b</INF> = Downstream background count
P<INF>100</INF> = 100 percent penetration value determined immediately 
prior to the arrestor test computed for each channel as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.011

P = Penetration of the arrestor corrected for P<INF>100</INF>
[rho]= sample standard deviation
CV = coefficient of variation = [rho]/mean
E = Efficiency.

    Overbar denotes arithmetic mean of quantity.
    Analysis of each test involves the following quantities:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> P<INF>100</INF> value for each sizing channel 
from the 100 percent penetration control test,
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> 2 upstream background values,
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> 2 downstream background values,
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> 10 upstream values with aerosol generator on, and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> 10 downstream values with aerosol generator on.
    Using the values associated with each sizing channel, the 
penetration associated with each particle-sizing channel is calculated 
as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.012

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.013

    Most often, the background levels are small compared to the values 
when the aerosol generator is on.
    12.3 The relationship between the physical diameter 
(D<INF>Physical</INF>) as measured by the OPC to the aerodynamic 
diameter (D<INF>Aero</INF>) is given by:

Where:

p<INF>O</INF> = unit density of 1 g/cm\3\.
p<INF>Particle</INF> = the density of the particle, 0.89 g/cm\3\ for 
oleic acid.
CCF<INF>Physical</INF> = the Cunningham Correction Factor at 
D<INF>Physical</INF>.
CCF<INF>Aero</INF> = the Cunningham Correction Factor at D\Aero\.

challenge aerosol,
    sbull; Triplicate arrestor tests with the solid-phase challenge 
aerosol,

    sbull; Triplicate 100 percent penetration tests with the solid-phase 
challenge aerosol, and
    sbull; One 0 percent filter test (using either the liquid-phase or 
solid-phase aerosol and performed at least monthly).
    12.4.1 Results for the paint arrestor test must be presented in both 
graphical and tabular form. The X-axis of the graph will be a 
logarithmic scale of aerodynamic diameter from 0.1 to 100 [micro]m. The 
Y-axis will be efficiency (%) on a linear scale from 0 to 100. Plots for 
each individual run and a plot of

[[Page 776]]

the average of triplicate solid-phase and of the average triplicate 
liquid-phase tests must be prepared. All plots are to be based on point-
to-point plotting (i.e., no curve fitting is to be used). The data are 
to be plotted based on the geometric mean diameter of each of the OPC's 
sizing channels.
    12.4.2 Tabulated data from each test must be provided. The data must 
include the upper and lower diameter bound and geometric mean diameter 
of each of the OPC sizing channels, the background particle counts for 
each channel for each sample, the upstream particle counts for each 
channel for each sample, the downstream particle counts for each channel 
for each sample, the 100 percent penetration values computed for each 
channel, and the 0 percent penetration values computed for each channel.

                        13.0 Pollution Prevention

    13.1 The quantities of materials to be aerosolized should be 
prepared in accord with the amount needed for the current tests so as to 
prevent wasteful excess.

                          14.0 Waste Management

    14.1 Paint arrestors may be returned to originator, if requested, or 
disposed of with regular laboratory waste.

   Test Method 320--Measurement of Vapor Phase Organic and Inorganic 
 Emissions by Extractive Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy

                            1.0 Introduction

    Persons unfamiliar with basic elements of FTIR spectroscopy should 
not attempt to use this method. This method describes sampling and 
analytical procedures for extractive emission measurements using Fourier 
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Detailed analytical procedures 
for interpreting infrared spectra are described in the ``Protocol for 
the Use of Extractive Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry in 
Analyses of Gaseous Emissions from Stationary Sources,'' hereafter 
referred to as the ``Protocol.'' Definitions not given in this method 
are given in appendix A of the Protocol. References to specific sections 
in the Protocol are made throughout this Method. For additional 
information refer to references 1 and 2, and other EPA reports, which 
describe the use of FTIR spectrometry in specific field measurement 
applications and validation tests. The sampling procedure described here 
is extractive. Flue gas is extracted through a heated gas transport and 
handling system. For some sources, sample conditioning systems may be 
applicable. Some examples are given in this method.

    Note: sample conditioning systems may be used providing the method 
validation requirements in Sections 9.2 and 13.0 of this method are met.

    1.1 Scope and Applicability.
    1.1.1 Analytes. Analytes include hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) for 
which EPA reference spectra have been developed. Other compounds can 
also be measured with this method if reference spectra are prepared 
according to section 4.6 of the protocol.
    1.1.2 Applicability. This method applies to the analysis of vapor 
phase organic or inorganic compounds which absorb energy in the mid-
infrared spectral region, about 400 to 4000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (25 to 2.5 
[micro]m). This method is used to determine compound-specific 
concentrations in a multi-component vapor phase sample, which is 
contained in a closed-path gas cell. Spectra of samples are collected 
using double beam infrared absorption spectroscopy. A computer program 
is used to analyze spectra and report compound concentrations.
    1.2 Method Range and Sensitivity. Analytical range and sensitivity 
depend on the frequency-dependent analyte absorptivity, instrument 
configuration, data collection parameters, and gas stream composition. 
Instrument factors include: (a) spectral resolution, (b) interferometer 
signal averaging time, (c) detector sensitivity and response, and (d) 
absorption path length.
    1.2.1 For any optical configuration the analytical range is between 
the absorbance values of about .01 (infrared transmittance relative to 
the background = 0.98) and 1.0
(T = 0.1). (For absorbance <ls-thn-eq> 1.0 the relation between 
absorbance and concentration may not be linear.)
    1.2.2 The concentrations associated with this absorbance range 
depend primarily on the cell path length and the sample temperature. An 
analyte absorbance greater than 1.0, can be lowered by decreasing the 
optical path length. Analyte absorbance increases with a longer path 
length. Analyte detection also depends on the presence of other species 
exhibiting absorbance in the same analytical region. Additionally, the 
estimated lower absorbance (A) limit

[[Page 777]]

(A = 0.01) depends on the root mean square deviation (RMSD) noise in the 
analytical region.
    1.2.3 The concentration range of this method is determined by the 
choice of optical configuration.
    1.2.3.1 The absorbance for a given concentration can be decreased by 
decreasing the path length or by diluting the sample. There is no 
practical upper limit to the measurement range.
    1.2.3.2 The analyte absorbance for a given concentration may be 
increased by increasing the cell path length or (to some extent) using a 
higher resolution. Both modifications also cause a corresponding 
increased absorbance for all compounds in the sample, and a decrease in 
the signal throughput. For this reason the practical lower detection 
range (quantitation limit) usually depends on sample characteristics 
such as moisture content of the gas, the presence of other interferants, 
and losses in the sampling system.
    1.3 Sensitivity. The limit of sensitivity for an optical 
configuration and integration time is determined using appendix D of the 
Protocol: Minimum Analyte Uncertainty, (MAU). The MAU depends on the 
RMSD noise in an analytical region, and on the absorptivity of the 
analyte in the same region.
    1.4 Data Quality. Data quality shall be determined by executing 
Protocol pre-test procedures in appendices B to H of the protocol and 
post-test procedures in appendices I and J of the protocol.
    1.4.1 Measurement objectives shall be established by the choice of 
detection limit (DL<INF>i</INF>) and analytical uncertainty 
(AU<INF>i</INF>) for each analyte.
    1.4.2 An instrumental configuration shall be selected. An estimate 
of gas composition shall be made based on previous test data, data from 
a similar source or information gathered in a pre-test site survey. 
Spectral interferants shall be identified using the selected 
DL<INF>i</INF> and AU<INF>i</INF> and band areas from reference spectra 
and interferant spectra. The baseline noise of the system shall be 
measured in each analytical region to determine the MAU of the 
instrument configuration for each analyte and interferant 
(MIU<INF>i</INF>).
    1.4.3 Data quality for the application shall be determined, in part, 
by measuring the RMS (root mean square) noise level in each analytical 
spectral region (appendix C of the Protocol). The RMS noise is defined 
as the RMSD of the absorbance values in an analytical region from the 
mean absorbance value in the region.
    1.4.4 The MAU is the minimum analyte concentration for which the 
AU<INF>i</INF> can be maintained; if the measured analyte concentration 
is less than MAU<INF>i</INF> then data quality are unacceptable.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Principle. References 4 through 7 provide background material on 
infrared spectroscopy and quantitative analysis. A summary is given in 
this section.
    2.1.1 Infrared absorption spectroscopy is performed by directing an 
infrared beam through a sample to a detector. The frequency-dependent 
infrared absorbance of the sample is measured by comparing this detector 
signal (single beam spectrum) to a signal obtained without a sample in 
the beam path (background).
    2.1.2 Most molecules absorb infrared radiation and the absorbance 
occurs in a characteristic and reproducible pattern. The infrared 
spectrum measures fundamental molecular properties and a compound can be 
identified from its infrared spectrum alone.
    2.1.3 Within constraints, there is a linear relationship between 
infrared absorption and compound concentration. If this frequency 
dependent relationship (absorptivity) is known (measured), it can be 
used to determine compound concentration in a sample mixture.
    2.1.4 Absorptivity is measured by preparing, in the laboratory, 
standard samples of compounds at known concentrations and measuring the 
FTIR ``reference spectra'' of these standard samples. These ``reference 
spectra'' are then used in sample analysis: (1) Compounds are detected 
by matching sample absorbance bands with bands in reference spectra, and 
(2) concentrations are measured by comparing sample band intensities 
with reference band intensities.
    2.1.5 This method is self-validating provided that the results meet 
the performance requirement of the QA spike in sections 8.6.2 and 9.0 of 
this method, and results from a previous method validation study support 
the use of this method in the application.
    2.2 Sampling and Analysis. In extractive sampling a probe assembly 
and pump are used to extract gas from the exhaust of the affected source 
and transport the sample to the FTIR gas cell. Typically, the sampling 
apparatus is similar to that used for single-component continuous 
emission monitor (CEM) measurements.
    2.2.1 The digitized infrared spectrum of the sample in the FTIR gas 
cell is measured and stored on a computer. Absorbance band intensities 
in the spectrum are related to sample concentrations by what is commonly 
referred to as Beer's Law.

Where:

A<INF>i</INF> = absorbance at a given frequency of the ith sample 
component.
a<INF>i</INF> = absorption coefficient (absorptivity) of the ith sample 
component.
b = path length of the cell.

[[Page 778]]

c<INF>i</INF> = concentration of the ith sample component.

    2.2.2 Analyte spiking is used for quality assurance (QA). In this 
procedure (section 8.6.2 of this method) an analyte is spiked into the 
gas stream at the back end of the sample probe. Analyte concentrations 
in the spiked samples are compared to analyte concentrations in unspiked 
samples. Since the concentration of the spike is known, this procedure 
can be used to determine if the sampling system is removing the spiked 
analyte(s) from the sample stream.
    2.3 Reference Spectra Availability. Reference spectra of over 100 
HAPs are available in the EPA FTIR spectral library on the EMTIC 
(Emission Measurement Technical Information Center) computer bulletin 
board service and at internet address http://info.arnold.af.mil/epa/
welcome.htm. Reference spectra for HAPs, or other analytes, may also be 
prepared according to section 4.6 of the Protocol.
    2.4 Operator Requirements. The FTIR analyst shall be trained in 
setting up the instrumentation, verifying the instrument is functioning 
properly, and performing routine maintenance. The analyst must evaluate 
the initial sample spectra to determine if the sample matrix is 
consistent with pre-test assumptions and if the instrument configuration 
is suitable. The analyst must be able to modify the instrument 
configuration, if necessary.
    2.4.1 The spectral analysis shall be supervised by someone familiar 
with EPA FTIR Protocol procedures.
    2.4.2 A technician trained in instrumental test methods is qualified 
to install and operate the sampling system. This includes installing the 
probe and heated line assembly, operating the analyte spike system, and 
performing moisture and flow measurements.

                             3.0 Definitions

    See appendix A of the Protocol for definitions relating to infrared 
spectroscopy. Additional definitions are given in sections 3.1 through 
3.29.
    3.1 Analyte. A compound that this method is used to measure. The 
term ``target analyte'' is also used. This method is multi-component and 
a number of analytes can be targeted for a test.
    3.2 Reference Spectrum. Infrared spectrum of an analyte prepared 
under controlled, documented, and reproducible laboratory conditions 
according to procedures in section 4.6 of the Protocol. A library of 
reference spectra is used to measure analytes in gas samples.
    3.3 Standard Spectrum. A spectrum that has been prepared from a 
reference spectrum through a (documented) mathematical operation. A 
common example is de-resolving of reference spectra to lower-resolution 
standard spectra (Protocol, appendix K to the addendum of this method). 
Standard spectra, prepared by approved, and documented, procedures can 
be used as reference spectra for analysis.
    3.4 Concentration. In this method concentration is expressed as a 
molar concentration, in ppm-meters, or in (ppm-meters)/K, where K is the 
absolute temperature (Kelvin). The latter units allow the direct 
comparison of concentrations from systems using different optical 
configurations or sampling temperatures.
    3.5 Interferant. A compound in the sample matrix whose infrared 
spectrum overlaps with part of an analyte spectrum. The most accurate 
analyte measurements are achieved when reference spectra of interferants 
are used in the quantitative analysis with the analyte reference 
spectra. The presence of an interferant can increase the analytical 
uncertainty in the measured analyte concentration.
    3.6 Gas Cell. A gas containment cell that can be evacuated. It is 
equipped with the optical components to pass the infrared beam through 
the sample to the detector. Important cell features include: path length 
(or range if variable), temperature range, materials of construction, 
and total gas volume.
    3.7 Sampling System. Equipment used to extract the sample from the 
test location and transport the sample gas to the FTIR analyzer. This 
includes sample conditioning systems.
    3.8 Sample Analysis. The process of interpreting the infrared 
spectra to obtain sample analyte concentrations. This process is usually 
automated using a software routine employing a classical least squares 
(cls), partial least squares (pls), or K- or P-matrix method.
    3.9 One hundred percent line. A double beam transmittance spectrum 
obtained by combining two background single beam spectra. Ideally, this 
line is equal to 100 percent transmittance (or zero absorbance) at every 
frequency in the spectrum. Practically, a zero absorbance line is used 
to measure the baseline noise in the spectrum.
    3.10 Background Deviation. A deviation from 100 percent 
transmittance in any region of the 100 percent line. Deviations greater 
than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent in an analytical region are 
unacceptable (absorbance of 0.021 to -0.022). Such deviations indicate a 
change in the instrument throughput relative to the background single 
beam.
    3.11 Batch Sampling. A procedure where spectra of discreet, static 
samples are collected. The gas cell is filled with sample and the cell 
is isolated. The spectrum is collected. Finally, the cell is evacuated 
to prepare for the next sample.
    3.12 Continuous Sampling. A procedure where spectra are collected 
while sample gas

[[Page 779]]

is flowing through the cell at a measured rate.
    3.13 Sampling resolution. The spectral resolution used to collect 
sample spectra.
    3.14 Truncation. Limiting the number of interferogram data points by 
deleting points farthest from the center burst (zero path difference, 
ZPD).
    3.15 Zero filling. The addition of points to the interferogram. The 
position of each added point is interpolated from neighboring real data 
points. Zero filling adds no information to the interferogram, but 
affects line shapes in the absorbance spectrum (and possibly analytical 
results).
    3.16 Reference CTS. Calibration Transfer Standard spectra that were 
collected with reference spectra.
    3.17 CTS Standard. CTS spectrum produced by applying a de-resolution 
procedure to a reference CTS.
    3.18 Test CTS. CTS spectra collected at the sampling resolution 
using the same optical configuration as for sample spectra. Test spectra 
help verify the resolution, temperature and path length of the FTIR 
system.
    3.19 RMSD. Root Mean Square Difference, defined in EPA FTIR 
Protocol, appendix A.
    3.20 Sensitivity. The noise-limited compound-dependent detection 
limit for the FTIR system configuration. This is estimated by the MAU. 
It depends on the RMSD in an analytical region of a zero absorbance 
line.
    3.21 Quantitation Limit. The lower limit of detection for the FTIR 
system configuration in the sample spectra. This is estimated by 
mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra of analytes and 
interferences from sample spectra, then measuring the RMSD in an 
analytical region of the subtracted spectrum. Since the noise in 
subtracted sample spectra may be much greater than in a zero absorbance 
spectrum, the quantitation limit is generally much higher than the 
sensitivity. Removing spectral interferences from the sample or 
improving the spectral subtraction can lower the quantitation limit 
toward (but not below) the sensitivity.
    3.22 Independent Sample. A unique volume of sample gas; there is no 
mixing of gas between two consecutive independent samples. In continuous 
sampling two independent samples are separated by at least 5 cell 
volumes. The interval between independent measurements depends on the 
cell volume and the sample flow rate (through the cell).
    3.23 Measurement. A single spectrum of flue gas contained in the 
FTIR cell.
    3.24 Run. A run consists of a series of measurements. At a minimum a 
run includes 8 independent measurements spaced over 1 hour.
    3.25 Validation. Validation of FTIR measurements is described in 
sections 13.0 through 13.4 of this method. Validation is used to verify 
the test procedures for measuring specific analytes at a source. 
Validation provides proof that the method works under certain test 
conditions.
    3.26 Validation Run. A validation run consists of at least 24 
measurements of independent samples. Half of the samples are spiked and 
half are not spiked. The length of the run is determined by the interval 
between independent samples.
    3.27 ning. Screening is used when there is little or no available 
information about a source. The purpose of screening is to determine 
what analytes are emitted and to obtain information about important 
sample characteristics such as moisture, temperature, and interferences. 
Screening results are semi-quantitative (estimated concentrations) or 
qualitative (identification only). Various optical and sampling 
configurations may be used. Sample conditioning systems may be evaluated 
for their effectiveness in removing interferences. It is unnecessary to 
perform a complete run under any set of sampling conditions. Spiking is 
not necessary, but spiking can be a useful screening tool for evaluating 
the sampling system, especially if a reactive or soluble analyte is used 
for the spike.
    3.28 Emissions Test. An FTIR emissions test is performed according 
specific sampling and analytical procedures. These procedures, for the 
target analytes and the source, are based on previous screening and 
validation results. Emission results are quantitative. A QA spike 
(sections 8.6.2 and 9.2 of this method) is performed under each set of 
sampling conditions using a representative analyte. Flow, gas 
temperature and diluent data are recorded concurrently with the FTIR 
measurements to provide mass emission rates for detected compounds.
    3.29 Surrogate. A surrogate is a compound that is used in a QA spike 
procedure (section 8.6.2 of this method) to represent other compounds. 
The chemical and physical properties of a surrogate shall be similar to 
the compounds it is chosen to represent. Under given sampling 
conditions, usually a single sampling factor is of primary concern for 
measuring the target analytes: for example, the surrogate spike results 
can be representative for analytes that are more reactive, more soluble, 
have a lower absorptivity, or have a lower vapor pressure than the 
surrogate itself.

                            4.0 Interferences

    Interferences are divided into two classifications: analytical and 
sampling.
    4.1 Analytical Interferences. An analytical interference is a 
spectral feature that complicates (in extreme cases may prevent) the 
analysis of an analyte. Analytical interferences are classified as 
background or spectral interference.
    4.1.1 Background Interference. This results from a change in 
throughput relative to the

[[Page 780]]

single beam background. It is corrected by collecting a new background 
and proceeding with the test. In severe instances the cause must be 
identified and corrected. Potential causes include: (1) Deposits on 
reflective surfaces or transmitting windows, (2) changes in detector 
sensitivity, (3) a change in the infrared source output, or (4) failure 
in the instrument electronics. In routine sampling throughput may 
degrade over several hours. Periodically a new background must be 
collected, but no other corrective action will be required.
    4.1.2 Spectral Interference. This results from the presence of 
interfering compound(s) (interferant) in the sample. Interferant 
spectral features overlap analyte spectral features. Any compound with 
an infrared spectrum, including analytes, can potentially be an 
interferant. The Protocol measures absorbance band overlap in each 
analytical region to determine if potential interferants shall be 
classified as known interferants (FTIR Protocol, section 4.9 and 
appendix B). Water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF> are common spectral 
interferants. Both of these compounds have strong infrared spectra and 
are present in many sample matrices at high concentrations relative to 
analytes. The extent of interference depends on the (1) interferant 
concentration, (2) analyte concentration, and (3) the degree of band 
overlap. Choosing an alternate analytical region can minimize or avoid 
the spectral interference. For example, CO<INF>2</INF> interferes with 
the analysis of the 670 cm<INF>-1</INF> benzene band. However, benzene 
can also be measured near 3000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (with less sensitivity).
    4.2 Sampling System Interferences. These prevent analytes from 
reaching the instrument. The analyte spike procedure is designed to 
measure sampling system interference, if any.
    4.2.1 Temperature. A temperature that is too low causes condensation 
of analytes or water vapor. The materials of the sampling system and the 
FTIR gas cell usually set the upper limit of temperature.
    4.2.2 Reactive Species. Anything that reacts with analytes. Some 
analytes, like formaldehyde, polymerize at lower temperatures.
    4.2.3 Materials. Poor choice of material for probe, or sampling line 
may remove some analytes. For example, HF reacts with glass components.
    4.2.4 Moisture. In addition to being a spectral interferant, 
condensed moisture removes soluble compounds.

                               5.0 Safety

    The hazards of performing this method are those associated with any 
stack sampling method and the same precautions shall be followed. Many 
HAPs are suspected carcinogens or present other serious health risks. 
Exposure to these compounds should be avoided in all circumstances. For 
instructions on the safe handling of any particular compound, refer to 
its material safety data sheet. When using analyte standards, always 
ensure that gases are properly vented and that the gas handling system 
is leak free. (Always perform a leak check with the system under maximum 
vacuum and, again, with the system at greater than ambient pressure.) 
Refer to section 8.2 of this method for leak check procedures. This 
method does not address all of the potential safety risks associated 
with its use. Anyone performing this method must follow safety and 
health practices consistent with applicable legal requirements and with 
prudent practice for each application.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.

    The equipment and supplies are based on the schematic of a sampling 
system shown in Figure 1. Either the batch or continuous sampling 
procedures may be used with this sampling system. Alternative sampling 
configurations may also be used, provided that the data quality 
objectives are met as determined in the post-analysis evaluation. Other 
equipment or supplies may be necessary, depending on the design of the 
sampling system or the specific target analytes.
    6.1 Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel, or other appropriate 
material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes, and to transport analytes to the 
infrared gas cell. Special materials or configurations may be required 
in some applications. For instance, high stack sample temperatures may 
require special steel or cooling the probe. For very high moisture 
sources it may be desirable to use a dilution probe.
    6.2 Particulate Filters. A glass wool plug (optional) inserted at 
the probe tip (for large particulate removal) and a filter (required) 
rated for 99 percent removal efficiency at 1-micron (e.g., Balston'') 
connected at the outlet of the heated probe.
    6.3 Sampling Line/Heating System. Heated (sufficient to prevent 
condensation) stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethane, or other material 
inert to the analytes.
    6.4 Gas Distribution Manifold. A heated manifold allowing the 
operator to control flows of gas standards and samples directly to the 
FTIR system or through sample conditioning systems. Usually includes 
heated flow meter, heated valve for selecting and sending sample to the 
analyzer, and a by-pass vent. This is typically constructed of stainless 
steel tubing and fittings, and high-temperature valves.
    6.5 Stainless Steel Tubing. Type 316, appropriate diameter (e.g., 3/
8 in.) and length for

[[Page 781]]

heated connections. Higher grade stainless may be desirable in some 
applications.
    6.6 Calibration/Analyte Spike Assembly. A three way valve assembly 
(or equivalent) to introduce analyte or surrogate spikes into the 
sampling system at the outlet of the probe upstream of the out-of-stack 
particulate filter and the FTIR analytical system.
    6.7 Mass Flow Meter (MFM). These are used for measuring analyte 
spike flow. The MFM shall be calibrated in the range of 0 to 5 L/min and 
be accurate to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent (or better) of the flow 
meter span.
    6.8 Gas Regulators. Appropriate for individual gas standards.
    6.9 Polytetrafluoroethane Tubing. Diameter (e.g., \3/8\ in.) and 
length suitable to connect cylinder regulators to gas standard manifold.
    6.10 Sample Pump. A leak-free pump (e.g., KNF \TM\), with by-pass 
valve, capable of producing a sample flow rate of at least 10 L/min 
through 100 ft of sample line. If the pump is positioned upstream of the 
distribution manifold and FTIR system, use a heated pump that is 
constructed from materials non-reactive to the analytes. If the pump is 
located downstream of the FTIR system, the gas cell sample pressure will 
be lower than ambient pressure and it must be recorded at regular 
intervals.
    6.11 Gas Sample Manifold. Secondary manifold to control sample flow 
at the inlet to the FTIR manifold. This is optional, but includes a by-
pass vent and heated rotameter.
    6.12 Rotameter. A 0 to 20 L/min rotameter. This meter need not be 
calibrated.
    6.13 FTIR Analytical System. Spectrometer and detector, capable of 
measuring the analytes to the chosen detection limit. The system shall 
include a personal computer with compatible software allowing automated 
collection of spectra.
    6.14 FTIR Cell Pump. Required for the batch sampling technique, 
capable of evacuating the FTIR cell volume within 2 minutes. The pumping 
speed shall allow the operator to obtain 8 sample spectra in 1 hour.
    6.15 Absolute Pressure Gauge. Capable of measuring pressure from 0 
to 1000 mmHg to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mmHg (e.g., Baratron 
\TM\).
    6.16 Temperature Gauge. Capable of measuring the cell temperature to 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]C.
    6.17 Sample Conditioning. One option is a condenser system, which is 
used for moisture removal. This can be helpful in the measurement of 
some analytes. Other sample conditioning procedures may be devised for 
the removal of moisture or other interfering species.
    6.17.1 The analyte spike procedure of section 9.2 of this method, 
the QA spike procedure of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the 
validation procedure of section 13 of this method demonstrate whether 
the sample conditioning affects analyte concentrations. Alternatively, 
measurements can be made with two parallel FTIR systems; one measuring 
conditioned sample, the other measuring unconditioned sample.
    6.17.2 Another option is sample dilution. The dilution factor 
measurement must be documented and accounted for in the reported 
concentrations. An alternative to dilution is to lower the sensitivity 
of the FTIR system by decreasing the cell path length, or to use a 
short-path cell in conjunction with a long path cell to measure more 
than one concentration range.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Analyte(s) and Tracer Gas. Obtain a certified gas cylinder 
mixture containing all of the analyte(s) at concentrations within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the emission source levels (expressed in 
ppm-meter/K). If practical, the analyte standard cylinder shall also 
contain the tracer gas at a concentration which gives a measurable 
absorbance at a dilution factor of at least 10:1. Two ppm SF<INF>6</INF> 
is sufficient for a path length of 22 meters at 250 [deg]F.
    7.2 Calibration Transfer Standard(s). Select the calibration 
transfer standards (CTS) according to section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol. 
Obtain a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable 
gravimetric standard of the CTS (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent).
    7.3 Reference Spectra. Obtain reference spectra for each analyte, 
interferant, surrogate, CTS, and tracer. If EPA reference spectra are 
not available, use reference spectra prepared according to procedures in 
section 4.6 of the EPA FTIR Protocol.

                   8.0 Sampling and Analysis Procedure

    Three types of testing can be performed: (1) Screening, (2) 
emissions test, and (3) validation. Each is defined in section 3 of this 
method. Determine the purpose(s) of the FTIR test. Test requirements 
include: (a) AU<INF>i</INF>, DL<INF>i</INF>, overall fractional 
uncertainty, OFU<INF>i</INF>, maximum expected concentration 
(CMAX<INF>i</INF>), and t<INF>AN</INF> for each, (b) potential 
interferants, (c) sampling system factors, e.g., minimum absolute cell 
pressure, (P<INF>min</INF>), FTIR cell volume (V<INF>SS</INF>), 
estimated sample absorption pathlength, L<INF>S</INF>', estimated sample 
pressure, P<INF>S</INF>', T<INF>S</INF>', signal integration time 
(t<INF>SS</INF>), minimum instrumental linewidth, MIL, fractional error, 
and (d) analytical regions, e.g., m = 1 to M, lower wavenumber position, 
FLm, center wavenumber position, FC<INF>m</INF>, and upper wavenumber 
position, FU<INF>m</INF>, plus interferants, upper wavenumber position 
of the CTS absorption band, FFU<INF>m</INF>, lower wavenumber position 
of the CTS absorption band, FFL<INF>m</INF>, wavenumber range FNU to 
FNL. If necessary, sample and acquire an initial spectrum. From analysis 
of this preliminary spectrum determine a suitable operational path 
length. Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 1 or use an 
appropriate alternative configuration. Sections 8.1 through 8.11 of this 
method provide guidance on pre-

[[Page 782]]

test calculations in the EPA protocol, sampling and analytical 
procedures, and post-test protocol calculations.
    8.1 Pretest Preparations and Evaluations. Using the procedure in 
section 4.0 of the FTIR Protocol, determine the optimum sampling system 
configuration for measuring the target analytes. Use available 
information to make reasonable assumptions about moisture content and 
other interferences.
    8.1.1 Analytes. Select the required detection limit (DL<INF>i</INF>) 
and the maximum permissible analytical uncertainty (AU<INF>i</INF>) for 
each analyte (labeled from 1 to i). Estimate, if possible, the maximum 
expected concentration for each analyte, CMAX<INF>i</INF>. The expected 
measurement range is fixed by DL<INF>i</INF> and CMAX<INF>i</INF> for 
each analyte (i).
    8.1.2 Potential Interferants. List the potential interferants. This 
usually includes water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF>, but may also include 
some analytes and other compounds.
    8.1.3. Optical Configuration. Choose an optical configuration that 
can measure all of the analytes within the absorbance range of .01 to 
1.0 (this may require more than one path length). Use Protocol sections 
4.3 to 4.8 for guidance in choosing a configuration and measuring CTS.
    8.1.4 Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainty (FRU<INF>i</INF>). The 
FRU is determined for each analyte by comparing CTS spectra taken before 
and after the reference spectra were measured. The EPA para-xylene 
reference spectra were collected on 10/31/91 and 11/01/91 with 
corresponding CTS spectra ``cts1031a,'' and ``cts1101b.'' The CTS 
spectra are used to estimate the reproducibility (FRU) in the system 
that was used to collect the references. The FRU must be < AU. Appendix 
E of the protocol is used to calculate the FRU from CTS spectra. Figure 
2 plots results for 0.25 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> CTS spectra in EPA reference 
library: S<INF>3</INF> (cts1101b-cts1031a), and S<INF>4</INF> 
[(cts1101b+cts1031a)/2]. The RMSD (SRMS) is calculated in the subtracted 
baseline, S<INF>3</INF>, in the corresponding CTS region from 850 to 
1065 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The area (BAV) is calculated in the same region of 
the averaged CTS spectrum, S<INF>4</INF>.
    8.1.5 Known Interferants. Use appendix B of the EPA FTIR Protocol.
    8.1.6 Calculate the Minimum Analyte Uncertainty, MAU (section 1.3 of 
this method discusses MAU and protocol appendix D gives the MAU 
procedure). The MAU for each analyte, i, and each analytical region, m, 
depends on the RMS noise.
    8.1.7 Analytical Program. See FTIR Protocol, section 4.10. Prepare 
computer program based on the chosen analytical technique. Use as input 
reference spectra of all target analytes and expected interferants. 
Reference spectra of additional compounds shall also be included in the 
program if their presence (even if transient) in the samples is 
considered possible. The program output shall be in ppm (or ppb) and 
shall be corrected for differences between the reference path length, 
L<INF>R</INF>, temperature, T<INF>R</INF>, and pressure, P<INF>R</INF>, 
and the conditions used for collecting the sample spectra. If sampling 
is performed at ambient pressure, then any pressure correction is 
usually small relative to corrections for path length and temperature, 
and may be neglected.
    8.2 Leak-Check
    8.2.1 Sampling System. A typical FTIR extractive sampling train is 
shown in Figure 1. Leak check from the probe tip to pump outlet as 
follows: Connect a 0-to 250-mL/min rate meter (rotameter or bubble 
meter) to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the probe, and 
record the leak rate. The leak rate shall be <=200 mL/min.
    8.2.2 Analytical System Leak check. Leak check the FTIR cell under 
vacuum and under pressure (greater than ambient). Leak check connecting 
tubing and inlet manifold under pressure.
    8.2.2.1 For the evacuated sample technique, close the valve to the 
FTIR cell, and evacuate the absorption cell to the minimum absolute 
pressure P<INF>min</INF>. Close the valve to the pump, and determine the 
change in pressure [Delta]P<INF>v</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.2.2.2 For both the evacuated sample and purging techniques, 
pressurize the system to about 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure. 
Isolate the pump and determine the change in pressure 
[Delta]P<INF>p</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.2.2.3 Measure the barometric pressure, P<INF>b</INF> in mmHg.
    8.2.2.4 Determine the percent leak volume %V<INF>L</INF> for the 
signal integration time t<INF>SS</INF> and for [Delta]P<INF>max</INF>, 
i.e., the larger of [Delta]P<INF>v</INF> or [Delta]P<INF>p</INF>, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.004

where 50 = 100% divided by the leak-check time of 2 minutes. 8.2.2.5 
Leak volumes in excess of 4 percent of the FTIR system volume 
V<INF>SS</INF> are unacceptable.
    8.3 Detector Linearity. Once an optical configuration is chosen, use 
one of the procedures of sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.3 to verify that the 
detector response is linear. If the detector response is not linear, 
decrease the aperture, or attenuate the infrared beam. After a change in 
the instrument configuration perform a linearity check until it is 
demonstrated that the detector response is linear.
    8.3.1 Vary the power incident on the detector by modifying the 
aperture setting. Measure the background and CTS at three instrument 
aperture settings: (1) at the aperture setting to be used in the 
testing, (2) at one half this aperture and (3) at twice the proposed 
testing aperture. Compare the three CTS spectra. CTS band areas shall

[[Page 783]]

agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard and the RMSD 
noise in the system. If test aperture is the maximum aperture, collect 
CTS spectrum at maximum aperture, then close the aperture to reduce the 
IR throughput by half. Collect a second background and CTS at the 
smaller aperture setting and compare the spectra again.
    8.3.2 Use neutral density filters to attenuate the infrared beam. 
Set up the FTIR system as it will be used in the test measurements. 
Collect a CTS spectrum. Use a neutral density filter to attenuate the 
infrared beam (either immediately after the source or the 
interferometer) to approximately \1/2\ its original intensity. Collect a 
second CTS spectrum. Use another filter to attenuate the infrared beam 
to approximately \1/4\ its original intensity. Collect a third 
background and CTS spectrum. Compare the CTS spectra. CTS band areas 
shall agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard and the 
RMSD noise in the system.
    8.3.3 Observe the single beam instrument response in a frequency 
region where the detector response is known to be zero. Verify that the 
detector response is ``flat'' and equal to zero in these regions.
    8.4 Data Storage Requirements. All field test spectra shall be 
stored on a computer disk and a second backup copy must stored on a 
separate disk. The stored information includes sample interferograms, 
processed absorbance spectra, background interferograms, CTS sample 
interferograms and CTS absorbance spectra. Additionally, documentation 
of all sample conditions, instrument settings, and test records must be 
recorded on hard copy or on computer medium. Table 1 gives a sample 
presentation of documentation.
    8.5 Background Spectrum. Evacuate the gas cell to <=5 mmHg, and fill 
with dry nitrogen gas to ambient pressure (or purge the cell with 10 
volumes of dry nitrogen). Verify that no significant amounts of 
absorbing species (for example water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF>) are 
present. Collect a background spectrum, using a signal averaging period 
equal to or greater than the averaging period for the sample spectra. 
Assign a unique file name to the background spectrum. Store two copies 
of the background interferogram and processed single-beam spectrum on 
separate computer disks (one copy is the back-up).
    8.5.1 Interference Spectra. If possible, collect spectra of known 
and suspected major interferences using the same optical system that 
will be used in the field measurements. This can be done on-site or 
earlier. A number of gases, e.g. CO<INF>2</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, 
NH<INF>3</INF>, are readily available from cylinder gas suppliers.
    8.5.2 Water vapor spectra can be prepared by the following 
procedure. Fill a sample tube with distilled water. Evacuate above the 
sample and remove dissolved gasses by alternately freezing and thawing 
the water while evacuating. Allow water vapor into the FTIR cell, then 
dilute to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen or dry air. If quantitative 
water spectra are required, follow the reference spectrum procedure for 
neat samples (protocol, section 4.6). Often, interference spectra need 
not be quantitative, but for best results the absorbance must be 
comparable to the interference absorbance in the sample spectra.
    8.6 Pre-Test Calibrations
    8.6.1 Calibration Transfer Standard. Evacuate the gas cell to <= 5 
mmHg absolute pressure, and fill the FTIR cell to atmospheric pressure 
with the CTS gas. Alternatively, purge the cell with 10 cell volumes of 
CTS gas. (If purge is used, verify that the CTS concentration in the 
cell is stable by collecting two spectra 2 minutes apart as the CTS gas 
continues to flow. If the absorbance in the second spectrum is no 
greater than in the first, within the uncertainty of the gas standard, 
then this can be used as the CTS spectrum.) Record the spectrum.
    8.6.2 QA Spike. This procedure assumes that the method has been 
validated for at least some of the target analytes at the source. For 
emissions testing perform a QA spike. Use a certified standard, if 
possible, of an analyte, which has been validated at the source. One 
analyte standard can serve as a QA surrogate for other analytes which 
are less reactive or less soluble than the standard. Perform the spike 
procedure of section 9.2 of this method. Record spectra of at least 
three independent (section 3.22 of this method) spiked samples. 
Calculate the spiked component of the analyte concentration. If the 
average spiked concentration is within 0.7 to 1.3 times the expected 
concentration, then proceed with the testing. If applicable, apply the 
correction factor from the Method 301 of this appendix validation test 
(not the result from the QA spike).
    8.7 Sampling. If analyte concentrations vary rapidly with time, 
continuous sampling is preferable using the smallest cell volume, 
fastest sampling rate and fastest spectra collection rate possible. 
Continuous sampling requires the least operator intervention even 
without an automated sampling system. For continuous monitoring at one 
location over long periods, Continuous sampling is preferred. Batch 
sampling and continuous static sampling are used for screening and 
performing test runs of finite duration. Either technique is preferred 
for sampling several locations in a matter of days. Batch sampling gives 
reasonably good time resolution and ensures that each spectrum measures 
a discreet (and unique) sample volume. Continuous static (and 
continuous) sampling provide a very stable background over long periods. 
Like batch sampling, continuous static sampling also ensures that each 
spectrum measures a unique sample volume. It is essential that the leak 
check procedure under

[[Page 784]]

vacuum (section 8.2 of this method) is passed if the batch sampling 
procedure is used. It is essential that the leak check procedure under 
positive pressure is passed if the continuous static or continuous 
sampling procedures are used. The sampling techniques are described in 
sections 8.7.1 through 8.7.2 of this method.
    8.7.1 Batch Sampling. Evacuate the absorbance cell to <=5 mmHg 
absolute pressure. Fill the cell with exhaust gas to ambient pressure, 
isolate the cell, and record the spectrum. Before taking the next 
sample, evacuate the cell until no spectral evidence of sample 
absorption remains. Repeat this procedure to collect eight spectra of 
separate samples in 1 hour.
    8.7.2 Continuous Static Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 10 cell 
volumes of sample gas. Isolate the cell, collect the spectrum of the 
static sample and record the pressure. Before measuring the next sample, 
purge the cell with 10 more cell volumes of sample gas.
    8.8 Sampling QA and Reporting
    8.8.1 Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the 
required signal-to-noise ratio. Obtain an absorbance spectrum by filling 
the cell with N2. Measure the RMSD in each analytical region in this 
absorbance spectrum. Verify that the number of scans used is sufficient 
to achieve the target MAU.
    8.8.2 Assign a unique file name to each spectrum.
    8.8.3 Store two copies of sample interferograms and processed 
spectra on separate computer disks.
    8.8.4 For each sample spectrum, document the sampling conditions, 
the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the 
spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, 
temperature, pressure, resolution, signal integration time), and the 
spectral file name. Keep a hard copy of these data sheets.
    8.9 Signal Transmittance. While sampling, monitor the signal 
transmittance. If signal transmittance (relative to the background) 
changes by 5 percent or more (absorbance = -.02 to .02) in any 
analytical spectral region, obtain a new background spectrum.
    8.10 Post-test CTS. After the sampling run, record another CTS 
spectrum.
    8.11 Post-test QA
    8.11.1 Inspect the sample spectra immediately after the run to 
verify that the gas matrix composition was close to the expected 
(assumed) gas matrix.
    8.11.2 Verify that the sampling and instrumental parameters were 
appropriate for the conditions encountered. For example, if the moisture 
is much greater than anticipated, it may be necessary to use a shorter 
path length or dilute the sample.
    8.11.3 Compare the pre- and post-test CTS spectra. The peak 
absorbance in pre- and post-test CTS must be <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent of the mean value. See appendix E of the FTIR Protocol.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    Use analyte spiking (sections 8.6.2, 9.2 and 13.0 of this method) to 
verify that the sampling system can transport the analytes from the 
probe to the FTIR system.
    9.1 Spike Materials. Use a certified standard (accurate to <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent) of the target analyte, if one can be 
obtained. If a certified standard cannot be obtained, follow the 
procedures in section 4.6.2.2 of the FTIR Protocol.
    9.2 Spiking Procedure. QA spiking (section 8.6.2 of this method) is 
a calibration procedure used before testing. QA spiking involves 
following the spike procedure of sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3 of this 
method to obtain at least three spiked samples. The analyte 
concentrations in the spiked samples shall be compared to the expected 
spike concentration to verify that the sampling/analytical system is 
working properly. Usually, when QA spiking is used, the method has 
already been validated at a similar source for the analyte in question. 
The QA spike demonstrates that the validated sampling/analytical 
conditions are being duplicated. If the QA spike fails then the 
sampling/analytical system shall be repaired before testing proceeds. 
The method validation procedure (section 13.0 of this method) involves a 
more extensive use of the analyte spike procedure of sections 9.2.1 
through 9.2.3 of this method. Spectra of at least 12 independent spiked 
and 12 independent unspiked samples are recorded. The concentration 
results are analyzed statistically to determine if there is a systematic 
bias in the method for measuring a particular analyte. If there is a 
systematic bias, within the limits allowed by Method 301 of this 
appendix, then a correction factor shall be applied to the analytical 
results. If the systematic bias is greater than the allowed limits, this 
method is not valid and cannot be used.
    9.2.1 Introduce the spike/tracer gas at a constant flow rate of <=10 
percent of the total sample flow, when possible.

    Note: Use the rotameter at the end of the sampling train to estimate 
the required spike/tracer gas flow rate.

    Use a flow device, e.g., mass flow meter (<greek-i> 2 percent), to 
monitor the spike flow rate. Record the spike flow rate every 10 
minutes.
    9.2.2 Determine the response time (RT) of the system by continuously 
collecting spectra of the spiked effluent until the spectrum of the 
spiked component is constant for 5 minutes. The RT is the interval from 
the first measurement until the spike becomes constant. Wait for twice 
the duration of the RT, then collect spectra of two independent spiked 
gas samples. Duplicate analyses of the spiked concentration shall be 
within 5

[[Page 785]]

percent of the mean of the two measurements.
    9.2.3 Calculate the dilution ratio using the tracer gas as follows: 
where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.005

Where:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.006

DF=Dilution factor of the spike gas; this value shall be <ls-thn-eq>=10.
SF<INF>6(dir)</INF>=SF<INF>6</INF> (or tracer gas) concentration 
measured directly in undiluted spike gas.
SF<INF>6(spk)</INF>=Diluted SF<INF>6</INF> (or tracer gas) concentration 
measured in a spiked sample.
Spike\dir\=Concentration of the analyte in the spike standard measured 
by filling the FTIR cell directly.
CS=Expected concentration of the spiked samples.
Unspike=Native concentration of analytes in unspiked samples.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The RMSD in the noise must be less 
than one tenth of the minimum analyte peak absorbance in each analytical 
region. For example if the minimum peak absorbance is 0.01 at the 
required DL, then RMSD measured over the entire analytical region must 
be <=0.001.
    10.2 Absorbance Path length. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing reference CTS spectra to test CTS spectra. See appendix E of 
the FTIR Protocol.
    10.3 Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
test CTS band(s) to verify instrument resolution. Alternatively, compare 
CTS spectra to a reference CTS spectrum, if available, measured at the 
nominal resolution.
    10.4 Apodization Function.In transforming the sample interferograms 
to absorbance spectra use the same apodization function that was used in 
transforming the reference spectra.
    10.5 FTIR Cell Volume. Evacuate the cell to <=5 mmHg. Measure the 
initial absolute temperature (T<INF>i</INF>) and absolute pressure 
(P<INF>i</INF>). Connect a wet test meter (or a calibrated dry gas 
meter), and slowly draw room air into the cell. Measure the meter volume 
(V<INF>m</INF>), meter absolute temperature (T<INF>m</INF>), and meter 
absolute pressure (P<INF>m</INF>); and the cell final absolute 
temperature (T<INF>f</INF>) and absolute pressure (P<INF>f</INF>). 
Calculate the FTIR cell volume VSS, including that of the connecting 
tubing, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.007

                   11.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    Analyte concentrations shall be measured using reference spectra 
from the EPA FTIR spectral library. When EPA library spectra are not 
available, the procedures in section 4.6 of the Protocol shall be 
followed to prepare reference spectra of all the target analytes.
    11.1 Spectral De-resolution. Reference spectra can be converted to 
lower resolution standard spectra (section 3.3 of this method) by 
truncating the original reference sample and background interferograms. 
Appendix K of the FTIR Protocol gives specific deresolution procedures. 
Deresolved spectra shall be transformed using the same apodization 
function and level of zero filling as the sample spectra. Additionally, 
pre-test FTIR protocol calculations (e.g., FRU, MAU, FCU) shall be 
performed using the de-resolved standard spectra.
    11.2 Data Analysis. Various analytical programs are available for 
relating sample absorbance to a concentration standard. Calculated 
concentrations shall be verified by analyzing residual baselines after 
mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra from the sample 
spectra. A full description of the data analysis and calculations is 
contained in the FTIR Protocol (sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices). 
Correct the calculated concentrations in the sample spectra for 
differences in absorption path length and temperature between the 
reference and sample spectra using equation 6,

C<INF>calc</INF>=Concentration, initial calculation (output of the 
analytical program designed for the compound).

                         12.0 Method Performance

    12.1 Spectral Quality. Refer to the FTIR Protocol appendices for 
analytical requirements, evaluation of data quality, and analysis of 
uncertainty.
    12.2 Sampling QA/QC. The analyte spike procedure of section 9 of 
this method, the QA spike of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the 
validation procedure of section 13 of this method are used to evaluate 
the performance of the sampling system and to quantify sampling system 
effects, if any, on the measured concentrations. This method is self-
validating provided that the results meet the performance requirement of 
the QA spike in sections 9.0 and 8.6.2 of this method and results from a 
previous method validation study support the use of this method in the 
application. Several factors can contribute to uncertainty in the 
measurement of spiked samples. Factors which can be controlled to 
provide better accuracy in the spiking procedure are listed in sections 
12.2.1 through 12.2.4 of this method.
    12.2.1 Flow meter. An accurate mass flow meter is accurate to <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of its span. If a flow of 1 L/min is monitored 
with such a MFM, which is calibrated in the range of 0-5 L/min, the flow 
measurement has an uncertainty of 5 percent. This may be improved by re-
calibrating the meter at the specific flow rate to be used.
    12.2.2 Calibration gas. Usually the calibration standard is 
certified to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent. With reactive 
analytes, such as HCl, the certified accuracy in a commercially 
available standard may be no better than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent.
    12.2.3 Temperature. Temperature measurements of the cell shall be 
quite accurate. If practical, it is preferable to measure sample 
temperature directly, by inserting a thermocouple into the cell chamber 
instead of monitoring the cell outer wall temperature.
    12.2.4 Pressure. Accuracy depends on the accuracy of the barometer, 
but fluctuations in pressure throughout a day may be as much as 2.5 
percent due to weather variations.

                    13.0 Method Validation Procedure

    This validation procedure, which is based on EPA Method 301 (40 CFR 
part 63, appendix (A), may be used to validate this method for the 
analytes in a gas matrix. Validation at one source may also apply to 
another type of source, if it can be shown that the exhaust gas 
characteristics are similar at both sources.
    13.1 Section 5.3 of Method 301 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), the 
Analyte Spike procedure, is used with these modifications. The 
statistical analysis of the results follows section 6.3 of EPA Method 
301. Section 3 of this method defines terms that are not defined in 
Method 301.
    13.1.1 The analyte spike is performed dynamically. This means the 
spike flow is continuous and constant as spiked samples are measured.
    13.1.2 The spike gas is introduced at the back of the sample probe.
    13.1.3 Spiked effluent is carried through all sampling components 
downstream of the probe.
    13.1.4 A single FTIR system (or more) may be used to collect and 
analyze spectra (not quadruplicate integrated sampling trains).
    13.1.5 All of the validation measurements are performed sequentially 
in a single ``run'' (section 3.26 of this method).
    13.1.6 The measurements analyzed statistically are each independent 
(section 3.22 of this method).
    13.1.7 A validation data set can consist of more than 12 spiked and 
12 unspiked measurements.
    13.2 Batch Sampling. The procedure in sections 13.2.1 through 13.2.2 
may be used for stable processes. If process emissions are highly 
variable, the procedure in section 13.2.3 shall be used.
    13.2.1 With a single FTIR instrument and sampling system, begin by 
collecting spectra of two unspiked samples. Introduce the spike flow 
into the sampling system and allow 10 cell volumes to purge the sampling 
system and FTIR cell. Collect spectra of two spiked samples. Turn off 
the spike and allow 10 cell volumes of unspiked sample to purge the FTIR 
cell. Repeat this procedure until the 24 (or more) samples are 
collected.
    13.2.2 In batch sampling, collect spectra of 24 distinct samples. 
(Each distinct sample consists of filling the cell to ambient pressure 
after the cell has been evacuated.)
    13.2.3 Alternatively, a separate probe assembly, line, and sample 
pump can be used for spiked sample. Verify and document that sampling 
conditions are the same in both the spiked and the unspiked sampling 
systems. This can be done by wrapping both sample lines in the same 
heated bundle. Keep the same flow rate in both sample lines. Measure 
samples in sequence in pairs. After two spiked samples are measured, 
evacuate the FTIR cell, and turn the manifold valve so that spiked 
sample flows to the FTIR cell. Allow the connecting line from the 
manifold to the FTIR cell to purge thoroughly (the

[[Page 787]]

time depends on the line length and flow rate). Collect a pair of spiked 
samples. Repeat the procedure until at least 24 measurements are 
completed.
    13.3 Simultaneous Measurements With Two FTIR Systems. If unspiked 
effluent concentrations of the target analyte(s) vary significantly with 
time, it may be desirable to perform synchronized measurements of spiked 
and unspiked sample. Use two FTIR systems, each with its own cell and 
sampling system to perform simultaneous spiked and unspiked 
measurements. The optical configurations shall be similar, if possible. 
The sampling configurations shall be the same. One sampling system and 
FTIR analyzer shall be used to measure spiked effluent. The other 
sampling system and FTIR analyzer shall be used to measure unspiked flue 
gas. Both systems shall use the same sampling procedure (i.e., batch or 
continuous).
    13.3.1 If batch sampling is used, synchronize the cell evacuation, 
cell filling, and collection of spectra. Fill both cells at the same 
rate (in cell volumes per unit time).
    13.3.2 If continuous sampling is used, adjust the sample flow 
through each gas cell so that the same number of cell volumes pass 
through each cell in a given time (i.e. TC<INF>1</INF> = 
TC<INF>2</INF>).
    13.4 Statistical Treatment. The statistical procedure of EPA Method 
301 of this appendix, section 6.3 is used to evaluate the bias and 
precision. For FTIR testing a validation ``run'' is defined as spectra 
of 24 independent samples, 12 of which are spiked with the analyte(s) 
and 12 of which are not spiked.
    13.4.1 Bias. Determine the bias (defined by EPA Method 301 of this 
appendix, section 6.3.2) using equation 7:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.009

Where:

B = Bias at spike level.
S<INF>m</INF> = Mean concentration of the analyte spiked samples.
CS = Expected concentration of the spiked samples.

    13.4.2 Correction Factor. Use section 6.3.2.2 of Method 301 of this 
appendix to evaluate the statistical significance of the bias. If it is 
determined that the bias is significant, then use section 6.3.3 of 
Method 301 to calculate a correction factor (CF). Analytical results of 
the test method are multiplied by the correction factor, if 0.7 <= CF <= 
1.3. If is determined that the bias is significant and CF <ls-thn-eq> 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 percent, then the test method is considered to 
``not valid.''
    13.4.3 If measurements do not pass validation, evaluate the sampling 
system, instrument configuration, and analytical system to determine if 
improper set-up or a malfunction was the cause. If so, repair the system 
and repeat the validation.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    The extracted sample gas is vented outside the enclosure containing 
the FTIR system and gas manifold after the analysis. In typical method 
applications the vented sample volume is a small fraction of the source 
volumetric flow and its composition is identical to that emitted from 
the source. When analyte spiking is used, spiked pollutants are vented 
with the extracted sample gas. Approximately 1.6 x 10-\4\ to 3.2 x 10-
\4\ lbs of a single HAP may be vented to the atmosphere in a typical 
validation run of 3 hours. (This assumes a molar mass of 50 to 100 g, 
spike rate of 1.0 L/min, and a standard concentration of 100 ppm). 
Minimize emissions by keeping the spike flow off when not in use.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    Small volumes of laboratory gas standards can be vented through a 
laboratory hood. Neat samples must be packed and disposed according to 
applicable regulations. Surplus materials may be returned to supplier 
for disposal.

   Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry for the Analyses of Gaseous 
                    Emissions from Stationary Sources

                            1.0 Introduction

    The purpose of this addendum is to set general guidelines for the 
use of modern FTIR spectroscopic methods for the analysis of gas samples 
extracted from the effluent of stationary emission sources. This 
addendum outlines techniques for developing and evaluating such methods 
and sets basic requirements for reporting and quality assurance 
procedures.
    1.1 Nomenclature
    1.1.1 Appendix A to this addendum lists definitions of the symbols 
and terms used in this Protocol, many of which have been taken directly 
from American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) publication E 
131-90a, entitled ``Terminology Relating to Molecular Spectroscopy.''
    1.1.2 Except in the case of background spectra or where otherwise 
noted, the term ``spectrum'' refers to a double-beam spectrum in units 
of absorbance vs. wavenumber (cm<SUP>-1</SUP>).
    1.1.3 The term ``Study'' in this addendum refers to a publication 
that has been subjected to EPA- or peer-review.

               2.0 Applicability and Analytical Principle

    2.1 Applicability. This Protocol applies to the determination of 
compound-specific concentrations in single- and multiple-component gas 
phase samples using double-beam absorption spectroscopy in the mid-
infrared band. It does not specifically address other FTIR applications, 
such as single-beam spectroscopy, analysis of open-path (non-enclosed) 
samples, and continuous measurement techniques. If multiple 
spectrometers, absorption cells, or instrumental linewidths are used in 
such analyses, each distinct operational configuration of the system 
must be evaluated separately according to this Protocol.
    2.2 Analytical Principle
    2.2.1 In the mid-infrared band, most molecules exhibit 
characteristic gas phase absorption spectra that may be recorded by FTIR 
systems. Such systems consist of a source of mid-infrared radiation, an 
interferometer, an enclosed sample cell of known absorption pathlength, 
an infrared detector, optical elements for the transfer of infrared 
radiation between components, and gas flow control and measurement 
components. Adjunct and integral computer systems are used for 
controlling the instrument, processing the signal, and for performing 
both Fourier transforms and quantitative analyses of spectral data.

[[Page 790]]

    2.2.2 The absorption spectra of pure gases and of mixtures of gases 
are described by a linear absorbance theory referred to as Beer's Law. 
Using this law, modern FTIR systems use computerized analytical programs 
to quantify compounds by comparing the absorption spectra of known 
(reference) gas samples to the absorption spectrum of the sample gas. 
Some standard mathematical techniques used for comparisons are classical 
least squares, inverse least squares, cross-correlation, factor 
analysis, and partial least squares. Reference A describes several of 
these techniques, as well as additional techniques, such as 
differentiation methods, linear baseline corrections, and non-linear 
absorbance corrections.

             3.0 General Principles of Protocol Requirements

    The characteristics that distinguish FTIR systems from gas analyzers 
used in instrumental gas analysis methods (e.g., Methods 6C and 7E of 
appendix A to part 60 of this chapter) are: (1) Computers are necessary 
to obtain and analyze data; (2) chemical concentrations can be 
quantified using previously recorded infrared reference spectra; and (3) 
analytical assumptions and results, including possible effects of 
interfering compounds, can be evaluated after the quantitative analysis. 
The following general principles and requirements of this Protocol are 
based on these characteristics.
    3.1 Verifiability and Reproducibility of Results. Store all data and 
document data analysis techniques sufficient to allow an independent 
agent to reproduce the analytical results from the raw interferometric 
data.
    3.2 Transfer of Reference Spectra. To determine whether reference 
spectra recorded under one set of conditions (e.g., optical bench, 
instrumental linewidth, absorption pathlength, detector performance, 
pressure, and temperature) can be used to analyze sample spectra taken 
under a different set of conditions, quantitatively compare 
``calibration transfer standards'' (CTS) and reference spectra as 
described in this Protocol.

    Note: The CTS may, but need not, include analytes of interest). To 
effect this, record the absorption spectra of the CTS (a) immediately 
before and immediately after recording reference spectra and (b) 
immediately after recording sample spectra.

    3.3 Evaluation of FTIR Analyses. The applicability, accuracy, and 
precision of FTIR measurements are influenced by a number of 
interrelated factors, which may be divided into two classes:
    3.3.1 Sample-Independent Factors. Examples are system configuration 
and performance (e.g., detector sensitivity and infrared source output), 
quality and applicability of reference absorption spectra, and type of 
mathematical analyses of the spectra. These factors define the 
fundamental limitations of FTIR measurements for a given system 
configuration. These limitations may be estimated from evaluations of 
the system before samples are available. For example, the detection 
limit for the absorbing compound under a given set of conditions may be 
estimated from the system noise level and the strength of a particular 
absorption band. Similarly, the accuracy of measurements may be 
estimated from the analysis of the reference spectra.
    3.3.2 Sample-Dependent Factors. Examples are spectral interferants 
(e.g., water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF>) or the overlap of spectral 
features of different compounds and contamination deposits on reflective 
surfaces or transmitting windows. To maximize the effectiveness of the 
mathematical techniques used in spectral analysis, identification of 
interferants (a standard initial step) and analysis of samples (includes 
effect of other analytical errors) are necessary. Thus, the Protocol 
requires post-analysis calculation of measurement concentration 
uncertainties for the detection of these potential sources of 
measurement error.

                4.0 Pre-Test Preparations and Evaluations

    Before testing, demonstrate the suitability of FTIR spectrometry for 
the desired application according to the procedures of this section.
    4.1 Identify Test Requirements. Identify and record the test 
requirements described in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum. 
These values set the desired or required goals of the proposed analysis; 
the description of methods for determining whether these goals are 
actually met during the analysis comprises the majority of this 
Protocol.
    4.1.1 Analytes (specific chemical species) of interest. Label the 
analytes from i = 1 to I.
    4.1.2 Analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>). The 
AU<INF>i</INF> is the maximum permissible fractional uncertainty of 
analysis for the i\th\ analyte concentration, expressed as a fraction of 
the analyte concentration in the sample.
    4.1.3 Required detection limit for each analyte (DL<INF>i</INF>, 
ppm). The detection limit is the lowest concentration of an analyte for 
which its overall fractional uncertainty (OFU<INF>i</INF>) is required 
to be less than its analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>).
    4.1.4 Maximum expected concentration of each analyte 
(CMAX<INF>i</INF>, ppm).
    4.2 Identify Potential Interferants. Considering the chemistry of 
the process or results of previous studies, identify potential 
interferants, i.e., the major effluent constituents and any relatively 
minor effluent constituents that possess either strong absorption 
characteristics or strong structural similarities to any analyte of 
interest. Label them 1 through N<INF>j</INF>, where the subscript ``j''

[[Page 791]]

pertains to potential interferants. Estimate the concentrations of these 
compounds in the effluent (CPOT<INF>j</INF>, ppm).
    4.3 Select and Evaluate the Sampling System. Considering the source, 
e.g., temperature and pressure profiles, moisture content, analyte 
characteristics, and particulate concentration), select the equipment 
for extracting gas samples. Recommended are a particulate filter, 
heating system to maintain sample temperature above the dew point for 
all sample constituents at all points within the sampling system 
(including the filter), and sample conditioning system (e.g., coolers, 
water-permeable membranes that remove water or other compounds from the 
sample, and dilution devices) to remove spectral interferants or to 
protect the sampling and analytical components. Determine the minimum 
absolute sample system pressure (P<INF>min</INF>, mmHg) and the infrared 
absorption cell volume (V<INF>SS</INF>, liter). Select the techniques 
and/or equipment for the measurement of sample pressures and 
temperatures.
    4.4 Select Spectroscopic System. Select a spectroscopic 
configuration for the application. Approximate the absorption pathlength 
(L<INF>S</INF>', meter), sample pressure (P<INF>S</INF>', kPa), absolute 
sample temperature T<INF>S</INF>', and signal integration period 
(t<INF>SS</INF>, seconds) for the analysis. Specify the nominal minimum 
instrumental linewidth (MIL) of the system. Verify that the fractional 
error at the approximate values P<INF>S</INF>' and T<INF>S</INF>' is 
less than one half the smallest value AU<INF>i</INF> (see section 4.1.2 
of this addendum).
    4.5 Select Calibration Transfer Standards (CTS's). Select CTS's that 
meet the criteria listed in sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 of this 
addendum.

    Note: It may be necessary to choose preliminary analytical regions 
(see section 4.7 of this addendum), identify the minimum analyte 
linewidths, or estimate the system noise level (see section 4.12 of this 
addendum) before selecting the CTS. More than one compound may be needed 
to meet the criteria; if so, obtain separate cylinders for each 
compound.

    4.5.1 The central wavenumber position of each analytical region 
shall lie within 25 percent of the wavenumber position of at least one 
CTS absorption band.
    4.5.2 The absorption bands in section 4.5.1 of this addendum shall 
exhibit peak absorbances greater than ten times the value 
RMS<INF>EST</INF> (see section 4.12 of this addendum) but less than 1.5 
absorbance units.
    4.5.3 At least one absorption CTS band within the operating range of 
the FTIR instrument shall have an instrument-independent linewidth no 
greater than the narrowest analyte absorption band. Perform and document 
measurements or cite Studies to determine analyte and CTS compound 
linewidths.
    4.5.4 For each analytical region, specify the upper and lower 
wavenumber positions (FFU<INF>m</INF> and FFL<INF>m</INF>, respectively) 
that bracket the CTS absorption band or bands for the associated 
analytical region. Specify the wavenumber range, FNU to FNL, containing 
the absorption band that meets the criterion of section 4.5.3 of this 
addendum.
    4.5.5 Associate, whenever possible, a single set of CTS gas 
cylinders with a set of reference spectra. Replacement CTS gas cylinders 
shall contain the same compounds at concentrations within 5 percent of 
that of the original CTS cylinders; the entire absorption spectra (not 
individual spectral segments) of the replacement gas shall be scaled by 
a factor between 0.95 and 1.05 to match the original CTS spectra.
    4.6 Prepare Reference Spectra

    Note: Reference spectra are available in a permanent soft copy from 
the EPA spectral library on the EMTIC (Emission Measurement Technical 
Information Center) computer bulletin board; they may be used if 
applicable.

    4.6.1 Select the reference absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>) of 
the cell.
    4.6.2 Obtain or prepare a set of chemical standards for each 
analyte, potential and known spectral interferants, and CTS. Select the 
concentrations of the chemical standards to correspond to the top of the 
desired range.
    4.6.2.1 Commercially-Prepared Chemical Standards. Chemical standards 
for many compounds may be obtained from independent sources, such as a 
specialty gas manufacturer, chemical company, or commercial laboratory. 
These standards (accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent) 
shall be prepared according to EPA Traceability Protocol (see Reference 
D) or shall be traceable to NIST standards. Obtain from the supplier an 
estimate of the stability of the analyte concentration. Obtain and 
follow all of the supplier's recommendations for recertifying the 
analyte concentration.
    4.6.2.2 Self-Prepared Chemical Standards. Chemical standards may be 
prepared by diluting certified commercially prepared chemical gases or 
pure analytes with ultra-pure carrier (UPC) grade nitrogen according to 
the barometric and volumetric techniques generally described in 
Reference A, section A4.6.
    4.6.3 Record a set of the absorption spectra of the CTS {R1{time} , 
then a set of the reference spectra at two or more concentrations in 
duplicate over the desired range (the top of the range must be less than 
10 times that of the bottom), followed by a second set of CTS spectra 
{R2{time} . (If self-prepared standards are used, see section 4.6.5 of 
this addendum before disposing of any of the standards.) The maximum 
accepted standard concentration-pathlength product (ASCPP) for each 
compound shall be higher than the

[[Page 792]]

maximum estimated concentration-pathlength products for both analytes 
and known interferants in the effluent gas. For each analyte, the 
minimum ASCPP shall be no greater than ten times the concentration-
pathlength product of that analyte at its required detection limit.
    4.6.4 Permanently store the background and interferograms in 
digitized form. Document details of the mathematical process for 
generating the spectra from these interferograms. Record the sample 
pressure (P<INF>R</INF>), sample temperature (T<INF>R</INF>), reference 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), and interferogram signal 
integration period (t<INF>SR</INF>). Signal integration periods for the 
background interferograms shall be <ls-thn-eq>=t<INF>SR</INF>. Values of 
P<INF>R</INF>, L<INF>R</INF>, and t<INF>SR</INF> shall not deviate by 
more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent from the time of recording 
[R1] to that of recording [R2].
    4.6.5 If self-prepared chemical standards are employed and spectra 
of only two concentrations are recorded for one or more compounds, 
verify the accuracy of the dilution technique by analyzing the prepared 
standards for those compounds with a secondary (non-FTIR) technique in 
accordance with sections 4.6.5.1 through 4.6.5.4 of this addendum.
    4.6.5.1 Record the response of the secondary technique to each of 
the four standards prepared.
    4.6.5.2 Perform a linear regression of the response values 
(dependant variable) versus the accepted standard concentration (ASC) 
values (independent variable), with the regression constrained to pass 
through the zero-response, zero ASC point.
    4.6.5.3 Calculate the average fractional difference between the 
actual response values and the regression-predicted values (those 
calculated from the regression line using the four ASC values as the 
independent variable).
    4.6.5.4 If the average fractional difference value calculated in 
section 4.6.5.3 of this addendum is larger for any compound than the 
corresponding AU<INF>i</INF>, the dilution technique is not sufficiently 
accurate and the reference spectra prepared are not valid for the 
analysis.
    4.7 Select Analytical Regions. Using the general considerations in 
section 7 of Reference A and the spectral characteristics of the 
analytes and interferants, select the analytical regions for the 
application. Label them m = 1 to M. Specify the lower, center and upper 
wavenumber positions of each analytical region (FL<INF>m</INF>, 
FC<INF>m</INF>, and FU<INF>m</INF>, respectively). Specify the analytes 
and interferants which exhibit absorption in each region.
    4.8 Determine Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainties. Using 
appendix E of this addendum, calculate the fractional reproducibility 
uncertainty for each analyte (FRU<INF>i</INF>) from a comparison of [R1] 
and [R2]. If FRU<INF>i</INF> <ls-thn-eq> AU<INF>i</INF> for any analyte, 
the reference spectra generated in accordance with section 4.6 of this 
addendum are not valid for the application.
    4.9 Identify Known Interferants. Using appendix B of this addendum, 
determine which potential interferants affect the analyte concentration 
determinations. Relabel these potential interferant as ``known'' 
interferants, and designate these compounds from k = 1 to K. Appendix B 
to this addendum also provides criteria for determining whether the 
selected analytical regions are suitable.
    4.10 Prepare Computerized Analytical Programs
    4.10.1 Choose or devise mathematical techniques (e.g, classical 
least squares, inverse least squares, cross-correlation, and factor 
analysis) based on equation 4 of Reference A that are appropriate for 
analyzing spectral data by comparison with reference spectra.
    4.10.2 Following the general recommendations of Reference A, prepare 
a computer program or set of programs that analyzes all of the analytes 
and known interferants, based on the selected analytical regions 
(section 4.7 of this addendum) and the prepared reference spectra 
(section 4.6 of this addendum). Specify the baseline correction 
technique (e.g., determining the slope and intercept of a linear 
baseline contribution in each analytical region) for each analytical 
region, including all relevant wavenumber positions.
    4.10.3 Use programs that provide as output [at the reference 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), reference gas temperature 
(T<INF>R</INF>), and reference gas pressure (P<INF>R</INF>)] the analyte 
concentrations, the known interferant concentrations, and the baseline 
slope and intercept values. If the sample absorption pathlength 
(L<INF>S</INF>), sample gas temperature (T<INF>S</INF>), or sample gas 
pressure (P<INF>S</INF>) during the actual sample analyses differ from 
L<INF>R</INF>, T<INF>R</INF>, and P<INF>R</INF>, use a program or set of 
programs that applies multiplicative corrections to the derived 
concentrations to account for these variations, and that provides as 
output both the corrected and uncorrected values. Include in the report 
of the analysis (see section 7.0 of this addendum) the details of any 
transformations applied to the original reference spectra (e.g., 
differentiation), in such a fashion that all analytical results may be 
verified by an independent agent from the reference spectra and data 
spectra alone.
    4.11 Determine the Fractional Calibration Uncertainty. Calculate the 
fractional calibration uncertainty for each analyte (FCUi) according to 
appendix F of this addendum, and compare these values to the fractional 
uncertainty limits (AU<INF>i</INF>; see section 4.1.2 of this addendum). 
If FCU<INF>i</INF> <ls-thn-eq>AU<INF>i</INF>, either the reference 
spectra or analytical programs for that analyte are unsuitable.
    4.12 Verify System Configuration Suitability. Using appendix C of 
this addendum, measure or obtain estimates of the noise level 
(RMS<INF>EST</INF>, absorbance) of the FTIR system.

[[Page 793]]

Alternatively, construct the complete spectrometer system and determine 
the values RMS<INF>Sm</INF> using appendix G of this addendum. Estimate 
the minimum measurement uncertainty for each analyte (MAU<INF>i</INF>, 
ppm) and known interferant (MIU<INF>k</INF>, ppm) using appendix D of 
this addendum. Verify that (a) MAU<INF>i</INF> < 
(AU<INF>i</INF>)(DL<INF>i</INF>), FRUi < AU<INF>i</INF>, and FCUi < 
AU<INF>i</INF> for each analyte and that (b) the CTS chosen meets the 
requirements listed in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.5 of this addendum.

                   5.0 Sampling and Analysis Procedure

    5.1 Analysis System Assembly and Leak-Test. Assemble the analysis 
system. Allow sufficient time for all system components to reach the 
desired temperature. Then, determine the leak-rate (L<INF>R</INF>) and 
leak volume (V<INF>L</INF>), where V<INF>L</INF>=L<INF>R</INF> 
t<INF>SS</INF>. Leak volumes shall be <=4 percent of V<INF>SS</INF>.
    5.2 Verify Instrumental Performance. Measure the noise level of the 
system in each analytical region using the procedure of appendix G of 
this addendum. If any noise level is higher than that estimated for the 
system in section 4.12 of this addendum, repeat the calculations of 
appendix D of this addendum and verify that the requirements of section 
4.12 of this addendum are met; if they are not, adjust or repair the 
instrument and repeat this section.
    5.3 Determine the Sample Absorption Pathlength
    Record a background spectrum. Then, fill the absorption cell with 
CTS at the pressure P<INF>R</INF> and record a set of CTS spectra [R3]. 
Store the background and unscaled CTS single beam interferograms and 
spectra. Using appendix H of this addendum, calculate the sample 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>) for each analytical region. The 
values L<INF>S</INF> shall not differ from the approximated sample 
pathlength L<INF>S</INF>' (see section 4.4 of this addendum) by more 
than 5 percent.
    5.4 Record Sample Spectrum. Connect the sample line to the source. 
Either evacuate the absorption cell to an absolute pressure below 5 mmHg 
before extracting a sample from the effluent stream into the absorption 
cell, or pump at least ten cell volumes of sample through the cell 
before obtaining a sample. Record the sample pressure P<INF>S</INF>. 
Generate the absorbance spectrum of the sample. Store the background and 
sample single beam interferograms, and document the process by which the 
absorbance spectra are generated from these data. (If necessary, apply 
the spectral transformations developed in section 5.6.2 of this 
addendum). The resulting sample spectrum is referred to below as 
S<INF>S</INF>.

    Note: Multiple sample spectra may be recorded according to the 
procedures of section 5.4 of this addendum before performing sections 
5.5 and 5.6 of this addendum.

    5.5 Quantify Analyte Concentrations. Calculate the unscaled analyte 
concentrations RUA<INF>i</INF> and unscaled interferant concentrations 
RUI<INF>K</INF> using the programs developed in section 4 of this 
addendum. To correct for pathlength and pressure variations between the 
reference and sample spectra, calculate the scaling factor, 
R<INF>LPS</INF> using equation A.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.012

Calculate the final analyte and interferant concentrations 
RSA<INF>i</INF> and RSI<INF>k</INF> using equations A.2 and A.3,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.013

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.014

    5.6 Determine Fractional Analysis Uncertainty. Fill the absorption 
cell with CTS at the pressure P<INF>S</INF>. Record a set of CTS spectra 
[R4]. Store the background and CTS single beam interferograms. Using 
appendix H of this addendum, calculate the fractional analysis 
uncertainty (FAU) for each analytical region. If the FAU indicated for 
any analytical region is greater than the required accuracy requirements 
determined in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum, then 
comparisons to previously recorded reference spectra are invalid in that 
analytical region, and the analyst shall perform one or both of the 
procedures of sections 5.6.1 through 5.6.2 of this addendum.
    5.6.1 Perform instrumental checks and adjust the instrument to 
restore its performance to acceptable levels. If adjustments are made, 
repeat sections 5.3, 5.4 (except for the recording of a sample 
spectrum), and 5.5 of this addendum to demonstrate that acceptable 
uncertainties are obtained in all analytical regions.
    5.6.2 Apply appropriate mathematical transformations (e.g., 
frequency shifting, zero-filling, apodization, smoothing) to the spectra 
(or to the interferograms upon which the spectra are based) generated 
during the performance of the procedures of section 5.3 of this 
addendum. Document these transformations and their reproducibility. Do 
not apply multiplicative scaling of the spectra, or any set of 
transformations that is mathematically equivalent to multiplicative 
scaling. Different transformations may be applied to different 
analytical regions. Frequency shifts shall be less than one-half the 
minimum instrumental linewidth, and must be applied to all spectral data 
points in an analytical region. The mathematical transformations may be 
retained for the analysis if they are also applied to the appropriate 
analytical regions of all sample spectra recorded, and if all original 
sample spectra are digitally stored. Repeat sections 5.3, 5.4 (except 
the recording of a sample spectrum), and 5.5 of this addendum to 
demonstrate

[[Page 794]]

that these transformations lead to acceptable calculated concentration 
uncertainties in all analytical regions.

                      6.0 Post-Analysis Evaluations

    Estimate the overall accuracy of the analyses performed in 
accordance with sections 5.1 through 5.6 of this addendum using the 
procedures of sections 6.1 through 6.3 of this addendum.
    6.1 Qualitatively Confirm the Assumed Matrix. Examine each 
analytical region of the sample spectrum for spectral evidence of 
unexpected or unidentified interferants. If found, identify the 
interfering compounds (see Reference C for guidance) and add them to the 
list of known interferants. Repeat the procedures of section 4 of this 
addendum to include the interferants in the uncertainty calculations and 
analysis procedures. Verify that the MAU and FCU values do not increase 
beyond acceptable levels for the application requirements. Re-calculate 
the analyte concentrations (section 5.5 of this addendum) in the 
affected analytical regions.
    6.2 Quantitatively Evaluate Fractional Model Uncertainty (FMU). 
Perform the procedures of either section 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 of this 
addendum:
    6.2.1 Using appendix I of this addendum, determine the fractional 
model error (FMU) for each analyte.
    6.2.2 Provide statistically determined uncertainties FMU for each 
analyte which are equivalent to two standard deviations at the 95 
percent confidence level. Such determinations, if employed, must be 
based on mathematical examinations of the pertinent sample spectra (not 
the reference spectra alone). Include in the report of the analysis (see 
section 7.0 of this addendum) a complete description of the 
determination of the concentration uncertainties.
    6.3 Estimate Overall Concentration Uncertainty (OCU). Using appendix 
J of this addendum, determine the overall concentration uncertainty 
(OCU) for each analyte. If the OCU is larger than the required accuracy 
for any analyte, repeat sections 4 and 6 of this addendum.

                       7.0 Reporting Requirements

[Documentation pertaining to virtually all the procedures of sections 4, 
5, and 6 will be required. Software copies of reference spectra and 
sample spectra will be retained for some minimum time following the 
actual testing.]

concentration of the species and absorption pathlength. For reference 
spectra, this is a known quantity; for sample spectra, it is the 
quantity directly determined from Beer's law. The units ``centimeters-
ppm'' or ``meters-ppm'' are recommended.
    Derivative absorption spectrum means a plot of rate of change of 
absorbance or of any function of absorbance with respect to wavelength 
or any function of wavelength.
    Double beam spectrum means a transmission or absorbance spectrum 
derived by dividing the sample single beam spectrum by the background 
spectrum.

    Note: The term ``double-beam'' is used elsewhere to denote a 
spectrum in which the sample and background interferograms are collected 
simultaneously along physically distinct absorption paths. Here, the 
term denotes a spectrum in which the sample and background 
interferograms are collected at different times along the same 
absorption path.

    Fast Fourier transform (FFT) means a method of speeding up the 
computation of a discrete FT by factoring the data into sparse matrices 
containing mostly zeros.
    Flyback means interferometer motion during which no data are 
recorded.
    Fourier transform (FT) means the mathematical process for converting 
an amplitude-time spectrum to an amplitude-frequency spectrum, or vice 
versa.
    Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer means an analytical 
system that employs a source of mid-infrared radiation, an 
interferometer, an enclosed sample cell of known absorption pathlength, 
an infrared detector, optical elements that transfer infrared radiation 
between components, and a computer system. The time-domain detector 
response (interferogram) is processed by a Fourier transform to yield a 
representation of the detector response vs. infrared frequency.

    Note: When FTIR spectrometers are interfaced with other instruments, 
a slash should be used to denote the interface; e.g., GC/FTIR; HPCL/
FTIR, and the use of FTIR should be explicit; i.e., FTIR not IR.

    Frequency, v means the number of cycles per unit time.
    Infrared means the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum 
containing wavelengths from approximately 0.78 to 800 microns.
    Interferogram, I([sigma]) means record of the modulated component of 
the interference signal measured as a function of retardation by the 
detector.
    Interferometer means device that divides a beam of radiant energy 
into two or more paths, generates an optical path difference between the 
beams, and recombines them in order to produce repetitive interference 
maxima and minima as the optical retardation is varied.
    Linewidth means the full width at half maximum of an absorption band 
in units of wavenumbers (cm<SUP>-1</SUP>).
    Mid-infrared means the region of the electromagnetic spectrum from 
approximately 400 to 5000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.
    Reference spectra means absorption spectra of gases with known 
chemical compositions, recorded at a known absorption pathlength, which 
are used in the quantitative analysis of gas samples.
    Retardation, [sigma] means optical path difference between two beams 
in an interferometer; also known as ``optical path difference'' or 
``optical retardation.''
    Scan means digital representation of the detector output obtained 
during one complete motion of the interferometer's moving assembly or 
assemblies.
    Scaling means application of a multiplicative factor to the 
absorbance values in a spectrum.
    Single beam spectrum means Fourier-transformed interferogram, 
representing the detector response vs. wavenumber.

    Note: The term ``single-beam'' is used elsewhere to denote any 
spectrum in which the sample and background interferograms are recorded 
on the same physical absorption path; such usage differentiates such 
spectra from those generated using interferograms recorded along two 
physically distinct absorption paths (see ``double-beam spectrum'' 
above). Here, the term applies (for example) to the two spectra used 
directly in the calculation of transmission and absorbance spectra of a 
sample.

    Standard reference material means a reference material, the 
composition or properties of which are certified by a recognized 
standardizing agency or group.

    Note: The equivalent ISO term is ``certified reference material.''

    Transmittance, T means the ratio of radiant power transmitted by the 
sample to the radiant power incident on the sample. Estimated in FTIR 
spectroscopy by forming the ratio of the single-beam sample and 
background spectra.
    Wavenumber, v means the number of waves per unit length.

    Note: The usual unit of wavenumber is the reciprocal centimeter, 
cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The wavenumber is the reciprocal of the wavelength, 
[lambda], when [lambda] is expressed in centimeters.

    Zero-filling means the addition of zero-valued points to the end of 
a measured interferogram.


[[Page 796]]


    Note: Performing the FT of a zero-filled interferogram results in 
correctly interpolated points in the computed spectrum.

 Appendix B to Addendum to Method 320--Identifying Spectral Interferants

                               B.1 General

    B.1.1 Assume a fixed absorption pathlength equal to the value 
L<INF>S</INF>'.
    B.1.2 Use band area calculations to compare the relative absorption 
strengths of the analytes and potential interferants. In the m\th\ 
analytical region (FL<INF>m</INF> to FU<INF>m</INF>), use either 
rectangular or trapezoidal approximations to determine the band areas 
described below (see Reference A, sections A.3.1 through A.3.3). 
Document any baseline corrections applied to the spectra.
    B.1.3 Use the average total absorbance of the analytes and potential 
interferants in each analytical region to determine whether the 
analytical region is suitable for analyte concentration determinations.

    Note: The average absorbance in an analytical region is the band 
area divided by the width of the analytical region in wavenumbers. The 
average total absorbance in an analytical region is the sum of the 
average absorbances of all analytes and potential interferants.

                            B.2 Calculations

    B.2.1 Prepare spectral representations of each analyte at the 
concentration CL<INF>i</INF> = (DL<INF>i</INF>)(AU<INF>i</INF>), where 
DL<INF>i</INF> is the required detection limit and AU<INF>i</INF> is the 
maximum permissible analytical uncertainty. For the m\th\ analytical 
region, calculate the band area (AAI<INF>im</INF>) and average 
absorbance (AAV<INF>im</INF>) from these scaled analyte spectra.
    B.2.2 Prepare spectral representations of each potential interferant 
at its expected concentration (CPOT<INF>j</INF>). For the m\th\ 
analytical region, calculate the band area (IAI<INF>jm</INF>) and 
average absorbance (IAV<INF>jm</INF>) from these scaled potential 
interferant spectra.
    B.2.3 Repeat the calculation for each analytical region, and record 
the band area results in matrix form as indicated in Figure B.1.
    B.2.4 If the band area of any potential interferant in an analytical 
region is greater than the one-half the band area of any analyte (i.e., 
IAI<INF>jm</INF> <ls-thn-eq> 0.5 AAI<INF>im</INF> for any pair ij and 
any m), classify the potential interferant as a known interferant. Label 
the known interferants k = 1 to K. Record the results in matrix form as 
indicated in Figure B.2.

[[Page 798]]

    B.2.5 Calculate the average total absorbance (AVT<INF>m</INF>) for 
each analytical region and record the values in the last row of the 
matrix described in Figure B.2. Any analytical region where 
AVT<INF>m</INF> <ls-thn-eq> 2.0 is unsuitable.

      Appendix C to Addendum to Method 320--Estimating Noise Levels

                               C.1 General

    C.1.1 The root-mean-square (RMS) noise level is the standard measure 
of noise in this addendum. The RMS noise level of a contiguous segment 
of a spectrum is defined as the RMS difference (RMSD) between the 
absorbance values which form the segment and the mean value of that 
segment (see appendix A of this addendum).
    C.1.2 The RMS noise value in double-beam absorbance spectra is 
assumed to be inversely proportional to: (a) the square root of the 
signal integration period of the sample single beam spectra from which 
it is formed, and (b) the total infrared power transmitted through the 
interferometer and absorption cell.
    C.1.3 Practically, the assumption of C.1.2 allows the RMS noise 
level of a complete system to be estimated from the quantities described 
in sections C.1.3.1 through C.1.3.4:
    C.1.3.1 RMS<INF>MAN</INF>, the noise level of the system (in 
absorbance units), without the absorption cell and transfer optics, 
under those conditions necessary to yield the specified minimum 
instrumental linewidth, e.g., Jacquinot stop size.
    C.1.3.2 t<INF>MAN</INF>, the manufacturer's signal integration time 
used to determine RMS<INF>MAN</INF>.
    C.1.3.3 t<INF>SS</INF>, the signal integration time for the 
analyses.
    C.1.3.4 TP, the manufacturer's estimate of the fraction of the total 
infrared power transmitted by the absorption cell and transfer optics 
from the interferometer to the detector.

                            C.2 Calculations

    C.2.1 Obtain the values of RMS<INF>MAN</INF>, t<INF>MAN</INF>, and 
TP from the manufacturers of the equipment, or determine the noise level 
by direct measurements with the completely constructed system proposed 
in section 4 of this addendum.
    C.2.2 Calculate the noise value of the system (RMS<INF>EST</INF>) 
using equation C.1.

 Appendix D to Addendum to Method 320--Estimating Minimum Concentration 
                 Measurement Uncertainties (MAU and MIU)

                               D.1 General

    Estimate the minimum concentration measurement uncertainties for the 
i\th\ analyte (MAU<INF>i</INF>) and j\th\ interferant (MIU<INF>j</INF>) 
based on the spectral data in the m\th\ analytical region by comparing 
the analyte band area in the analytical region (AAI<INF>im</INF>) and 
estimating or measuring the noise level of the system (RMS<INF>EST</INF> 
or RMS<INF>SM</INF>).

    Note: For a single analytical region, the MAU or MIU value is the 
concentration of the analyte or interferant for which the band area is 
equal to the product of the analytical region width (in wavenumbers) and 
the noise level of the system (in absorbance units). If data from more 
than one analytical region are used in the determination of an analyte 
concentration, the MAU or MIU is the mean of the separate MAU or MIU 
values calculated for each analytical region.

                            D.2 Calculations

    D.2.1 For each analytical region, set RMS = RMS<INF>SM</INF> if 
measured (appendix G of this addendum), or set RMS = RMS<INF>EST</INF> 
if estimated (appendix C of this addendum).
    D.2.2 For each analyte associated with the analytical region, 
calculate MAU<INF>im</INF> using equation D.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.020

    D.2.3 If only the m\th\ analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set MAU<INF>i</INF> = 
MAU<INF>im</INF>.
    D.2.4 If more than one analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set MAU<INF>i</INF> equal to the 
weighted mean of the appropriate MAU<INF>im</INF> values calculated 
above; the weight for each term in the mean is equal to the fraction of 
the total wavenumber range used for the calculation

[[Page 800]]

represented by each analytical region. Mathematically, if the set of 
analytical regions employed is [m'], then the MAU for each analytical 
region is given by equation D.2.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.021

where the weight W<INF>ik</INF> is defined for each term in the sum as
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.022

    D.2.5 Repeat sections D.2.1 through D.2.4 of this appendix to 
calculate the analogous values MIU<INF>j</INF> for the interferants j = 
1 to J. Replace the value (AU<INF>i</INF>) (DL<INF>i</INF>) in equation 
D.1 with CPOT<INF>j</INF>/20; replace the value AAI<INF>im</INF> in 
equation D.1 with IAI<INF>jm</INF>.

      Appendix E to Addendum to Method 320--Determining Fractional 
                   Reproducibility Uncertainties (FRU)

                               E.1 General

    To estimate the reproducibility of the spectroscopic results of the 
system, compare the CTS spectra recorded before and after preparing the 
reference spectra. Compare the difference between the spectra to their 
average band area. Perform the calculation for each analytical region on 
the portions of the CTS spectra associated with that analytical region.

                            E.2 Calculations

    E.2.1 The CTS spectra {R1{time}  consist of N spectra, denoted by 
S<INF>1i</INF>, i=1, N. Similarly, the CTS spectra {R2{time}  consist of 
N spectra, denoted by S<INF>2i</INF>, i=1, N. Each S<INF>ki</INF> is the 
spectrum of a single compound, where i denotes the compound and k 
denotes the set {{time}  of which S<INF>ki</INF> is a member. Form the 
spectra S<INF>3</INF> according to S<INF>3i</INF> = S<INF>2i</INF>-
S<INF>1i</INF> for each i. Form the spectra S<INF>4</INF> according to 
S<INF>4i</INF> = [S<INF>2i</INF>+S<INF>1i</INF>]/2 for each i.
    E.2.2 Each analytical region m is associated with a portion of the 
CTS spectra S<INF>2i</INF> and S<INF>1i</INF>, for a particular i, with 
lower and upper wavenumber limits FFL<INF>m</INF> and FFU<INF>m</INF>, 
respectively.
    E.2.3 For each m and the associated i, calculate the band area of 
S<INF>4i</INF> in the wavenumber range FFU<INF>m</INF> to 
FFL<INF>m</INF>. Follow the guidelines of section B.1.2 of this addendum 
for this band area calculation. Denote the result by BAV<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.4 For each m and the associated i, calculate the RMSD of 
S<INF>3i</INF> between the absorbance values and their mean in the 
wavenumber range FFU<INF>m</INF> to FFL<INF>m</INF>. Denote the result 
by SRMS<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.5 For each analytical region m, calculate FM<INF>m</INF> using 
equation E.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.023

    E.2.6 If only the m\th\ analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set FRU<INF>i</INF> = 
FM<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.7 If a number p<INF>i</INF> of analytical regions are used to 
calculate the concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set FRU<INF>i</INF> 
equal to the weighted mean of the appropriate FM<INF>m</INF> values 
calculated according to section E.2.5. Mathematically, if the set of 
analytical regions employed is {m'{time} , then FRU<INF>i</INF> is given 
by equation E.2,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.024

where the W<INF>ik</INF> are calculated as described in appendix D of 
this addendum.

Appendix F of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Fractional Calibration 
                           Uncertainties (FCU)

                               F.1 General

    F.1.1 The concentrations yielded by the computerized analytical 
program applied to each single-compound reference spectrum are defined 
as the indicated standard concentrations (ISC's). The ISC values for a 
single compound spectrum should ideally equal the accepted standard 
concentration (ASC) for one analyte or interferant, and should ideally 
be zero for all other compounds. Variations from these results are 
caused by errors in the ASC values, variations from the Beer's law (or 
modified Beer's law) model used to determine the concentrations, and

[[Page 801]]

noise in the spectra. When the first two effects dominate, the 
systematic nature of the errors is often apparent and the analyst shall 
take steps to correct them.
    F.1.2 When the calibration error appears non-systematic, apply the 
procedures of sections F.2.1 through F.2.3 of this appendix to estimate 
the fractional calibration uncertainty (FCU) for each compound. The FCU 
is defined as the mean fractional error between the ASC and the ISC for 
all reference spectra with non-zero ASC for that compound. The FCU for 
each compound shall be less than the required fractional uncertainty 
specified in section 4.1 of this addendum.
    F.1.3 The computerized analytical programs shall also be required to 
yield acceptably low concentrations for compounds with ISC = 0 when 
applied to the reference spectra. The ISC of each reference spectrum for 
each analyte or interferant shall not exceed that compound's minimum 
measurement uncertainty (MAU or MIU).

                            F.2 Calculations

    F.2.1 Apply each analytical program to each reference spectrum. 
Prepare a similar table to that in Figure F.1 to present the ISC and ASC 
values for each analyte and interferant in each reference spectrum. 
Maintain the order of reference file names and compounds employed in 
preparing Figure F.1.
    F.2.2 For all reference spectra in Figure F.1, verify that the 
absolute values of the ISC's are less than the compound's MAU (for 
analytes) or MIU (for interferants).
    F.2.3 For each analyte reference spectrum, calculate the quantity 
(ASC-ISC)/ASC. For each analyte, calculate the mean of these values (the 
FCU<INF>i</INF> for the i\th\ analyte) over all reference spectra. 
Prepare a similar table to that in Figure F.2 to present the

      Appendix G to Addendum to Method 320--Measuring Noise Levels

                               G.1 General

    The root-mean-square (RMS) noise level is the standard measure of 
noise. The RMS noise level of a contiguous segment of a spectrum is the 
RMSD between the absorbance values that form the segment and the mean 
value of the segment (see appendix A of this addendum).

                            G.2 Calculations

    G.2.1 Evacuate the absorption cell or fill it with UPC grade 
nitrogen at approximately one atmosphere total pressure.
    G.2.2 Record two single beam spectra of signal integration period 
t<INF>SS</INF>.
    G.2.3 Form the double beam absorption spectrum from these two single 
beam spectra, and calculate the noise level RMS<INF>Sm</INF> in the M 
analytical regions.

  Appendix H of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Sample Absorption 
 Pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>) and Fractional Analytical Uncertainty (FAU)

                               H.1 General

    Reference spectra recorded at absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), 
gas pressure (P<INF>R</INF>), and gas absolute temperature 
(T<INF>R</INF>) may be used to determine analyte concentrations in 
samples whose spectra are recorded at conditions different from that of 
the reference spectra, i.e., at absorption pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>), 
absolute temperature (T<INF>S</INF>), and pressure (P<INF>S</INF>). This 
appendix describes the calculations for estimating the fractional 
uncertainty (FAU) of this practice. It also describes the calculations 
for determining the sample absorption pathlength from comparison of CTS 
spectra, and for preparing spectra for further instrumental and 
procedural checks.
    H.1.1 Before sampling, determine the sample absorption pathlength 
using least squares analysis. Determine the ratio L<INF>S</INF>/
L<INF>R</INF> by comparing the spectral sets {R1{time}  and {R3{time} , 
which are recorded using the same CTS at L<INF>S</INF> and 
L<INF>R</INF>, and T<INF>S</INF> and T<INF>R</INF>, but both at 
P<INF>R</INF>.
    H.1.2 Determine the fractional analysis uncertainty (FAU) for each 
analyte by comparing a scaled CTS spectral set, recorded at 
L<INF>S</INF>, T<INF>S</INF>, and P<INF>S</INF>, to the CTS reference 
spectra of the same gas, recorded at L<INF>R</INF>, T<INF>R</INF>, and 
P<INF>R</INF>. Perform the quantitative comparison after recording the 
sample spectra, based on band areas of the spectra in the CTS absorbance 
band associated with each analyte.

    H.2.1 Absorption Pathlength Determination. Perform and document 
separate linear baseline corrections to each analytical region in the 
spectral sets {R1{time}  and {R3{time} . Form a one-dimensional array 
A<INF>R</INF> containing the absorbance values from all segments of 
{R1{time}  that are associated with the analytical regions; the members 
of the array are A<INF>Ri</INF>, i = 1, n. Form a similar one-
dimensional array A<INF>S</INF> from the absorbance values in the 
spectral set {R3{time} ; the members of the array are A<INF>Si</INF>, i 
= 1, n. Based on the model A<INF>S</INF> = rA<INF>R</INF> + E, determine 
the least-squares estimate of r, the value of r which minimizes the

values from {R1{time}  to form A<INF>R</INF>, and values from {R4{time}

   Appendix I to Addendum to Method 320--Determining Fractional Model 
                           Uncertainties (FMU)

                               I.1 General

    To prepare analytical programs for FTIR analyses, the sample 
constituents must first be assumed. The calculations in this appendix, 
based upon a simulation of the sample spectrum, shall be used to verify 
the appropriateness of these assumptions. The simulated spectra consist 
of the sum of single compound reference spectra scaled to represent 
their contributions to the sample absorbance spectrum; scaling factors 
are based on the indicated standard concentrations (ISC) and measured 
(sample) analyte and interferant concentrations, the sample and 
reference absorption pathlengths, and the sample and reference gas 
pressures. No band-shape correction for differences in the temperature 
of the sample and reference spectra gases is made; such errors are 
included in the FMU estimate. The actual and simulated sample spectra 
are quantitatively compared to determine the fractional model 
uncertainty; this comparison uses the reference

[[Page 803]]

spectra band areas and residuals in the difference spectrum formed from 
the actual and simulated sample spectra.

                            I.2 Calculations

    I.2.1 For each analyte (with scaled concentration RSA<INF>i</INF>), 
select a reference spectrum SA<INF>i</INF> with indicated standard 
concentration ISC<INF>i</INF>. Calculate the scaling factors, 
RA<INF>i</INF>, using equation I.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.029

Form the spectra SAC<INF>i</INF> by scaling each SA<INF>i</INF> by the 
factor RA<INF>i</INF>.
    I.2.2 For each interferant, select a reference spectrum 
SI<INF>k</INF> with indicated standard concentration ISC<INF>k</INF>. 
Calculate the scaling factors, RI<INF>k</INF>, using equation I.2,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.030

Form the spectra SIC<INF>k</INF> by scaling each SI<INF>k</INF> by the 
factor RI<INF>k</INF>.
    I.2.3 For each analytical region, determine by visual inspection 
which of the spectra SAC<INF>i</INF> and SIC<INF>k</INF> exhibit 
absorbance bands within the analytical region. Subtract each spectrum 
SAC<INF>i</INF> and SIC<INF>k</INF> exhibiting absorbance from the 
sample spectrum S<INF>S</INF> to form the spectrum SUB<INF>S</INF>. To 
save analysis time and to avoid the introduction of unwanted noise into 
the subtracted spectrum, it is recommended that the calculation be made 
(1) only for those spectral data points within the analytical regions, 
and (2) for each analytical region separately using the original 
spectrum S<INF>S</INF>.
    I.2.4 For each analytical region m, calculate the RMSD of 
SUB<INF>S</INF> between the absorbance values and their mean in the 
region FFU<INF>m</INF> to FFL<INF>m</INF>. Denote the result by 
RMSS<INF>m</INF>.
    I.2.5 For each analyte i, calculate FM<INF>m</INF>, using equation 
I.3,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.031

for each analytical region associated with the analyte.
    I.2.6 If only the m\th\ analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set FMU<INF>i</INF>=FM<INF>m</INF>.
    I.2.7 If a number of analytical regions are used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set FM<INF>i</INF> equal to the 
weighted mean of the appropriate FM<INF>m</INF> values calculated using 
equation I-3. Mathematically, if the set of analytical regions employed 
is {m'{time} , then the fractional model uncertainty, FMU, is given by 
equation I.4,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.032

where W<INF>ik</INF> is calculated as described in appendix D of this 
addendum.

Appendix J of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Overall Concentration 
                           Uncertainties (OCU)

    The calculations in this addendum estimate the measurement 
uncertainties for various FTIR measurements. The lowest possible overall 
concentration uncertainty (OCU) for an analyte is its MAU value, which 
is an estimate of the absolute concentration uncertainty when spectral 
noise dominates the measurement error. However, if the product of the 
largest fractional concentration uncertainty (FRU, FCU, FAU, or FMU) and 
the measured concentration of an analyte exceeds the MAU for the 
analyte, then the OCU is this product. In mathematical terms, set 
OFU<INF>i</INF> = MAX{FRU<INF>i</INF>, FCU<INF>i</INF>, FAU<INF>i</INF>, 
FMU<INF>i</INF>{time}  and OCU<INF>i</INF> = 
MAX{RSA<INF>i</INF>*OFU<INF>i</INF>, MAU<INF>i</INF>{time} .

 Test Method 321--Measurement of Gaseous Hydrogen Chloride Emissions At 
 Portland Cement Kilns by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy

                            1.0 Introduction

    This method should be performed by those persons familiar with the 
operation of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) instrumentation in the 
application to source sampling. This document describes the sampling 
procedures for use in the application of FTIR spectrometry for the 
determination of vapor phase hydrogen chloride (HCl) concentrations both 
before and after particulate matter control devices installed at 
portland cement kilns. A procedure for analyte spiking is included for 
quality assurance. This method is considered to be self validating 
provided that the requirements listed in section 9 of this method are 
followed. The analytical procedures for interpreting infrared spectra 
from emission measurements are described in the ``Protocol For The Use 
of Extractive

[[Page 804]]

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry in Analyses of Gaseous 
Emissions From Stationary Industrial Sources'', included as an addendum 
to proposed Method 320 of this appendix (hereafter referred to as the 
``FTIR Protocol)''. References 1 and 2 describe the use of FTIR 
spectrometry in field measurements. Sample transport presents the 
principal difficulty in directly measuring HCl emissions. This identical 
problem must be overcome by any extractive measurement method. HCl is 
reactive and water soluble. The sampling system must be adequately 
designed to prevent sample condensation in the system.
    1.1 Scope and Application
    This method is specifically designed for the application of FTIR 
Spectrometry in extractive measurements of gaseous HCl concentrations in 
portland cement kiln emissions.

                            1.2 Applicability

    This method applies to the measurement of HCl [CAS No. 7647-01-0]. 
This method can be applied to the determination of HCl concentrations 
both before and after particulate matter control devices installed at 
portland cement manufacturing facilities. This method applies to either 
continuous flow through measurement (with isolated sample analysis) or 
grab sampling (batch analysis). HCl is measured using the mid-infrared 
spectral region for analysis (about 400 to 4000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> or 25 to 
2.5 [micro]m). Table 1 lists the suggested analytical region for 
quantification of HCl taking the interference from water vapor into 
consideration.

    1.3 Method Range and Sensitivity
    1.3.1 The analytical range is determined by the instrumental design 
and the composition of the gas stream. For practical purposes there is 
no upper limit to the range because the pathlength may be reduced or the 
sample may be diluted. The lower detection range depends on (1) the 
absorption coefficient of the compound in the analytical frequency 
region, (2) the spectral resolution, (3) the interferometer sampling 
time, (4) the detector sensitivity and response, and (5) the absorption 
pathlength.
    1.3.2 The practical lower quantification range is usually higher 
than that indicated by the instrument performance in the laboratory, and 
is dependent upon (1) the presence of interfering species in the exhaust 
gas (notably H<INF>2</INF>O), (2) the optical alignment of the gas cell 
and transfer optics, and (3) the quality of the reflective surfaces in 
the cell (cell throughput). Under typical test conditions (moisture 
content of up to 30 percent, 10 meter absorption path length, liquid 
nitrogen-cooled IR detector, 0.5 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> resolution, and an 
interferometer sampling time of 60 seconds) a typical lower 
quantification range for HCl is 0.1 to 1.0 ppm.
    1.4 Data Quality Objectives
    1.4.1 In designing or configuring the analytical system, data 
quality is determined by measuring of the root mean square deviation 
(RMSD) of the absorbance values within a chosen spectral (analytical) 
region. The RMSD provides an indication of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/
N) of the spectral baseline. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol (the 
addendum to Method 320 of this appendix) presents a discussion of the 
relationship between the RMSD, lower detection limit, DL<INF>i</INF>, 
and analytical uncertainty, AU<INF>i</INF>. It is important to consider 
the target analyte quantification limit when performing testing with 
FTIR instrumentation, and to optimize the system to achieve the desired 
detection limit.
    1.4.2 Data quality is determined by measuring the root mean square 
(RMS) noise level in each analytical spectral region (appendix C of the 
FTIR Protocol). The RMS noise is defined as the root mean square 
deviation (RMSD) of the absorbance values in an analytical region from 
the mean absorbance value in the same region. Appendix D of the FTIR 
Protocol defines the minimum analyte uncertainty (MAU), and how the RMSD 
is used to calculate the MAU. The MAU<INF>im</INF> is the minimum 
concentration of the ith analyte in the mth analytical region for which 
the analytical uncertainty limit can be maintained. Table 2 presents 
example values of AU and MAU using the analytical region presented in 
Table 1.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Principle
    See Method 320 of this appendix. HCl can also undergo rotation 
transitions by absorbing energy in the far-infrared spectral region. The 
rotational transitions are superimposed on the vibrational fundamental 
to give a series of lines centered at the fundamental vibrational 
frequency, 2885 cm-\1\. The frequencies of absorbance and the pattern of 
rotational/vibrational lines are unique to HCl. When this distinct 
pattern is observed in an infrared spectrum of an unknown sample, it 
unequivocally identifies HCl as a component of the mixture. The infrared 
spectrum of HCl is very distinctive and cannot be confused with the 
spectrum of any other compound. See Reference 6.
    2.2 Sampling and Analysis. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    2.3 Operator Requirements. The analyst must have knowledge of 
spectral patterns to choose an appropriate absorption path length or 
determine if sample dilution is necessary. The analyst should also 
understand FTIR instrument operation well enough to choose instrument 
settings that are consistent with the objectives of the analysis.

                             3.0 Definitions

    See appendix A of the FTIR Protocol.

                            4.0 Interferences

    This method will not measure HCl under conditions: (1) where the 
sample gas stream can condense in the sampling system or the 
instrumentation, or (2) where a high moisture content sample relative to 
the analyte concentrations imparts spectral interference due to the 
water vapor absorbance bands. For measuring HCl the first (sampling) 
consideration is more critical. Spectral interference from water vapor 
is not a significant problem except at very high moisture levels and low 
HCl concentrations.
    4.1 Analytical Interferences. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    4.1.1 Background Interferences. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    4.1.2 Spectral interferences. Water vapor can present spectral 
interference for FTIR gas analysis of HCl. Therefore, the water vapor in 
the spectra of kiln gas samples must be accounted for. This means 
preparing at least one spectrum of a water vapor sample where the 
moisture concentration is close to that in the kiln gas.
    4.2 Sampling System Interferences. The principal sampling system 
interferant for measuring HCl is water vapor. Steps must be taken to 
ensure that no condensation forms anywhere in the probe assembly, sample 
lines, or analytical instrumentation. Cold spots anywhere in the 
sampling system must be avoided. The extent of sampling system bias in 
the FTIR analysis of HCl depends on concentrations of potential 
interferants, moisture content of the gas stream, temperature of the gas 
stream, temperature of sampling system components, sample flow rate, and 
reactivity of HCl with other species in the gas stream (e.g., ammonia). 
For measuring HCl in a wet gas stream the temperatures of the gas 
stream, sampling components, and the sample flow rate are of primary 
importance. Analyte spiking with HCl is performed to demonstrate the 
integrity of the sampling system for transporting HCl vapor in the flue 
gas to the FTIR instrument. See section 9 of this method for a complete 
description of analyte spiking.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Hydrogen chloride vapor is corrosive and can cause irritation or 
severe damage to respiratory system, eyes and skin. Exposure to this 
compound should be avoided.
    5.2 This method may involve sampling at locations having high 
positive or negative pressures, or high concentrations of hazardous or 
toxic pollutants, and can not address all safety problems encountered 
under these diverse sampling conditions. It is the responsibility of the 
tester(s) to ensure proper safety and health practices, and to determine 
the applicability of regulatory limitations before performing this test 
method. Leak-check procedures are outlined in section 8.2 of Method 320 
of this appendix.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.

(interferometer, transfer optics, gas cell and detector) having the 
capability of measuring HCl to the predetermined minimum detectable 
level required (see section 4.1.3 of the FTIR Protocol). The system must 
also include an accurate means to control and/or measure the temperature 
of the FTIR gas analysis cell, and a personal computer with compatible 
software that provides real-time updates of the spectral profile during 
sample and spectral collection.

    6.3 Mass Flow Meters/Controllers. To accurately measure analyte 
spike flow rate, having the appropriate calibrated range and a stated 
accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the absolute measurement 
value. This device must be calibrated with the major component of the 
calibration/spike gas (e.g., nitrogen) using an NIST traceable bubble 
meter or equivalent. Single point calibration checks should be performed 
daily in the field. When spiking HCl, the mass flow meter/controller 
should be thoroughly purged before and after introduction of the gas to 
prevent corrosion of the interior parts.
    6.4 Polytetrafluoroethane tubing. Diameter and length suitable to 
connect cylinder regulators.

Torr (133.3 Pa=1 Torr) within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent.
    6.8 Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel or other appropriate 
material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes and capable of reaching gas sampling 
point.
    6.9 Sampling Line. Heated 180 [deg]C (360 [deg]F) and fabricated of 
either stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethane or other material that 
prevents adsorption of HCl and transports effluent to analytical 
instrumentation. The extractive sample line must have the capability to 
transport sample gas to the analytical components as well as direct 
heated calibration spike gas to the calibration assembly located at the 
sample probe. It is important to minimize the length of heated sample 
line.
    6.10 Particulate Filters. A sintered stainless steel filter rated at 
20 microns or greater may be placed at the inlet of the probe (for 
removal of large particulate matter). A heated filter (Balston or 
equivalent) rated at 1 micron is necessary for primary particulate 
matter removal, and shall be placed immediately after the heated probe. 
The filter/filter holder temperature should be maintained at 180 [deg]C 
(360 [deg]F).
    6.11 Calibration/Analyte Spike Assembly. A heated three-way valve 
assembly (or equivalent) to introduce surrogate spikes into the sampling 
system at the outlet of the probe before the primary particulate filter.
    6.12 Sample Extraction Pump. A leak-free heated head pump (KNF 
Neuberger or equivalent) capable of extracting sample effluent through 
entire sampling system at a rate which prevents analyte losses and 
minimizes analyzer response time. The pump should have a heated by-pass 
and may be placed either before the FTIR instrument or after. If the 
sample pump is located upstream of the FTIR instrument, it must be 
fabricated from materials non-reactive to HCl. The sampling system and 
FTIR measurement system shall allow the operator to obtain at least six 
sample spectra during a one-hour period.
    6.13 Barometer. For measurement of barometric pressure.

calibration or analyte spike) via a heated traced sample line;
    6.14.3 Delivery of sample gas (kiln gas, spiked kiln gas, or system 
calibrations) to the analytical instrumentation;
    6.14.4 Delivery (optional) of a humidified nitrogen sample stream.
    6.15 Flow Measurement Device. Type S Pitot tube (or equivalent) and 
Magnahelic set for measurement of volumetric flow rate.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    HCl can be purchased in a standard compressed gas cylinder. The most 
stable HCl cylinder mixture available has a concentration certified at 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent. Such a cylinder is suitable for 
performing analyte spiking because it will provide reproducible samples. 
The stability of the cylinder can be monitored over time by periodically 
performing direct FTIR analysis of cylinder samples. It is recommended 
that a 10-50 ppm cylinder of HCl be prepared having from 2-5 ppm SF6 as 
a tracer compound. (See sections 7.1 through 7.3 of Method 320 of this 
appendix for a complete description of the use of existing HCl reference 
spectra. See section 9.1 of Method 320 of this appendix for a complete 
discussion of standard concentration selection.)

             8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1 Pretest. A screening test is ideal for obtaining proper data 
that can be used for preparing analytical program files. Information 
from literature surveys and source personnel is also acceptable. 
Information about the sampling location and gas stream composition is 
required to determine the optimum sampling system configuration for 
measuring HCl. Determine the percent moisture of the kiln gas by Method 
4 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter or by performing a wet bulb/
dry bulb measurement. Perform a preliminary traverse of the sample duct 
or stack and select the sampling point(s). Acquire an initial spectrum 
and determine the optimum operational pathlength of the instrument.

direction on performing leak-checks.

8.5 for direction in background spectral acquisition.
    8.4 Pre-Test Calibration Transfer Standard (Direct Instrument 
Calibration). See Method 320 of this appendix, section 8.3 for direction 
in CTS spectral acquisition.
    8.5 Pre-Test System Calibration. See Method 320 of this appendix, 
sections 8.6.1 through 8.6.2 for direction in performing system 
calibration.
    8.6 Sampling
    8.6.1 Extractive System. An extractive system maintained at 180 
[deg]C (360 [deg]F) or higher which is capable of directing a total flow 
of at least 12 L/min to the sample cell is required (References 1 and 
2). Insert the probe into the duct or stack at a point representing the 
average volumetric flow rate and 25 percent of the cross sectional area. 
Co-locate an appropriate flow monitoring device with the sample probe so 
that the flow rate is recorded at specified time intervals during 
emission testing (e.g., differential pressure measurements taken every 
10 minutes during each run).
    8.6.2 Batch Samples. Evacuate the absorbance cell to 5 Torr (or 
less) absolute pressure before taking first sample. Fill the cell with 
kiln gas to ambient pressure and record the infrared spectrum, then 
evacuate the cell until there is no further evidence of infrared 
absorption. Repeat this procedure, collecting a total of six separate 
sample spectra within a 1-hour period.
    8.6.3 Continuous Flow Through Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 
kiln gas for a time period sufficient to equilibrate the entire sampling 
system and FTIR gas cell. The time required is a function of the 
mechanical response time of the system (determined by performing the 
system calibration with the CTS gas or equivalent), and by the chemical 
reactivity of the target analytes. If the effluent target analyte 
concentration is not variable, observation of the spectral up-date of 
the flowing gas sample should be performed until equilibration of the 
sample is achieved. Isolate the gas cell from the sample flow by 
directing the purge flow to vent. Record the spectrum and pressure of 
the sample gas. After spectral acquisition, allow the sample gas to 
purge the cell with at least three volumes of kiln gas. The time 
required to adequately purge the cell with the required volume of gas is 
a function of (1) cell volume, (2) flow rate through the cell, and (3) 
cell design. It is important that the gas introduction and vent for the 
FTIR cell provides a complete purge through the cell.
    8.6.4 Continuous Sampling. In some cases it is possible to collect 
spectra continuously while the FTIR cell is purged with sample gas. The 
sample integration time, t<INF>ss</INF>, the sample flow rate through 
the gas cell, and the sample integration time must be chosen so that the 
collected data consist of at least 10 spectra with each spectrum being 
of a separate cell volume of flue gas. Sampling in this manner may only 
be performed if the native source analyte concentrations do not affect 
the test results.
    8.7 Sample Conditioning
    8.7.1 High Moisture Sampling. Kiln gas emitted from wet process 
cement kilns may contain 3- to 40 percent moisture. Zinc selenide 
windows or the equivalent should be used when attempting to analyze hot/
wet kiln gas under these conditions to prevent dissolution of water 
soluble window materials (e.g., KBr).
    8.7.2 Sample Dilution. The sample may be diluted using an in-stack 
dilution probe, or an external dilution device provided that the sample 
is not diluted below the instrument's quantification range. As an 
alternative to using a dilution probe, nitrogen may be dynamically 
spiked into the effluent stream in the same manner as analyte spiking. A 
constant dilution rate shall be maintained throughout the measurement 
process. It is critical to measure and verify the exact dilution ratio 
when using a dilution probe or the nitrogen spiking approach. 
Calibrating the system with a calibration gas containing an appropriate 
tracer compound will allow determination of the dilution ratio for most 
measurement systems. The tester shall specify the procedures used to 
determine the dilution ratio, and include these calibration results in 
the report.
    8.8 Sampling QA, Data Storage and Reporting. See the FTIR Protocol. 
Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the required 
signal-to-noise ratio, and all sample spectra should have unique file 
names. Two copies of sample interferograms and processed spectra will be 
stored on separate computer media. For each sample spectrum the analyst 
must document the sampling conditions, the sampling time (while the cell 
was being filled), the time the spectrum was recorded, the instrumental 
conditions (path length, temperature, pressure, resolution, integration 
time), and the spectral file name. A hard copy of these data must be 
maintained until the test results are accepted.
    8.9 Signal Transmittance. Monitor the signal transmittance through 
the instrumental system. If signal transmittance (relative to the 
background) drops below 95 percent in any spectral region where the 
sample does not absorb infrared energy, then a new background spectrum 
must be obtained.
    8.10 Post-test CTS. After the sampling run completion, record the 
CTS spectrum. Analysis of the spectral band area used for quantification 
from pre- and post-test CTS spectra should agree to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent or corrective action must be taken.
    8.11 Post-test QA. The sample spectra shall be inspected immediately 
after the run to verify that the gas matrix composition was

[[Page 808]]

close to the assumed gas matrix, (this is necessary to account for the 
concentrations of the interferants for use in the analytical analysis 
programs), and to confirm that the sampling and instrumental parameters 
were appropriate for the conditions encountered.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    Use analyte spiking to verify the effectiveness of the sampling 
system for the target compounds in the actual kiln gas matrix. QA 
spiking shall be performed before and after each sample run. QA spiking 
shall be performed after the pre- and post-test CTS direct and system 
calibrations. The system biases calculated from the pre- and post-test 
dynamic analyte spiking shall be within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 percent 
for the spiked surrogate analytes for the measurements to be considered 
valid. See sections 9.3.1 through 9.3.2 for the requisite calculations. 
Measurement of the undiluted spike (direct-to-cell measurement) involves 
sending dry, spike gas to the FTIR cell, filling the cell to 1 
atmosphere and obtaining the spectrum of this sample. The direct-to-cell 
measurement should be performed before each analyte spike so that the 
recovery of the dynamically spiked analytes may be calculated. Analyte 
spiking is only effective for assessing the integrity of the sampling 
system when the concentration of HCl in the source does not vary 
substantially. Any attempt to quantify an analyte recovery in a variable 
concentration matrix will result in errors in the expected concentration 
of the spiked sample. If the kiln gas target analyte concentrations vary 
by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent (or 5 ppm, whichever is 
greater) in the time required to acquire a sample spectrum, it may be 
necessary to: (1) Use a dual sample probe approach, (2) use two 
independent FTIR measurement systems, (3) use alternate QA/QC 
procedures, or (4) postpone testing until stable emission concentrations 
are achieved. (See section 9.2.3 of this method). It is recommended that 
a laboratory evaluation be performed before attempting to employ this 
method under actual field conditions. The laboratory evaluation shall 
include (1) performance of all applicable calculations in section 4 of 
the FTIR Protocol; (2) simulated analyte spiking experiments in dry 
(ambient) and humidified sample matrices using HCl; and (3) performance 
of bias (recovery) calculations from analyte spiking experiments. It is 
not necessary to perform a laboratory evaluation before every field 
test. The purpose of the laboratory study is to demonstrate that the 
actual instrument and sampling system configuration used in field 
testing meets the requirements set forth in this method.
    9.1 Spike Materials. Perform analyte spiking with an HCl standard to 
demonstrate the integrity of the sampling system.
    9.1.1 An HCl standard of approximately 50 ppm in a balance of ultra 
pure nitrogen is recommended. The SF<INF>6</INF> (tracer) concentration 
shall be 2 to 5 ppm depending upon the measurement pathlength. The spike 
ratio (spike flow/total flow) shall be no greater than 1:10, and an 
ideal spike concentration should approximate the native effluent 
concentration.
    9.1.2 The ideal spike concentration may not be achieved because the 
target concentration cannot be accurately predicted prior to the field 
test, and limited calibration standards will be available during 
testing. Therefore, practical constraints must be applied that allow the 
tester to spike at an anticipated concentration. For these tests, the 
analyte concentration contributed by the HCl standard spike should be 1 
to 5 ppm or should more closely approximate the native concentration if 
it is greater.
    9.2 Spike Procedure
    9.2.1 A spiking/sampling apparatus is shown in Figure 2. Introduce 
the spike/tracer gas mixture at a constant flow (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
percent) rate at approximately 10 percent of the total sample flow. (For 
example, introduce the surrogate spike at 1 L/min 20 cc/min, into a 
total sample flow rate of 10 L/min). The spike must be pre-heated before 
introduction into the sample matrix to prevent a localized condensation 
of the gas stream at the spike introduction point. A heated sample 
transport line(s) containing multiple transport tubes within the heated 
bundle may be used to spike gas up through the sampling system to the 
spike introduction point. Use a calibrated flow device (e.g., mass flow 
meter/controller), to monitor the spike flow as indicated by a 
calibrated flow meter or controller, or alternately, the SF<INF>6</INF> 
tracer ratio may be calculated from the direct measurement and the 
diluted measurement. It is often desirable to use the tracer approach in 
calculating the spike/total flow ratio because of the difficulty in 
accurately measuring hot/wet total flow. The tracer technique has been 
successfully used in past validation efforts (Reference 1).
    9.2.2 Perform a direct-to-cell measurement of the dry, undiluted 
spike gas. Introduce the spike directly to the FTIR cell, bypassing the 
sampling system. Fill cell to 1 atmosphere and collect the spectrum of 
this sample. Ensure that the spike gas has equilibrated to the 
temperature of the measurement cell before acquisition of the spectra. 
Inspect the spectrum and verify that the gas is dry and contains 
negligible CO<INF>2</INF>. Repeat the process to obtain a second direct-
to-cell measurement. Analysis of spectral band areas for HCl from these 
duplicate measurements should agree to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent of the mean.
    9.2.3 Analyte Spiking. Determine whether the kiln gas contains 
native concentrations

[[Page 809]]

of HCl by examination of preliminary spectra. Determine whether the 
concentration varies significantly with time by observing a continuously 
up-dated spectrum of sample gas in the flow-through sampling mode. If 
the concentration varies by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent 
during the period of time required to acquire a spectra, then an 
alternate approach should be used. One alternate approach uses two 
sampling lines to convey sample to the gas distribution manifold. One of 
the sample lines is used to continuously extract unspiked kiln gas from 
the source. The other sample line serves as the analyte spike line. One 
FTIR system can be used in this arrangement. Spiked or unspiked sample 
gas may be directed to the FTIR system from the gas distribution 
manifold, with the need to purge only the components between the 
manifold and the FTIR system. This approach minimizes the time required 
to acquire an equilibrated sample of spiked or unspiked kiln gas. If the 
source varies by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent (or 5 ppm, 
whichever is greater) in the time it takes to switch from the unspiked 
sample line to the spiked sample line, then analyte spiking may not be a 
feasible means to determine the effectiveness of the sampling system for 
the HCl in the sample matrix. A second alternative is to use two 
completely independent FTIR measurement systems. One system would 
measure unspiked samples while the other system would measure the spiked 
samples. As a last option, (where no other alternatives can be used) a 
humidified nitrogen stream may be generated in the field which 
approximates the moisture content of the kiln gas. Analyte spiking into 
this humidified stream can be employed to assure that the sampling 
system is adequate for transporting the HCl to the FTIR instrumentation.
    9.2.3.1 Adjust the spike flow rate to approximately 10 percent of 
the total flow by metering spike gas through a calibrated mass flowmeter 
or controller. Allow spike flow to equilibrate within the sampling 
system before analyzing the first spiked kiln gas samples. A minimum of 
two consecutive spikes are required. Analysis of the spectral band area 
used for quantification should agree to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent or corrective action must be taken.
    9.2.3.2 After QA spiking is completed, the sampling system 
components shall be purged with nitrogen or dry air to eliminate traces 
of the HCl compound from the sampling system components. Acquire a 
sample spectra of the nitrogen purge to verify the absence of the 
calibration mixture.
    9.2.3.3 Analyte spiking procedures must be carefully executed to 
ensure that meaningful measurements are achieved. The requirements of 
sections 9.2.3.3.1 through 9.2.3.3.4 shall be met.
    9.2.3.3.1 The spike must be in the vapor phase, dry, and heated to 
(or above) the kiln gas temperature before it is introduced to the kiln 
gas stream.
    9.2.3.3.2 The spike flow rate must be constant and accurately 
measured.
    9.2.3.3.3 The total flow must also be measured continuously and 
reliably or the dilution ratio must otherwise be verified before and 
after a run by introducing a spike of a non-reactive, stable compound 
(i.e., tracer).
    9.2.3.3.4 The tracer must be inert to the sampling system 
components, not contained in the effluent gas, and readily detected by 
the analytical instrumentation. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<INF>6</INF>) has 
been used successfully (References 1 and 2) for this purpose.
    9.3 Calculations
    9.3.1 Recovery. Calculate the percent recovery of the spiked 
analytes using equations 1 and 2.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.033

S<INF>m</INF> = Mean concentration of the analyte spiked effluent 
samples (observed).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.034

C<INF>e</INF> = Expected concentration of the spiked samples 
(theoretical).
D<INF>f</INF> = dilution Factor (Total flow/Spike flow). total flow = 
spike flow plus effluent flow.
C<INF>s</INF> = cylinder concentration of spike gas.
S<INF>u</INF> = native concentration of analytes in unspiked samples.

The spike dilution factor may be confirmed by measuring the total flow 
and the spike flow directly. Alternately, the spike dilution can be 
verified by comparing the concentration of the tracer compound in the 
spiked samples (diluted) to the tracer concentration in the direct 
(undiluted) measurement of the spike gas.
If SF<INF>6</INF> is the tracer gas, then

[SF<INF>6</INF>]<INF>spike</INF> = the diluted SF<INF>6</INF> 
concentration measured in a spiked sample.
[SF<INF>6</INF>]<INF>direct</INF> = the SF<INF>6</INF> concentration 
measured directly.

    9.3.2 Bias. The bias may be determined by the difference between the 
observed spike value and the expected response (i.e., the equivalent 
concentration of the spiked material plus the analyte concentration 
adjusted for spike dilution). Bias is defined by section 6.3.1 of EPA 
Method 301 of this appendix (Reference 8) as,

Where:
B = Bias at spike level.
S<INF>m</INF> = Mean concentration of the analyte spiked samples.

[[Page 810]]

C<INF>e</INF> = Expected concentration of the analyte in spiked samples.

Acceptable recoveries for analyte spiking are <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 
percent. Application of correction factors to the data based upon bias 
and recovery calculations is subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Calibration transfer standards (CTS). The EPA Traceability 
Protocol gases or NIST traceable standards, with a minimum accuracy of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent shall be used. For other requirements of 
the CTS, see the FTIR Protocol section 4.5.
    10.2 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The S/N shall be less than the 
minimum acceptable measurement uncertainty in the analytical regions to 
be used for measuring HCl.
    10.3 Absorbance Pathlength. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing CTS spectra to reference spectra of the calibration gas(es).
    10.4 Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
CTS band(s) to verify instrumental resolution.
    10.5 Apodization Function. Choose the appropriate apodization 
function. Determine any appropriate mathematical transformations that 
are required to correct instrumental errors by measuring the CTS. Any 
mathematical transformations must be documented and reproducible. 
Reference 9 provides additional information about FTIR instrumentation.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    A full description of the analytical procedures is given in sections 
4.6-4.11, sections 5, 6, and 7, and the appendices of the FTIR Protocol. 
Additional description of quantitative spectral analysis is provided in 
References 10 and 11.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    Data analysis is performed using appropriate reference spectra whose 
concentrations can be verified using CTS spectra. Various analytical 
programs (References 10 and 11) are available to relate sample 
absorbance to a concentration standard. Calculated concentrations should 
be verified by analyzing spectral baselines after mathematically 
subtracting scaled reference spectra from the sample spectra. A full 
description of the data analysis and calculations may be found in the 
FTIR Protocol (sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices).
    12.1 Calculated concentrations in sample spectra are corrected for 
differences in absorption pathlength between the reference and sample 
spectra by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.037

Where:

C<INF>corr</INF> = The pathlength corrected concentration.
C<INF>calc</INF> = The initial calculated concentration (output of the 
multicomponent analysis program designed for the compound).
L<INF>r</INF> = The pathlength associated with the reference spectra.
L<INF>s</INF> = The pathlength associated with the sample spectra.
T<INF>s</INF> = The absolute temperature (K) of the sample gas.
T<INF>r</INF> = The absolute temperature (K) at which reference spectra 
were recorded.

    12.2 The temperature correction in equation 5 is a volumetric 
correction. It does not account for temperature dependence of 
rotational-vibrational relative line intensities. Whenever possible, the 
reference spectra used in the analysis should be collected at a 
temperature near the temperature of the FTIR cell used in the test to 
minimize the calculated error in the measurement (FTIR Protocol, 
appendix D). Additionally, the analytical region chosen for the analysis 
should be sufficiently broad to minimize errors caused by small 
differences in relative line intensities between reference spectra and 
the sample spectra.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    A description of the method performance may be found in the FTIR 
Protocol. This method is self validating provided the results meet the 
performance specification of the QA spike in sections 9.0 through 9.3 of 
this method.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    This is a gas phase measurement. Gas is extracted from the source, 
analyzed by the instrumentation, and discharged through the instrument 
vent.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    Gas standards of HCl are handled according to the instructions 
enclosed with the material safety data sheet.

Method 323--Measurement of Formaldehyde Emissions From Natural Gas-Fired 
        Stationary Sources--Acetyl Acetone Derivitization Method

    1.0 Introduction. This method describes the sampling and analysis 
procedures of the acetyl acetone colorimetric method for measuring 
formaldehyde emissions in the exhaust of natural gas-fired, stationary 
combustion sources. This method, which was prepared by the Gas Research 
Institute (GRI), is based on the Chilled Impinger Train Method for 
Methanol, Acetone, Acetaldehyde, Methyl Ethyl Ketone, and Formaldehyde 
(Technical Bulletin No. 684) developed and published by the National 
Council of the Paper Industry for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc. 
(NCASI). However, this method has been prepared specifically for 
formaldehyde and does not include specifications (e.g., equipment and 
supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) for methanol, 
acetone, acetaldehyde, and methyl ethyl ketone. To obtain reliable 
results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of 
at least Methods 1 and 2 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1; Method 3 of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A-2; and Method 4 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3.

                        1.1 Scope and Application

    1.1.1 Analytes. The only analyte measured by this method is 
formaldehyde (CAS Number 50-00-0).
    1.1.2 Applicability. This method is for analyzing formaldehyde 
emissions from uncontrolled and controlled natural gas-fired, stationary 
combustion sources.
    1.1.3 Data Quality Objectives. If you adhere to the quality control 
and quality assurance requirements of this method, then you and future 
users of your data will be able to assess the quality of the data you 
obtain and estimate the uncertainty in the measurements.
    2.0 Summary of Method. An emission sample from the combustion 
exhaust is drawn through a midget impinger train containing chilled 
reagent water to absorb formaldehyde. The formaldehyde concentration in 
the impinger is determined by reaction with acetyl acetone to form a 
colored derivative which is measured colorimetrically.

                             3.0 Definitions

    [Reserved]
    4.0 Interferences. The presence of acetaldehyde, amines, polymers of 
formaldehyde, periodate, and sulfites can cause interferences with the 
acetyl acetone procedure which is used to determine the formaldehyde 
concentration. However, based on experience gained from extensive 
testing of natural gas-fired combustion sources using FTIR to measure a 
variety of compounds, GRI expects only acetaldehyde to be potentially 
present when combusting natural gas. Acetaldehyde has been reported to 
be a significant interference only when present at concentrations above 
50 ppmv. However, GRI reports that the concentration of acetaldehyde 
from gas-fired sources is very low (typically below the FTIR detection 
limit of around 0.5 ppmv); therefore, the potential positive bias due to 
acetaldehyde interference is expected to be negligible.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Prior to applying the method in the field, a site-specific 
Health and Safety Plan should be prepared. General safety precautions 
include the use of steel-toed boots, safety glasses, hard hats, and work 
gloves. In certain cases, facility policy may require the use of fire-
resistant clothing while on-site. Since the method involves testing at 
high-temperature sampling locations, precautions must be taken to limit 
the potential for exposure to high-temperature gases and surfaces while 
inserting or removing the sample probe. In warm locations, precautions 
must also be taken to avoid dehydration.
    5.2 Potential chemical hazards associated with sampling include 
formaldehyde, nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), and carbon monoxide 
(CO). Formalin solution, used for field spiking, is an aqueous solution 
containing formaldehyde and methanol. Formaldehyde is a skin, eye, and 
respiratory irritant and a carcinogen, and should be handled 
accordingly. Eye and skin contact and inhalation of formaldehyde vapors 
should be avoided. Natural gas-fired combustion sources can potentially 
emit CO at toxic concentrations. Care should be taken to minimize 
exposure to the sample gas while inserting or removing the sample probe. 
If the work area is enclosed, personal CO monitors should be used to 
insure that the concentration of CO in the work area is maintained at 
safe levels.
    5.3 Potential chemical hazards associated with the analytical 
procedures include acetyl acetone and glacial acetic acid. Acetyl 
acetone is an irritant to the skin and respiratory system, as well as 
being moderately toxic. Glacial acetic acid is highly corrosive and is 
an irritant to the skin, eyes, and respiratory system. Eye and skin 
contact and inhalation of vapors should be avoided. Acetyl acetone and 
glacial acetic acid have flash points of 41 [deg]C (105.8 [deg]F) and 43 
[deg]C (109.4 [deg]F), respectively. Exposure to heat or flame should be 
avoided.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    6.1 Sampling Probe. Quartz glass probe with stainless steel sheath 
or stainless steel probe.

condensed formaldehyde and the rinsate combined with the impinger 
contents prior to sample analysis.
    6.3 Midget Impingers. Three midget impingers are required for sample 
collection. The first impinger serves as a moisture knockout, the second 
impinger contains 20 mL of reagent water, and the third impinger 
contains silica gel to remove residual moisture from the sample prior to 
the dry gas meter.
    6.4 Vacuum Pump. Vacuum pump capable of delivering a controlled 
extraction flow rate between 0.2 and 0.4 L/min.
    6.5 Flow Measurement Device. A rotameter or other flow measurement 
device is required to indicate consistent sample flow.
    6.6 Dry Gas Meter. A dry gas meter is used to measure the total 
sample volume collected. The dry gas meter must be sufficiently accurate 
to measure the sample volume to within 2 percent, calibrated at the 
selected flow rate and conditions actually encountered during sampling, 
and equipped with a temperature sensor (dial thermometer, or equivalent) 
capable of measuring temperature accurately to within 3 [deg]C (5.4 
[deg]F).
    6.7 Spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer is required for 
formaldehyde analysis, and must be capable of measuring absorbance at 
412 nm.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

                          7.1 Sampling Reagents

    7.1.1 Reagent water. Deionized, distilled, organic-free water. This 
water is used as the capture solution, for rinsing the sample probe, 
sample line, and impingers at the completion of the sampling run, in 
reagent dilutions, and in blanks.
    7.1.2 Ice. Ice is necessary to pack around the impingers during 
sampling in order to keep the impingers cold. Ice is also needed for 
sample transport and storage.

                              7.2 Analysis

    7.2.1 Acetyl acetone Reagent. Prepare the acetyl acetone reagent by 
dissolving 15.4 g of ammonium acetate in 50 mL of reagent water in a 
100-mL volumetric flask. To this solution, add 0.20 mL of acetyl acetone 
and 0.30 mL of glacial acetic acid. Mix the solution thoroughly, then 
dilute to 100 mL with reagent water. The solution can be stored in a 
brown glass bottle in the refrigerator, and is stable for at least two 
weeks.
    7.2.2 Formaldehyde. Reagent grade.
    7.2.3 Ammonium Acetate
    7.2.4 Glacial Acetic Acid

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

                              8.1 Pre-test

    8.1.1 Collect information about the site characteristics such as 
exhaust pipe diameter, gas flow rates, port location, access to ports, 
and safety requirements during a pre-test site survey. You should then 
decide the sample collection period per run and the target sample flow 
rate based on your best estimate of the formaldehyde concentration 
likely to be present. You want to assure that sufficient formaldehyde is 
captured in the impinger solution so that it can be measured precisely 
by the spectrophotometer. You may use Equation 323-1 to design your test 
program. As a guideline for optimum performance, if you can, design your 
test so that the liquid concentration (C<INF>l</INF>) is approximately 
10 times the assumed spectrophotometer detection limit of 0.2 [micro]g/
mL. However, since actual detection limits are instrument specific, we 
also suggest that you confirm that the laboratory equipment can meet or 
exceed this detection limit.
    8.1.2 Prepare and then weigh the midget impingers prior to 
configuring the sampling train. The first impinger is initially dry. The 
second impinger contains 20 mL of reagent water, and the third impinger 
contains silica gel that is added before weighing the impinger. Each 
prepared impinger is weighed and the pre-sampling weight is recorded to 
the nearest 0.5 gm.
    8.1.3 Assemble the sampling train (see Figure 1). Ice is packed 
around the impingers in order to keep them cold during sample 
collection. A small amount of water may be added to the ice to improve 
thermal transfer.
    8.1.4 Perform a sampling system leak check (from the probe tip to 
the pump outlet) as follows: Connect a rotameter to the outlet of the 
pump. Close off the inlet to the probe and observe the leak rate. The 
leak rate must be less than 2 percent of the planned sampling rate of 
0.2 or 0.4 L/min.
    8.1.5 Source gas temperature and static pressure should also be 
considered prior to field sampling to ensure adequate safety precautions 
during sampling.

                          8.2 Sample Collection

    8.2.1 Set the sample flow rate between 0.2-0.4 L/min, depending upon 
the anticipated concentration of formaldehyde in the engine exhaust. 
(You may have to refer to published data for anticipated concentration 
levels--see References 5 and 6.) If no information is available for the 
anticipated levels of formaldehyde, use the higher sampling rate of 0.4 
L/min.
    8.2.2 Record the sampling flow rate every 5 to 10 minutes during the 
sample collection period. NOTE: It is critical that you do not sample at 
a flow rate higher than 0.4 L/min.

[[Page 816]]

Sampling at higher flow rates may reduce formaldehyde collection 
efficiency resulting in measured formaldehyde concentrations that are 
less than the actual concentrations.
    8.2.3 Monitor the amount of ice surrounding the impingers and add 
ice as necessary to maintain the proper impinger temperature. Remove 
excess water as needed to maintain an adequate amount of ice.
    8.2.4 Record measured leak rate, beginning and ending times and dry 
gas meter readings for each sampling run, impinger weights before and 
after sampling, and sampling flow rates and dry gas meter exhaust 
temperature every 5 to 10 minutes during the run, in a signed and dated 
notebook.
    8.2.5 If possible, monitor and record the fuel flow rate to the 
engine and the exhaust oxygen concentration during the sampling period. 
This data can be used to estimate the engine exhaust flow rate based on 
the Method 19 approach. This approach, if accurate fuel flow rates can 
be determined, is preferred for reciprocating IC engine exhaust flow 
rate estimation due to the pulsating nature of the engine exhaust. The 
F-Factor procedures described in Method 19 may be used based on 
measurement of fuel flow rate and exhaust oxygen concentration. One 
example equation is Equation 323-2.
    8.3 Post-test. Perform a sampling system leak-check (from the probe 
tip to pump outlet). Connect a rotameter to the outlet of the pump. 
Close off the inlet to the probe and observe the leak rate. The leak 
rate must be less than 2 percent of the sampling rate. Weigh and record 
each impinger immediately after sampling to determine the moisture 
weight gain. The impinger weights are measured before transferring the 
impinger contents, and before rinsing the sample probe and sample line. 
The moisture content of the exhaust gas is determined by measuring the 
weight gain of the impinger solutions and volume of gas sampled as 
described in Method 4. Rinse the sample probe and sample line with 
reagent water. Transfer the impinger catch to an amber 40-mL VOA bottle 
with a Teflon-lined cap. If there is a small amount of liquid in the 
dropout impinger (< 10 mL), the impinger catches can be combined in one 
40 mL VOA bottle. If there is a larger amount of liquid in the dropout 
impinger, use a larger VOA bottle to combine the impinger catches. Rinse 
the impingers and combine the rinsings from the sample probe, sample 
line, and impingers with the impinger catch. In general, combined rinse 
volumes should not exceed 10 mL. However, in cases where a long, 
flexible extension line must be used to connect the sample probe to the 
sample box, sufficient water must be used to rinse the connecting line 
to insure that any sample that may have collected there is recovered. 
The volume of the rinses during sample recovery should not be excessive 
as this may result in your having to use a larger VOA bottle. This in 
turn would raise the detection limit of the method since after combining 
the rinses with the impinger catches in the VOA bottle, the bottle 
should be filled with reagent water to eliminate the headspace in the 
sample vial. Keep the sample bottles over ice until analyzed on-site or 
received at the laboratory. Samples should be analyzed as soon as 
possible to minimize possible sample degradation. Based on a limited 
number of previous analyses, samples held in refrigerated conditions 
showed some sample degradation over time.

                       8.4 Quality Control Samples

    8.4.1 Field Duplicates. During at least one run, a pair of samples 
should be collected concurrently and analyzed as separate samples. 
Results of the field duplicate samples should be identified and reported 
with the sample results. The percent difference in exhaust (stack) 
concentration indicated by field duplicates should be within 20 percent 
of their mean concentration. Data are to be flagged as suspect if the 
duplicates do not meet the acceptance criteria.
    8.4.2 Spiked Samples. An aliquot of one sample from each source 
sample set should be spiked at 2 to 3 times the formaldehyde level found 
in the unspiked sample. It is also recommended that a second aliquot of 
the same sample be spiked at around half the level of the first spike; 
however, the second spike is not mandatory. The results are acceptable 
if the measured spike recovery is 80 to 120 percent. Use Equation 323-4. 
Data are to be flagged as suspect if the spike recovery do not meet the 
acceptance criteria.
    8.4.3 Field Blank. A field blank consisting of reagent water placed 
in a clean impinger train, taken to the test site but not sampled, then 
recovered and analyzed in the same manner as the other samples, should 
be collected with each set of source samples. The field blank results 
should be less than 50 percent of the lowest calibration standard used 
in the sample analysis. If this criteria is not met, the data should be 
flagged as suspect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Spectrophotometer Calibration. Prepare a stock solution of 10 
[micro]g/mL formaldehyde. Prepare a series of calibration standards from 
the stock solution by adding 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.5 mL of stock 
solution (corresponding to 0, 1.0, 3.0, 7.0, 10.0, and 15.0 [micro]g 
formaldehyde, respectively) to screw-capped vials. Adjust each vial's 
volume to 2.0 mL with reagent water. At this point the concentration of 
formaldehyde in the standards is 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, and 7.5 
[micro]g/mL, respectively. Add 2.0 mL of acetyl acetone reagent, 
thoroughly mix the solution, and place the vials in a water bath (or 
heating block) at 60 [deg]C for 10 minutes. Remove the vials and allow 
to cool to room temperature. Transfer each solution to a cuvette and 
measure the absorbance at 412 nm using the spectrophotometer. Develop a 
calibration curve from the analytical results of these standards. The 
acceptance criteria for the spectrophotometer calibration is a 
correlation coefficient of 0.99 or higher. If this criteria is not met, 
the calibration procedures should be repeated.
    10.2 Spectrophotometer Zero. The spectrophotometer should be zeroed 
with reagent water when analyzing each set of samples.
    10.3 Calibration Checks. Calibration checks consisting of analyzing 
a standard separate from the calibration standards must be performed 
with each set of samples. The calibration check standard should not be 
prepared from the calibration stock solution. The result of the check 
standard must be within 10 percent of the theoretical value to be 
acceptable. If the acceptance criteria are not met, the standard must be 
reanalyzed. If still unacceptable, a new calibration curve must be 
prepared using freshly prepared standards.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Sample Analysis. A 2.0-mL aliquot of the impinger catch/rinsate 
is transferred to a screw-capped vial. Two mL of the acetyl acetone 
reagent are added and the solution is thoroughly mixed. Once mixed, the 
vial is placed in a water bath (or heating block) at 60 [deg]C for 10 
minutes. Remove the vial and allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer 
the solution to a cuvette and measure the absorbance using the 
spectrophotometer at 412 nm. The quantity of formaldehyde present is 
determined by comparing the sample response to the calibration curve. 
Use Equation 323-5. If the sample response is out of the calibration 
range, the sample must be diluted and reanalyzed. Such dilutions must be 
performed on another aliquot of the original sample before the addition 
of the acetyl acetone reagent. The full procedure is repeated with the 
diluted sample.
    11.2 Analytical Quality Control
    11.2.1 Laboratory Duplicates. Two aliquots of one sample from each 
source sample set should be prepared and analyzed (with a minimum of one 
pair of aliquots for every 10 samples). The percent difference between 
aliquot analysis should be within 10 percent of their mean. Use Equation 
323-3. Data are flagged if the laboratory duplicates do not meet this 
criteria.
    11.2.2 Analytical blanks. Blank samples (reagent water) should be 
incorporated into each sample set to evaluate the possible presence of 
any cross-contamination. The acceptance criteria for the analytical 
blank is less than 50 percent of the lowest calibration standard. If the 
analytical blank does not meet this criteria, the glassware/analytical 
equipment should be cleaned and the analytical blank repeated.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Precision. Based on a Method 301 validation using quad train 
arrangement with post sampling spiking study of the method at a natural 
gas-fired IC engine, the relative standard deviation of six pairs of 
unspiked samples was 11.2 percent at a mean stack gas concentration of 
16.7 ppmvd.
    13.2 Bias. No bias correction is allowed. The single Method 301 
validation study of the method at a natural gas-fired IC engine, 
indicated a bias correction factor of 0.91 for that set of data. An 
earlier spiking study got similar average percent spike recovery when 
spiking into a blank sample. This data set is too limited to justify 
using a bias correction factor for future tests at other sources.
    13.3 Range. The range of this method for formaldehyde is 0.2 to 7.5 
[micro]g/mL in the liquid phase. (This corresponds to a range of 0.27 to 
10 ppmv in the engine exhaust if sampling at a rate of 0.4 Lpm for 60 
minutes and using a 40-mL VOA bottle.) If the liquid sample 
concentration is above this range, perform the appropriate dilution for 
accurate measurement. Any dilutions must be taken from new aliquots of 
the original sample before reanalysis.
    13.4 Sample Stability. Based on a sample stability study conducted 
in conjunction with the method validation, sample degradation for 7- and 
14-day hold times does not exceed 2.3 and 4.6 percent, respectively, 
based on a 95 percent level of confidence. Therefore, the recommended 
maximum sample holding time for the underivatized impinger catch/
rinsings is 14 days, where projected sample degradation is below 5 
percent.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    Sample gas from the combustion source exhaust is vented to the 
atmosphere after passing through the chilled impinger sampling train. 
Reagent solutions and samples should be collected for disposal as 
aqueous waste.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    Standards of formaldehyde and the analytical reagents should be 
handled according to the Material Safety Data Sheets.

 Sec. Appendix C to Part 63--Determination of the Fraction Biodegraded 

            (F<INF>bio</INF>) in a Biological Treatment Unit

                               I. Purpose

    The purpose of this appendix is to define the procedures for an 
owner or operator to use to calculate the site specific fraction of 
organic compounds biodegraded (F<INF>bio</INF>) in a biological 
treatment unit. If an acceptable level of organic compounds is destroyed 
rather than emitted to the air or remaining in the effluent, the 
biological treatment unit may be used to comply with the applicable 
treatment requirements without the unit being covered and vented through 
a closed vent system to an air pollution control device.
    The determination of F<INF>bio</INF> shall be made on a system as it 
would exist under the rule. The owner or operator should anticipate 
changes that would occur to the wastewater flow and concentration of 
organics, to be treated by the biological treatment unit, as a result of 
enclosing the collection and treatment system as required by the rule.
    Unless otherwise specified, the procedures presented in this 
appendix are designed to be applied to thoroughly mixed treatment units. 
A thoroughly mixed treatment unit is a unit that is designed and 
operated to approach or achieve uniform biomass distribution and organic 
compound concentration throughout the aeration unit by quickly 
dispersing the recycled biomass and the wastewater entering the unit. 
Detailed discussion on how to determine if a biological treatment unit 
is thoroughly mixed can be found in reference 7. Systems that are not 
thoroughly mixed treatment units should be subdivided into a series of 
zones that have uniform characteristics within each zone. The number of 
zones required to characterize a biological treatment system will depend 
on the design and operation of the treatment system. Detailed discussion 
on how to determine the number of zones in a biological treatment unit 
and examples of determination of f <INF>bio</INF> can be found in 
reference 8. Each zone should then be modeled as a separate unit. The 
amount of air emissions and biodegradation from the modeling of these 
separate zones can then be added to reflect the entire system.

                             II. Definitions

    Biological treatment unit = wastewater treatment unit designed and 
operated to promote the growth of bacteria to destroy organic materials 
in wastewater.

f<INF>bio</INF> = The fraction of individual applicable organic 
compounds in the wastewater biodegraded in a biological treatment unit.
F<INF>bio</INF> = The fraction of total applicable organic compounds in 
the wastewater biodegraded in a biological treatment unit.
Fe = The fraction of applicable organic compounds emitted from the 
wastewater to the atmosphere.
K1 = First order biodegradation rate constant, L/g MLVSS-hr
KL = liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient, m/s
M = compound specific mass flow weighted average of organic compounds in 
the wastewater, Mg/Yr

          III. Procedures for Determination of f<INF>bio</INF>

    The first step in the analysis to determine if a biological 
treatment unit may be used without being covered and vented through a 
closed-vent system to an air pollution control device is to determine 
the compound-specific f<INF>bio</INF>. The following procedures may be 
used to determine f<INF>bio</INF>:

[[Page 822]]

    (1) The EPA Test Method 304A or 304B (appendix A, part 63)--Method 
for the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds,
    (2) Performance data with and without biodegradation,
    (3) Inlet and outlet concentration measurements,
    (4) Batch tests,
    (5) Multiple zone concentration measurements.
    All procedures must be executed so that the resulting 
f<INF>bio</INF> is based on the collection system and waste management 
units being in compliance with the rule. If the collection system and 
waste management units meet the suppression requirements at the time of 
the test, any of the procedures may be chosen. If the collection system 
and waste management units are not in compliance at the time of the 
performance test, then only Method 304A, B, or the batch test shall be 
chosen. If Method 304A, B, or the batch test is used, any anticipated 
changes to the influent of the full-scale biological treatment unit that 
will occur after the facility has enclosed the collection system must be 
represented in the influent feed to the benchtop bioreactor unit, or 
test unit.
    Select one or more appropriate procedures from the five listed above 
based on the availability of site specific data and the type of mixing 
that occurs in the unit (thoroughly mixed or multiple mixing zone). If 
the facility does not have site-specific data on the removal efficiency 
of its biological treatment unit, then Procedure 1 or Procedure 4 may be 
used. Procedure 1 allows the use of a benchtop bioreactor to determine 
the first-order biodegradation rate constant. An owner or operator may 
elect to assume the first order biodegradation rate constant is zero for 
any regulated compound(s) present in the wastewater. Procedure 4 
explains two types of batch tests which may be used to estimate the 
first order biodegradation rate constant. An owner or operator may elect 
to assume the first order biodegradation rate constant is zero for any 
regulated compound(s) present in the wastewater. Procedure 3 would be 
used if the facility has, or measures to determine, data on the inlet 
and outlet individual organic compound concentration for the biological 
treatment unit. Procedure 3 may only be used on a thoroughly mixed 
treatment unit. Procedure 5 is the concentration measurement test that 
can be used for units with multiple mixing zones. Procedure 2 is used if 
a facility has or obtains performance data on a biotreatment unit prior 
to and after addition of the microbial mass. An example where Procedure 
2 could be used is an activated sludge unit where measurements have been 
taken on inlet and exit concentration of organic compounds in the 
wastewater prior to seeding with the microbial mass and startup of the 
unit. The flow chart in figure 1 outlines the steps to use for each of 
the procedures.

                  A. Method 304A or 304B (Procedure 1)

    If the first procedure is selected, follow the instructions in 
appendix A of part 63 Method 304A ``Method for the Determination of 
Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds (Vented Option)'' or Method 
304B ``Method for the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic 
Compounds (Scrubber Option).'' Method 304A or 304B provides instruction 
on setting up and operating a self-contained benchtop bioreactor system 
which is operated under conditions representative of the target full-
scale system. Method 304A uses a benchtop bioreactor system with a vent, 
and uses modeling to estimate any air emissions. Method 304B uses a 
benchtop bioreactor system which is equipped with a scrubber and is not 
vented.
    There are some restrictions on which method a source may use. If the 
facility is measuring the rate of biodegradation of compounds that may 
tend to react or hydrolyze in the scrubber of Method 304B, this method 
shall not be used and Method 304A is the required method. If a Henry's 
law value is not available to use with Form V, then Method 304A shall 
not be used and Method 304B is the required method. When using either 
method, the feed flow to the benchtop bioreactor shall be representative 
of the flow and concentration of the wastewater that will be treated by 
the full-scale biological treatment unit after the collection and 
treatment system has been enclosed as required under the applicable 
subpart.
    The conditions under which the full-scale biological treatment unit 
is run establish the operating parameters of Method 304A or 304B. If the 
biological treatment unit is operated under abnormal operating 
conditions (conditions outside the range of critical parameters examined 
and confirmed in the laboratory), the EPA believes this will adversely 
affect the biodegradation rate and is an unacceptable treatment option. 
The facility would be making multiple runs of the test method to 
simulate the operating range for its biological treatment unit. For wide 
ranges of variation in operating parameters, the facility shall 
demonstrate the biological treatment unit is achieving an acceptable 
level of control, as required by the regulation, across the ranges and 
not only at the endpoints.
    If Method 304A is used, complete Form V initially. Form V is used to 
calculate K1 from the Method 304A results. Form V uses the Henry's law 
constant to estimate the fraction lost from the benchtop reactor vent. 
The owner or operator shall use the Henry's law values in Table I. Form 
V also gives direction for calculating an equivalent KL. Note on Form V 
if the calculated number for line 11 is greater than the calculated 
value

[[Page 823]]

for line 13, this procedure shall not be used to demonstrate the 
compound is biodegradable. If line 11 is greater than line 13, this is 
an indication the fraction emitted from the vent is greater than the 
fraction biodegraded. The equivalent KL determined on Form V is used in 
Form II (line 6). Estimation of the Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> must be done 
following the steps in Form III. Form III uses the previously calculated 
values of K1 and KL (equivalent KL), and site-specific parameters of the 
full-scale bioreactor as input to the calculations. Forms II, III, and V 
must be completed for each organic compound in the wastewater to 
determine Fe and f<INF>bio</INF>.
    If Method 304B is used, perform the method and use the measurements 
to determine K1, which is the first-order biodegradation rate constant. 
Form I lists the sequence of steps in the procedure for calculating K1 
from the Method 304B results. Once K1 is determined, KL must be 
calculated by use of mass transfer equations. Form II outlines the 
procedure to follow for use of mass transfer equations to determine KL. 
A computer program which incorporates these mass transfer equations may 
be used. Water7 is a program that incorporates these mass transfer 
equations and may be used to determine KL. Refer to Form II-A to 
determine KL, if Water7 or the most recent update to this model is used. 
In addition, the Bay Area Sewage Toxics Emission (BASTE) model version 
3.0 or equivalent upgrade and the TOXCHEM (Environment Canada's 
Wastewater Technology Centre and Environmega, Ltd.) model version 1.10 
or equivalent upgrade may also be used to determine KL for the 
biological treatment unit with several stipulations. The programs must 
be altered to output a KL value which is based on the site-specific 
parameters of the unit modeled, and the Henry's law values listed in 
Table I must be substituted for the existing Henry's law values in the 
programs. Input values used in the model and corresponding output values 
shall become documentation of the f<INF>bio</INF> determination. The 
owner or operator should be aware these programs do not allow modeling 
of certain units. To model these units, the owner or operator shall use 
one of the other appropriate procedures as outlined in this appendix. 
The owner or operator shall not use a default value for KL. The KL value 
determined by use of these models shall be based on the site-specific 
parameters of the specific unit. This KL value shall be inserted in Form 
II (line 6). Estimation of the Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> must be done 
following the steps in Form III. Form III uses the previously calculated 
values of K1 and KL, and site-specific parameters of the full-scale 
bioreactor as input to the calculations. Forms I, II, and III must be 
completed for each organic compound in the wastewater to determine Fe 
and f<INF>bio</INF>.

    B. Performance Data With and Without Biodegradation (Procedure 2)

    Procedure 2 uses site-specific performance data that represents or 
characterizes operation of the unit both with and without 
biodegradation. As previously mentioned, proper determination of 
f<INF>bio</INF> must be made on a system as it would exist under the 
rule. Using Form IV, calculate KL and K1. After KL and K1 are 
determined, Form III is used to calculate Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> for 
each organic compound present in the wastewater.

      C. Inlet and Outlet Concentration Measurements (Procedure 3)

    Procedure 3 uses measured inlet and outlet organic compound 
concentrations for the unit. This procedure may only be used on a 
thoroughly mixed treatment unit. Again, proper determination of 
f<INF>bio</INF> must be made on a system as it would exist under the 
rule. The first step in using this procedure is to calculate KL using 
Form II. A computer model may be used. If the Water7 model or the most 
recent update to this model is used, then use Form II-A to calculate KL. 
After KL is determined using field data, complete Form VI to calculate 
K1. The TOXCHEM or BASTE model may also be used to calculate KL for the 
biological treatment unit, with the stipulations listed in procedure 
304B. After KL and K1 are determined, Form III is used to calculate Fe 
and f<INF>bio</INF> for each organic compound.

                      D. Batch Tests (Procedure 4)

    Two types of batch tests which may be used to determine kinetic 
parameters are: (1) The aerated reactor test and (2) the sealed reactor 
test. The aerated reactor test is also known as the BOX test (batch test 
with oxygen addition). The sealed reactor test is also known as the 
serum bottle test. These batch tests should be conducted only by persons 
familiar with procedures for determining biodegradation kinetics. 
Detailed discussions of batch procedures for determining biodegradation 
kinetic parameters can be found in references 1-4.
    For both batch test approaches, a biomass sample from the activated 
sludge unit of interest is collected, aerated, and stored for no more 
than 4 hours prior to testing. To collect sufficient data when 
biodegradation is rapid, it may be necessary to dilute the biomass 
sample. If the sample is to be diluted, the biomass sample shall be 
diluted using treated effluent from the activated sludge unit of 
interest to a concentration such that the biodegradation test will last 
long enough to make at least six concentration measurements. It is 
recommended that the tests not be terminated until the compound 
concentration falls below the limit of quantitation (LOQ). Measurements 
that are below the LOQ should not be used in the data analysis.

[[Page 824]]

Biomass concentrations shall be determined using standard methods for 
measurement of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) (reference 
5).
    The change in concentration of a test compound may be monitored by 
either measuring the concentration in the liquid or in the reactor 
headspace. The analytical technique chosen for the test should be as 
sensitive as possible. For the batch test procedures described in this 
section, equilibrium conditions must exist between the liquid and gas 
phases of the experiments because the data analysis procedures are based 
on this premise. To use the headspace sampling approach, the reactor 
headspace must be in equilibrium with the liquid so that the headspace 
concentrations can be correlated with the liquid concentrations. Before 
the biodegradation testing is conducted, the equilibrium assumption must 
be verified. A discussion of the equilibrium assumption verification is 
given below in sections D.1 and D.2 since different approaches are 
required for the two types of batch tests.
    To determine biodegradation kinetic parameters in a batch test, it 
is important to choose an appropriate initial substrate (compound(s) of 
interest) concentration for the test. The outcome of the batch 
experiment may be influenced by the initial substrate (S<INF>O</INF>) to 
biomass (X<INF>O</INF>) ratio (see references 3, 4, and 6). This ratio 
is typically measured in chemical oxygen demand (COD) units. When the 
S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF> ratio is low, cell multiplication and growth 
in the batch test is negligible and the kinetics measured by the test 
are representative of the kinetics in the activated sludge unit of 
interest. The S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF> ratio for a batch test is 
determined with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.034

Where:

S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF>=initial substrate to biomass ratio on a COD 
basis
S<INF>i</INF>=initial substrate concentration in COD units (g COD/L)
X=biomass concentration in the batch test (g MLVSS/L)
1.42 = Conversion factor to convert to COD units

    For the batch tests described in this section, the S<INF>O</INF>/
X<INF>O</INF> ratio (on a COD basis) must be initially less than 0.5.
    1. Aerated Reactor Test. An aerated draft tube reactor may be used 
for the biokinetics testing (as an example see Figure 2 of appendix C). 
Other aerated reactor configurations may also be used. Air is bubbled 
through a porous frit at a rate sufficient to aerate and keep the 
reactor uniformly mixed. Aeration rates typically vary from 50 to 200 
ml/min for a 1 liter system. A mass flow rate controller is used to 
carefully control the air flow rate because it is important to have an 
accurate measure of this rate. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration 
in the system must not fall below 2 mg/liter so that the biodegradation 
observed will not be DO-limited. Once the air flow rate is established, 
the test mixture (or compound) of interest is then injected into the 
reactor and the concentration of the compound(s) is monitored over time. 
Concentrations may be monitored in the liquid or in the headspace. A 
minimum of six samples shall be taken over the period of the test. 
However, it is necessary to collect samples until the compound 
concentration falls below the LOQ. If liquid samples are collected, they 
must be small enough such that the liquid volume in the batch reactor 
does not change by more than 10%.
    Before conducting experiments with biomass, it is necessary to 
verify the equilibrium assumption. The equilibrium assumption can be 
verified by conducting a stripping experiment using the effluent (no 
biomass) from the activated sludge unit of interest. Effluent is 
filtered with a 0.45 um or smaller filter and placed in the draft tube 
reactor. Air is sparged into the system and the compound concentration 
in the liquid or headspace is monitored over time. This test with no 
biomass may provide an estimate of the Henry's law constant. If the 
system is at equilibrium, the Henry's law constant may be estimated with 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.035

Where:

C=cencentration at time, t (min)
C<INF>O</INF>=concentration at t=0
G=volumetric gas flow rate (ml/min)
V=liquid volume in the batch reactor (ml)
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's law constant (mg/L-gas)/(mg/L-liquid)
t=time (min)

    A plot of--ln(C/C<INF>o</INF>) as a function of t will have a slope 
equal to GK<INF>eq</INF>/V. The equilibrium assumption can be verified 
by comparing the experimentally determined K<INF>eq</INF> for the system 
to literature values of the Henry's Law constant (including those listed 
in this appendix). If K<INF>eq</INF> does not match the

[[Page 825]]

Henry's law constant, K<INF>eq</INF> shall be determined from analysis 
of the headspace and liquid concentration in a batch system.
    The concentration of a compound decreases in the bioreactor due to 
both biodegradation and stripping. Biodegradation processes are 
typically described with a Monod model. This model and a stripping 
expression are combined to give a mass balance for the aerated draft 
tube reactor):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.036

Where:

s=test compound concentration, mg/liter
G=volumetric gas flow rate, liters/hr
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's Law constant measured in the system, (mg/liter 
gas)/(mg/liter liquid)
V=volume of liquid in the reactor, liters
X=biomass concentration (g MLVSS/liter)
Q<INF>m</INF>=maximum rate of substrate removal, mg/g MLVSS/hr
K<INF>S</INF>=Monod biorate constant at half the maximum rate, mg/liter

    Equation App. C-3 can be integrated to obtain the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JA01.162

Where:

A=GK<INF>eq</INF>K<INF>s</INF> + Q<INF>m</INF>VX
B=GK<INF>eq</INF>
S<INF>o</INF>=test compound concentration at t=0
    This equation is used along with the substrate concentration versus 
time data to determine the best fit parameters (Q<INF>m</INF> and 
K<INF>S</INF>) to describe the biodegradation process in the aerated 
reactor. If the aerated reactor test is used, the following procedure is 
used to analyze the data. Evaluate K<INF>eq</INF> for the compound of 
interest with Form XI. The concentration in the vented headspace or 
liquid is measured as a function of time and the data is entered on Form 
XI. A plot is made from the data and attached to the Form XI. 
K<INF>eq</INF> is calculated on Form XI and the results are contrasted 
with the expected value of Henry's law obtained from Form IX. If the 
comparison is satisfactory, the stripping constant is calculated from 
K<INF>eq</INF>, completing Form XI. The values of K<INF>eq</INF> may 
differ because the theoretical value of K<INF>eq</INF> may not be 
applicable to the system of interest. If the comparison of the 
calculated K<INF>eq</INF> from the form and the expected value of 
Henry's law is unsatisfactory, Form X can alternatively be used to 
validate K<INF>eq</INF>. If the aerated reactor is demonstrated to not 
be at equilibrium, either modify the reactor design and/or operation, or 
use another type of batch test.
    The compound-specific biorate constants are then measured using Form 
XII. The stripping constant that was determined from Form XI and a 
headspace correction factor of 1 are entered on Form XII. The aerated 
reactor biotest may then be run, measuring concentrations of each 
compound of interest as a function of time. If headspace concentrations 
are measured instead of liquid concentrations, then the corresponding 
liquid concentrations are calculated from the headspace measurements 
using the K<INF>eq</INF> determined on Form XI and entered on Form XII.
    The concentration data on Form XII may contain scatter that can 
adversely influence the data interpretation. It is possible to curve fit 
the concentration data and enter the concentrations on the fitted curve 
instead of the actual data. If curve fitting is used, the curve-fitting 
procedure must be based upon the Equation App. C-4. When curve fitting 
is used, it is necessary to attach a plot of the actual data and the 
fitted curve to Form XII.
    If the stripping rate constant is relatively large when compared to 
the biorate at low concentrations, it may be difficult to obtain 
accurate evaluations of the first-order biorate constant. In these 
cases, either reducing the stripping rate constant by lowering the 
aeration rate, or increasing the biomass concentrations should be 
considered.
    The final result of the batch testing is the measurement of a 
biorate that can be used to estimate the fraction biodegraded, 
f<INF>bio</INF>. The number transferred to Form III is obtained from 
Form XII, line 9.
    2. Sealed Reactor Test. This test uses a closed system to prevent 
losses of the test compound by volatilization. This test may

[[Page 826]]

be conducted using a serum bottle or a sealed draft tube reactor (for an 
example see Figure 3 of appendix C). Since no air is supplied, it is 
necessary to ensure that sufficient oxygen is present in the system. The 
DO concentration in the system must not fall below 2 mg/liter so that 
the biodegradation observed will not be DO-limited. As an alternative, 
oxygen may be supplied by electrolysis as needed to maintain the DO 
concentration above 2 mg/liter. The reactor contents must be uniformly 
mixed, by stirring or agitation using a shaker or similar apparatus. The 
test mixture (or compound) of interest is injected into the reactor and 
the concentration is monitored over time. A minimum of six samples shall 
be taken over the period of the test. However, it is necessary to 
monitor the concentration until it falls below the LOQ.
    The equilibrium assumption must be verified for the batch reactor 
system. In this case, K<INF>eq</INF> may be determined by simultaneously 
measuring gas and liquid phase concentrations at different times within 
a given experiment. A constant ratio of gas/liquid concentrations 
indicates that equilibrium conditions are present and K<INF>eq</INF> is 
not a function of concentration. This ratio is then taken as the 
K<INF>eq</INF> for the specific compound in the test. It is not 
necessary to measure K<INF>eq</INF> for each experiment. If the ratio is 
not constant, the equilibrium assumption is not valid and it is 
necessary to (1) increase mixing energy for the system and retest for 
the equilibrium assumption, or (2) use a different type of test (for 
example, a collapsible volume reactor).
    The concentration of a compound decreases in the bioreactor due to 
biodegradation according to Equation App. C-5:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.038

Where:

s=test compound concentration (mg/liters)
V<INF>l</INF>=the average liquid volume in the reactor (liters)
V<INF>g</INF>=the average gas volume in the reactor (liters)
Q<INF>m</INF>=maximum rate of substrate removal (mg/g ML VSS/hr)
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's Law constant determined for the test, (mg/liter 
gas)/(mg/liter liquid)
K<INF>s</INF>=Monod biorate constant at one-half the maximum rate (mg/
liter)
t=time (hours)
X=biomass concentration (g ML VSS/liter)
s<INF>o</INF>=test compound concentration at time t=0

    Equation App. C-5 can be solved analytically to give:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JA01.163
    
    This equation is used along with the substrate concentration versus 
time data to determine the best fit parameters (Q<INF>m</INF> and 
K<INF>s</INF>) to describe the biodegradation process in the sealed 
reactor.
    If the sealed reactor test is used, Form X is used to determine the 
headspace correction factor. The disappearance of a compound in the 
sealed reactor test is slowed because a fraction of the compound is not 
available for biodegradation because it is present in the headspace. If 
the compound is almost entirely in the liquid phase, the headspace 
correction factor is approximately one. If the headspace correction 
factor is substantially less than one, improved mass transfer or reduced 
headspace may improve the accuracy of the sealed reactor test. A 
preliminary sealed reactor test must be conducted to test the 
equilibrium assumption. As the compound of interest is degraded, 
simultaneous headspace and liquid samples should be collected and Form X 
should be used to evaluate K<INF>eq</INF>. The ratio of headspace to 
liquid concentrations must be constant in order to confirm that 
equilibrium conditions exist. If equilibrium conditions are not present, 
additional mixing or an alternate reactor configuration may be required.
    The compound-specific biorate constants are then calculated using 
Form XII. For the sealed reactor test, a stripping rate constant of zero 
and the headspace correction factor

[[Page 827]]

that was determined from Form X are entered on Form XII. The sealed 
reactor test may then be run, measuring the concentrations of each 
compound of interest as a function of time. If headspace concentrations 
are measured instead of liquid concentrations, then the corresponding 
liquid concentrations are calculated from the headspace measurements 
using K<INF>eq</INF> from Form X and entered on Form XII.
    The concentration data on Form XII may contain scatter that can 
adversely influence the data interpretation. It is possible to curve fit 
the concentration data and enter the concentrations on the fitted curve 
instead of the actual data. If curve fitting is used, the curve-fitting 
procedure must be based upon Equation App. C-6. When curve fitting is 
used, it is necessary to attach a plot of the actual data and the fitted 
curve to Form XII.
    If a sealed collapsible reactor is used that has no headspace, the 
headspace correction factor will equal 1, but the stripping rate 
constant may not equal 0 due to diffusion losses through the reactor 
wall. The ratio of the rate of loss of compound to the concentration of 
the compound in the reactor (units of per hour) must be evaluated. This 
loss ratio has the same units as the stripping rate constant and may be 
entered as the stripping rate constant on line 1 of Form XII.
    If the loss due to diffusion through the walls of the collapsible 
reactor is relatively large when compared to the biorate at low 
concentrations, it may be difficult to obtain accurate evaluations of 
the first-order biorate constant. In these cases, either replacing the 
materials used to construct the reactor with materials of low 
permeability or increasing the biomass concentration should be 
considered.
    The final result of the batch testing is the measurement of a 
biorate that can be used to estimate the fraction biodegraded, 
f<INF>bio</INF>. The number transferred to Form III is obtained from 
Form XII, line 9.
    The number on Form XII line 9 will equal the Monod first-order 
biorate constant if the full-scale system is operated in the first-order 
range. If the full-scale system is operated at concentrations above that 
of the Monod first-order range, the value of the number on line 9 will 
be somewhat lower than the Monod first-order biorate constant. With 
supporting biorate data, the Monod model used in Form XII may be used to 
estimate the effective biorate constant K1 for use in Form III.
    If a reactor with headspace is used, analysis of the data using 
equation App. C-6 is valid only if V<INF>l</INF> and V<INF>g</INF> do 
not change more than 10% (i.e., they can be approximated as constant for 
the duration of the test). Since biodegradation is occurring only in the 
liquid, as the liquid concentration decreases it is necessary for mass 
to transfer from the gas to the liquid phase. This may require vigorous 
mixing and/or reducing the volume in the headspace of the reactor.
    If there is no headspace (e.g., a collapsible reactor), equation 
App. C-6 is independent of V<INF>1</INF> and there are no restrictions 
on the liquid volume. If a membrane or bag is used as the collapsible-
volume reactor, it may be important to monitor for diffusion losses in 
the system. To determine if there are losses, the bag should be used 
without biomass and spiked with the compound(s) of interest. The 
concentration of the compound(s) in the reactor should be monitored over 
time. The data are analyzed as described above for the sealed reactor 
test.
    3. Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC). A QA/QC plan outlining 
the procedures used to determine the biodegradation rate constants shall 
be prepared and a copy maintained at the source. The plan should 
include, but may not be limited to:
    1. A description of the apparatus used (e.g., size, volume, method 
of supplying air or oxygen, mixing, and sampling procedures) including a 
simplified schematic drawing.
    2. A description of how biomass was sampled from the activated 
sludge unit.
    3. A description of how biomass was held prior to testing (age, 
etc.).
    4. A description of what conditions (DO, gas-liquid equilibrium, 
temperature, etc.) are important, what the target values are, how the 
factors were controlled, and how well they were controlled.
    5. A description of how the experiment was conducted, including 
preparation of solutions, dilution procedures, sampling procedures, 
monitoring of conditions, etc.
    6. A description of the analytical instrumentation used, how the 
instruments were calibrated, and a summary of the precision for that 
equipment.
    7. A description of the analytical procedures used. If appropriate, 
reference to an ASTM, EPA or other procedure may be used. Otherwise, 
describe how the procedure is done, what is done to measure precision, 
accuracy, recovery, etc., as appropriate.
    8. A description of how data are captured, recorded, and stored.
    9. A description of the equations used and their solutions, 
including a reference to any software used for calculations and/or 
curve-fitting.

        E. Multiple Zone Concentration Measurements (Procedure 5)

    Procedure 5 is the concentration measurement method that can be used 
to determine the f<INF>bio</INF> for units that are not thoroughly mixed 
and thus have multiple zones of mixing. As with the other procedures, 
proper determination of f<INF>bio</INF> must be made on a system as it 
would exist under the rule. For purposes of this calculation, the 
biological unit must

[[Page 828]]

be divided \1\ into zones with uniform characteristics within each zone. 
The number of zones that is used depends on the complexity of the unit. 
Reference 8, ``Technical Support Document for the Evaluation of Aerobic 
Biological Treatment Units with Multiple Mixing Zones,'' is a source for 
further information concerning how to determine the number of zones that 
should be used for evaluating your unit. The following information on 
the biological unit must be available to use this procedure: basic unit 
variables such as inlet and recycle wastewater flow rates, type of 
agitation, and operating conditions; measured representative organic 
compound concentrations in each zone and the inlet and outlet; and 
estimated mass transfer coefficients for each zone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This is a mathematical division of the actual unit; not addition 
of physical barriers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Reference 8 ``Technical Support Document for the Evaluation of 
Aerobic Biological Treatment Units with Multiple Mixing Zones,'' is a 
source for further information concerning how to interpolate the 
biorates for multiple zones. In units with well-characterized 
concentration measurements obtained in an initial evaluation of the 
unit, it may be possible to demonstrate that there is a good correlation 
of the component concentrations with the locations in the multiple-zone 
unit. With this good correlation, it may be possible to accurately 
predict the concentrations in selected zones without actually testing 
each selected zone. This correlation method may be used for units that 
have many zones (greater than 5) or where one of the interior zones is 
not readily accessible for sampling. To use this correlation method of 
estimating zone concentrations, it is necessary to measure the 
concentrations in the inlet unit, the exit unit, and sufficient interior 
units to obtain a correlation of component concentrations with the 
locations. You cannot use this correlation method of estimating selected 
zone concentrations if monitoring of each zone is required, or if the 
accuracy and precision of the correlation is inferior to actual 
individual sampling error. The accuracy and precision of the correlation 
may be improved by increasing the number of locations tested. Because 
the correlation is based on many samples, it should provide an accurate 
representation of a stable operating system.
    The estimated mass transfer coefficient for each compound in each 
zone is obtained from Form II using the characteristics of each zone. A 
computer model may be used. If the Water7 model or the most recent 
update to this model is used, then use Form II-A to calculate KL. The 
TOXCHEM or BASTE model may also be used to calculate KL for the 
biological treatment unit, with the stipulations listed in Procedure 
304B. Compound concentration measurements for each zone are used in Form 
XIII to calculate the f<INF>bio</INF>. A copy of Form XIII is completed 
for each of the compounds of concern treated in the biological unit.

                         IV. Calculation of Fbio

    At this point, the individual f<INF>bios</INF> determined by the 
previously explained procedures must be summed to obtain the total 
F<INF>bio</INF>. To determine the F<INF>bio</INF> multiply each compound 
specific f<INF>bio</INF> by the compound-specific average mass flow rate 
of the organic compound in the wastewater stream (see regulation for 
instruction on calculation of average mass flow rate). Sum these 
products and divide by the total wastewater stream average mass flow 
rate of organic compounds.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.040

M=compound specific average mass flow rate of the organic compounds in 
the wastewater (Mg/Yr)
n=number of organic compounds in the wastewater

    The F<INF>bio</INF> is then used in the applicable compliance 
equations in the regulation to determine if biodegradation may be used 
to comply with the treatment standard without covering and venting to an 
air pollution control device.

  Sec. Appendix D to Part 63--Alternative Validation Procedure for EPA 

                      Waste and Wastewater Methods

                            1. Applicability

    This procedure is to be applied exclusively to Environmental 
Protection Agency methods developed by the Office of Water and the 
Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery. Alternative methods 
developed by any other group or agency shall be validated according to 
the procedures in Sections 5.1 and 5.3 of Test Method 301, 40 CFR part 
63, appendix A. For the purposes of this appendix, ``waste'' means waste 
and wastewater.

                              2. Procedure

    This procedure shall be applied once for each waste matrix. Waste 
matrix in the context of this procedure refers to the target compound 
mixture in the waste as well as the formulation of the medium in which 
the

[[Page 853]]

target compounds are suspended. The owner or operator shall prepare a 
sampling plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling 
procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample 
collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sample plan 
shall include procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the 
relevant compounds regulated in the applicable subpart. An example of an 
acceptable sampling plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling 
and sample handling requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A.
    2.1. Sampling and Analysis
    2.1.1. For each waste matrix, collect twice the number of samples 
required by the applicable regulation. Designate and label half the 
sample vials the ``spiked'' sample set, and the other half the 
``unspiked'' sample set. Immediately before or immediately after 
sampling (immediately after in the context of this procedure means after 
placing the sample into the sample vial, but before the sample is 
capped, cooled, and shipped to the laboratory for analysis), inject, 
either individually or as a solution, all the target compounds into each 
spiked sample.
    2.1.2. The mass of each spiked compound shall be 40 to 60 percent of 
the mass expected to be present in the waste matrix. If the 
concentration of the target compounds in the waste are not known, the 
mass of each spiked compound shall be 40 to 60 percent of the limit 
allowed in the applicable regulation. Analyze both sets of samples 
(spiked and unspiked) with the chosen method.

                             3. Calculations

    For each pair of spiked and unspiked samples, determine the fraction 
of spiked compound recovered (R) using the following equations.

where:

m<INF>r</INF> = mass spiked compound measured ([micro] g).
m<INF>s</INF> = total mass of compound measured in spiked sample 
([micro] g).
m<INF>u</INF> = total mass of compound measured in unspiked sample 
([micro] g).

where:

S = theoretical mass of compound spiked into spiked sample ([micro] g).
    3.1. Method Evaluation
    In order for the chosen method to be acceptable for a compound, 
0.70<=R<=1.30 (R in this case is an average value of all the spiked and 
unspiked sample set R values). If the average R value does not meet this 
criterion for a target compound, the chosen method is not acceptable for 
that compound, and therefore another method shall be evaluated for 
acceptance (by repeating the procedures outlined above with another 
method).
    3.2. Records and Reports
    Report the average R value in the test report and correct all 
reported measurements made with the method with the calculated R value 
for that compound by using the following equation:

    3.3. Optional Correction Step
    If the applicable regulation allows for correction of the mass of 
the compound in the waste by a published f<INF>m</INF> value, multiply 
the reported result calculated above with the appropriate f<INF>m</INF> 
value for that compound.

Sec. Appendix E to Part 63--Monitoring Procedure for Nonthoroughly Mixed 

   Open Biological Treatment Systems at Kraft Pulp Mills Under Unsafe 

                           Sampling Conditions

                               I. Purpose

    This procedure is required to be performed in subpart S of this 
part, entitled National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
from the Pulp and Paper Industry. Subpart S requires this procedure in 
Sec. 63.453(p)(3) to be followed during unsafe sampling conditions when 
it is not practicable to obtain representative samples of hazardous air 
pollutants (HAP) concentrations from an open biological treatment unit. 
It is assumed that inlet and outlet HAP concentrations from the open 
biological treatment unit may be obtained during the unsafe sampling 
conditions. The purpose of this procedure is to estimate the 
concentration of HAP within the open biological treatment unit based on 
information obtained at inlet and outlet sampling locations in units 
that are not thoroughly mixed and, therefore, have different 
concentrations of HAP at different locations within the unit.

 III. Test Procedure for Determination of fbio for Nonthoroughly Mixed 
    Open Biological Treatment Units Under Unsafe Sampling Conditions

    This test procedure is used under unsafe sampling conditions that do 
not permit practicable sampling of open biological treatment units 
within the unit itself, but rather relies on sampling at the inlet and 
outlet locations of the unit. This procedure may be used only under 
unsafe sampling conditions to estimate f<INF>bio</INF>. Once the unsafe 
conditions have passed, then the formal compliance demonstration 
procedures of f<INF>bio</INF> based upon measurements within the open 
biological treatment unit must be completed.

                   A. Overview of Estimation Procedure

    The steps in the estimation procedure include data collection, the 
estimation of concentrations within the unit, and the use of Form 1 to 
estimate f<INF>bio</INF>. The data collection procedure consists of two 
separate components. The first data collection component demonstrates 
that the open biological treatment unit can be represented by Monod 
kinetics and characterizes the effectiveness of the open biological 
treatment unit as part of the initial performance test, and the second 
data collection component is used when there are unsafe sampling 
conditions. These two data collection components are used together in a 
data calculation procedure based on a Monod kinetic model to estimate 
the concentrations in each zone of the open biological treatment unit. 
After the first two components of data collection are completed, the 
calculation procedures are used to back estimate the zone 
concentrations, starting with the last zone in the series and ending 
with the first zone.

                     B. Data Collection Requirements

    This method is based upon modeling the nonthoroughly mixed open 
biological treatment unit as a series of well-mixed zones with internal 
recycling between the units and assuming that two Monod biological 
kinetic parameters can be used to characterize the biological removal 
rates in each unit. The data collection procedure consists of two 
separate components. The first data collection component is part of the 
initial performance test, and the second data collection component is 
used during unsafe sampling conditions.

                       1. Initial Performance Test

    The objective of the first data collection component is to 
demonstrate that the open biological treatment unit can be represented 
by Monod kinetics and to characterize the performance of the open 
biological treatment unit. An appropriate value of the biorate constant, 
Ks, is determined using actual sampling data from the open biological 
treatment unit. This is done during the initial performance test when 
the open biological treatment unit is operating under normal conditions. 
This specific Ks value obtained during the initial performance test is 
used in the calculation procedure to characterize the open biological 
treatment unit during unsafe sampling conditions. The following open 
biological treatment unit characterization information is obtained from 
the first component of the data collection procedure:
    (1) The value of the biorate constant, Ks;
    (2) The number and characteristics of each zone in the open 
biological treatment unit (depth, area, characterization parameters for 
surface aeration, submerged aeration rates, biomass concentration, 
concentrations of organic compounds, dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved 
solids, temperature, and other relevant variables); and
    (3) The recycle ratio of internal recirculation between the zones. 
The number of zones and the above characterization of the zones are also 
used to determine the performance of the unit under the unsafe sampling 
conditions of concern.

           2. Data Collected Under Unsafe Sampling Conditions

    In the second data collection component obtained under unsafe 
sampling conditions, the measured inlet and outlet HAP concentrations 
and the biomass concentration are obtained for the open biological 
treatment unit. After the site specific data collection is completed on 
the day a parameter excursion occurs, the inlet and outlet 
concentrations are used with the prior open biological treatment unit 
characterization to estimate the concentrations of HAP in each zone. The 
following information on the open biological treatment unit must be 
available in the second data collection component:
    (1) Basic unit variables such as inlet and recycle wastewater flow 
rates, type of agitation, and operating conditions;

[[Page 855]]

    (2) The value of the inlet and outlet HAP concentrations; and
    (3) The biomass concentration in the open biological treatment unit.

 C. One Time Determination of a Single Value of Ks (Initial Performance 
                                  Test)

    A single value of Ks is calculated using Form 3 for each data set 
that is collected during the initial performance test. A single 
composite value of Ks, deemed to be representative of the biological 
unit, is subsequently selected so that the f<INF>bio</INF> values 
calculated by the procedures in this appendix (using this single value 
of Ks) for the data sets collected during the initial performance test 
are within 10 percent of the f<INF>bio</INF> value determined by using 
Form 1 with these same data sets. The value of Ks meeting these criteria 
is obtained by the following steps:
    (1) Determine the median of the Ks values calculated for each data 
set;
    (2) Estimate f<INF>bio</INF> for each data set using the selected Ks 
value (Form 1 and Form 2);
    (3) Calculate f<INF>bio</INF> for each data set using Form 1; and
    (4) Compare the f<INF>bio</INF> values obtained in steps (2) and 
(3); if the f<INF>bio</INF> value calculated using step (2) differs from 
that calculated using step (3) by more than 10 percent, adjust Ks 
(decrease Ks if the f<INF>bio</INF> value is lower than that calculated 
by Form 1 and vice versa) and repeat this procedure starting at step 
(2). If a negative value is obtained for the values of Ks, then this 
negative kinetic constant may not be used with the Monod model. If a 
negative value of Ks is obtained, this test procedure cannot be used for 
evaluating the performance of the open biological treatment unit.

      D. Confirmation of Monod Kinetics (Initial Performance Test)

    (1) Confirmation that the unit can be represented by Monod kinetics 
is made by identifying the following two items:
    (i) The zone methanol concentrations measured during the initial 
performance test; and
    (ii) The zone methanol concentrations estimated by the Multiple Zone 
Concentrations Calculations Procedure based on inlet and outlet 
concentrations (Column A of Form 2). For each zone, the concentration in 
item 1 is compared to the concentration in item 2.
    (2) For each zone, the estimated value of item 2 must be:
    (i) Within 25 percent of item 1 when item 1 exceeds 8 mg/L; or
    (ii) Within 2 mg/L of item 1 when item 1 is 8 mg/L or less.
    (3) Successful demonstration that the calculated zone concentrations 
meet these criteria must be achieved for 80 percent of the performance 
test data sets.
    (4) If negative values are obtained for the values of K1 and Ks, 
then these negative kinetic constants may not be used with the Monod 
model, even if the criteria are met. If negative values are obtained, 
this test procedure cannot be used for evaluating the performance of the 
open biological treatment unit.

    E. Determination of KL for Each Zone (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)

    (1) A site-specific liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient (KL) must 
be obtained for each zone during the unsafe sampling conditions. Do not 
use a default value for KL. The KL value for each zone must be based on 
the site-specific parameters of the specific unit. The first step in 
using this procedure is to calculate KL for each zone in the unit using 
Form 4. Form 4 outlines the procedure to follow for using mass transfer 
equations to determine KL. Form 4 identifies the appropriate form to use 
for providing the detailed calculations to support the estimate of the 
value of KL. Forms 5 and 6 are used to provide individual compound 
estimates of KL for quiescent and aerated impoundments, respectively. A 
computer model may be used to perform the calculations. If the WATER8 
model or the most recent update to this model is used, then report the 
computer model input parameters that you used as an attachment to Form 
4. In addition, the Bay Area Sewage Toxics Emission (BASTE) model, 
version 3.0, or equivalent upgrade and the TOXCHEM (Environment Canada's 
Wastewater Technology Centre and Environmega, Ltd.) model, version 1.10, 
or equivalent upgrade may also be used to determine KL for the open 
biological treatment unit with the following stipulations:
    (i) The programs must be altered to output a KL value that is based 
on the site-specific parameters of the unit modeled; and
    (ii) The Henry's law value listed in Form 4 must be substituted for 
the existing Henry's law values in the models.
    (2) The Henry's law value listed in Form 4 may be obtained from the 
following sources:
    (i) Values listed by EPA with temperature adjustment if needed;
    (ii) Measured values for the system of concern with temperature 
adjustment; or
    (iii) Literature values of Henry's law values for methanol, adjusted 
for temperature if needed.
    (3) Input values used in the model and corresponding output values 
shall become part of the documentation of the f<INF>bio</INF> 
determination. The owner or operator should be aware that these models 
may not provide equivalent KL values for some types of units. To obtain 
an equivalent KL value in this situation, the owner or operator shall 
either use the appropriate procedure on Form 4 or adjust the KL value 
from the model to the equivalent KL value as described on Form 4.

[[Page 856]]

    (4) Report the input parameters that you used in the computer model 
on Forms 5, 6, and 7 as an attachment to Form 4. If you have submerged 
air flow in your unit, you must add the value of KL estimated on Form 7 
to the value of KL obtained with Forms 5 and 6 before using the value of 
KL with Form 2.

    F. Estimation of Zone Concentrations (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)

    Form 2 is used to estimate the zone concentrations of HAP based on 
the inlet and outlet data. The value of Ks entered on the form is that 
single composite value of Ks discussed in section III.C of this 
appendix. This value of Ks is calculated during the Initial Performance 
Test (and subsequently updated, if necessary). A unique value of the 
biorate K1 is entered on line 5 of Form 2, and the inlet concentration 
is estimated in Column A of Form 2. The inlet concentration is located 
in the row of Form 2 corresponding to zone 0. If there are three zones 
in the system, n-3 equals 0 for the inlet concentration row. These 
estimated zone concentrations are then used in Form 1 to estimate f bio 
for the treatment unit.

              G. Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC)

    A QA/QC plan outlining the procedures used to determine the measured 
inlet and outlet concentrations during unsafe conditions and how the 
zone characterization data were obtained during the initial performance 
test shall be prepared and submitted with the initial performance test 
report. The plan should include, but may not be limited to:
    (1) A description of each of the sampling methods that were used 
(method, procedures, time, method to avoid losses during sampling and 
holding, and sampling procedures) including simplified schematic 
drawings;
    (2) A description of how that biomass was sampled from the 
biotreatment unit, including methods, locations, and times;
    (3) A description of what conditions (DO, temperature, etc.) are 
important, what the target values are in the zones, how the factors were 
controlled, and how they were monitored. These conditions are primarily 
used to establish that the conditions of the initial performance test 
correspond to the conditions of the day in question;
    (4) A description of how each analytical measurement was conducted, 
including preparation of solutions, dilution procedures, sampling 
procedures, monitoring of conditions, etc;
    (5) A description of the analytical instrumentation used, how the 
instruments were calibrated, and a summary of the accuracy and precision 
for each instrument;
    (6) A description of the test methods used to determine HAP 
concentrations and other measurements. Section 63.457(c)(3) specifies 
the test methods that must be used to determine HAP concentrations. 
During unsafe sampling conditions, you do not have to sample over an 
extended period of time or obtain more than one sample at each sample 
point.
    (7) A description of how data are captured, recorded, and stored; 
and
    (8) A description of the equations used and their solutions for 
sampling and analysis, including a reference to any software used for 
calculations and/or curve-fitting.

     IV. Calculation of Individual fbio (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)

    Use Form 1 with your zone concentration information to estimate the 
value of f bio under unsafe sampling conditions. Form 1 uses measured 
concentrations of HAP in the unit inlet and outlet, and Form 1 also uses 
the estimated concentrations in each zone of the unit obtained from Form 
2. This procedure may be used on an open biological treatment unit that 
has defined zones within the unit. Use Form 1 to determine 
f<INF>bio</INF> for each open biological treatment unit as it exists 
under subpart S of part 63. The first step in using Form 1 is to 
calculate KL for each zone in the unit using Form 4. Form 7 must also be 
used if submerged aeration is used. After KL is determined using field 
data, obtain the concentrations of the HAP in each zone. In this 
alternative procedure for unsafe sampling conditions, the actual 
measured concentrations of the HAP in each zone are replaced with the 
zone concentrations that are estimated with Form 2. After KL and the 
zone concentrations are determined, Form 1 is used to estimate the 
overall unit Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> for methanol.
