                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2001), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

total actual combined U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles and light light-
duty trucks of the applicable model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, 
distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any other entity which comprises 
the point of first sale.
    (iv) The manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual 
volume produced for U.S. sale to be used in lieu of actual U.S. sales 
for purposes of determining compliance with the implementation schedule 
sales percentages of table A00-1. Such petition shall be submitted 
within 30 days of the end of the model year to the Vehicle Programs and 
Compliance Division. For the petition to be granted, the manufacturer 
must establish to the satisfaction of the Administrator that actual 
production volume is functionally equivalent to actual sales volume.
    (2) These SFTP standards do not apply to vehicles certified on

Provisions set forth in Secs. 86.094-15(a), (b), (d) through (i), and 
86.098-15(c) apply except as specifically stated otherwise in this 
paragraph (k).
    (1) To be eligible for the optional program described in this 
paragraph (k), the following must apply:
    (i) Credits are generated from Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines which 
have been certified using certification durability demonstration 
procedures which meet the criteria contained in Sec. 86.004-26 and with 
deterioration factors calculated in accordance with Sec. 86.004-28.
    (ii) During certification, the manufacturer shall declare its intent 
to include specific engine families in the program described in this 
paragraph. Separate declarations are required for each program and no 
engine families may be included in both programs in the same model year.
    (2) Credit generation and use. (i) Credits shall only be generated 
by 2000 and later model year engine families.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, 
credits generated under this paragraph (k) may only be used for 2003 and 
later model year heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines subject to NO<INF>X</INF> 
or NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC standards more stringent than 4.0 g/bhp-hr. 
When used with 2003 and later model year engines, NO<INF>X</INF> credits 
may be used to meet an applicable NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC standard, 
except as otherwise provided in Sec. 86.004-10(a)(1)(i)(C).
    (iii) If a manufacturer chooses to use credits generated under this 
paragraph (k) for engine families subject to the NO<INF>X</INF> standard 
contained in Sec. 86.098-10 (4.0 g/bhp-hr) the averaging, trading, and 
banking of such credits shall be governed by the program provided in 
Secs. 86.094-15(a), (b), (d) through (i) and 86.098-15(c) and shall be 
subject to all discounting, credit life limits and all other provisions 
contained in Secs. 86.094-15(a), (b), (d) through (i) and 86.098-15(c). 
In the case where the manufacturer can demonstrate that the credits were 
discounted under the program provided in this paragraph (k), that 
discount may be accounted for in the calculation of credits described in 
Sec. 86.098-15(c).
    (iv) For NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated under this paragraph (k), 
a Std value of 2.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour shall be used in 
place of the current and applicable NO<INF>X</INF> standard in the 
credit availability equation in Sec. 86.098-15(c)(1).
    (3) Program flexibilities. (i) NO<INF>X</INF> credits that are 
banked under this paragraph (k) and not used as provided by paragraph 
(k)(2)(iii) of this section may be used without being forfeited due to 
credit age. The requirement in this paragraph (k)(3) applies instead of 
the requirements in Sec. 86.094-15(f)(2)(i).
    (ii) There are no regional category restraints for averaging, 
trading, and banking of credits generated under the program described in 
this paragraph (k) except if they are used under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) 
of this section. This applies instead of the regional category 
provisions described in the introductory text of Sec. 86.094-15(d) and 
(e).
    (iii) Credit discounting. (A) For NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated 
under this paragraph (k) from engine families with NO<INF>X</INF> FELs 
greater than 1.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour for oxides of nitrogen, 
a Discount value of 0.9 shall be used instead of 0.8 in the credit 
availability equation in Sec. 86.098-15(c)(1).
    (B) For NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated under this paragraph (k) 
from engine families with NO<INF>X</INF> FELs less than or equal to 1.0

[[Page 20]]

grams per brake horsepower-hour for oxides of nitrogen, a Discount value 
of 1.0 shall be used in place of 0.8 in the credit availability equation 
in Sec. 86.098-15 (c)(1).
    (4) 2003 model year. Manufacturers selecting Option 1, described in 
Sec. 86.005-10(f)(1), may not generate or bank early credits under this 
paragraph (k) for the 2003 model year. Credit generation and banking 
provisions contained in Sec. 86.004-15 apply for the 2003 model year.
    (l) Credit apportionment. At the manufacturer's option, credits 
generated under the provisions described in paragraph (j) or (k) of this 
section may be sold to or otherwise provided to another party for use in 
programs other than the averaging, trading and banking program described 
in this section.
    (1) The manufacturer shall pre-identify two emission levels per 
engine family for the purposes of credit apportionment. One emission 
level shall be the FEL and the other shall be the level of the standard 
that the engine family is required to certify to under Sec. 86.098-10 or 
Sec. 86.098-11, as applicable. For each engine family, the manufacturer 
may report engine sales in two categories, ``ABT-only credits'' and 
``non-manufacturer-owned credits.''
    (i) For engine sales reported as ``ABT-only credits'', the credits 
generated must be used solely in the ABT program described in this 
section.
    (ii) The engine manufacturer may declare a portion of engine sales 
``non-manufacturer-owned credits'' and this portion of the credits 
generated between the standard and the FEL, based on the calculation in 
Sec. 86.098-15(c)(1), would belong to another party. For ABT, the 
manufacturer may not generate any credits for the engine sales reported 
as ``non-manufacturer-owned credits.'' Engines reported as ``non-
manufacturer-owned credits'' shall comply with the FEL and the 
requirements of the ABT program in all other respects.
    (2) Only manufacturer-owned credits reported as ``ABT-only credits'' 
shall be used in the averaging, trading, and banking provisions 
described in this section.
    (3) Credits shall not be double-counted. Credits used in the ABT 
program may not be provided to an engine purchaser for use in another 
program.
    (4) Manufacturers shall determine and state the number of engines 
sold as ``ABT-only credits'' and ``non-manufacturer-owned credits'' in 
the end-of-model year reports required under Sec. 86.098-23.

Sec. 86.096-24.
    (b)(1)(i) Vehicles are chosen to be operated and tested for emission 
data based upon engine family groupings. Within each engine family, one 
test vehicle is selected. If air conditioning is projected to be 
available on any vehicles within the engine family, the Administrator 
will limit selections to engine codes which have air conditioning 
available and will require that any vehicle selected under this section 
has air conditioning installed and operational. The Administrator 
selects as the test vehicle the vehicle with the heaviest equivalent 
test weight (including options) within the family which meets the air 
conditioning eligibility requirement discussed earlier in this section. 
If more than one vehicle meets this criterion, then within that vehicle 
grouping, the Administrator selects, in the order listed, the highest 
road-load power, largest displacement, the transmission with the highest 
numerical final gear ratio (including overdrive), the highest numerical 
axle ratio offered in that engine family, and the maximum fuel flow 
calibration.
    (ii) The Administrator selects one additional test vehicle from 
within each engine family. The additional vehicle selected is the 
vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those vehicles 
remaining in the engine family. The selected vehicle will include an air 
conditioning engine code unless the Administrator chooses a worst 
vehicle configuration that is not available with air conditioning. If 
all vehicles within the engine family are similar, the Administrator may 
waive the requirements of this paragraph.

be equipped with an item (whether that item is standard equipment or an 
option) that can reasonably be expected to influence emissions, that 
item may not be installed on any emission data vehicle or durability 
data vehicle of that carline within that engine-system combination, 
unless that item is standard equipment on that vehicle or specifically 
required by the Administrator.
    (4) Air conditioning must be installed and operational on any 
emission data vehicle of any vehicle configuration that is projected to

accumulation using the Durability Driving Schedule as specified in 
appendix IV to this part. A modified procedure may also be used if 
approved in advance by the Administrator. Except with the advance 
approval of the Administrator, all vehicles will accumulate mileage at a 
measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds of the estimated curb 
weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100 pounds of being 
included in the next higher inertia weight class as specified in 
Sec. 86.129, the manufacturer may elect to conduct the respective 
emission tests at higher loaded vehicle weight.
    (3) Emission data vehicles. Unless otherwise provided for in 
Sec. 86.000-23(a), emission-data vehicles shall be operated and tested 
as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section; Sec. 86.094-

may elect to accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an 
engine family without making a determination. The manufacturer must 
accumulate a minimum of 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) on each test 
vehicle within an engine family. All test vehicle mileage must be 
accurately determined, recorded, and reported to the Administrator. Any 
vehicle used to represent emission-data vehicle selections under 
Sec. 86.000-24(b)(1) shall be equipped with an engine and emission 
control system that has accumulated the mileage the manufacturer chose 
to accumulate on the test vehicle. Fuel economy data generated from 
certification vehicles selected in accordance with Sec. 86.000-24(b)(1) 
with engine-system combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 
kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be factored in accordance with 40 CFR

nominal test point mileage intervals that the manufacturer determines. 
Unless the Administrator approves a manufacturer's request to develop 
specific deterioration factors for aggressive driving (US06) and air 
conditioning (SC03) test cycle results, tail pipe exhaust emission 
deterioration factors are determined from only FTP test cycle data. At a 
minimum, two complete exhaust emission tests shall be made. The first 
test shall be made at a distance not greater than 6,250 miles. The last 
shall be made at the mileage accumulation endpoint determined in

    (a)(4) Introductory text [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.098-
28.
    (a)(4)(i) Separate emission deterioration factors for each regulated 
exhaust constituent shall be determined from the FTP exhaust emission 
results of the durability-data vehicle(s) for each engine-system 
combination. Unless the Administrator approves a manufacturer's request 
to develop specific deterioration factors for US06 and air conditioning 
(SC03) test results, applicable FTP deterioration factors will also be 
used to estimate intermediate and full useful life emissions for all 
SFTP regulated emission levels. Separate evaporative and/or refueling 
emission deterioration factors shall be determined for each evaporative/
refueling emission family-emission control system combination from the 
testing conducted by the manufacturer (gasoline-fueled and methanol-
fueled vehicles only). Separate refueling emission deterioration factors 
shall be determined for each evaporative/refueling emission family-
emission control system combination from the testing conducted by the

    (a)(4)(ii)(A)(1) The official exhaust emission test results for each 
applicable exhaust emission standard for each emission data vehicle at 
the selected test point shall be multiplied by the appropriate 
deterioration factor: Provided, that if a deterioration factor as 
computed in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section is less than 
one, that deterioration factor shall be one for the purposes of this 
paragraph. For the SFTP composite standard of (NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>), the 
measured results of

[[Page 26]]

NMHC and NO<INF>X</INF> must each be multiplied by their corresponding 
deterioration factors before the composite (NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>) 
standard is calculated.
    (2) The calculation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A)(1) of this 
section may be modified with advance approval of the Administrator for 
engine-system combinations which are certified under the Alternative 
Service Accumulation Durability Program specified in Sec. 86.094-13(e).

emissions of Sec. 86.098-28 (a)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) and paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section 211a for each emission-data vehicle. For 
the SFTP composite (NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>) results, the individual 
deterioration factors must be applied to the applicable NMHC and 
NO<INF>X</INF> test results prior to calculating the adjusted composite 
(NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>) level that is compared with the standard. The 
additional composite calculations that are required by the SFTP are 
discussed in Sec. 86.164-00 (Supplemental federal test procedure 
calculations). Before any emission value is compared with the standard 
(or the family particulate emission limit, as appropriate), it shall be 
rounded to two significant figures in accordance with the Rounding-Off 
Method specified in ASTM E29-90, Standard Practice for Using Significant 
Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with Specifications 
(incorporated by reference; see Sec. 86.1). The rounded emission values 
may not exceed the standard (or the family particulate emission limit, 
as appropriate).

group. Unless the Administrator approves a manufacturer's request to 
develop specific deterioration factors for US06 and air conditioning 
(SC03) test results, applicable deterioration factors determined from 
FTP exhaust emission results will also be used to estimate intermediate 
and full useful life emissions for all SFTP regulated emission levels. 
The evaporative and/or refueling emission deterioration factors for each 
evaporative/refueling family will be determined and applied in 
accordance with Sec. 86.098-28 (a)(4) introductory text, (a)(4)(i)(C)

    (b)(4)(ii) Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors for each 
regulated exhaust constituent, determined from tests of vehicles, 
engines, subsystems, or components conducted by the manufacturer, shall 
be supplied for each standard and for each engine-system combination. 
Unless the Administrator approves a manufacturer's request to develop 
specific deterioration factors for US06 and air conditioning (SC03) test 
results, applicable deterioration factors determined from FTP exhaust 
emission results will also be used to estimate intermediate and full 
useful life emissions for all SFTP regulated emission levels.
    (iii) The official exhaust emission results for each applicable 
exhaust emission standard for each emission data vehicle at the selected 
test point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate 
deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by 
the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of 
this paragraph (b)(4)(iii).
    (iv) The emissions to compare with the standard(s) (or the family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted 
emissions of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section for each emission-
data vehicle. For the SFTP composite (NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>) results, the 
individual deterioration factors must be applied to the applicable NMHC 
and

[[Page 27]]

NO<INF>X</INF> test results prior to calculating the adjusted composite 
(NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>) level that is compared with the standard. The 
additional composite calculations that are required by the SFTP are

Sec. 86.001-1  General applicability.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart generally apply to 2001 and later 
model year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle heavy-duty engines. In cases 
where a provision applies only to a certain vehicle group based on its 
model year, vehicle class, motor fuel, engine type, or other 
distinguishing characteristics, the limited applicability is cited in 
the appropriate section or paragraph. The provisions of this subpart 
continue to generally apply to 2000 and earlier model year new Otto-
cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles and 2000 and earlier model 
year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty trucks produced. 
Provisions generally applicable to all 2001 and later model year new 
Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles and 2001 and later model 
year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty trucks are located in 
Subpart S of this part.
    (b) Optional applicability. (1) A manufacturer may request to 
certify any heavy-duty vehicle of 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight 
Rating or less in accordance with the light-duty truck provisions 
located in subpart S of this part through the 2004 model year (through 
the 2003 model year for manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE Option 2 
in Sec. 86.005-1(c)(2), or through the 2002 model year for manufacturers 
choosing Otto-cycle HDE Option 1 in Sec. 86.005-1(c)(1)). Heavy-duty 
engine or vehicle provisions of this subpart A do not apply to such a 
vehicle.
    (2) Beginning with the 2000 model year, a manufacturer may certify 
any Otto-cycle heavy-duty vehicle of 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight 
Rating or less in accordance with the provisions for Otto-cycle complete 
heavy-duty vehicles located in subpart S of this part for purposes of 
generating credits in the heavy-duty vehicle averaging, banking, and 
trading program contained in Sec. 86.1817-05. Heavy-duty engine or 
heavy-duty vehicle provisions of this subpart A do not apply to such a 
vehicle.
    (c)-(d) [Reserved]
    (e) Small volume manufacturers. Special certification procedures are 
available for any manufacturer whose projected combined U.S. sales of 
light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-
duty engines in its product line (including all vehicles and engines 
imported under the provisions of Secs. 85.1505 and 85.1509 of this 
chapter) are fewer than 10,000 units for the model year in which the 
manufacturer seeks certification. To certify its product line under 
these optional procedures, the small-volume manufacturer must first 
obtain the Administrator's approval. The manufacturer must meet the 
eligibility criteria specified in Sec. 86.092-14(b) before the 
Administrator's approval will be granted. The small-volume 
manufacturer's certification procedures are described in Sec. 86.092-14.
    (f) Optional procedures for determining exhaust opacity. (1) The 
provisions of subpart I of this part apply to tests which are performed 
by the Administrator, and optionally, by the manufacturer.
    (2) Measurement procedures, other than those described in subpart I 
of this part, may be used by the manufacturer provided the manufacturer 
satisfies the requirements of Sec. 86.091-23(f).
    (3) When a manufacturer chooses to use an alternative measurement 
procedure it has the responsibility to determine whether the results 
obtained by the procedure will correlate with the results which would be 
obtained from the measurement procedure in subpart I of this part. 
Consequently, the Administrator will not routinely approve or disapprove 
any alternative opacity measurement procedure or any associated 
correlation data which the manufacturer elects to use to satisfy the 
data requirements for subpart I of this part.
    (4) If a confirmatory test(s) is performed and the results indicate 
there is a systematic problem suggesting that the data generated under 
an optional alternative measurement procedure do not adequately 
correlate with data obtained in accordance with the procedures described 
in subpart I of this part, EPA may require that all certificates of 
conformity not already issued

[[Page 29]]

be based on data obtained from procedures described in subpart I of this 
part.

Sec. 86.004-2  Definitions.

    The definitions of Sec. 86.001-2 continue to apply to 2001 and later 
model year vehicles. The definitions listed in this section apply 
beginning with the 2004 model year.
    Defeat device means an auxiliary emission control device (AECD) that 
reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system under 
conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal 
vehicle operation and use, unless:
    (1) Such conditions are substantially included in the applicable 
Federal emission test procedure for heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty 
engines described in subpart N of this part;
    (2) The need for the AECD is justified in terms of protecting the 
vehicle against damage or accident; or
    (3) The AECD does not go beyond the requirements of engine starting.
    U.S.-directed production means the engines and/or vehicles (as 
applicable) produced by a manufacturer for which the manufacturer has 
reasonable assurance that sale was or will be made to ultimate 
purchasers in the United States, excluding engines and/or vehicles that 
are certified to state emission standards different than the emission 
standards in this part.
    Useful life means:
    (1) For light-duty vehicles, and for light light-duty trucks not 
subject to the Tier 0 standards of Sec. 86.094-9(a), intermediate useful 
life and/or full useful life. Intermediate useful life is a period of 
use of 5 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Full useful life 
is a period of use of 10 years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first, 
except as otherwise noted in Sec. 86.094-9. The useful life of 
evaporative and/or refueling emission control systems on the portion of 
these vehicles subject to the evaporative emission test requirements of 
Sec. 86.130-96, and/or the refueling emission test requirements of 
Sec. 86.151-98, is defined as a period of use of 10 years or 100,000 
miles, whichever occurs first.
    (2) For light light-duty trucks subject to the Tier 0 standards of 
Sec. 86.094-9(a), and for heavy light-duty truck engine families, 
intermediate and/or full useful life. Intermediate useful life is a 
period of use of 5 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Full 
useful life is a period of use of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever 
occurs first. The useful life of evaporative emission and/or

[[Page 38]]

refueling control systems on the portion of these vehicles subject to 
the evaporative emission test requirements of Sec. 86.130-96, and/or the 
refueling emission test requirements of Sec. 86.151-98, is also defined 
as a period of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first.
    (3) For an Otto-cycle HDE family:
    (i) For hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide standards, a period of use 
of 10 years or 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (ii) For the oxides of nitrogen standard, a period of use of 10 
years or 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (iii) For the portion of evaporative emission control systems 
subject to the evaporative emission test requirements of Sec. 86.1230-
96, a period of use of 10 years or 110,000 miles, whichever first 
occurs.
    (4) For a diesel HDE family:
    (i) For light heavy-duty diesel engines, for carbon monoxide, 
particulate, and oxides of nitrogen plus non-methane hydrocarbons 
emissions standards, a period of use of 10 years or 110,000 miles, 
whichever first occurs.
    (ii) For medium heavy-duty diesel engines, for carbon monoxide, 
particulate, and oxides of nitrogen plus non-methane hydrocarbons 
emission standards, a period of use of 10 years or 185,000 miles, 
whichever first occurs.
    (iii) For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines, for carbon monoxide, 
particulate, and oxides of nitrogen plus non-methane hydrocarbon 
emissions standards, a period of use of 10 years or 435,000 miles, or 
22,000 hours, whichever first occurs, except as provided in paragraphs 
(4)(iv) and (4)(v) of this definition.
    (iv) The useful life limit of 22,000 hours in paragraph (4)(iii) of 
this definition is effective as a limit to the useful life only when an 
accurate hours meter is provided by the manufacturer with the engine and 
only when such hours meter can reasonably be expected to operate 
properly over the useful life of the engine.
    (v) For an individual engine, if the useful life hours limit of 
22,000 hours is reached before the engine reaches 10 years or 100,000 
miles, the useful life shall become 10 years or 100,000 miles, whichever 
occurs first, as required under Clean Air Act section 202(d).
    (5) As an option for both light-duty trucks under certain conditions 
and HDE families, an alternative useful life period may be assigned by 
the Administrator under the provisions of Sec. 86.094-21(f).
    Warranty period, for purposes of HDE emissions defect warranty and 
emissions performance warranty, shall be a period of 5 years/50,000 
miles, whichever occurs first, for Otto-cycle HDEs and light heavy-duty 
diesel engines. For all other heavy-duty diesel engines the 
aforementioned period shall be 5 years/100,000 miles, whichever occurs 
first. However, in no case may this period be less than the basic 
mechanical warranty period that the manufacturer provides (with or 
without additional charge) to the purchaser of the engine. Extended 
warranties on select parts do not extend the emissions warranty 
requirements for the entire engine but only for those parts. In cases 
where responsibility for an extended warranty is shared between the 
owner and the manufacturer, the emissions warranty shall also be shared 
in the same manner as specified in the warranty agreement.

accordance with those procedures.
    (B) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating greater than 
26,000 pounds, the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and 
(b)(4)(ii) of this section refer to the manufacturer's engineering 
design evaluation using good engineering practice (a statement of which 
is required in Sec. 86.091-23(b)(4)(ii)).
    (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient 
atmosphere from any new 2004 or later model year methanol-, natural gas-
, or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel, or any naturally-aspirated 
diesel HDE. For petroleum-fueled engines only, this provision does not 
apply to engines using turbochargers, pumps, blowers, or superchargers 
for air induction.
    (d) Every manufacturer of new motor vehicle engines subject to the 
standards prescribed in this section shall, prior to taking any of the

Sec. 86.004-15  NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines.

    (a)(1) Heavy-duty engines eligible for NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC and 
particulate averaging, trading and banking programs are described in the 
applicable emission standards sections in this subpart. All heavy-duty 
engine families which include any engines labeled for use in clean-fuel 
vehicles as specified in 40 CFR part 88 are not eligible for these 
programs. For manufacturers not selecting Options 1 or 2 contained in 
Sec. 86.005-10(f), the ABT program requirements contained in 
Sec. 86.000-15 apply for 2004 model year Otto-cycle engines, rather than 
the provisions contained in this Sec. 86.004-15. Participation in these 
programs is voluntary.
    (2)(i) Engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable standard 
shall obtain emission credits in a mass amount sufficient to address the 
shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, trading, or banking, 
within the averaging set restrictions described in this section.

[[Page 42]]

    (ii) Engine families with FELs below the applicable standard will 
have emission credits available to average, trade, bank or a combination 
thereof. Credits may not be used for averaging or trading to offset 
emissions that exceed an FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy an in-
use nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by 
recall testing. However, credits may be used to allow subsequent 
production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer 
elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (b) Participation in the NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC and/or particulate 
averaging, trading, and banking programs shall be done as follows:
    (1) During certification, the manufacturer shall:
    (i) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the 
averaging, trading and/or banking programs. Separate declarations are 
required for each program and for each pollutant (i.e., NO<INF>X</INF> 
plus NMHC, and particulate).
    (ii) Declare an FEL for each engine family participating in one or 
more of these two programs.
    (A) The FEL must be to the same level of significant digits as the 
emission standard (one-tenth of a gram per brake horsepower-hour for 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC emissions and one-hundredth of a gram per brake 
horsepower-hour for particulate emissions).
    (B) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in the 
section concerning the applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> plus 
NMHC and particulate emission standards.
    (iii) Calculate the projected emission credits (positive or 
negative) based on quarterly production projections for each 
participating family and for each pollutant, using the applicable 
equation in paragraph (c) of this section and the applicable factors for 
the specific engine family.
    (iv)(A) Determine and state the source of the needed credits 
according to quarterly projected production for engine families 
requiring credits for certification.
    (B) State where the quarterly projected credits will be applied for 
engine families generating credits.
    (C) Credits may be obtained from or applied to only engine families 
within the same averaging set as described in paragraph (d) or (e) of 
this section. Credits available for averaging, trading, or banking as 
defined in Sec. 86.090-2, may be applied exclusively to a given engine 
family, or reserved as defined in Sec. 86.091-2.
    (2) Based on this information each manufacturer's certification 
application must demonstrate:
    (i) That at the end of model year production, each engine family has 
a net emissions credit balance of zero or more using the methodology in 
paragraph (c) of this section with any credits obtained from averaging, 
trading or banking.
    (ii) The source of the credits to be used to comply with the 
emission standard if the FEL exceeds the standard, or where credits will 
be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where 
credits are being obtained, each engine family involved must state 
specifically the source (manufacturer/engine family) of the credits 
being used. In cases where credits are being generated/supplied, each 
engine family involved must state specifically the designated use 
(manufacturer/engine family or reserved) of the credits involved. All 
such reports shall include all credits involved in averaging, trading or 
banking.
    (3) During the model year manufacturers must:
    (i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that 
compliance with the emission standards is achieved at the end of the 
model year.
    (ii) Provide the end-of-model year reports required under 
Sec. 86.001-23.
    (iii) For manufacturers participating in emission credit trading, 
maintain the quarterly records required under Sec. 86.091-7(c)(8).
    (4) Projected credits based on information supplied in the 
certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of 
conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of 
end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any other compliance 
measures deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
    (5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be 
determined at the end of the model year. Engine families without an 
adequate

[[Page 43]]

amount of NO<INF>X</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, and/or particulate 
emission credits will violate the conditions of the certificate of 
conformity. The certificates of conformity may be voided ab initio for 
engine families exceeding the emission standard.
    (6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error 
occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this 
section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be 
recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous 
negative balances may be adjusted by EPA for retroactive use.
    (i) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates a 
credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to purchase the 
necessary credits to bring the credit balance for that engine family to 
zero, using the discount specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
on the ratio of credits purchased for every credit needed to bring the 
balance to zero. If sufficient credits are not available to bring the 
credit balance for the family in question to zero, EPA may void the 
certificate for that engine family ab initio.
    (ii) If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year 
report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's 
favor (i.e., resulting in a positive credit balance) or if the 
manufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of 
the end-of-year report, the credits will be restored for use by the 
manufacturer.
    (c)(1) For each participating engine family, NO<INF>X</INF> plus 
NMHC, and particulate emission credits (positive or negative) are to be 
calculated according to one of the following equations and rounded, in 
accordance with ASTM E29-93a (incorporated by reference at Sec. 86.1), 
to the nearest one-tenth of a Megagram (Mg). Consistent units are to be 
used throughout the equation.
    (i) For determining credit need for all engine families and credit 
availability for engine families generating credits for averaging 
programs only:

Emission credits = (Std - FEL)  x  (CF)  x  (UL)  x  (Production)  x  
    (10<SUP>-6</SUP>)

    (ii) For determining credit availability for engine families 
generating credits for trading or banking programs:

Emission credits = (Std - FEL)  x  (CF)  x  (UL)  x  (Production)  x  
    (10<SUP>-6</SUP>)  x  (Discount)

    (iii) For purposes of the equation in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) 
of this section:

Std = the current and applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> plus 
NMHC or particulate emission standard in grams per brake horsepower hour 
or grams per Megajoule.
FEL = the NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, or particulate family emission limit 
for the engine family in grams per brake horsepower hour or grams per 
Megajoule.
CF = a transient cycle conversion factor in BHP-hr/mi or MJ/mi, as given 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
UL = the useful life described in Sec. 86.004-2, or alternative life as 
described in Sec. 86.004-21(f), for the given engine family in miles.
Production = the number of engines produced for U.S. sales within the 
given engine family during the model year. Quarterly production 
projections are used for initial certification. Actual production is 
used for end-of-year compliance determination.
Discount = a one-time discount applied to all credits to be banked or 
traded within the model year generated. Except as otherwise allowed in 
paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section, the discount applied here is 
0.9. Banked credits traded in a subsequent model year will not be 
subject to an additional discount. Banked credits used in a subsequent 
model year's averaging program will not have the discount restored.

    (2)(i) The transient cycle conversion factor is the total 
(integrated) cycle brake horsepower-hour or Megajoules, divided by the 
equivalent mileage of the applicable transient cycle. For Otto-cycle 
heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3 miles. For diesel 
heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.5 miles.
    (ii) When more than one configuration is chosen by EPA to be tested 
in the certification of an engine family (as described in Sec. 86.085-
24), the conversion factor used is to be based upon a production 
weighted average value of the configurations in an engine family to 
calculate the conversion factor.
    (d) Averaging sets for NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC emission credits. 
The averaging and trading of NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC emission credits 
will only be allowed between heavy-duty engine families in the same 
averaging set. The averaging sets for

[[Page 44]]

the averaging and trading of NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC emission credits 
for heavy-duty engines are defined as follows:
    (1) For NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC credits from Otto-cycle heavy-duty 
engines:
    (i) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines constitute an averaging set. 
Averaging and trading among all Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families is 
allowed. There are no subclass restrictions.
    (ii) Otto-cycle heavy-duty vehicles certified under the chassis-
based provisions of Subpart S of this Part may not average or trade with 
heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines except as allowed in Sec. 86.1817-05(o).
    (2) For NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC credits from diesel-cycle heavy-
duty engines:
    (i) Each of the three primary intended service classes for heavy-
duty diesel engines, as defined in Sec. 86.004-2, constitute an 
averaging set. Averaging and trading among all diesel-cycle engine 
families within the same primary service class is allowed.
    (ii) Urban buses are treated as members of the primary intended 
service class where they otherwise would fall.
    (e) Averaging sets for particulate emission credits. The averaging 
and trading of particulate emission credits will only be allowed between 
diesel cycle heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set. The 
averaging sets for the averaging and trading of particulate emission 
credits for diesel cycle heavy-duty engines are defined as follows:
    (1) Engines intended for use in urban buses constitute a separate 
averaging set from all other heavy-duty engines. Averaging and trading 
between diesel cycle bus engine families is allowed.
    (2) For heavy-duty engines, exclusive of urban bus engines, each of 
the three primary intended service classes for heavy-duty diesel cycle 
engines, as defined in Sec. 86.004-2, constitute an averaging set. 
Averaging and trading between diesel-cycle engine families within the 
same primary service class is allowed.
    (3) Otto cycle engines may not participate in particulate averaging, 
trading, or banking.
    (f) Banking of NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, and particulate emission 
credits. (1) Credit deposits. (i) NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, and 
particulate emission credits may be banked from engine families produced 
in any model year.
    (ii) Manufacturers may bank credits only after the end of the model 
year and after actual credits have been reported to EPA in the end-of-
year report. During the model year and before submittal of the end-of-
year report, credits originally designated in the certification process 
for banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for 
trading or averaging.
    (2) Credit withdrawals. (i) NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC and particulate 
credits generated in 2004 and later model years do not expire. 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC credits generated by Otto-cycle engines in the 
2003 model year for manufacturers selecting Option 1 contained in 
Sec. 86.005-10(f)(1) also do not expire.
    (ii) Manufacturers withdrawing banked NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, and/
or particulate credits shall indicate so during certification and in 
their credit reports, as described in Sec. 86.091-23.
    (3) Use of banked emission credits. The use of banked credits shall 
be within the averaging set and other restrictions described in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and only for the following 
purposes:
    (i) Banked credits may be used in averaging, or in trading, or in 
any combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits 
declared for banking from the previous model year but not reported to 
EPA may also be used. However, if EPA finds that the reported credits 
can not be proven, they will be revoked and unavailable for use.
    (ii) Banked credits may not be used for NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC or 
particulate averaging and trading to offset emissions that exceed an 
FEL. Banked credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity 
determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing. 
However, banked credits may be used for subsequent production of the 
engine family if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (iii) NO<INF>X</INF> credits banked under paragraph Sec. 86.098-
15(j) or Sec. 86.000-15(k) may be used in place of NO<INF>X</INF> plus 
NMHC credits in 2004 and later model years provided that they are used 
in the correct averaging set. NO<INF>X</INF> credits banked under 
paragraph Sec. 86.000-15(k) may also

[[Page 45]]

be used in place of NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC credits in the 2003 model 
year for manufacturers selecting Option 1 contained in Sec. 86.005-
10(f)(1), provided that they are used in the correct averaging set.
    (iv) Except for early credits banked under Sec. 86.000-15(k), 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits banked in accordance with Sec. 86.000-15 may not 
be used to meet the Otto-cycle engine standards contained in 
Sec. 86.005-10.
    (g)(1) This paragraph (g) assumes NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, and 
particulate nonconformance penalties (NCPs) will be available for the 
2004 and later model year HDEs.
    (2) Engine families using NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC and/or 
particulate NCPs but not involved in averaging:
    (i) May not generate NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC or particulate credits 
for banking and trading.
    (ii) May not use NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC or particulate credits 
from banking and trading.
    (3) If a manufacturer has any engine family to which application of 
NCPs and banking and trading credits is desired, that family must be 
separated into two distinct families. One family, whose FEL equals the 
standard, must use NCPs only while the other, whose FEL does not equal 
the standard, must use credits only.
    (4) If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given averaging set 
which is using NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC and/or particulate NCPs, none of 
that manufacturer's engine families in that averaging set may generate 
credits for banking and trading.
    (h) In the event of a negative credit balance in a trading 
situation, both the buyer and the seller would be liable.
    (i) Certification fuel used for credit generation must be of a type 
that is both available in use and expected to be used by the engine 
purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the Administrator, the engine 
manufacturer must provide information acceptable to the Administrator 
that the designated fuel is readily available commercially and would be 
used in customer service.
    (j) Credit apportionment. At the manufacturer's option, credits 
generated under the provisions described in this section may be sold to 
or otherwise provided to another party for use in programs other than 
the averaging, trading and banking program described in this section.
    (1) The manufacturer shall pre-identify two emission levels per 
engine family for the purposes of credit apportionment. One emission 
level shall be the FEL and the other shall be the level of the standard 
that the engine family is required to certify to under Sec. 86.005-10 or 
Sec. 86.004-11. For each engine family, the manufacturer may report 
engine sales in two categories, ``ABT-only credits'' and 
``nonmanufacturer-owned credits''.
    (i) For engine sales reported as ``ABT-only credits'', the credits 
generated must be used solely in the ABT program described in this 
section.
    (ii) The engine manufacturer may declare a portion of engine sales 
``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' and this portion of the credits 
generated between the standard and the FEL, based on the calculation in 
(c)(1) of this section, would belong to the engine purchaser. For ABT, 
the manufacturer may not generate any credits for the engine sales 
reported as ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits''. Engines reported as 
``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' shall comply with the FEL and the 
requirements of the ABT program in all other respects.
    (2) Only manufacturer-owned credits reported as ``ABT-only credits'' 
shall be used in the averaging, trading, and banking provisions 
described in this section.
    (3) Credits shall not be double-counted. Credits used in the ABT 
program may not be provided to an engine purchaser for use in another 
program.
    (4) Manufacturers shall determine and state the number of engines 
sold as ``ABT-only credits'' and ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' in 
the end-of-model year reports required under Sec. 86.001-23.
    (k) Additional flexibility for diesel-cycle engines. If a diesel-
cycle engine family meets the conditions of either paragraph (k)(1) or 
(2) of this section, a Discount of 1.0 may be used in the trading and 
banking calculation, for both NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC and for 
particulate, described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (1) The engine family certifies with a certification level of 1.9 g/
bhp-hr NO<INF>X</INF>

[[Page 46]]

plus NMHC or lower for all diesel-cycle engine families.
    (2) All of the following must apply to the engine family:
    (i) Diesel-cycle engines only;
    (ii) 2004, 2005, and 2006 model years only;
    (iii) Must be an engine family using carry-over certification data 
from prior to model year 2004 where the NO<INF>X</INF> plus the HC 
certification level prior to model year 2004 is below the NO<INF>X</INF> 
plus NMHC or NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHCE standard set forth in 
Sec. 86.004-11. Under this option, the NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated 
from this engine family prior to model year 2004 may be used as 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC credits.
    (l) Additional flexibility for Otto-cycle engines. If an Otto-cycle 
engine family meets the conditions of paragraph (l)(1) or (2) of this 
section, a discount of 1.0 may be used in the trading and banking 
credits calculation for NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, as follows:
    (1) The engine family has a FEL of 0.5 g/bhp-hr NO<INF>X</INF> plus 
NMHC or lower;
    (2) All of the following conditions are met:
    (i) For first three consecutive model years that the engine family 
is certified to a NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC standard contained in 
Sec. 86.005-10;
    (ii) The engine family is certified using carry-over data from an 
engine family which was used to generate early NO<INF>X</INF> credits 
per Sec. 86.000-15(k) where the sum of the NO<INF>X</INF> FEL plus the 
HC (or hydrocarbon equivalent where applicable) certification level is 
below 1.0 g/bhp-hr.

Sec. 86.004-16  Prohibition of defeat devices.

    (a) No new heavy-duty vehicle or heavy-duty engine shall be equipped 
with a defeat device.
    (b) The Administrator may test or require testing on any vehicle or 
engine at a designated location, using driving cycles and conditions 
which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation 
and use, for the purpose of investigating a potential defeat device.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) For vehicle and engine designs designated by the Administrator 
to be investigated for possible defeat devices:
    (1) General. The manufacturer must show to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that the vehicle or engine design does not incorporate 
strategies that reduce emission control effectiveness exhibited during 
the Federal emissions test procedures, described in subpart N of this 
part, when the vehicle or engine is operated under conditions which may 
reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use, 
unless one of the specific exceptions set forth in the definition of 
``defeat device'' in Sec. 86.004-2 has been met.
    (2) Information submissions required. The manufacturer will provide 
an explanation containing detailed information (including information 
which the Administrator may request to be submitted) regarding test 
programs, engineering evaluations, design specifications, calibrations, 
on-board computer algorithms, and design strategies incorporated for 
operation both during and outside of the Federal emission test procedure 
described in subpart N of this part.

refueling emission family-emission control system combination, required 
to use a volume of fuel equal to 85% of fuel tank volume.
    (6) Participation in averaging programs--(i) Particulate averaging. 
(A) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the particulate 
averaging program for diesel light-duty vehicles and/or diesel light-
duty trucks or the particulate averaging program for heavy-duty diesel 
engines, the application must list the family particulate emission limit 
and the projected U.S. production volume of the family for the model 
year.
    (B) The manufacturer shall choose the level of the family 
particulate emission limits, accurate to hundredth of a gram per mile or 
hundredth of a gram per brake horsepowerhour for HDEs.
    (C) The manufacturer may at any time during production elect to 
change the level of any family particulate emission limit(s) by 
submitting the new limit(s) to the Administrator and by demonstrating 
compliance with the limit(s) as described in Secs. 86.090-2 and 86.094-
28(b)(5)(i).
    (ii) NO<INF>X</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC averaging. (A) If 
the manufacturer elects to participate in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging 
program for light-duty trucks or otto-cycle HDEs or the NO<INF>X</INF> 
plus NMHC averaging program for diesel-cycle HDEs, the application must 
list the family emission limit and the projected U.S. production volume 
of the family for the model year.
    (B) The manufacturer shall choose the level of the family emission

    (m) For model years 2004 through 2007, within 180 days after 
submission of the application for certification of a heavy-duty diesel 
engine, the manufacturer must provide emission test results from the 
Load Response Test conducted according to Sec. 86.1380-2004, including, 
at a minimum, test results conducted at each of the speeds identified in 
Sec. 86.1380-2004. Load Response Test data submissions are not necessary 
for carry-over engine families for which Load Response Test data has 
been previously submitted. In addition, upon approval of the 
Administrator, manufacturers may carry Load Response Test data across 
from one engine family to other engine families, provided that the 
carry-across engine families use similar emission control technology 
hardware which would be expected to result in the generation of similar 
emission data when run over the Load Response Test.
    (n) Upon request from EPA, a manufacturer must provide to EPA any 
hardware (including scan tools), passwords, and/or documentation 
necessary for EPA to read, interpret, and store

[[Page 48]]

(in engineering units if applicable) any information broadcast by an 
engine's on-board computers and electronic control modules which relates 
in any way to emission control devices and auxiliary emission control 
devices, provided that such hardware, passwords, or documentation exists 
and is not otherwise commercially available. Passwords include any 
information necessary to enable generic scan tools or personal computers 
access to proprietary emission related information broadcast by an 
engine's on-board computer, if such passwords exist. This requirement 
includes access by EPA to any proprietary code information which may be 
broadcast by an engine's on-board computer and electronic control 
modules. Information which is confidential business information must be 
marked as such. Engineering units refers to the ability to read, 
interpret, and store information in commonly understood engineering 
units, for example, engine speed in revolutions per minute or per 
second, injection timing parameters such as start of injection in 
degree's before top-dead center, fueling rates in cubic centimeters per 
stroke, vehicle speed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour. This 
paragraph (n) does not restrict EPA authority to take any action 
authorized by section 208 of the Clean Air Act.

Sec. 86.004-25  Maintenance.

    Section 86.004-25 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.094-25 or Sec. 86.098-25. Where a paragraph in 
Sec. 86.094-25 or Sec. 86.098-25 is identical and applicable to 
Sec. 86.004-25, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding 
paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.094-

    (ii) All critical emission-related scheduled maintenance must have a 
reasonable likelihood of being performed in-use. The manufacturer shall 
be required to show the reasonable likelihood of such maintenance being 
performed in-use, and such showing shall be made prior to the 
performance of the maintenance on the durability data vehicle. Critical 
emission-related scheduled maintenance items which satisfy one of the 
conditions defined in paragraphs (b)(6)(ii) (A) through (F) of this 
section will be accepted as having

[[Page 50]]

a reasonable likelihood of the maintenance item being performed in-use.
    (A) Data are presented which establish for the Administrator a 
connection between emissions and vehicle performance such that as 
emissions increase due to lack of maintenance, vehicle performance will 
simultaneously deteriorate to a point unacceptable for typical driving.
    (B) Survey data are submitted which adequately demonstrate to the 
Administrator that, at an 80 percent confidence level, 80 percent of 
such engines already have this critical maintenance item performed in-
use at the recommended interval(s).
    (C) A clearly displayed visible signal system approved by the 
Administrator is installed to alert the vehicle driver that maintenance 
is due. A signal bearing the message ``maintenance needed'' or ``check 
engine'', or a similar message approved by the Administrator, shall be 
actuated at the appropriate mileage point or by component failure. This 
signal must be continuous while the engine is in operation and not be 
easily eliminated without performance of the required maintenance. 
Resetting the signal shall be a required step in the maintenance 
operation. The method for resetting the signal system shall be approved 
by the Administrator. For HDEs, the system must not be designed to 
deactivate upon the end of the useful life of the engine or thereafter.
    (D) A manufacturer may desire to demonstrate through a survey that a 
critical maintenance item is likely to be performed without a visible 
signal on a maintenance item for which there is no prior in-use 
experience without the signal. To that end, the manufacturer may in a 
given model year market up to 200 randomly selected vehicles per 
critical emission-related maintenance item without such visible signals, 
and monitor the performance of the critical maintenance item by the 
owners to show compliance with paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. 
This option is restricted to two consecutive model years and may not be 
repeated until any previous survey has been completed. If the critical 
maintenance involves more than one engine family, the sample will be 
sales weighted to ensure that it is representative of all the families 
in question.
    (E) The manufacturer provides the maintenance free of charge, and 
clearly informs the customer that the maintenance is free in the 
instructions provided under Sec. 86.087-38.
    (F) Any other method which the Administrator approves as 
establishing a reasonable likelihood that the critical maintenance will 
be performed in-use.
    (iii) Visible signal systems used under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(C) of 
this section are considered an element of design of the emission control 
system. Therefore, disabling, resetting, or otherwise rendering such 
signals inoperative without also performing the indicated maintenance 
procedure is a prohibited act under section 203(a)(3) of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(3)).

    (c)(1) Paragraph (c) of this section applies to heavy-duty engines.
    (2) Two types of service accumulation are applicable to heavy-duty 
engines, as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. 
For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines exhaust emissions, the service 
accumulation method used by a manufacturer must be designed to 
effectively predict the deterioration of emissions in actual use over 
the full useful life of the of the candidate in-use vehicles and must 
cover the breadth of the manufacturer's product line that will be 
covered by the durability procedure. Manufacturers not selecting Options 
1 or 2 described in Sec. 86.005-10(f) may certify Otto-cycle engines 
using the provisions contained in Sec. 86.094-26(c)(2) rather than those 
contained in this paragraph (c)(2) for 2004 model year engine families 
certified using carry-over durability data, except for those engines 
used for early credit banking as allowed in Sec. 86.000-15(k).
    (i) Service accumulation on engines, subsystems, or components 
selected by the manufacturer under Sec. 86.094-24(c)(3)(i). The 
manufacturer determines the form and extent of this service 
accumulation, consistent with good engineering practice, and describes 
it in the application for certification.
    (ii) Dynamometer service accumulation on emission data engines 
selected under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(2) or (3). The manufacturer determines 
the engine operating schedule to be used for dynamometer service 
accumulation, consistent with good engineering practice. A single engine 
operating schedule shall be used for all engines in an engine family-
control system combination. Operating schedules may be different for 
different combinations.
    (3) Exhaust emission deterioration factors will be determined on the 
basis of the service accumulation described in Sec. 86.000-26(b)(2)(i) 
and related testing, according to the manufacturer's procedures.

    (c)(1) Paragraph (c) of this section applies to heavy-duty engines.
    (2) The applicable exhaust emission standards (or family emission 
limits, as appropriate) for Otto-cycle engines and for diesel-cycle 
engines apply to the emissions of engines for their useful life.
    (3) Since emission control efficiency generally decreases with the 
accumulation of service on the engine, deterioration factors will be 
used in combination with emission data engine test results as the basis 
for determining compliance with the standards.
    (4)(i) Paragraph (c)(4) of this section describes the procedure for 
determining compliance of an engine with emission standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate), based on deterioration factors 
supplied by the manufacturer. Deterioration factors shall be established 
using applicable emissions test procedures. NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC 
deterioration factors shall be established based on the sum of the 
pollutants. When establishing deterioration factors for NO<INF>X</INF> 
plus NMHC, a negative deterioration (emissions decrease from the 
official exhaust emissions test result) for one pollutant may not offset 
deterioration of the other pollutant. Where negative deterioration 
occurs for NO<INF>X</INF> and/or NMHC, the official exhaust emission 
test result shall be used for purposes of determining the NO<INF>X</INF> 
plus NMHC deterioration factor.
    (ii) Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors, determined 
from tests of engines, subsystems, or components conducted by the 
manufacturer, shall be supplied for each engine-system combination. For 
Otto-cycle engines, separate factors shall be established for transient 
NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, and idle CO, 
for those engines utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., catalytic 
converters). For diesel-cycle engines, separate factors shall be 
established for transient NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC and exhaust particulate. For diesel-cycle smoke 
testing, separate factors shall also be established for the acceleration 
mode (designated as ``A''), the lugging mode (designated as ``B''), and 
peak opacity (designated as ``C'').
    (iii)(A) Paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) (1) and (2) of this section apply 
to Otto-cycle HDEs.
    (1) Otto-cycle HDEs not utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., 
catalytic converters). For transient NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, 
the official exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at 
the selected test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the 
appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor 
supplied by the manufacturer is less than

[[Page 53]]

zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (2) Otto-cycle HDEs utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., 
catalytic converters). For transient NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, 
and for idle CO, the official exhaust emission results for each emission 
data engine at the selected test point shall be adjusted by 
multiplication by the appropriate deterioration factor, except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A)(3) of this section. The 
deterioration factor must be calculated by dividing the exhaust 
emissions at full useful life by the stabilized mileage emission level 
(reference Sec. 86.096-26(c)(4), e.g., 125 hours). However, if the 
deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than one, it 
shall be one for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A)(2).
    (3) An Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine manufacturer who believes that a 
deterioration factor derived using the calculation methodology described 
in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(4)(A)(2) of this section are significantly 
unrepresentative for one or more engine families (either too high or too 
low) may petition the Administrator to allow for the use of an additive 
rather than a multiplicative deterioration factor. This petition must 
include full rationale behind the request together with any supporting 
data or other evidence. Based on this or other information the 
Administration may allow for an alternative procedure. Any petition 
should be submitted in a timely manner, to allow adequate time for a 
thorough evaluation. Manufacturers using an additive deterioration 
factor under this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A)(3) must perform in-use 
verification testing to determine if the additive deterioration factor 
reasonably predicts actual in-use emissions. The plan for the in-use 
verification testing must be approved by the Administrator as part of 
the approval process described in this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(4)(A)(3) 
prior to the use of the additive deterioration factor. The Administrator 
may consider the results of the in-use verification testing both in 
certification and in-use compliance programs.
    (B) Paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section applies to diesel-cycle 
HDEs.
    (1) Diesel-cycle HDEs not utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., 
particulate traps). For transient NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, and exhaust particulate, the official exhaust 
emission results for each emission data engine at the selected test 
point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration 
factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the 
manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (2) Diesel-cycle HDEs utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., 
particulate traps). For transient NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC, and exhaust particulate, the official exhaust 
emission results for each emission data engine at the selected test 
point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate 
deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by 
the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (3) Diesel-cycle HDEs only. For acceleration smoke (``A''), lugging 
smoke (``B''), and peak smoke (``C''), the official exhaust emission 
results for each emission data engine at the selected test point shall 
be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. 
However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is 
less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (iv) The emission values to compare with the standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted emission values 
of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, rounded to the same number of 
significant figures as contained in the applicable standard in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-93a (as referenced in Sec. 86.094-28 
(a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii)), for each emission data engine.
    (5) and (6) [Reserved]
    (7) Every test engine of an engine family must comply with all 
applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), as 
determined in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, before any engine in 
that family will be certified.
    (8) For the purposes of setting an NMHC plus NO<INF>x</INF> 
certification level or FEL for a diesel-fueled engine family, the 
manufacturer may use one of the

[[Page 54]]

following options for the determination of NMHC for an engine family. 
The manufacturer must declare which option is used in its application 
for certification of that engine family.
    (i) THC may be used in lieu of NMHC for the standards set forth in 
Sec. 86.004-11.
    (ii) The manufacturer may choose its own method to analyze methane 
with prior approval of the Administrator.
    (iii) The manufacturer may assume that two percent of the measured 
THC is methane (NMHC =0.98  x  THC).
    (d)(1) Paragraph (d) of this section applies to heavy-duty vehicles 
equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled engines.
    (2) The applicable evaporative emission standards in this subpart 
apply to the emissions of vehicles for their useful life.
    (3)(i) For vehicles with a GVWR of up to 26,000 pounds, because it 
is expected that emission control efficiency will change during the 
useful life of the vehicle, an evaporative emission deterioration factor 
shall be determined from the testing described in Sec. 86.098-23(b)(3) 
for each evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combination to indicate the evaporative emission control system 
deterioration during the useful life of the vehicle (minimum 50,000 
miles). The factor shall be established to a minimum of two places to 
the right of the decimal.
    (ii) For vehicles with a GVWR of greater than 26,000 pounds, because 
it is expected that emission control efficiency will change during the 
useful life of the vehicle, each manufacturer's statement as required in 
Sec. 86.098-23(b)(4)(ii) shall include, in accordance with good 
engineering practice, consideration of control system deterioration.
    (4) The evaporative emission test results, if any, shall be adjusted 
by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor, provided that 
if the deterioration factor as computed in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section is less than zero, that deterioration factor shall be zero for 
the purposes of this paragraph.
    (5) The emission level to compare with the standard shall be the 
adjusted emission level of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Before any 
emission value is compared with the standard, it shall be rounded, in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-93a (as referenced in Sec. 86.094-28 
(a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii)), to two significant figures. The rounded emission 
values may not exceed the standard.
    (6) Every test vehicle of an evaporative emission family must comply 
with the evaporative emission standard, as determined in paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, before any vehicle in that family may be 
certified.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) through (g)(3) through [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.001-
28.
    (g)(4) Vehicles certified to the refueling emission standard under 
this provision shall not be counted in the sales percentage compliance 
determinations for the 2004, 2005 and subsequent model years.
    (h) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.001-28.
    (i) Emission results from heavy-duty engines equipped with exhaust 
aftertreatment may need to be adjusted to account for regeneration 
events. This provision only applies for engines equipped with emission 
controls that are regenerated on an infrequent basis. For the purpose of 
this paragraph (i), the term ``regeneration'' means an event during 
which emissions levels change while the aftertreatment performance is 
being restored by design. Examples of regenerations are increasing 
exhaust gas temperature to remove sulfur from an adsorber or increasing 
exhaust gas temperature to oxidize PM in a trap. For the purpose of this 
paragraph (i), the term ``infrequent'' means having an expected 
frequency of less than once per transient test cycle. Calculation and 
use of adjustment factors are described in paragraphs (i)(1) through 
(i)(5) of this section.
    (1) Development of adjustment factors. Manufacturers must develop 
separate pairs of adjustment factors (an upward adjustment factor and a 
downward adjustment factor) for each pollutant based on measured 
emission data and observed regeneration frequency. Adjustment factors 
may be carried-over to subsequent model years or carried-across to other 
engine families only where the Administrator determines that such carry-
over or carry-across is

[[Page 55]]

consistent with good engineering judgment. Adjustment factors should 
generally apply to an entire engine family, but manufacturers may 
develop separate adjustment factors for different engine configurations 
within an engine family. All adjustment factors for regeneration are 
additive.
    (2) Calculation of adjustment factors. The adjustment factors are 
calculated from the following parameters: the measured emissions from a 
test in which the regeneration occurs (EF<INF>H</INF>), the measured 
emissions from a test in which the regeneration does not occur 
(EF<INF>L</INF>), and the frequency of the regeneration event in terms 
of fraction of tests during which the regeneration occurs (F). The 
average emission rate (EF<INF>A</INF>) is calculated as:


EF<INF>A</INF> = (F)(EF<INF>H</INF>) + (1 - F)(EF<INF>L</INF>)

    (i) The upward adjustment factor (UAF) is calculated as: UAF = 
EF<INF>A</INF> - EF<INF>L</INF>.
    (ii) The downward adjustment factor (DAF) is calculated as: DAF = 
EF<INF>A</INF> - EF<INF>H</INF>.
    (3) Use of adjustment factors. Upward adjustment factors are added 
to measured emission rates for all tests in which the regeneration does 
not occur. Downward adjustment factors are added to measured emission 
rates for all tests in which the regeneration occurs. The occurrence of 
the regeneration must be identified in a manner that is readily apparent 
during all testing. Where no regeneration is identified, the upward 
adjustment factor shall be applied.
    (4) Sample calculation. If EF<INF>L</INF> is 0.10 g/bhp-hr, 
EF<INF>H</INF> is 0.50 g/bhp-hr, and F is 0.1 (i.e., the regeneration 
occurs once for each ten tests), then:

EF<INF>A</INF> = (0.1)(0.5 g/bhp-hr) + (1.0 - 0.1)(0.1 g/bhp-hr) = 0.14 
g/bhp-hr
UAF = 0.14 g/bhp-hr - 0.10 g/bhp-hr = 0.04 g/bhp-hr
DAF = 0.14 g/bhp-hr - 0.50 g/bhp-hr = -0.36 g/bhp-hr

    (5) Options. (i) A manufacturer may elect to omit adjustment factors 
for one or more of its engine families (or configurations) because the 
effect of the regeneration is small, or because it is not practical to 
identify when regenerations occur. In these cases, no upward or downward 
adjustment factor shall be added, and the manufacturer is liable for 
compliance with the emission standards for all tests, without regard to 
whether a regeneration occurs.
    (ii) Upon request by the manufacturer, the Administrator may account 
for regeneration events differently than is provided in this paragraph 
(i). However, this option only applies for events that occur extremely 
infrequently, and which cannot be practically addressed using the 
adjustment factors described in this paragraph (i).

    (f) For engine families required to have an OBD system, 
certification will not be granted if, for any test vehicle approved by 
the Administrator in consultation with the manufacturer, the malfunction 
indicator light does not illuminate under any of the following 
circumstances, unless the manufacturer can demonstrate that any 
identified OBD problems discovered during the Administrator's evaluation 
will be corrected on production vehicles.
    (1)(i) Otto-cycle. A catalyst is replaced with a deteriorated or 
defective catalyst, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in an 
increase of 1.5 times the NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> standard or FEL above the 
NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> emission level measured using a representative 4000 
mile catalyst system.
    (ii) Diesel. (A) If monitored for emissions performance--a catalyst 
is replaced with a deteriorated or defective catalyst, or an electronic 
simulation of such, resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times 
the applicable standard or FEL for NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> or PM.
    (B) If monitored for performance--a particulate trap is replaced 
with a trap that has catastrophically failed, or an electronic 
simulation of such.
    (2)(i) Otto-cycle. An engine misfire condition is induced resulting 
in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standards or FEL 
for NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> or CO.
    (ii) Diesel. An engine misfire condition is induced and is not 
detected.
    (3) If so equipped, any oxygen sensor is replaced with a 
deteriorated or defective oxygen sensor, or an electronic simulation of 
such, resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable 
standard or FEL for NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> or CO.
    (4) If so equipped, a vapor leak is introduced in the evaporative 
and/or refueling system (excluding the tubing and connections between 
the purge valve and the intake manifold) greater than or equal in 
magnitude to a leak caused by a 0.040 inch diameter orifice, or the 
evaporative purge air flow is blocked or otherwise eliminated from the 
complete evaporative emission control system.
    (5) A malfunction condition is induced in any emission-related 
engine system or component, including but not necessarily limited to, 
the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, if equipped, the secondary 
air system, if equipped, and the fuel control system, singularly 
resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable 
emission standard or FEL for NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>, CO or PM.
    (6) A malfunction condition is induced in an electronic emission-
related engine system or component not otherwise described above that 
either provides input to or receives commands from the on-board computer 
resulting in a measurable impact on emissions.

Sec. 86.004-38  Maintenance instructions.

    Section 86.004-38 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.094-38. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.094-38 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.004-38 this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.094-38.''.
    (a) The manufacturer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the 
purchaser of each new motor vehicle (or motor vehicle engine) subject to 
the standards prescribed in Sec. 86.099-8, Sec. 86.004-9, Sec. 86.004-
10, or Sec. 86.004-11, as applicable, written instructions for the 
proper maintenance and use of the vehicle (or engine), by the purchaser 
consistent with the provisions of Sec. 86.004-25, which establishes what 
scheduled maintenance the Administrator approves as being reasonable and 
necessary.
    (1) The maintenance instructions required by this section shall be 
in clear, and to the extent practicable, nontechnical language.
    (2) The maintenance instructions required by this section shall 
contain a general description of the documentation which the 
manufacturer will require from the ultimate purchaser or any subsequent 
purchaser as evidence of compliance with the instructions.
    (b) Instructions provided to purchasers under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall specify the performance of all scheduled maintenance 
performed by the manufacturer on certification durability vehicles and, 
in cases where

[[Page 59]]

the manufacturer performs less maintenance on certification durability 
vehicles than the allowed limit, may specify the performance of any 
scheduled maintenance allowed under Sec. 86.004-25.
    (c) Scheduled emission-related maintenance in addition to that 
performed under Sec. 86.004-25(b) may only be recommended to offset the 
effects of abnormal in-use operating conditions, except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section. The manufacturer shall be required to 
demonstrate, subject to the approval of the Administrator, that such 
maintenance is reasonable and technologically necessary to assure the 
proper functioning of the emission control system. Such additional 
recommended maintenance shall be clearly differentiated, in a form 
approved by the Administrator, from that approved under Sec. 86.004-
25(b).
    (d) Inspections of emission-related parts or systems with 
instructions to replace, repair, clean, or adjust the parts or systems 
if necessary, are not considered to be items of scheduled maintenance 
which insure the proper functioning of the emission control system. Such 
inspections, and any recommended maintenance beyond that approved by the 
Administrator as reasonable and necessary under paragraphs (a), (b), and 
(c) of this section, may be included in the written instructions 
furnished to vehicle owners under paragraph (a) of this section: 
Provided, That such instructions clearly state, in a form approved by 
the Administrator, that the owner need not perform such inspections or 
recommended maintenance in order to maintain the emissions defect and 
emissions performance warranty or manufacturer recall liability.
    (e) The manufacturer may choose to include in such instructions an 
explanation of any distinction between the useful life specified on the 
label, and the emissions defect and emissions performance warranty 
period. The explanation must clearly state that the useful life period 
specified on the label represents the average period of use up to 
retirement or rebuild for the engine family represented by the engine 
used in the vehicle. An explanation of how the actual useful lives of 
engines used in various applications are expected to differ from the 
average useful life may be included. The explanation(s) shall be in 
clear, non-technical language that is understandable to the ultimate 
purchaser.
    (f) If approved by the Administrator, the instructions provided to 
purchasers under paragraph (a) of this section shall indicate what 
adjustments or modifications, if any, are necessary to allow the vehicle 
to meet applicable emission standards at elevations above 4,000 feet, or 
at elevations of 4,000 feet or less.
    (g) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.094-38.
    (h) The manufacturer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the 
purchaser of each new motor engine subject to the standards prescribed 
in Sec. 86.004-10 or Sec. 86.004-11, as applicable, the following:
    (1) Instructions for all maintenance needed after the end of the 
useful life of the engine for critical emissions-related components as 
provided in Sec. 86.004-25(b), including recommended practices for 
diagnosis, cleaning, adjustment, repair, and replacement of the 
component (or a statement that such component is maintenance free for 
the life of the engine) and instructions for accessing and responding to 
any emissions-related diagnostic codes that may be stored in on-board 
monitoring systems;
    (2) A copy of the engine rebuild provisions contained in 
Sec. 86.004-40.

Sec. 86.004-40  Heavy-duty engine rebuilding practices.

    The provisions of this section are applicable to heavy-duty engines 
subject to model year 2004 or later standards and are applicable to the 
process of engine rebuilding (or rebuilding a portion of an engine or 
engine system). The process of engine rebuilding generally includes 
disassembly, replacement of multiple parts due to wear, and reassembly, 
and also may include the removal of the engine from the vehicle and 
other acts associated with rebuilding an engine. Any deviation from the 
provisions contained in this section is a prohibited act under section 
203(a)(3)

[[Page 60]]

of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(3)).
    (a) When rebuilding an engine, portions of an engine, or an engine 
system, there must be a reasonable technical basis for knowing that the 
resultant engine is equivalent, from an emissions standpoint, to a 
certified configuration (i.e., tolerances, calibrations, specifications) 
and the model year(s) of the resulting engine configuration must be 
identified. A reasonable basis would exist if:
    (1) Parts installed, whether the parts are new, used, or rebuilt, 
are such that a person familiar with the design and function of motor 
vehicle engines would reasonably believe that the parts perform the same 
function with respect to emissions control as the original parts; and
    (2) Any parameter adjustment or design element change is made only:
    (i) In accordance with the original engine manufacturer's 
instructions; or
    (ii) Where data or other reasonable technical basis exists that such 
parameter adjustment or design element change, when performed on the 
engine or similar engines, is not expected to adversely affect in-use 
emissions.
    (b) When an engine is being rebuilt and remains installed or is 
reinstalled in the same vehicle, it must be rebuilt to a configuration 
of the same or later model year as the original engine. When an engine 
is being replaced, the replacement engine must be an engine of (or 
rebuilt to) a configuration of the same or later model year as the 
original engine.
    (c) At time of rebuild, emissions-related codes or signals from on-
board monitoring systems may not be erased or reset without diagnosing 
and responding appropriately to the diagnostic codes, regardless of 
whether the systems are installed to satisfy requirements in 
Sec. 86.004-25 or for other reasons and regardless of form or interface. 
Diagnostic systems must be free of all such codes when the rebuilt 
engine is returned to service. Such signals may not be rendered 
inoperative during the rebuilding process.
    (d) When conducting a rebuild without removing the engine from the 
vehicle, or during the installation of a rebuilt engine, all critical 
emissions-related components listed in Sec. 86.004-25(b) not otherwise 
addressed by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section must be checked 
and cleaned, adjusted, repaired, or replaced as necessary, following 
manufacturer recommended practices.
    (e) Records shall be kept by parties conducting activities included 
in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. The records shall include 
at minimum the mileage and/or hours at time of rebuild, a listing of

the NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC (or NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHCE for methanol-
fueled engines) FELs may not exceed 4.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour 
(1.7 grams per megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits 
for the family are derived from averaging, banking, or trading programs.
    (ii)(A) Carbon monoxide for engines intended for use in all

forth in paragraph (f)(1) of appendix I to this part, and measured and 
calculated in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart N or P 
of this part.
    (3)(i) A manufacturer may certify one or more Otto-cycle HDE 
configurations intended for use in all vehicles to the emission standard 
set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section: Provided, that the 
total model year sales of such configuration(s), segregated by fuel 
type, being certified to the emission standard in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section represent no more than five percent of 
total model year sales of each fuel type Otto-cycle HDE intended for use 
in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 14,000 pounds by 
the manufacturer.
    (ii) The configurations certified to the emission standards of 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section under the provisions of 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall still be required to meet the 
evaporative emission standards set forth in Sec. 86.099-10(b)(1)(i), 
(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i).
    (4) The manufacturer may exempt 2005 model year HDE engine families 
whose model year begins before July, 31, 2004 from the requirements in 
this paragraph (a). Exempted engine families shall be subject to the 
requirements in Sec. 86.099-10.
    (b) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.099-10.

tested motor vehicle engines in accordance with applicable procedures in 
subpart N or P of this part to ascertain that such test engines meet the 
requirements of this section.
    (e) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.099-10.
    (f) Alternative exhaust emission standards. In lieu of the exhaust 
emission standards in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, the 
manufacturer may select the standards and provisions in either paragraph 
(f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section.
    (1) Otto-cycle HDE Option 1. The alternative exhaust emission 
standards in this paragraph (f)(1) shall apply to new 2003 through 2007 
model year Otto-cycle HDEs and, at the manufacturers option, to new 2003 
through 2006 model year Otto-cycle complete heavy-duty vehicles less 
than or equal to 14,000 pounds GVWR

<R05>
Sec. 86.005-17  On-board diagnostics.

    (a) General. (1) All heavy-duty engines intended for use in a heavy-
duty vehicle weighing 14,000 pounds GVWR or less must be equipped with 
an on-board diagnostic (OBD) system capable of monitoring all emission-
related engine systems or components during the applicable useful life. 
Heavy-duty engines intended for use in a heavy-duty vehicle weighing 
14,000 pounds GVWR or less must meet the OBD requirements of this 
section according to the phase-in schedule in paragraph (k) of this 
section. All monitored systems and components must be evaluated 
periodically, but no less frequently than once per applicable 
certification test cycle as defined in Appendix I, paragraph (f), of 
this part, or similar trip as approved by the Administrator.
    (2) An OBD system demonstrated to fully meet the requirements in 
Sec. 86.1806-05 may be used to meet the requirements of this section, 
provided that the Administrator finds that a manufacturer's decision to 
use the flexibility in this paragraph (a)(2) is based on good 
engineering judgement. (b) Malfunction descriptions. The OBD system must 
detect and identify malfunctions in all monitored emission-related 
engine systems or components according to the following malfunction 
definitions as measured and calculated in accordance with test 
procedures set forth in subpart N of this part (engine-based test 
procedures) excluding the test procedure referred to as the 
``Supplemental emission test; test cycle and procedures'' contained in 
Sec. 86.1360, and excluding the test procedure referred to as the ``Not-
To-Exceed Test Procedure'' contained in Sec. 86.1370, and excluding the 
test procedure referred to as the ``Load Response Test'' contained in 
Sec. 86.1380.
    (1) Catalysts and particulate traps. (i) Otto-cycle. Catalyst 
deterioration or malfunction before it results in an increase in NMHC 
(or NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC, as applicable) emissions 1.5 times the NMHC (or 
NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC, as applicable) standard or FEL, as compared to the 
NMHC (or NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC, as applicable) emission level measured 
using a representative 4000 mile catalyst system.
    (ii) Diesel. (A) If equipped, catalyst deterioration or malfunction 
before it results in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the 
applicable standard or FEL for NO<INF>X</INF> (or NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC, 
as applicable) or PM. This requirement applies only to reduction 
catalysts; monitoring of oxidation catalysts is not required. This 
monitoring need not be done if the manufacturer can demonstrate that 
deterioration or malfunction of the system will not result in exceedance 
of the threshold.
    (B) If equipped with a particulate trap, catastrophic failure of the 
device must be detected. Any particulate trap whose complete failure 
results in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard 
or FEL for NMHC (or NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC, as applicable) or PM must be 
monitored for such catastrophic failure. This monitoring need not be 
done if the manufacturer can demonstrate that a catastrophic failure of 
the system will not result in exceedance of the threshold.
    (2) Engine Misfire. (i) Otto-cycle. Engine misfire resulting in 
exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard or FEL for 
NMHC, NO<INF>X</INF> (or NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC, as applicable) or CO; and 
any misfire capable of damaging the catalytic converter.
    (ii) Diesel. Lack of cylinder combustion must be detected.
    (3) Oxygen sensors. If equipped, oxygen sensor deterioration or 
malfunction resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the 
applicable standard or FEL for NMHC, NO<INF>X</INF> (or 
NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC, as applicable) or CO.
    (4) Evaporative leaks. If equipped, any vapor leak in the 
evaporative and/or refueling system (excluding the tubing and 
connections between the purge valve and the intake manifold) greater 
than or equal in magnitude to a leak caused by a 0.040 inch diameter 
orifice; an absence of evaporative purge air

[[Page 65]]

flow from the complete evaporative emission control system. Where fuel 
tank capacity is greater than 25 gallons, the Administrator may, 
following a request from the manufacturer, revise the size of the 
orifice to the smallest orifice feasible, based on test data, if the 
most reliable monitoring method available cannot reliably detect a 
system leak equal to a 0.040 inch diameter orifice.
    (5) Other emission control systems. Any deterioration or malfunction 
occurring in an engine system or component directly intended to control 
emissions, including but not necessarily limited to, the exhaust gas 
recirculation (EGR) system, if equipped, the secondary air system, if 
equipped, and the fuel control system, singularly resulting in exhaust 
emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable emission standard or FEL 
for NMHC, NO<INF>X</INF> (or NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC, as applicable), CO or 
diesel PM. For engines equipped with a secondary air system, a 
functional check, as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, may 
satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) provided the 
manufacturer can demonstrate that deterioration of the flow distribution 
system is unlikely. This demonstration is subject to Administrator 
approval and, if the demonstration and associated functional check are 
approved, the diagnostic system must indicate a malfunction when some 
degree of secondary airflow is not detectable in the exhaust system 
during the check. For engines equipped with positive crankcase 
ventilation (PCV), monitoring of the PCV system is not necessary 
provided the manufacturer can demonstrate to the Administrator's 
satisfaction that the PCV system is unlikely to fail.
    (6) Other emission-related engine components. Any other 
deterioration or malfunction occurring in an electronic emission-related 
engine system or component not otherwise described above that either 
provides input to or receives commands from the on-board computer and 
has a measurable impact on emissions; monitoring of components required 
by this paragraph (b)(6) must be satisfied by employing electrical 
circuit continuity checks and rationality checks for computer input 
components (input values within manufacturer specified ranges based on 
other available operating parameters), and functionality checks for 
computer output components (proper functional response to computer 
commands) except that the Administrator may waive such a rationality or 
functionality check where the manufacturer has demonstrated 
infeasibility. Malfunctions are defined as a failure of the system or 
component to meet the electrical circuit continuity checks or the 
rationality or functionality checks.
    (7) Performance of OBD functions. Oxygen sensor or any other 
component deterioration or malfunction which renders that sensor or 
component incapable of performing its function as part of the OBD system 
must be detected and identified on vehicles so equipped.
    (c) Malfunction indicator light (MIL). The OBD system must 
incorporate a malfunction indicator light (MIL) readily visible to the 
vehicle operator. When illuminated, the MIL must display ``Check 
Engine,'' ``Service Engine Soon,'' a universally recognizable engine 
symbol, or a similar phrase or symbol approved by the Administrator. 
More than one general purpose malfunction indicator light for emission-
related problems should not be used; separate specific purpose warning 
lights (e.g., brake system, fasten seat belt, oil pressure, etc.) are 
permitted. The use of red for the OBD-related malfunction indicator 
light is prohibited.
    (d) MIL illumination. The MIL must illuminate and remain illuminated 
when any of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section 
are detected and verified, or whenever the engine control enters a 
default or secondary mode of operation considered abnormal for the given 
engine operating conditions. The MIL must blink once per second under 
any period of operation during which engine misfire is occurring and 
catalyst damage is imminent. If such misfire is detected again during 
the following driving cycle (i.e., operation consisting of, at a 
minimum, engine start-up and engine shut-off) or the next driving cycle 
in which similar conditions are encountered, the MIL must maintain a 
steady illumination when the misfire is not occurring and then remain 
illuminated until the MIL extinguishing criteria of

[[Page 66]]

this section are satisfied. The MIL must also illuminate when the 
vehicle's ignition is in the ``key-on'' position before engine starting 
or cranking and extinguish after engine starting if no malfunction has 
previously been detected. If a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction 
has previously been detected, the MIL may be extinguished if the 
malfunction does not reoccur during three subsequent sequential trips 
during which similar conditions are encountered and no new malfunctions 
have been detected. Similar conditions are defined as engine speed 
within 375 rpm, engine load within 20 percent, and engine warm-up status 
equivalent to that under which the malfunction was first detected. If 
any malfunction other than a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction 
has been detected, the MIL may be extinguished if the malfunction does 
not reoccur during three subsequent sequential trips during which the 
monitoring system responsible for illuminating the MIL functions without 
detecting the malfunction, and no new malfunctions have been detected. 
Upon Administrator approval, statistical MIL illumination protocols may 
be employed, provided they result in comparable timeliness in detecting 
a malfunction and evaluating system performance, i.e., three to six 
driving cycles would be considered acceptable.
    (e) Storing of computer codes. The OBD system shall record and store 
in computer memory diagnostic trouble codes and diagnostic readiness 
codes indicating the status of the emission control system. These codes 
shall be available through the standardized data link connector per 
specifications as referenced in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (1) A diagnostic trouble code must be stored for any detected and 
verified malfunction causing MIL illumination. The stored diagnostic 
trouble code must identify the malfunctioning system or component as 
uniquely as possible. At the manufacturer's discretion, a diagnostic 
trouble code may be stored for conditions not causing MIL illumination. 
Regardless, a separate code should be stored indicating the expected MIL 
illumination status (i.e., MIL commanded ``ON,'' MIL commanded ``OFF'').
    (2) For a single misfiring cylinder, the diagnostic trouble code(s) 
must uniquely identify the cylinder, unless the manufacturer submits 
data and/or engineering evaluations which adequately demonstrate that 
the misfiring cylinder cannot be reliably identified under certain 
operating conditions. For diesel engines only, the specific cylinder for 
which combustion cannot be detected need not be identified if new 
hardware would be required to do so. The diagnostic trouble code must 
identify multiple misfiring cylinder conditions; under multiple misfire 
conditions, the misfiring cylinders need not be uniquely identified if a 
distinct multiple misfire diagnostic trouble code is stored.
    (3) The diagnostic system may erase a diagnostic trouble code if the 
same code is not re-registered in at least 40 engine warm-up cycles, and 
the malfunction indicator light is not illuminated for that code.
    (4) Separate status codes, or readiness codes, must be stored in 
computer memory to identify correctly functioning emission control 
systems and those emission control systems which require further engine 
operation to complete proper diagnostic evaluation. A readiness code 
need not be stored for those monitors that can be considered 
continuously operating monitors (e.g., misfire monitor, fuel system 
monitor, etc.). Readiness codes should never be set to ``not ready'' 
status upon key-on or key-off; intentional setting of readiness codes to 
``not ready'' status via service procedures must apply to all such 
codes, rather than applying to individual codes. Subject to 
Administrator approval, if monitoring is disabled for a multiple number 
of driving cycles (i.e., more than one) due to the continued presence of 
extreme operating conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures below 40 
deg.F, or altitudes above 8000 feet), readiness for the subject 
monitoring system may be set to ``ready'' status without monitoring 
having been completed. Administrator approval shall be based on the 
conditions for monitoring system disablement, and the number of driving 
cycles

[[Page 67]]

specified without completion of monitoring before readiness is 
indicated.
    (f) Available diagnostic data. (1) Upon determination of the first 
malfunction of any component or system, ``freeze frame'' engine 
conditions present at the time must be stored in computer memory. Should 
a subsequent fuel system or misfire malfunction occur, any previously 
stored freeze frame conditions must be replaced by the fuel system or 
misfire conditions (whichever occurs first). Stored engine conditions 
must include, but are not limited to: engine speed, open or closed loop 
operation, fuel system commands, coolant temperature, calculated load 
value, fuel pressure, vehicle speed, air flow rate, and intake manifold 
pressure if the information needed to determine these conditions is 
available to the computer. For freeze frame storage, the manufacturer 
must include the most appropriate set of conditions to facilitate 
effective repairs. If the diagnostic trouble code causing the conditions 
to be stored is erased in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, 
the stored engine conditions may also be erased.
    (2) The following data in addition to the required freeze frame 
information must be made available on demand through the serial port on 
the standardized data link connector, if the information is available to 
the on-board computer or can be determined using information available 
to the on-board computer: Diagnostic trouble codes, engine coolant 
temperature, fuel control system status (closed loop, open loop, other), 
fuel trim, ignition timing advance, intake air temperature, manifold air 
pressure, air flow rate, engine RPM, throttle position sensor output 
value, secondary air status (upstream, downstream, or atmosphere), 
calculated load value, vehicle speed, and fuel pressure. The signals 
must be provided in standard units based on SAE specifications 
incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section. Actual 
signals must be clearly identified separately from default value or limp 
home signals.
    (3) For all OBD systems for which specific on-board evaluation tests 
are conducted (catalyst, oxygen sensor, etc.), the results of the most 
recent test performed by the vehicle, and the limits to which the system 
is compared must be available through the standardized data link 
connector per the appropriate standardized specifications as referenced 
in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (4) Access to the data required to be made available under this 
section shall be unrestricted and shall not require any access codes or 
devices that are only available from the manufacturer.
    (g) Exceptions. The OBD system is not required to evaluate systems 
or components during malfunction conditions if such evaluation would 
result in a risk to safety or failure of systems or components. 
Additionally, the OBD system is not required to evaluate systems or 
components during operation of a power take-off unit such as a dump bed, 
snow plow blade, or aerial bucket, etc.
    (h) Reference materials. The OBD system shall provide for 
standardized access and conform with the following Society of Automotive 
Engineers (SAE) standards and/or the following International Standards 
Organization (ISO) standards. The following documents are incorporated 
by reference (see Sec. 86.1):
    (1) SAE material. Copies of these materials may be obtained from the 
Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., 400 Commonwealth Drive, 
Warrendale, PA 15096-0001.
    (i) SAE J1850 ``Class B Data Communication Network Interface,'' 
(July 1995) shall be used as the on-board to off-board communications 
protocol. All emission related messages sent to the scan tool over a 
J1850 data link shall use the Cyclic Redundancy Check and the three byte 
header, and shall not use inter-byte separation or checksums.
    (ii) Basic diagnostic data (as specified in Secs. 86.094-17(e) and 
(f)) shall be provided in the format and units in SAE J1979 ``E/E 
Diagnostic Test Modes,'' (July 1996).
    (iii) Diagnostic trouble codes shall be consistent with SAE J2012 
``Recommended Practices for Diagnostic Trouble Code Definitions,'' (July 
1996).
    (iv) The connection interface between the OBD system and test 
equipment and diagnostic tools shall meet

[[Page 68]]

the functional requirements of SAE J1962 ``Diagnostic Connector,'' 
(January 1995).
    (v) As an alternative to the above standards, heavy-duty engines may 
conform to the specifications of the SAE J1939 series of standards (SAE 
J1939-11, J1939-13, J1939-21, J1939-31, J1939-71, J1939-73, J1939-81).
    (2) ISO materials. Copies of these materials may be obtained from 
the International Organization for Standardization, Case Postale 56, CH-
1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland.
    (i) ISO 9141-2 ``Road vehicles--Diagnostic systems--Part 2: CARB 
requirements for interchange of digital information,'' (February 1994) 
may be used as an alternative to SAE J1850 as the on-board to off-board 
communications protocol.
    (ii) ISO 14230-4 ``Road vehicles--Diagnostic systems--Keyword 
Protocol 2000--Part 4: Requirements for emission-related systems'' may 
also be used as an alternative to SAE J1850.
    (i) Deficiencies and alternate fueled engines. Upon application by 
the manufacturer, the Administrator may accept an OBD system as 
compliant even though specific requirements are not fully met. Such 
compliances without meeting specific requirements, or deficiencies, will 
be granted only if compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable 
considering such factors as, but not limited to: technical feasibility 
of the given monitor and lead time and production cycles including 
phase-in or phase-out of engines or vehicle designs and programmed 
upgrades of computers. Unmet requirements should not be carried over 
from the previous model year except where unreasonable hardware or 
software modifications would be necessary to correct the deficiency, and 
the manufacturer has demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward 
compliance as determined by the Administrator. Furthermore, EPA will not 
accept any deficiency requests that include the complete lack of a major 
diagnostic monitor (``major'' diagnostic monitors being those for 
exhaust aftertreatment devices, oxygen sensor, engine misfire, 
evaporative leaks, and diesel EGR, if equipped), with the possible 
exception of the special provisions for alternate fueled engines. For 
alternate fueled heavy-duty engines (e.g. natural gas, liquefied 
petroleum gas, methanol, ethanol), beginning with the model year for 
which alternate fuel emission standards are applicable and extending 
through the 2006 model year, manufacturers may request the Administrator 
to waive specific monitoring requirements of this section for which 
monitoring may not be reliable with respect to the use of the alternate 
fuel. At a minimum, alternate fuel engines must be equipped with an OBD 
system meeting OBD requirements to the extent feasible as approved by 
the Administrator.
    (j) California OBD II compliance option. For heavy-duty engines at 
or below 14,000 pounds GVWR, demonstration of compliance with California 
OBD II requirements (Title 13 California Code section 1968.1), as 
modified pursuant to California Mail Out 97-24 (December 9, 1997), 
shall satisfy the requirements of this section, except that the 
exemption to the catalyst monitoring provisions of California Code 
section 1968.1(b)(1.1.2) for diesel engines does not apply, and 
compliance with California Code sections 1968.1(b)(4.2.2), pertaining to 
0.02 inch evaporative leak detection, and 1968.1(d), pertaining to 
tampering protection, are not required to satisfy the requirements of 
this section. Also, the deficiency fine provisions of California Code 
sections 1968.1(m)(6.1) and (6.2) do not apply.
    (k) Phase-in for heavy-duty engines. Manufacturers of heavy-duty 
engines must comply with the OBD requirements in this section according 
to the following phase-in schedule, based on the percentage of projected 
engine sales within each category. The 2004 model year requirements in 
the following phase-in schedule are applicable only to heavy-duty Otto-
cycle engines where the manufacturer has selected Otto-cycle Option 1 or 
Option 2 for alternative 2004 compliance according to Sec. 86.005-
01(c)(1) or (2). The 2005 through 2007 requirements in the following 
phase-in schedule apply to all heavy-duty engines intended for use in a 
heavy-duty vehicle weighing 14,000 pounds GVWR or less. Manufacturers 
may exempt 2005 model year diesel heavy-duty engines from the 
requirements of this section if the 2005 model

[[Page 69]]

year commences before July 31, 2004 from the requirements of this 
section. Manufacturers may exempt 2005 model year Otto-cycle heavy-duty 
engines and vehicles from the requirements of this section if the 
manufacturer has selected Otto-cycle Option 3 and if the 2005 model year 
commences before July 31, 2004. For the purposes of calculating 
compliance with the phase-in provisions of this paragraph (k), heavy-
duty engines may be combined with heavy-duty vehicles subject to the 
phase-in requirements of paragraph Sec. 86.1806-05(l). The OBD 
Compliance phase-in table follows:

<R05>
Sec. 86.007-11  Emission standards and supplemental requirements for 2007 and later model year diesel heavy-duty engines and vehicles.

    This section applies to new 2007 and later model year diesel HDEs. 
Section 86.007-11 includes text that specifies requirements that differ 
from Sec. 86.004-11. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.004-11 is identical 
and applicable to Sec. 86.007-11, this may be indicated by specifying 
the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance 
see Sec. 86.004-11.''.
    (a)(1) Exhaust emissions from new 2007 and later model year diesel 
HDEs shall not exceed the following:
    (i) Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>). (A) 0.20 grams per brake 
horsepower-hour (0.075 grams per megajoule).
    (B) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its diesel HDE 
families in any or all of the NO<INF>X</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> plus 
NMHC emissions ABT programs for HDEs, within the restrictions described 
in Sec. 86.007-15 or Sec. 86.004-15. If the manufacturer elects to 
include engine families in any of these programs, the NO<INF>X</INF> 
FELs may not exceed the following FEL caps: 2.00 grams per brake 
horsepower-hour (0.75 grams per megajoule) for model years before 2010; 
0.50 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.19 grams per megajoule) for 
model years 2010 and later. This ceiling value applies whether credits 
for the family are derived from averaging, banking, or trading programs.
    (ii)(A) Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC) for engines fueled with 
either diesel fuel, natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas. 0.14 grams 
per brake horsepower-hour (0.052 grams per megajoule).
    (B) Non-Methane Hydrocarbon Equivalent (NMHCE) for engines fueled 
with methanol. 0.14 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.052 grams per 
megajoule).
    (iii) Carbon monoxide. (A) 15.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour 
(5.77 grams per megajoule).
    (B) 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle (methanol-, 
natural gas-, and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel HDEs only). This 
does not apply for vehicles certified to the requirements of 
Sec. 86.005-17
    (iv) Particulate. (A) 0.01 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.0037 
grams per megajoule).
    (B) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its diesel HDE 
families in any or all of the particulate ABT programs for HDEs, within 
the restrictions described in Sec. 86.007-15 or

[[Page 70]]

other applicable sections. If the manufacturer elects to include engine 
families in any of these programs, the particulate FEL may not exceed 
0.02 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.0075 grams per megajoule).
    (2) The standards set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
refer to the exhaust emitted over the operating schedule set forth in 
paragraph (f)(2) of appendix I to this part, and measured and calculated 
in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart N or P of this 
part, except as noted in Sec. 86.007-23(c)(2).
    (3) SET (i) The weighted average exhaust emissions, as determined 
under Sec. 86.1360-2007(e)(5) pertaining to the supplemental emission 
test cycle, for each regulated pollutant shall not exceed 1.0 times the 
applicable emission standards or FELs specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section.
    (ii) For engines not having a NO<INF>X</INF> FEL less than1.5 g/bhp-
hr, gaseous exhaust emissions shall not exceed the steady-state 
interpolated values determined by the Maximum Allowable Emission Limits 
(for the corresponding speed and load), as determined under 
Sec. 86.1360-2007(f), when the engine is operated in the steady-state 
control area defined under Sec. 86.1360-2007(d).
    (4) NTE (i)(A) The brake-specific exhaust NMHC or NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions in g/bhp-hr, as determined under Sec. 86.1370-2007 pertaining 
to the not-to-exceed test procedures, shall not exceed 1.5 times the 
applicable NMHC or NO<INF>X</INF> emission standards or FELs specified 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, during engine and vehicle operation 
specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section except as noted in 
paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (B) For engines not having a NO<INF>X</INF> FEL less than1.50 g/bhp-
hr, the brake-specific NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC exhaust emissions in g/
bhp-hr, as determined under Sec. 86.1370-2007 pertaining to the not-to-
exceed test procedures, shall not exceed 1.25 times the applicable 
emission standards or FELs specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
(or of Sec. 86.004-11, as allowed by paragraph (g) of this section), 
during engine and vehicle operation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of 
this section except as noted in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (C) The brake-specific exhaust PM emissions in g/bhp-hr, as 
determined under Sec. 86.1370-2007 pertaining to the not-to-exceed test 
procedures, shall not exceed 1.5 times the applicable PM emission 
standards or FEL (for FELs above the standard only) specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, during engine and vehicle operation 
specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section except as noted in 
paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (D) The brake-specific exhaust CO emissions in g/bhp-hr, as 
determined under Sec. 86.1370-2007 pertaining to the not-to-exceed test 
procedures, shall not exceed 1.25 times the applicable CO emission 
standards or FEL specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, during 
engine and vehicle operation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this 
section except as noted in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) For each engine family, the not-to-exceed emission limits must 
apply during one of the following two ambient operating regions:
    (A) The not-to-exceed limits apply for all altitudes less than or 
equal to 5,500 feet above sea-level, during all ambient conditions 
(temperature and humidity). Temperature and humidity ranges for which 
correction factors are allowed are specified in Sec. 86.1370-2007(e); or
    (B)(1) The not-to-exceed emission limits apply at all altitudes less 
than or equal to 5,500 feet above sea-level, for temperatures less than 
or equal to the temperature determined by the following equation at the 
specified altitude:

T = -0.00254  x  A + 100

Where:

T = ambient air temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
A = altitude in feet above sea-level (A is negative for altitudes below 
sea-level).

    (2) Temperature and humidity ranges for which correction factors are 
allowed are specified in Sec. 86.1370-2007(e);
    (iii) For engines equipped with exhaust gas recirculation, the not-
to-exceed emission limits specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this 
section do not apply to engine or vehicle operation during cold 
operating conditions as specified in Sec. 86.1370-2007(f).

[[Page 71]]

    (iv) Deficiencies for NTE emission standards. (A) For model years 
2007 through 2009, upon application by the manufacturer, the 
Administrator may accept a HDDE as compliant with the NTE standards even 
though specific requirements are not fully met. Such compliances without 
meeting specific requirements, or deficiencies, will be granted only if 
compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable considering such factors 
as, but not limited to: Technical feasibility of the given hardware and 
lead time and production cycles including phase-in or phase-out of 
engines or vehicle designs and programmed upgrades of computers. 
Deficiencies will be approved on a engine model and/or horsepower rating 
basis within an engine family, and each approval is applicable for a 
single model year. A manufacturer's application must include a 
description of the auxiliary emission control device(s) which will be 
used to maintain emissions to the lowest practical level, considering 
the deficiency being requested, if applicable. An application for a 
deficiency must be made during the certification process; no deficiency 
will be granted to retroactively cover engines already certified.
    (B) Unmet requirements should not be carried over from the previous 
model year except where unreasonable hardware or software modifications 
would be necessary to correct the deficiency, and the manufacturer has 
demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward compliance as 
determined by the Administrator. The NTE deficiency should only be seen 
as an allowance for minor deviations from the NTE requirements. The NTE 
deficiency provisions allow a manufacturer to apply for relief from the 
NTE emission requirements under limited conditions. EPA expects that 
manufacturers should have the necessary functioning emission control 
hardware in place to comply with the NTE.
    (C) For model years 2010 through 2013, the Administrator may allow 
up to three deficiencies per engine family. The provisions of paragraphs 
(a)(4)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section apply for deficiencies allowed by 
this paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(C). In determining whether to allow the 
additional deficiencies, the Administrator may consider any relevant 
factors, including the factors identified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(A) of 
this section. If additional deficiencies are approved, the Administrator 
may set any additional conditions that he/she determines to be 
appropriate.
    (v) The emission limits specified in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of 
this section shall be rounded to the same number of significant figures 
as the applicable standards in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using 
ASTM E29-93a (Incorporated by reference at Sec. 86.1).
    (b)(1) introductory text through (b)(1)(iii) [Reserved]. For 
guidance see Sec. 86.004-11.
    (b)(1)(iv) Operation within the NTE zone (defined in Sec. 86.1370-
2007) must comply with a filter smoke number of 1.0 under steady-state 
operation, or the following alternate opacity limits:
    (A) A 30 second transient test average opacity limit of 4% for a 5 
inch path; and
    (B) A 10 second steady state test average opacity limit of 4% for a 
5 inch path.
    (2)(i) The standards set forth in Sec. 86.004-11 (b)(1)(i) through 
(iii) refer to exhaust smoke emissions generated under the conditions 
set forth in subpart I of this part and measured and calculated in 
accordance with those procedures.
    (ii) The standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section 
refer to exhaust smoke emissions generated under the conditions set 
forth in Sec. 86.1370-2007 and calculated in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 86.1372-2007.
    (b)(3) and (b)(4) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.004-11.
    (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged directly into the 
ambient atmosphere from any new 2007 or later model year diesel HDE, 
with the following exception: HDEs equipped with turbochargers, pumps, 
blowers, or superchargers for air induction may discharge crankcase 
emissions to the ambient atmosphere if the emissions are added to the 
exhaust emissions (either physically or mathematically) during all 
emission testing. Manufacturers taking advantage of this exception must 
manufacture the engines so that

[[Page 72]]

all crankcase emission can be routed into a dilution tunnel (or other 
sampling system approved in advance by the Administrator), and must 
account for deterioration in crankcase emissions when determining 
exhaust deterioration factors. For the purpose of this paragraph (c), 
crankcase emissions that are routed to the exhaust upstream of exhaust 
aftertreatment during all operation are not considered to be 
``discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere.''
    (d) Every manufacturer of new motor vehicle engines subject to the 
standards prescribed in this section shall, prior to taking any of the 
actions specified in section 203(a)(1) of the Act, test or cause to be 
tested motor vehicle engines in accordance with applicable procedures in 
subpart I or N of this part to ascertain that such test engines meet the 
requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
    (e) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.004-11.
    (f) (1) Model year 2007 and later diesel-fueled heavy-duty engines 
and vehicles for sale in Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands shall be subject to the same standards and 
requirements as apply to 2006 model year diesel heavy-duty engines and 
vehicles, but only if the vehicle or engine bears a permanently affixed 
label stating:

    THIS ENGINE (or VEHICLE, as applicable) CONFORMS TO US EPA EMISSION 
STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO MODEL YEAR 2006. THIS ENGINE (or VEHICLE, as 
applicable) DOES NOT CONFORM TO US EPA EMISSION REQUIREMENTS IN EFFECT 
AT TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MAY NOT BE IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES OR 
ANY TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT GUAM, AMERICAN SAMOA, OR THE 
COMMONWEALTH OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS.

    (2) The importation or sale of such a vehicle or engine for use at 
any location U.S. other than Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be considered a violation of 
section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. In addition, vehicles or vehicle 
engines subject to this exemption may not subsequently be imported or 
sold into any state or territory of the United States other than Guam, 
American Samoa, or Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
    (g) Phase-in options. (1) For model years 2007, 2008, and 2009, 
manufacturers may certify some of their engine families to the combined 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC standard applicable to model year 2006 engines 
under Sec. 86.004-11, in lieu of the separate NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC 
standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. These engines 
must comply with all other requirements applicable to model year 2007 
engines. The combined number of engines in the engine families certified 
to the 2006 combined NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC standard may not exceed 50 
percent of the manufacturer's U.S.-directed production of heavy-duty 
diesel motor vehicle engines for model year 2007, 2008, or 2009, except 
as explicitly allowed by this paragraph (g).
    (2)(i) Manufacturers certifying engines to all of the applicable 
standards listed in paragraph (a) and (c) of this section (without using 
credits) prior to model year 2007 may reduce the number of engines that 
are required to meet the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section in model year 2007, 2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the 
phase-in option provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. For every 
two engines that are certified early, the manufacturer may reduce the 
number of engines that are required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
to meet standards listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by three 
engines. For example, if a manufacturer produces 100 heavy-duty diesel 
engines in 2006 that meet all of the applicable standards listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, and it produced 10,000 heavy-duty diesel 
engines in 2007, then only 4,850 ((10,000)(0.50) - (100)(1.5)) of the 
engines would need to comply with the standards listed in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (ii) Manufacturers certifying engines to the PM standards listed in 
paragraph (a), and to all of the applicable standards in paragraph (c) 
of this section (without using credits) prior to model year 2007 may 
reduce the number of engines that are required to meet the PM standard 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section in model year

[[Page 73]]

2007, 2008 and/or 2009. For every two engines that are certified to the 
PM standard early, the manufacturer may reduce the number of engines 
that are otherwise required to meet the PM standard listed in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section by three engines.
    (3) Manufacturers may initially base compliance with the phase-in 
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section on projected 
U.S.-directed production estimates. This is allowed for model year 2007 
and/or 2008. However, if a manufacturer's actual U.S. directed 
production volume of engines that comply with the model year 2007 
NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC standards is less than the required amount, the 
shortfall (in terms of number of engines) must be made up prior to 2010. 
For example, if a manufacturer plans in good faith to produce 50 percent 
of its projected 10,000 2007 engines (i.e., 5,000 engines) in compliance 
with the 2007 NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC standard, but is only able to 
produce 4,500 such engines of an actual 10,000 2007 engines, the 
manufacturer would need to produce an extra 500 engines in 2008 or 2009 
in compliance with the 2007 NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC standard. The 
deficit allowed by this paragraph (g)(3) may not exceed 25 percent of 
the U.S. directed production volume.
    (4) Manufacturers certifying engines to a voluntary NO<INF>X</INF> 
standard of 0.10 g/bhp-hr (without using credits) in addition to all of 
the other applicable standards listed in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
section prior to model year 2007 may reduce the number of engines that

Sec. 86.007-15  NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines.

    Section 86.007-15 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.004-15. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.004-15 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.007-15, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.004-15.''
    (a) through (l) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.004-15.
    (m) The following provisions apply for model year 2007 and later 
engines (including engines certified during years 2007-2009 under the 
phase-in provisions of Sec. 86.007-11(g)(1), Sec. 86.005-10(a), or 
Sec. 86.008-10(f)(1)). These provisions apply instead of the provisions 
of paragraphs Sec. 86.004-15 (a) through (k) to the extent that they are 
in conflict.
    (1) Manufacturers of Otto-cycle engines may participate in an NMHC 
averaging, banking and trading program to show compliance with the 
standards specified in Sec. 86.008-10. The generation and use of NMHC 
credits are subject to the same provisions in paragraphs Sec. 86.004-15 
(a) through (k) that apply for NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC credits,

[[Page 74]]

except as otherwise specified in this section.
    (2) Credits are calculated as NO<INF>X</INF> or NMHC credits for 
engines certified to separate NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC standards. 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC credits (including banked credits and credits 
that are generated during years 2007-2009 under the phase-in provisions 
of Sec. 86.007-11(g)(1), Sec. 86.005-10(a), or Sec. 86.008-10(f)(1)) may 
be used to show compliance with 2007 or later NO<INF>X</INF> standards ( 
NO<INF>X</INF> or NMHC standards for Otto-cycle engines), subject to an 
0.8 discount factor (e.g., 100 grams of NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC credits 
is equivalent to 80 grams of NO<INF>X</INF> credits).
    (3) NO<INF>X</INF> or NMHC (or NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC) credits may 
be exchanged between heavy-duty Otto-cycle engine families certified to 
the engine standards of this subpart and heavy-duty Otto-cycle engine 
families certified to the chassis standards of subpart S of this part, 
subject to an 0.8 discount factor (e.g., 100 grams of NO<INF>X</INF> (or 
NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC) credits generated from engines would be 
equivalent to 80 grams of NO<INF>X</INF> credits if they are used in the 
vehicle program of subpart S, and vice versa).
    (4) Credits that were previously discounted when they were banked 
according to paragraph (c) of Sec. 86.004-15, are subject to an 
additional discount factor of 0.888 instead of the 0.8 discount factor 
otherwise required by paragraph (m)(2) or (m)(3) of this section. This 
results in a total discount factor of 0.8 (0.9  x  0.888 = 0.8).
    (5) For diesel engine families, the combined number of engines 
certified to FELs higher than 0.50 g/bhp-hr using banked NO<INF>X</INF> 
(and/or NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC) credits in any given model year may 
not exceed 10 percent of the manufacturer's U.S.-directed production of 
engines in all heavy-duty diesel engine families for that model year.
    (6) The FEL must be expressed to the same number of decimal places 
as the standard (generally, one-hundredth of a gram per brake 
horsepower-hour). For engines certified to standards expressed only one-
tenth of a gram per brake horsepower-hour, if the FEL is below 1.0, then 
add a zero to the standard in the second decimal place and express the 
FEL to nearest one-hundredth of a gram per brake horsepower-hour.
    (7) Credits are to be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a 
Megagram using ASTM E29-93a (Incorporated by reference at Sec. 86.1).
    (8) Credits generated for 2007 and later model year diesel engine 
families, or generated for 2008 and later model year Otto-cycle engine 
families are not discounted (except as specified in paragraph (m)(2) or 
(m)(3) of this section), and do not expire.
    (9) For the purpose of using or generating credits during a phase-in 
of new standards, a manufacturer may elect to split an engine family 
into two subfamilies (e.g., one which uses credits and one which 
generates credits). The manufacturer must indicate in the application 
for certification that the engine family is to be split, and may assign 
the numbers and configurations of engines within the respective 
subfamilies at any time prior to the submission of the end-of-year 
report required by Sec. 86.001-23.
    (i) Manufacturers certifying a split diesel engine family to both 
the Phase 1 and Phase 2 standards with equally sized subfamilies may 
exclude the engines within that split family from end-of-year 
NO<INF>X</INF> (or NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC) ABT calculations, provided that 
neither subfamily generates credits for use by other engine families, or 
uses banked credits, or uses averaging credits from other engine 
families. All of the engines in that split family must be excluded from 
the phase-in calculations of Sec. 86.007-11(g)(1) (both from the number 
of engines complying with the standards being phased-in and from the 
total number of U.S.-directed production engines.)
    (ii) Manufacturers certifying a split Otto-cycle engine family to 
both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 standards with equally sized subfamilies 
may exclude the engines within that split family from end-of-year 
NO<INF>X</INF> (or NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC) ABT calculations, provided that 
neither subfamily generates credits for use by other engine families, or 
uses banked credits, or uses averaging credits from other engine 
families. All of the engines in that split family must be excluded from 
the phase-in calculations of Sec. 86.008-10(f)(1) (both from the

[[Page 75]]

number of engines complying with the standards being phased-in and from 
the total number of U.S.-directed production engines.)
    (iii) Manufacturers certifying a split engine family may label all 
of the engines within that family with a single NO<INF>X</INF> or 
NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC FEL. The FEL on the label will apply for all SEA or 
other compliance testing.
    (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (m)(9)(iii) of this 
section, for split families, the NO<INF>X</INF> FEL shall be used to 
determine applicability of the provisions of Sec. 86.007-11(a)(3)(ii), 
(a)(4)(i)(B), and (h)(1), and Sec. 86.008-10(g).
    (10) For model years 2007 through 2009, to be consistent with the 
phase-in provisions of Sec. 86.007-11(g)(1), credits generated from 
engines in one diesel engine service class (e.g., light-heavy duty 
diesel engines) may be used for averaging by engines in a different 
diesel engine service class, provided the credits are calculated for 
both engine families using the conversion factor and useful life of the 
engine family using the credits, and the engine family using the credits 
is certified to the standards listed in Sec. 86.007-11(a)(1). Banked or 
traded credits may not be used by any engine family in a different 
service class than the service class of the engine family generating the 
credits.

    Editorial Note: At 66 FR 5165, Jan. 18, 2001, Sec. 86.008-10 was 
added. However, Sec. 86.008-10 already existed. For the convenience of 
the user, the second Sec. 86.008-10 is set forth as follows:

Sec. 86.008-10  Emission standards for 2008 and later model year Otto-
          cycle heavy-duty engines and vehicles.

    Section 86.008-10 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.099-10. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.099-10 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.008-10, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.099-10.''.
    (a)(1) Exhaust emissions from new 2008 and later model year Otto-
cycle HDEs shall not exceed:
    (i)(A) Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>). 0.20 grams per brake 
horsepower-hour (0.075 grams per megajoule).
    (B) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its Otto-cycle 
HDE families in any or all of the NO<INF>X</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> plus 
NMHC emissions ABT programs for HDEs, within the restrictions described 
in Sec. 86.008-15 or Sec. 86.004-15. If the manufacturer elects to 
include engine families in any of these programs, the NO<INF>X</INF> FEL 
may not exceed 0.50 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.26 grams per 
megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family 
are derived from averaging, banking, or trading programs. The 
NO<INF>X</INF> FEL cap is 0.80 for model years before 2011 for 
manufacturers choosing to certify to the 1.5 g/bhp-hr 
NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC standard in 2003 or 2004, in accordance with 
Sec. 86.005-10(f).
    (ii)(A) Non-methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC) for engines fueled with 
either gasoline, natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas. 0.14 grams per 
brake horsepower-hour (0.052 grams per megajoule).

HDE families in any or all of the NMHC emissions ABT programs for HDEs, 
within the restrictions described in Sec. 86.008-15 or Sec. 86.004-15. 
If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these 
programs, the NMHC FEL may not exceed 0.30 grams per brake horsepower-
hour. This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family are 
derived from averaging, banking, or trading programs. The NMHC FEL cap 
is 0.40 for model years before 2011 for manufacturers choosing to 
certify to the 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC in 2004, as allowed in 
Sec. 86.005-10.

actions specified in section 203(a)(1) of the Act, test or cause to be 
tested motor vehicle engines in accordance with applicable procedures in 
subpart N or P of this part to ascertain that such test engines meet the 
requirements of this section.
    (e) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.099-10.
    (f) Phase-in options. (1)(i) For model year 2008, manufacturers may 
certify some of their engine families to the exhaust standards 
applicable to model year 2007 engines under Sec. 86.005-10, in lieu of 
the exhaust standards specified in this section. These engines

[[Page 81]]

must comply with all other requirements applicable to model year 2008 
engines, except as allowed by paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. The 
combined number of engines in the engine families certified to the 2007 
combined NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC standard may not exceed 50 percent of 
the manufacturer's U.S.-directed production of heavy-duty Otto-cycle 
motor vehicle engines for model year 2008, except as explicitly allowed 
by paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (ii) For model year 2008, manufacturers may certify some of their 
engine families to the evaporative standards applicable to model year 
2007 engines under Sec. 86.005-10, in lieu of the standards specified in 
this section. These engines must comply with all other requirements 
applicable to model year 2008 engines, except as allowed by paragraph 
(f)(1)(i) of this section. The combined number of engines in the engine 
families certified to the 2007 standards may not exceed 50 percent of 
the manufacturer's U.S.-directed production of heavy-duty Otto-cycle 
motor vehicle engines for model year 2008.
    (2)(i) Manufacturers certifying engines to all of the applicable 
exhaust standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section prior to model 
year 2008 (without using credits) may reduce the number of engines that 
are required to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC exhaust standards 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section in model year 2008 and/or 2009, 
taking into account the phase-in option provided in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section. For every engine that is certified early, the manufacturer 
may reduce the number of engines that are required by paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC standards listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section by one engine. For example, if a 
manufacturer produces 100 heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines in 2007 that 
meet all of the applicable standards listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, and it produced 10,000 heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines in 2009, 
then only 9,900 of the engines would need to comply with the 
NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC standards listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (ii) Manufacturers certifying engines to all of the applicable 
evaporative standards listed in paragraph (b) of this section prior to 
model year 2008 may reduce the number of engines that are required to 
meet the evaporative standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section 
in model year 2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the phase-in option 
provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For every engine that is 
certified early, the manufacturer may reduce the number of engines that 
are required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section to meet evaporative 
standards listed in paragraph (b) of this section by one engine.
    (3) Manufacturers certifying engines to a voluntary NO<INF>X</INF> 
standard of 0.10 g/bhp-hr (without using credits) in addition to all of 
the applicable standards listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section prior to model year 2008 may reduce the number of engines that 
are required to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC standards listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section in model year 2008 and/or 2009, taking 
into account the phase-in option provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section. For such every engine that is certified early, the manufacturer 
may reduce the number of engines that are required by paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC standards listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section by two engines.
    (g) For model years prior to 2012, for purposes of determining 
compliance after title or custody has transferred to the ultimate 
purchaser, for engines having a NO<INF>X</INF> FEL no higher than 0.50 
g/bhp-hr, the applicable compliance limits for NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC 
shall be determined by adding 0.10 g/bhp-hr to the otherwise applicable 
standards or FELs for NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC.

Sec. 86.079-31  Separate certification.

    Where possible a manufacturer should include in a single application 
for certification all vehicles (or engines) for which certification is 
required. A manufacturer may, however, choose to apply separately for 
certification of part of his product line. The selection of test 
vehicles (or test engines) and the computation of test results will be 
determined separately for each application.

[42 FR 45149, Sept. 8, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 86.079-32  Addition of a vehicle or engine after certification.

    (a) If a manufacturer proposes to add to his product line a vehicle 
(or engine) of the same engine-system combination as vehicles (or 
engines) previously certified but which was not described in the 
application for certification when the test vehicle(s) (or test 
engine(s)) representing other vehicles (or engines) of that combination 
was certified, he shall notify the Administrator. Such notification 
shall be in advance of the addition unless the manufacturer elects to 
follow the procedure described in Sec. 86.079-34. This notification 
shall include a full description of the vehicle (or engine) to be added.
    (b) The Administrator may require the manufacturer to perform such 
tests

[[Page 84]]

on the test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) representing the vehicle (or 
engine) to be added which would have been required if the vehicle (or 
engine) had been included in the original application for certification.
    (c) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the 
manufacturer, and data derived from any testing conducted under 
Sec. 86.079-29, the Administrator determines that the test vehicle(s) or 
test engine(s) meets all applicable standards, the appropriate 
certificate will be amended accordingly. If the Administrator determines 
that the test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) does not meet applicable 
standards, he will proceed under Sec. 86.079-30(b).

parameters listed in Sec. 86.079-24(a)(3), Sec. 86.079-24(b)(1)(iii), 
Sec. 86.079-24(b)(2) (iii) or Sec. 86.079-24(b)(3)(iii) as applicable, 
giving a full description of the change. Such notification shall be in 
advance of the change unless the manufacturer elects to follow the 
procedure described in Sec. 86.079-34.
    (b) Based upon the description of the change, and data derived from 
such testing as the Administrator may require or conduct. The 
Administrator will determine whether the vehicle (or engine), as 
modified, would still be covered by the certificate of conformity then 
in effect.
    (c) If the Administrator determines that the outstanding certificate 
would cover the modified vehicles (or engines) he will notify the 
manufacturer in writing. Except as provided in Sec. 86.079-34 the change 
may not be put into effect prior to the manufacturer's receiving this 
notification. If the Administrator determines that the modified vehicles 
(or engines) would not be covered by the certificate then in effect, the 
modified vehicles (or engines) shall be treated as additions to the 
product line subject to Sec. 86.079-32.

Sec. 86.084-4  Section numbering; construction.

    (a) Section numbering. (1) The model year of initial applicability 
is indicated by the last two digits of the 5-digit group. A section 
remains in effect for subsequent model years until it is superseded. The 
number following the hyphen designates what previous section is replaced 
by a future regulation.
    Examples: Section 86.077-6 applies to the 1977 and subsequent model 
years until superseded. If a Sec. 86.080-6 is promulgated it would take 
effect with the 1980 model year; Sec. 86.077-6 would not apply after the 
1979 model year. Section 86.077-10 would be replaced by Sec. 86.078-10 
beginning with the 1978 model year.
    (2) Where a section still in effect references a section that has 
been superseded, the reference shall be interpreted to mean the 
superseding section.
    (b) A section reference without a model year suffix refers to the 
section applicable for the appropriate model year.
    (c) Construction. Except where indicated, the language in this 
subpart applies to both vehicles and engines. In many instances, 
language referring to engines is enclosed in parentheses and immediately 
follows the language discussing vehicles.

Sec. 86.084-40  Automatic expiration of reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines. (1) All of the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements in this subpart for which 1984 
is the first model year of implementation will automatically expire on 
December 31, 1988, unless the Administrator acts to retain them.
    (2) If the Administrator determines that the reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements should be retained she/he will also at that 
time establish the subsequent date of expiration, which will not be 
later than December 31, 1993.

Sec. 86.085-1  General applicability.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to 1985 and later model 
year new gasoline-fueled and diesel light-duty vehicles, 1985 and later 
model year new gasoline-fueled and diesel light-duty trucks, and 1985 
and later model year new gasoline-fueled and diesel heavy-duty engines.
    (b) Optional applicability. A manufacturer may request to certify 
any heavy-duty vehicle 10,000 pounds GVWP or less in accordance with the 
light-duty truck provisions. Heavy-duty engine or vehicle provisions do 
not apply to such a vehicle.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Alternative Durability Program. For 1985 and later model year 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, a manufacturer may elect to 
participate in the Alternative Durability Program. This optional program 
provides an alternative method of determining exhaust emission control 
system durability. The general procedures and a description of the 
programs are contained in Sec. 86.085-13 and specific provisions on test 
vehicles and compliance procedures are contained in Secs. 86.085-24 and 
86.085-28 respectively.
    (e) Small volume manufacturers. Special certification procedures are 
available for any manufacturer whose projected combined U.S. sales of 
light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty engines in its 
product line are fewer than 10,000 units for the

[[Page 93]]

model year in which the manufacturer seeks certification. In order to 
certify its product line under these optional procedures, the small-
volume manufacturer must first obtain the Administrator's approval. 
Vehicles produced at facilities leased, operated, controlled, 
supervised, or in 10 percent or greater part owned by the manufacturer 
shall be counted in calculating the total sales of the manufacturer. The 
small-volume manufacturer's certification procedures are described in 
Sec. 86.084-14.
    (f) Optional Procedures for Determining Exhaust Opacity. (1) The 
provisions of subpart I apply to tests which are performed by the 
Administrator, and optionally, by the manufacturer.
    (2) Measurement procedures, other than that described in subpart I, 
may be used by the manufacturer provided the manufacturer satisfies the 
requirements of Sec. 86.085-23(f).
    (3) When a manufacturer chooses to use an alternative measurement 
procedure it has the responsibility to determine whether the results 
obtained by the procedure will correlate with the results which would be 
obtained from the measurement procedure in subpart I. Consequently, the 
Administrator will not routinely approve or disapprove any alternative 
opacity measurement procedure or any associated correlation data which 
the manufacturer elects to use to satisfy the data requirements of 
subpart I.
    (4) If a confirmatory test(s) is performed and the results indicate 
there is a systematic problem suggesting that the data generated under 
an optional alternative measurement procedure do not adequately 
correlate with subpart I data, EPA may require that all certificates of 
conformity not already issued be based on data from subpart I 
procedures.

Sec. 86.085-2  Definitions.

    The definitions of Sec. 86.084-2 remain effective. The definitions 
listed in this section apply beginning with the 1985 model year.
    Abnormally treated vehicle, any diesel light-duty vehicle or diesel 
light-duty truck that is operated for less than five miles in a 30 day 
period immediately prior to conducting a particulate emissions test.
    Composite particulate standard, for a manufacturer which elects to 
average diesel light-duty vehicles and diesel light-duty trucks together 
in the particulate averaging program, means that standard calculated 
according to the following equation and rounded to the nearest hundredth 
gram-per-mile:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.004

Where:
PROD<INF>LDV</INF> represents the manufacturer's total diesel light-duty 
vehicle production for those engine families being included in the 
average for a given model year.
STD<INF>LDV</INF> represents the light-duty vehicle particulate 
standard.
PROD<INF>LDT</INF> represents the manufacturer's total diesel light-duty 
truck production for those engine families being included in the average 
for a given model year.
STD<INF>LDT</INF> represents the light-duty truck particulate standard.

    Family particulate emission limit means the diesel particulate 
emission level to which an engine family is certified in the particulate 
averaging program, expressed to an accuracy of one hundredth gram-per-
mile.
    Incomplete gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicle means any gasoline-
fueled heavy-duty vehicle which does not have the primary load-carrying 
device, or passenger compartment, or engine compartment or fuel system 
attached.
    Production-weighted average means the manufacturer's production-
weighted average particulate emission level, for certification purposes, 
of all of its

[[Page 94]]

diesel engine families included in the particulate averaging program. It 
is calculated at the end of the model year by multiplying each family 
particulate emission limit by its respective production, summing these 
terms, and dividing the sum by the total production of the effected 
families. Those vehicles produced for sale in California or at high 
altitude shall each be averaged separately from those produced for sale 
in any other area.
    Primary intended service class means:
    (a) The primary service application group for which a heavy-duty 
diesel engine is designed and marketed, as determined by the 
manufacturer. The primary intended service classes are designated as 
light, medium, and heavy heavy-duty diesel engines. The determination is 
based on factors such as vehicle GVW, vehicle usage and operating 
patterns, other vehicle design characteristics, engine horsepower, and 
other engine design and operating characteristics.
    (1) Light heavy-duty diesel engines usually are non-sleeved and not 
designed for rebuild; their rated horsepower generally ranges from 70 to 
170. Vehicle body types in this group might include any heavy-duty 
vehicle built for a light-duty truck chassis, van trucks, multi-stop 
vans, recreational vehicles, and some single axle straight trucks. 
Typical applications would include personal transportation, light-load 
commercial hauling and delivery, passenger service, agriculture, and 
construction. The GVWR of these vehicles is normally less than 19,500 
lbs.
    (2) Medium heavy-duty diesel engines may be sleeved or non-sleeved 
and may be designed for rebuild. Rated horsepower generally ranges from 
170 to 250. Vehicle body types in this group would typically include 
school buses, tandem axle straight trucks, city tractors, and a variety 
of special purpose vehicles such as small dump trucks, and trash 
compactor trucks. Typical applications would include commercial short 
haul and intra-city delivery and pickup. Engines in this group are 
normally used in vehicles whose GVWR varies from 19,500-33,000 lbs.
    (3) Heavy heavy-duty diesel engines are sleeved and designed for 
multiple rebuilds. Their rated horsepower generally exceeds 250. 
Vehicles in this group are normally tractors, trucks, and buses used in 
inter-city, long-haul applications. These vehicles normally exceed 
33,000 lbs GVWR.
    Useful life means:
    (a) For light-duty vehicles a period of use of 5 years or 50,000 
miles, whichever first occurs.
    (b) For a light-duty truck engine family, a period of use of 11 
years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first.
    (c) For a gasoline-fueled heavy-duty engine family (and in the case 
of evaporative emission regulations, for gasoline-fueled heavy-duty 
vehicles), a period of use of 8 years or 110,000 miles, whichever first 
occurs.
    (d) For a diesel heavy-duty engine family:
    (1) For light heavy-duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years 
or 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (2) For medium heavy-duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years 
or 185,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (3) For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years 
or 290,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (e) As an option for both light-duty truck and heavy-duty engine 
families, an alternative useful life period assigned by the 
Administrator under the provisions of paragraph (f) of Sec. 86.085-21.
    (f) The useful-life period for purposes of the emissions defect 
warranty and emissions performance warranty shall be a period of 5 
years/50,000 miles whichever first occurs, for light-duty trucks, 
gasoline heavy-duty engines, and light heavy-duty diesel engines. For 
all other heavy-duty diesel engines the aforementioned period is 5 
years/100,000 miles, whichever first occurs. However, in no case may 
this period be less than the manufacturer's basic mechanical warranty 
period for the engine family.

Sec. 86.085-13  Alternative Durability Program.

    (a) The procedures of the Alternative Durability Program are 
optional. Manufacturers may use these optional procedures to determine 
deterioration factors instead of using the procedures that this subpart 
otherwise requires.
    (b) The optional procedures of the Alternative Durability Program 
apply only to light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and are 
effective for the 1985 and later model years. All manufacturers of these 
vehicles are eligible to participate in this program.
    (c) For engine families subject to the procedures of the Alternative 
Durability Program, the manufacturer shall submit deterioration factors 
to the Administrator for approval to use them for certification. The 
Administrator shall approve the use of deterioriation factors that:
    (1) The manufacturer attests are representative of the durability 
performance of its vehicles in actual field use when maintained 
according to the manufacturer's maintenance instructions (as limited 
under Sec. 86.084-25(a)), and
    (2) Are equal to or greater than the deterioration factors that EPA 
determines under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) EPA shall determine minimum deterioration factors for engine 
families subject to the Alternative Durability Program. This 
determination shall be based on a procedure of grouping engine families 
(see Sec. 86.085-24(a)) in order to use historical certification data to 
determine deterioration factors for each engine family group. The 
historical data shall be updated yearly through the testing of 
production durability-data vehicles. Test vehicle requirements under 
these procedures are contained in Sec. 86.085-24(h) and compliance 
requirements are contained in Sec. 86.085-28 (a)(5) and (b)(5).
    (e) Request Procedures. (1) A manufacturer wishing to participate in 
the Alternative Durability Program must submit to the Administrator, for 
each model year, a written request describing the engine families that 
the manufacturer elects to be included in the program.
    (2) The Administrator may declare ineligible any engine family for 
which the Administrator determines there is unreasonable risk in 
determining a deterioration factor using the methods of the Alternative 
Durability Program. Furthermore, the Administrator may limit the number 
of engine families within the manufacturer's product line that are 
eligible for the Alternative Durability Program.
    (3) Upon approval of the manufacturer's request to participate, the 
Administrator and the manufacturer may enter into a written agreement 
prescribing the terms and conditions of the program. This agreement 
shall be equitable as compared to agreements entered into with other 
manufacturers. The agreement shall specify the following:
    (i) The engine families to be included in the program and the engine 
family groups that have been established by the provisions of 
Sec. 86.085-24(a) (8) and (9).
    (ii) The procedures for the selection of production durability-data 
vehicles specified under the provisions of Sec. 86.085-24(h).
    (iii) The procedures for the determination of minimum exhaust 
emission deterioration factors for each engine family group.
    (f) Withdrawal from Alternative Durability Program. (1) Subject to 
the conditions of the following paragraphs, a manufacturer may, at any 
time, withdraw all of its product line or separate engine family groups 
from this program. Only entire engine family groups may be withdrawn.
    (2) Once any engine family in an engine family group is certified 
using deterioration factors determined in the Alternative Durability 
Program, the manufacturer shall operate and test the production 
durability-data vehicles specified in Sec. 86.085-24(h) in accordance 
with the procedures of this part.
    (3) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer if a 
nonconformity of a category of vehicles within the engine family group 
is indicated by the production durability data. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, a nonconformity is determined to exist if:
    (i) Any emission-data vehicle within an engine family of the model 
year

[[Page 96]]

most recently certified under the Alternative Durability Program is 
projected to exceed an emission standard by applying deterioration 
factors generated by a production durability-data vehicle within the 
same engine family, or
    (ii) Any of the most recent model year's production durability-data 
vehicle configurations tested under paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
line crosses as defined in Sec. 86.085-28(a)(5)(ii)(C). For the purpose 
of this paragraph, data from identical vehicles will be averaged as 
under Sec. 86.085-28(a)(4)(i) (A) and (B).
    (4) If the Administrator notifies a manufacturer of such a 
nonconformity, the manufacturer shall submit, by a date specified by the 
Administrator, a plan to remedy the nonconformity which is acceptable to 
the Director, Office of Mobile Sources. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, the term ``remedy the nonconformity'' will have the same 
meaning as it does when it appears in section 207(c)(1) of the Clean Air 
Act.
    (5) The manufacturer shall comply with the terms of the remedial 
plan approved by the Director, Office of Mobile Sources.
    (6) If a manufacturer does not comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (f) (2), (4), or (5) of this section, the Administrator may 
deem the certificate of conformity for the affected engine families void 
ab initio.

Sec. 86.087-38  Maintenance instructions.

    (a) The manufacturer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the 
purchaser of each new motor vehicle (or motor vehicle engine) subject to 
the standards prescribed in Sec. 86.087-8, Sec. 86.087-9, Sec. 86.087-
10, or Sec. 86.087-11, as applicable, written instructions for the 
proper maintenance and use of the vehicle (or engine), by the purchaser 
consistent with the provisions of Sec. 86.087-25, which establishes what 
scheduled maintenance the Administrator approves as being reasonable and 
necessary. For light-duty vehicle manufacturers optionally complying 
with Sec. 86.087-25(a) for the 1987 model year, the Administrator 
approves any scheduled maintenance allowed by Sec. 86.087-25(a) as being 
reasonable and necessary.
    (1) The maintenance instructions required by this section shall be 
in clear, and to the extent practicable, nontechnical language.
    (2) The maintenance instructions required by this section shall 
contain a general description of the documentation which the 
manufacturer will require from the ultimate purchaser or any subsequent 
purchaser as evidence of compliance with the instructions.
    (b) Instructions provided to purchasers under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall specify the performance of all scheduled maintenance 
performed by the manufacturer on certification durability vehicles and, 
in cases where the manufacturer performs less maintenance on 
certification durability vehicles than the allowed limit, may specify 
the performance of any scheduled maintenance allowed under Sec. 86.087-
25 (or under Sec. 86.085-25(a), for light-duty vehicle families 
optionally complying with that section for the 1987 model year).
    (c) Scheduled emission-related maintenance in addition to that 
performed under Sec. 86.087-25(b) may only be recommended to offset the 
effects of abnormal in-use operating conditions, except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section. The manufacturer shall be required to 
demonstrate, subject to the approval of the Administrator, that such 
maintenance is reasonable and technologically necessary to assure the 
proper functioning of the emission control system. Such additional 
recommended maintenance shall be clearly differentiated, in a form 
approved by the Administrator, from that approved under Sec. 86.087-
25(b).
    (d) Inspections of emission-related parts or systems with 
instructions to replace, repair, clean, or adjust the parts or systems 
if necessary, are not considered to be items of scheduled maintenance 
which insure the proper functioning of the emission control system. Such 
inspections, and any recommended maintenance beyond that approved by the 
Administrator as reasonable and necessary under paragraphs (a), (b), and 
(c) of this section, may be included in the written instructions 
furnished to vehicle owners under paragraph (a) of this section: 
Provided, That such instructions clearly state, in a form approved by 
the Administrator, that the owner need not perform such inspections or 
recommended maintenance in order to maintain the emission warranty or 
manufacturer recall liability.
    (e) If the vehicle has been granted an alternative useful life 
period under the provisions of Sec. 86.087-21(f), the manufacturer may 
choose to include in such instructions an explanation of the distinction 
between the alternative useful life specified on the label, and the 
emissions defect and emissions performance warranty period. The 
explanation must clearly state that the useful life period specified on 
the label represents the average period of use up to retirement or 
rebuild for the engine family represented by the engine used in the 
vehicle. An explanation of how the actual useful lives of engines used 
in various applications are expected to differ from the average useful 
life may be included. The explanation(s) shall be in clear, non-
technical language that is understandable to the ultimate purchaser.
    (f) If approved by the Administrator, the instructions provided to 
purchasers under paragraph (a) of this section shall indicate what 
adjustments or modifications, if any, are necessary to allow the vehicle 
to meet applicable emission standards at elevations above

in this section apply beginning with the 1988 model year.
    Composite NO<INF>X</INF> standard, for a manufacturer which elects 
to average light-duty trucks subject to the NO<INF>X</INF> standard of 
Sec. 86.088-9(a)(iii)(A) together with those subject to the 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard of Sec. 86.088-9(a)(iii)(B) in the light-duty 
truck NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program, means that standard calculated 
according to the following equation and rounded to the nearest one-tenth 
gram per mile:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.006

Where:
PROD<INF>A</INF> = The manufacturer's total light-duty truck production 
for those engine families subject to the standard of Sec. 86.088-
9(a)(iii)(A) and included in the average for a given model year,
STD<INF>A</INF> = The NO<INF>X</INF> standard of Sec. 86.088-
9(a)(iii)(A),
PROD<INF>B</INF> = The manufacturer's total light-duty truck production 
for those engine families subject to the standard of Sec. 86.088-
9(a)(iii)(B) and included in the average for a given model year, and
STD<INF>B</INF> = The NO<INF>X</INF> standard of Sec. 86.088-
9(a)(iii)(B).

    Critical emission-related components are those components which are 
designed primarily for emission control, or whose failure may result in 
a significant increase in emissions accompanied by no significant 
impairment (or perhaps even an improvement) in performance, 
driveability, and/or fuel economy as determined by the Administrator.
    Critical emission-related maintenance means that maintenance to be 
performed on critical emission-related components.
    Emission-related maintenance means that maintenance which does 
substantially affect emissions or which is likely to affect the 
emissions deterioration of the vehicle or engine during normal in-use 
operation, even if the maintenance is performed at some time other than 
that which is recommended.
    Family NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit means the NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission level to which an engine family is certified in the light-duty 
truck NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program, expressed to one-tenth of a gram 
per mile accuracy.
    Non-emission-related maintenance means that maintenance which does 
not substantially affect emissions and which does not have a lasting 
effect on the emissions deterioration of the vehicle or engine during 
normal in-use operation once the maintenance is performed.
    Production-weighted NO<INF>X</INF> average means the manufacturer's 
production-weighted average NO<INF>X</INF> emission level, for 
certification purposes, of all of its light-duty truck engine families 
included in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program. It is calculated at 
the end of the model year by multiplying each family NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission limit by its respective production, summing those terms, and 
dividing the sum by the total production of the effected families. Those 
vehicles produced for sale in California or at high altitude shall each 
be averaged separately from those produced for sale in any other area.
    Production-weighted particulate average means the manufacturer's 
production-weighted average particulate emission level, for 
certification purposes, of all of its diesel engine families included in 
the particulate averaging program. It is calculated at the end of the 
model year by multiplying each family particulate emission limit by its 
respective production, summing those terms, and dividing the sum by

[[Page 100]]

the total production of the effected families. Those vehicles produced 
for sale in California or at high altitude shall each be averaged 
separately from those produced for sale in any other area.

Sec. 86.090-1  General applicability.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to: 1990 and later model 
year new Otto-cycle and diesel light-duty vehicles; 1990 and later model 
year new Otto-cycle and diesel light-duty trucks; and, 1990 and later 
model year new Otto-cycle and diesel heavy-duty engines.
    (b) Optional applicability. A manufacturer may request to certify 
any heavy-duty vehicle of 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating or 
less to the light-duty truck provisions. Heavy-duty engine or vehicle 
provisions do not apply to such a vehicle.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Alternative Durability Program. For 1990 and later model year 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, a manufacturer may elect to 
participate in the Alternative Durability Program. This optional program 
provides an alternative method of determining exhaust emission control 
system durability. The general procedures and a description of the 
programs are contained in Sec. 86.085-13 and specific provisions on test 
vehicles and compliance procedures are contained in Sec. 86.085-24 and 
Sec. 86.088-28 respectively.
    (e) Small-Volume Manufacturers. Special certification procedures are 
available for any manufacturer whose projected combined U.S. sales of 
light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty engines in its 
product line are fewer than 10,000 units for the model year in which the 
manufacturer seeks certification. In order to certify its product line 
under these optional procedures, the small-volume manufacturer must 
first obtain the Administrator's approval. Vehicles produced at 
facilities leased, operated, controlled, supervised, or is ten percent 
or greater part owned by the manufacturer shall be counted in 
calculating the total sales of the manufacturer. The small-volume 
manufacturer's certification procedures are described in Sec. 86.090-14.
    (f) Optional Procedures for Determining Exhaust Opacity. (1) The 
provisions of subpart I apply to tests which are performed by the 
Administrator, and optionally, by the manufacturer.
    (2) Measurement procedures, other than that described in subpart I, 
may be used by the manufacturer provided the manufacturer satisfies the 
requirements of Sec. 86.090-23(f).
    (3) When a manufacturer chooses to use an alternative measurement 
procedure it has the responsibility to determine whether the results 
obtained by the procedure will correlate with the results which would be 
obtained from the measurement procedure in subpart I. Consequently, the 
Administrator will not routinely approve or disapprove any alternative 
opacity measurement procedure or any associated correlation data which 
the manufacturer elects to use to satisfy the data requirements of 
subpart I.
    (4) If a confirmatory test(s) is performed and the results indicate 
there is a systematic problem suggesting that the data generated under 
an optional alternative measurement procedure do not adequately 
correlate with subpart I data, EPA may require that all certificates of 
conformity not already issued be based on data from subpart I 
procedures.

Sec. 86.090-2  Definitions.

    The definitions in Sec. 86.088-2 remain effective. The definitions 
in this section apply beginning with the 1990 model year.
    Averaging for heavy-duty engines means the exchange of 
NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate emission credits among engine families 
within a given manufacturer's product line.
    Averaging set means a subcategory of heavy-duty engines within which 
engine families can average and trade emission credits with one other.
    Banking means the retention of heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate

[[Page 102]]

emission credits, by the manufacturer generating the emission credits, 
for use in future model year certification programs as permitted by 
regulation.
    Composite particulate standard, for a manufacturer which elects to 
average light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks together in either the 
petroleum-fueled or methanol-fueled light-duty particulate averaging 
program, means that standards calculated using the following equation 
and rounded to the nearest one-hundredth (0.01) of a gram per mile:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.007

Where:
PROD<INF>LDV</INF> represents the manufacturer's total petroleum-fueled 
diesel or methanol-fueled diesel light-duty vehicle production for those 
engine families being included in the appropriate average for a given 
model year.
STD<INF>LDV</INF> represents the light-duty vehicle particulate 
standard.
PROD<INF>LDT</INF> represents the manufacturer's total petroleum-fueled 
diesel or methanol-fueled diesel light-duty truck production for those 
engine families being included in the appropriate average for a given 
model year.
STD<INF>LDT</INF> represents the light-duty truck particulate standard.

    Dedicated vehicle (or engine) means any motor vehicle (or motor 
vehicle engine) engineered and designed to be operated using a single 
fuel. Flexible fuel vehicles and multi-fuel vehicles are not dedicated 
vehicles.
    Diesel means type of engine with operating characteristics 
significantly similar to the theoretical Diesel combustion cycle. The 
non-use of a throttle during normal operation is indicative of a diesel 
engine.
    Dual fuel vehicle (or engine) means any motor vehicle (or motor 
vehicle engine) engineered and designed to be operated on two different 
fuels, but not on a mixture of fuels.
    Emission credits mean the amount of emission reductions or 
exceedances, by a heavy-duty engine family, below or above the emission 
standard, respectively. Emission credits below the standard are 
considered as ``positive credits,'' while emission credits above the 
standard are considered as ``negative credits.'' In addition, 
``projected credits'' refer to emission credits based on the projected 
U.S. production volume of the engine family. ``Reserved credits'' are 
emission credits generated within a model year waiting to be reported to 
EPA at the end of the model year. ``Actual credits'' refer to emission 
credits based on actual U.S. production volumes as contained in the end-
of-year reports submitted to EPA. Some or all of these credits may be 
revoked if EPA review of the end of year reports or any subsequent audit 
actions uncover problems or errors.
    Family emission limit (FEL) means an emission level declared by the 
manufacturer which serves in lieu of an emission standard for 
certification purposes in any of the averaging, trading, or banking 
programs. FELs must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as 
the applicable emission standard. The FEL for an engine family using 
NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate NCPs must equal the value of the current 
NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate emission standard.
    Flexible fuel vehicle (or engine) means any motor vehicle (or motor 
vehicle engine) engineered and designed to be operated on any mixture of 
two or more different fuels.
    Methanol-fueled means any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that 
is engineered and designed to be operated using methanol fuel (i.e., a 
fuel that contains at least 50 percent methanol (CH<INF>3</INF>OH) by 
volume) as fuel. Flexible fuel vehicles are methanol-fueled vehicles.
    Non-oxygenated hydrocarbon means organic emissions measured by a 
flame ionization detector, excluding methanol.
    Otto-cycle means type of engine with operating characteristics 
significantly similar to the theoretical Otto combustion cycle. The use 
of a throttle during

[[Page 103]]

normal operation is indicative of an Otto-cycle engine.
    Primary intended service class means:
    (a) The primary service application group for which a heavy-duty 
diesel engine is designed and marketed, as determined by the 
manufacturer. The primary intended service classes are designated as 
light, medium, and heavy heavy-duty diesel engines. The determination is 
based on factors such as vehicle GVW, vehicle usage and operating 
patterns, other vehicle design characteristics, engine horsepower, and 
other engine design and operating characteristics.
    (1) Light heavy-duty diesel engines usually are non-sleeved and not 
designed for rebuild; their rated horsepower generally ranges from 70 to 
170. Vehicle body types in this group might include any heavy-duty 
vehicle built for a light-duty truck chassis, van trucks, multi-stop 
vans, recreational vehicles, and some single axle straight trucks. 
Typical applications would include personal transportation, light-load 
commercial hauling and delivery, passenger service, agriculture, and 
construction. The GVWR of these vehicles is normally less than 19,500 
lbs.
    (2) Medium heavy-duty diesel engines may be sleeved or non-sleeved 
and may be designed for rebuild. Rated horsepower generally ranges from 
170 to 250. Vehicle body types in this group would typically include 
school buses, tandem axle straight trucks, city tractors, and a variety 
of special purpose vehicles such as small dump trucks, and trash 
compactor trucks. Typical applications would include commercial short 
haul and intra-city delivery and pickup. Engines in this group are 
normally used in vehicles whose GVWR varies from 19,500-33,000 lbs.
    (3) Heavy heavy-duty diesel engines are sleeved and designed for 
multiple rebuilds. Their rated horsepower generally exceeds 250. 
Vehicles in this group are normally tractors, trucks, and buses used in 
inter-city, long-haul applications. These vehicles normally exceed 
33,000 lbs. GVWR.
    Production weighted particulate average means the manufacturer's 
production-weighted average particulate emission level, for 
certification purposes, of all of its diesel engine families included in 
the light-duty particulate averaging program. It is calculated at the 
end of the model year by multiplying each family particulate emission 
limit by its respective production, summing those terms, and dividing 
the sum by the total production of the effected families. Those vehicles 
produced for sale in California or at high altitude shall each be 
averaged separately from those produced for sale in any other area.
    Throttle means a device used to control an engine's power output by 
limiting the amount of air entering the combustion chamber.
    Total Hydrocarbon Equivalent means the sum of the carbon mass 
emissions of non-oxygenated hydrocarbons, methanol, formaldehyde or 
other organic compounds that are separately measured, expressed as 
gasoline-fueled vehicle hydrocarbons. In the case of exhaust emissions, 
the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the equivalent hydrocarbon is 1.85:1. In 
the case of diurnal and hot soak emissions, the hydrogen-to-carbon 
ratios of the equivalent hydrocarbons are 2.33:1 and 2.2:1, 
respectively.
    Trading means the exchange of heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> or 
particulate emission credits between manufacturers.
    Useful life means:
    (a) For light-duty vehicles a period of use of 5 years or 50,000 
miles, whichever first occurs.
    (b) For a light-duty truck engine family, a period of use of 11 
years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first.
    (c) For an Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine family, a period of use of 8 
years of 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (d) For a diesel heavy-duty engine family:
    (1) For light heavy-duty diesel engines, period of use of 8 years or 
110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (2) For medium heavy-duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years 
or 185,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (3) For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years 
or 290,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
    (e) As an option for both light-duty truck and heavy-duty engine 
families,

[[Page 104]]

an alternative useful life period assigned by the Administrator under 
the provisions of paragraph (f) of Sec. 86.090-21.
    (f) The useful-life period for purposes of the emissions defect 
warranty and emissions performance warranty shall be a period of 5 
years/50,000 miles whichever first occurs, for light-duty trucks, Otto 
cycle heavy-duty engines and light heavy-duty diesel engines. For all 
other heavy-duty diesel engines the aforementioned period is 5 years/
100,000 miles, whichever first occurs. However, in no case may this 
period be less than the manufacturer's basic mechanical warranty period 
for the engine family.

altitude conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher 
than 4,000 feet above sea level.
    (h) The manufacturer may exempt 1990 and later model year vehicles 
from compliance at high altitude with the emission standards set forth 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if the vehicles are not 
intended for sale at high altitude and if the requirements of paragraphs 
(h) (1) and (2) of this section are met.
    (1) A vehicle configuration shall only be considered eligible for 
exemption under paragraph (h) of this section if the requirements of 
either paragraph

[[Page 106]]

(h) (l) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section are met.
    (i) Its design parameters (displacement-to-weight ratio (D/W) and 
engine speed-to-vehicle-speed ratio (N/V)) fall within the exempted 
range for that manufacturer for that year. The exempted range is 
determined according to the following procedure:
    (A) The manufacturer shall graphically display the D/W and N/V data 
of all vehicle configurations it will offer for the model year in 
question. The axis of the abscissa shall be D/W (where (D) is the engine 
displacement expressed in cubic centimeters and (W) is the equivalent 
vehicle test weight expressed in pounds), and the axis of the ordinate 
shall be N/V (where (N) is the crankshaft speed expressed in revolutions 
per minute and (V) is the vehicle speed expressed in miles per hour). At 
the manufacturer's option, either the 1:1 transmission gear ratio or the 
lowest numerical gear ratio available in the transmission will be used 
to determine N/V. The gear selection must be the same for all N/V data 
points on the manufacturer's graph. For each transmission/axle ratio 
combination, only the lowest N/V value shall be used in the graphical 
display.
    (B) The product line is then defined by the equation, N/V=C(D/
W)<SUP>-</SUP>\0\<SUP>.</SUP>\9\, where the constant, C, is determined 
by the requirement that all the vehicle data points either fall on the 
line or lie to the upper right of the line as displayed on the graphs.
    (C) The exemption line is then defined by the equation, N/V=C(0.84 
D/W)<SUP>-</SUP>\0\<SUP>.</SUP>\9\, where the constant, C is the same as 
that found in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (D) The exempted range includes all values of N/V and D/W which 
simultaneously fall to the lower left of the exemption line as drawn on 
the graph.
    (ii) Its design parameters fall within the alternate exempted range 
for that manufacturer that year. The alternate exempted range is 
determined by substituting rated horsepower (hp) for displacement (D) in 
the exemption procedure described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section 
and by using the product line N/V=C(hp/W)<SUP>-</SUP>\0\<SUP>.</SUP>\9\.
    (A) Rated horsepower shall be determined by using the Society of 
Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J 1349, or any subsequent version of 
that test procedure. Any of the horsepower determinants within that test 
procedure may be used, as long as it is used consistently throughout the 
manufacturer's product line in any model year.
    (B) No exemptions will be allowed under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this 
section to any manufacturer that has exempted vehicle configurations as 
set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Its acceleration time (the time it takes a vehicle to 
accelerate from 0 miles per hour to a speed not less than 40 miles per 
hour and not greater than 50 miles per hour) under high-altitude 
conditions is greater than the largest acceleration time under low-
altitude conditions for that manufacturer for that year. The procedure 
to be followed in making this determination is:
    (A) The manufacturer shall list the vehicle configuration and 
acceleration time under low-altitude conditions of that vehicle 
configuration which has the highest acceleration time under low-altitude 
conditions of all the vehicle configurations it will offer for the model 
year in question. The manufacturer shall also submit a description of 
the methodology used to make this determination.
    (B) The manufacturer shall then list the vehicle configurations and 
acceleration times under high-altitude conditions of all those vehicle 
configurations which have higher acceleration times under high-altitude 
conditions than the highest acceleration time at low altitude identified 
in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (iv) In lieu of performing the test procedure of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section, its acceleration time can be 
estimated based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation, in 
accordance with good engineering practice, to meet the exemption 
criteria of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) A vehicle shall only be considered eligible for exemption under 
this paragraph if at least one configuration of its model type (and 
transmission configuration in the case of vehicles equipped with manual 
transmissions,

[[Page 107]]

excluding differences due to the presence of overdrive) is certified to 
meet emission standards under high-altitude conditions as specified in 
paragraph (a) through (g) of this section. The Certificate of Conformity 
(the Certificate) covering any exempted configuration(s) will also apply 
to the corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) required under this 
subparagraph. As a condition to the exemption, any suspension, 
revocation, voiding, or withdrawal of the Certificate as it applies to a 
non-exempt configuration for any reason will result in a suspension of 
the Certificate as it applies to the corresponding exempted 
configuration(s) of that model type, unless there is at least one other 
corresponding non-exempt configuration of the same model type still 
covered by the Certificate. The suspension of the Certificate as it 
applies to the exempted configuration(s) will be terminated when any one 
of the following occurs:
    (i) Another corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) receive(s) 
coverage under the Certificate; or
    (ii) Suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) is terminated; or
    (iii) The Agency's action(s), with respect to suspension, 
revocation, voiding or withdrawal of the Certificate as it applies to 
the corresponding non-exempt configuration(s), is reversed.
    (3) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at a designated high-
altitude location that has been exempted as set forth in paragraph (h) 
of this section will be considered a violation of Section 203(a)(1) of 
the Clean Air Act.
    (i)(1) The manufacturers may exempt 1990 and later model year 
vehicles from compliance at low altitude with the emission standards set 
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if the vehicles:
    (i) Are not intended for sale at low altitude; and
    (ii) Are equipped with a unique, high-altitude axle ratio (rear-
wheel drive vehicles) or a unique, high-altitude drivetrain (front-wheel 
drive vehicles) with a higher N/V ratio than other configurations of 
that model type which are certified in compliance with the emission 
standards of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section under low-altitude 
conditions.
    (2) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at low altitude that has 
been exempted as set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this section will be 
considered a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act.

    (g)(1) Any light-duty truck that a manufacturer wishes to certify 
for sale at low altitude must be capable of meeting high-altitude 
emission standards (specified in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this 
section). The manufacturer may specify vehicle adjustments or 
modifications to allow the vehicle to meet high-altitude standards but 
these adjustments or modifications may not alter the vehicle's basic 
engine, inertia weight class, transmission configuration, and axle 
ratio.
    (i) A manufacturer may certify unique configurations to meet the 
high-altitude standards but is not required to certify these vehicle 
configurations to meet the low-altitude standards.
    (ii) Any adjustments or modifications that are recommended to be 
performed on vehicles to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section:
    (A) Shall be capable of being effectively performed by commercial 
repair facilities, and
    (B) Must be included in the manufacturer's application for 
certification.
    (2) The manufacturer may exempt 1990 and later model year vehicles 
from compliance with the high-altitude emission standards set forth in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section if the vehicles are not intended 
for sale at high altitude and if the following requirements are met. A 
vehicle configuration shall only be considered eligible for exemption if 
the requirements of either paragraph (g)(2) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of 
this section are met.
    (i) Its design parameters (displacement-to-weight ratio (D/W) and 
engine speed to-vehicle-speed ratio (N/V)) fall within the exempted 
range for that manufacturer for that year. The exempted range is 
determined according to the following procedure:
    (A) The manufacturer shall graphically display the D/W and N/V data 
of all vehicle configurations it will offer for the model year in 
question. The axis of the abscissa shall be D/W (where (D) is the engine 
displacement expressed in cubic centimeters and (W) is the gross vehicle 
weight (GVW) expressed in pounds), and the axis of the ordinate shall be 
N/V (where (N) is the crankshaft speed expressed in revolutions per 
minute and (V) is the vehicle speed expressed in miles per hour). At the 
manufacturer's option, either the 1:1 transmission gear ratio or the 
lowest numerical gear ratio available in the transmission will be used 
to determine N-V. The gear selection must be the same for all N/V data 
points on the manufacturer's graph. For each transmission/axle ratio 
combination, only the lowest N/V value shall be used in the graphical 
display.
    (B) The product line is then defined by the equation, N/V = C(D/
W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>, where the constant, C, is determined by the 
requirement that all the vehicle data points either fall on the line or 
lie to the upper right of the line as displayed on the graphs.
    (C) The exemption line is then defined by the equation, N/V = C(0.84 
D/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>, where the constant, C is the same as that found in 
paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.

[[Page 110]]

    (D) The exempted range includes all values of N/V and D/W which 
simultaneously fall to the lower left of the exemption line as drawn on 
the graph.
    (ii) Its design parameters fall within the alternate exempted range 
for that manufacturer that year. The alternate exempted range is 
determined by substituting rated horsepower (hp) for displacement (D) in 
the exemption procedure described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section 
and by using the product line N/V = C(hp/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>.
    (A) Rated horsepower shall be determined by using the Society of 
Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J 1349, or any subsequent version of 
that test procedure. Any of the horsepower determinants within that test 
procedure may be used, as long as it is used consistently throughout the 
manufacturer s product line in any model year.
    (B) No exemptions will be allowed under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this 
section to any manufacturer that has exempted vehicle configurations as 
set forth in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Its acceleration time (the time it takes a vehicle to 
accelerate from 0 to a speed not less than 40 miles per hour and not 
greater than 50 miles per hour) under high-altitude conditions is 
greater than the largest acceleration time under low-altitude conditions 
for that manufacturer for that year. The procedure to be followed in 
making this determination is:
    (A) The manufacturer shall list the vehicle configuration and 
acceleration time under low-altitude conditions of that vehicle 
configuration which has the highest acceleration time under low-altitude 
conditions of all the vehicle configurations it will offer for the model 
year in question. The manufacturer shall also submit a description of 
the methodology used to make this determination.
    (B) The manufacturer shall then list the vehicle configurations and 
acceleration times under high-altitude conditions of all those vehicle 
configurations which have higher acceleration times under high-altitude 
conditions than the highest acceleration time at low altitude identified 
in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (iv) In lieu of performing the test procedure of paragraph 
(g)(2)(iii) of this section, its acceleration time can be estimated 
based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation, in accordance with 
good engineering practice, to meet the exemption criteria of paragraph 
(g)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at a designated high-
altitude location that has been exempted as set forth in paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section will be considered a violation of section 
203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act.

Sec. 86.090-21  Application for certification.

    (a) A separate application for a certificate of conformity shall be 
made for each set of standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate) and each class of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle 
engines. Such application shall be made to the Administrator by the 
manufacturer and shall be updated and corrected by amendment.
    (b) The application shall be in writing, signed by an authorized 
representative of the manufacturer, and shall include the following:
    (1)(i) Identification and description of the vehicles (or engines) 
covered by the application and a description of their engine (vehicles 
only), emission control system and fuel system components. This shall 
include a detailed description of each auxiliary emission control device 
(AECD) to be installed in or on any certification test vehicle (or 
certification test engine).
    (ii)(A) The manufacturer shall provide to the Administrator in the 
application for certification:
    (1) A list of those parameters which are physically capable of being 
adjusted (including those adjustable parameters for which access is 
difficult) and that, if adjusted to settings other than the 
manufacturer's recommended setting, may affect emissions;
    (2) A specification of the manufacturer's intended physically 
adjustable range of each such parameter, and the production tolerances 
of the limits or stops used to establish the physically adjustable 
range;
    (3) A description of the limits or stops used to establish the 
manufacturer's intended physically adjustable range of each adjustable 
parameter, or any other means used to inhibit adjustment;
    (4) The nominal or recommended setting, and the associated 
production tolerances, for each such parameter.
    (B) The manufacturer may provide, in the application for 
certification, information relating to why certain parameters are not 
expected to be adjusted in actual use and to why the physical limits or 
stops used to establish the physically adjustable range of each 
parameter, or any other means used to inhibit adjustment, are expected 
to be effective in preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use 
vehicles to settings outside the manufacturer's intended physically 
adjustable ranges. This may include results of any tests to determine 
the difficulty of gaining access to an adjustment or exceeding a limit 
as intended or recommended by the manufacturer.
    (C) The Administrator may require to be provided detailed drawings 
and descriptions of the various emission related components, and/or 
hardware samples of such components, for the purpose of making his 
determination of which vehicle or engine parameter will be subject to 
adjustment for new certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing 
and of the physically adjustable range for each such vehicle or engine 
parameter.
    (2) Projected U.S. sales data sufficient to enable the Administrator 
to select a test fleet representative of the

[[Page 114]]

vehicles (or engines) for which certification is requested. The sales 
data shall also include the altitude of intended sale for light-duty 
trucks.

methanol-fueled engines, the Administrator does not assume that each 
evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combination will deteriorate in a unique manner during the useful life 
of the vehicle. The manufacturer shall therefore identify those 
evaporative emission deterioration factors which shall be applied to the 
various evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combinations which are expected to exhibit similar deterioration 
characteristics during the useful life of the vehicle.
    (iii)(A) A description of the test procedures to be used to 
establish the durability data or the exhaust emission deterioration

period under paragraph (f) of this section, a statement of that 
alternative period and a brief synopsis of the justification.
    (2) For heavy-duty diesel engine families, a statement of the 
primary intended service class (light, medium, or heavy) and an 
explanation as to why that service class was selected. Each diesel 
engine family shall be certified under one primary intended service 
class only. After reviewing the guidance in Sec. 86.085-2, the class 
shall be determined on the basis of which class best represents the 
majority of the sales of that engine family.
    (C)(1) A statement of recommended maintenance and procedures

particulate emission limit and the projected U.S. production volume of 
the family for the model year.
    (B) The manufacturer shall choose the level of the family 
particulate emission limits, accurate to one-hundredth of a gram per 
mile.
    (C) The manufacturer may at any time during production elect to 
change the level of any family diesel particulate emission limit(s) by 
submitting the new limit(s) to the Administrator and by demonstrating 
compliance with the limit(s) as described in Sec. 86.085-2 and 
Sec. 86.088-28(b)(5)(i).
    (ii)(A) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the

compliance with the limit(s) as described in Sec. 86.088-2 and 
Sec. 86.088-28(b)(5)(ii).
    (iii) If the manufacturer elects to participate in any of the 
particulate and/or the NO<INF>X</INF> banking programs for heavy-duty 
engines, the application must list the information required in 
Secs. 86.091-15 and 86.090-23.

[[Page 115]]

whether the engine family is being certified for use in all vehicles 
regardless of their Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (see Sec. 86.088-10 
(a)(1)(i) and (a)(3)(i)), or, only for use in vehicles with a Gross 
Vehicle Weight Rating greater than 14,000 pounds.
    (ii) If the engine family is being certified for use in all vehicles 
and, is being certified to the emission standards applicable to Otto-
cycle heavy-duty engines for use only in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle 
Weight Rating over 14,000 pounds under the provisions of paragraph 
(a)(3) of Sec. 86.088-10, then the application must also attest that the 
engine family, together with all other engine families being certified 
under the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 86.088-10, represent no 
more than 5 percent of model year sales of the manufacturer of all Otto-

Sec. 86.090-22  Approval of application for certification; test fleet 
selections; determinations of parameters subject to adjustment for i

certification and Selective Enforcement Audit, adequacy of limits, and 
          physically adjustable ranges.

    (a) After a review of the application for certification and any 
other information which the Administrator may require, the Administrator 
may approve the application and select a test fleet in accordance with 
Sec. 86.090-24.

[[Page 116]]

    (b) The Administrator may disapprove in whole or in part an 
application for certification for reasons including incompleteness, 
inaccuracy, inappropriate proposed mileage (or service) accumulation 
procedures, test equipment, or fuel, and incorporation of defeat devices 
in vehicles (or on engines) described by the application.
    (c) Where any part of an application is rejected, the Administrator 
shall notify the manufacturer in writing and set forth the reasons for 
such rejection. Within 30 days following receipt of such notification, 
the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
determination. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized 
representative of the manufacturer and shall include a statement 
specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's 
determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after the 
review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that 
the request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the 
manufacturer a hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to 
such issue.
    (d)(1) The Administrator does not approve the test procedures for 
establishing the evaporative emission deterioration factors for light-
duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The manufacturer shall submit the 
procedures as required in Sec. 86.090-21(b)(4)(i) prior to the 
Administrator's selection of the test fleet under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) 
and if such procedures will involve testing of durability-data vehicles 
selected by the Administrator or elected by the manufacturer under 
Sec. 86.090-24(c)(1), prior to initiation of such testing.
    (2) Light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines only. The Administrator 
does not approve the test procedures for establishing exhaust emission 
deterioration factors. The manufacturer shall submit these procedures 
and determinations as required in Sec. 86.090-21(b)(4)(iii) prior to 
determining the deterioration factors.
    (3) Heavy-duty vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-
fueled engines only. The Administrator does not approve the test 
procedures for establishing the evaporative emission deterioration 
factors. The test procedure will conform to the requirements in 
Sec. 86.090-23(b)(3).
    (e) When the Administrator selects emission-data vehicles for the 
test fleet, he will at the same time determine those vehicle or engine 
parameters which will be subject to adjustment for certification, 
Selective Enforcement Audit and Production Compliance Audit testing, the 
adequacy of the limits, stops, seals, or other means used to inhibit 
adjustment, and the resulting physically adjustable ranges for each such 
parameter and notify the manufacturer of his determinations.
    (1)(i) Except as noted in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, the 
Administrator may determine to be subject to adjustment the idle fuel-
air mixture parameter on Otto-cycle vehicles (or engines) (carbureted or 
fuel-injected); the choke valve action parameter(s) on carbureted, Otto-
cycle vehicles (or engines); or any parameter on any vehicle (or engine) 
(Otto-cycle or diesel) which is physically capable of being adjusted, 
may significantly affect emissions, and was not present on the 
manufacturer's vehicles (or engines) in the previous model year in the 
same form and function.
    (ii) The Administrator may, in addition, determine to be subject to 
adjustment any other parameters on any vehicle or engine which is 
physically capable of being adjusted and which may significantly affect 
emissions. However, the Administrator may do so only if he has 
previously notified the manufacturer that he might do so and has found, 
at the time he gave this notice, that the intervening period would be 
adequate to permit the development and application of the requisite 
technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance 
within such period. In no event will this notification be given later 
than September 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the model year.
    (iii) In determining the parameters subject to adjustment the 
Administrator will consider the likelihood that, for each of the 
parameters listed in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this 
section, settings other than the manufacturer's recommended setting will 
occur on in-use vehicles (or engines). In determining likelihood, the

[[Page 117]]

Administrator may consider such factors as, but not limited to, 
information contained in the preliminary application, surveillance 
information from similar in-use vehicles (or engines), the difficulty 
and cost of gaining access to an adjustment, damage to the vehicle (or 
engine) if an attempt is made to gain such access and the need to 
replace parts following such attempt, and the effect of settings other 
than the manufacturer's recommended setting on vehicle (or engine) 
performance characteristics including emission characteristics.
    (iv) Manual chokes of heavy-duty engines only will not be considered 
a parameter subject to adjustment under the parameter adjustment 
requirements.
    (2)(i) The Administrator shall determine a parameter to be 
adequately inaccessible or sealed if:
    (A) In the case of an idle mixture screw, the screw is recessed 
within the carburetor casting and sealed with lead, thermosetting 
plastic, or an inverted elliptical spacer or sheared off after 
adjustment at the factory, and the inaccessibility is such that the 
screw cannot be accessed and/or adjusted with simple tools in one-half 
hour or for $20 (1978 dollars) or less.
    (B) In the case of a choke bimetal spring, the plate covering the 
bimetal spring is riveted or welded in place, or held in place with 
nonreversible screws.
    (C) In the case of a parameter which may be adjusted by elongating 
or bending adjustable members (e.g., the choke vacuum break), the 
elongation of the adjustable member is limited by design or, in the case 
of a bendable member, the member is constructed of a material which when 
bent would return to its original shape after the force is removed 
(plastic or spring steel materials).
    (D) In the case of any parameter, the manufacturer demonstrates that 
adjusting the parameter to settings other than the manufacturer's 
recommended setting takes more than one-half hour or costs more than $20 
(1978 dollars).
    (ii) The Administrator shall determine a physical limit or stop to 
be an adequate restraint on adjustability if:
    (A) In the case of a threaded adjustment, the threads are 
terminated, pinned or crimped so as to prevent additional travel without 
breakage or need for repairs which take more than one-half hour or cost 
more than $20 (1978 dollars).
    (B) The adjustment is ineffective at the end of the limits of travel 
regardless of additional forces or torques applied to the adjustment.
    (C) The manufacturer demonstrates that travel or rotation limits 
cannot be exceeded with the use of simple and inexpensive tools 
(screwdriver, pliers, open-end or box wrenches, etc.) without incurring 
significant and costly damage to the vehicle (or engine) or control 
system or without taking more than one-half hour or costing more than 
$20 (1978 dollars).
    (iii) If manufacturer service manuals or bulletins describe routine 
procedures for gaining access to a parameter or for removing or 
exceeding a physical limit, stop, seal or other means used to inhibit 
adjustment, or if surveillance data indicate that gaining access, 
removing, or exceeding is likely, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (e)(2)(ii) of 
this section shall not apply for that parameter.
    (iv) In determining the adequacy of a physical limit, stop, seal, or 
other means used to inhibit adjustment of a parameter not covered by 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the Administrator 
will consider the likelihood that it will be circumvented, removed, or 
exceeded on in-use vehicles. In determining likelihood, the 
Administrator may consider such factors as, but not limited to, 
information contained in the preliminary application; surveillance 
information from similar in-use vehicles (or engines); the difficulty 
and cost of circumventing, removing, or exceeding the limit, stop, seal, 
or other means; damage to the vehicle (or engine) if an attempt is made 
to circumvent, remove, or exceed it and the need to replace parts 
following such attempt; and the effect of settings beyond the limit, 
stop, seal, or other means on vehicle (or engine) performance 
characteristics other than emission characteristics.
    (3) The Administrator shall determine two physically adjustable 
ranges

[[Page 118]]

for each parameter subject to adjustment:
    (i)(A) In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately 
inaccessible or sealed, the Administrator may include within the 
physically adjustable range applicable to testing under this subpart 
(certification testing) all settings within the production tolerance 
associated with the nominal setting for that parameter, as specified by 
the manufacturer in the preliminary application for certification.
    (B) In the case of other parameters, the Administrator shall include 
within this range all settings within physical limits or stops 
determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability. The Administrator 
may also include the production tolerances on the location of these 
limits or stops when determining the physically adjustable range.
    (ii)(A) In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately 
inaccessible or sealed, the Administrator shall include within the 
physically adjustable range applicable to testing under subpart G or K 
(Selective Enforcement Audit and Production Compliance Audit) only the 
actual settings to which the parameter is adjusted during production.
    (B) In the case of other parameters, the Administrator shall include 
within this range all settings within physical limits or stops 
determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability, as they are 
actually located on the test vehicle (or engine).
    (f)(1) If the manufacturer submits the information specified in 
Sec. 86.090-21(b)(1)(ii) in advance of its full preliminary application 
for certification, the Administrator shall review the information and 
make the determinations required in paragraph (e) of this section within 
90 days of the manufacturer's submittal.
    (2) The 90-day decision period is exclusive of the elapsed time 
during which EPA may request additional information from manufacturers 
regarding an adjustable parameter and the receipt of the manufacturers' 
response(s).
    (g) Within 30 days following receipt of notification of the 
Administrator's determinations made under paragraph (e) of this section, 
the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
determinations. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized 
representative of the manufacturer, and shall include a statement 
specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's 
determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after review 
of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the 
request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the 
manufacturer a hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to 
such issue.

Sec. 86.090-24  Test vehicles and engines.

    (a)(1) The vehicles or engines covered by an application for 
certification will be divided into groupings of engines which are 
expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their 
useful life. Each group of engines with similar emission characteristics 
shall be defined as a separate engine family.
    (2) To be classed in the same engine family, engines must be 
identical in all the following respects:
    (i) The cylinder bore center-to-center dimensions.
    (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) The cylinder block configuration (air cooled or water cooled; 
L-6, 90 deg. V-8, etc.).

    (vi) The method of air aspiration.
    (vii) The combustion cycle.
    (viii) Catalytic converter characteristics.
    (ix) Thermal reactor characteristics.
    (x) Type of air inlet cooler (e.g., intercoolers and after-coolers) 
for diesel heavy-duty engines.
    (3)(i) Engines identical in all the respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section may be further divided into different engine 
families if the Administrator determines that they may be expected to 
have different emission characteristics. This determination will be 
based upon a consideration of the following features of each engine:
    (A) The bore and stroke.
    (B) The surface-to-volume ratio of the nominally dimensioned 
cylinder at the top dead center positions.

[[Page 119]]

    (C) The intake manifold induction port size and configuration.
    (D) The exhaust manifold port size and configuration.
    (E) The intake and exhaust valve sizes.
    (F) The fuel system.
    (G) The camshaft timing and ignition or injection timing 
characteristics.
    (ii) Light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines produced in different 
model years and distinguishable in the respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section shall be treated as belonging to a single engine 
family if the Administrator requires it, after determining that the 
engines may be expected to have similar emission deterioration 
characteristics.
    (4) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine 
families based upon the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this section, the Administrator will establish families for those 
engines based upon those features most related to their emission 
characteristics. Engines that are eligible to be included in the same 
engine family based on the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) 
of this section may be further divided into different engine families if 
the manufacturer determines that they may be expected to have different 
emission characteristics. This determination will be based upon a 
consideration of the following features of each engine:
    (i) The dimension from the center line of the crankshaft to the 
center line of the camshaft.
    (ii) The dimension from the center line of the crankshaft to the top 
of the cylinder block head face.
    (iii) The size of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
    (5) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks covered by an application for certification will be 
divided into groupings which are expected to have similar evaporative 
emission characteristics throughout their useful life. Each group of 
vehicles with similar evaporative emission characteristics shall be 
defined as a separate evaporative emission family.
    (6) For gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks to be classed in the same evaporative emission family, 
vehicles must be similar with respect to:
    (i) Type of vapor storage device (e.g., canister, air cleaner, 
crankcase).
    (ii) Basic canister design.
    (iii) Fuel system.
    (7) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into 
evaporative emission families based on the criteria listed above, the 
Administrator will establish families for those vehicles based upon the 
features most related to their evaporative emission characteristics.
    (8)(i) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the Alternative 
Durability Program, the engine families covered by an application for 
certification shall be grouped based upon similar engine design and 
emission control system characteristics. Each of these groups shall 
constitute a separate engine family group.
    (ii) To be classed in the same engine family group, engine families 
must contain engines identical in all of the following respects:
    (A) The combustion cycle.
    (B) The cylinder block configuration (air-cooled or water-cooled; L-
6, V-8, rotary, etc.).
    (C) Displacement (engines of different displacement within 50 cubic 
inches or 15 percent of the largest displacement and contained within a 
multidisplacement engine family will be included in the same engine 
family group).
    (D) Catalytic converter usage and basic type (noncatalyst, oxidation 
catalyst only, three-way catalyst equipped).
    (9) Engine families identical in all respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(8) of this section may be further divided into different engine 
family groups if the Administrator determines that they are expected to 
have significantly different exhaust emission control system 
deterioration characteristics.
    (10) A manufacturer may request the Administrator to include in an 
engine family group, engine families in addition to those grouped under 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. This request must be 
accompanied by information the manufacturer believes supports the 
inclusion of these additional engine families.

[[Page 120]]

    (11) A manufacturer may combine into a single engine family group 
those light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck engine families which 
otherwise meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(8) through (a)(10) of 
this section.
    (12) The vehicles covered by an application for certification 
equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled heavy-duty engines will 
be divided into groupings of vehicles on the basis of physical features 
which are expected to affect evaporative emissions. Each group of 
vehicles with similar features shall be defined as a separate 
evaporative emission family.
    (13) For vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled 
heavy-duty engines to be classed in the same evaporative emission 
family, vehicles must be identical with respect to:
    (i) Method of fuel/air metering (i.e., carburetion versus fuel 
injection).
    (ii) Carburetor bowl fuel volume, within a 10 cc range.
    (14) For vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled 
heavy-duty engines to be classed in the same evaporative emission 
control system, vehicles must be identical with respect to:
    (i) Method of vapor storage.
    (ii) Method of carburetor sealing.
    (iii) Method of air cleaner sealing.
    (iv) Vapor storage working capacity, within a 20 g range.
    (v) Number of storage devices.
    (vi) Method of purging stored vapors.
    (vii) Method of venting the carburetor during both engine off and 
engine operation.
    (viii) Liquid fuel hose material.
    (ix) Vapor storage material.
    (15) Where vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled 
heavy-duty engines are types which cannot be divided into evaporative 
emission family-control system combinations based on the criteria listed 
above, the Administrator will establish evaporative emission family-
control system combinations for those vehicles based on features most 
related to their evaporative emission characteristics.
    (16) No 1990 or later model year heavy-duty engine which is to be 
used to generate emission credits for 1991 and later banking, trading 
and averaging programs may also utilize nonconformance penalties (NCPs). 
Use of an NCP thus becomes an engine family criterion.
    (i) Use of either a NO<INF>X</INF> or a particulate matter NCP by an 
engine family precludes that family from generating both NO<INF>X</INF> 
and particulate matter emission credits.
    (ii) If a manufacturer desires to use both banked credits and NCPs 
on an engine family, two separate engine families must be established. 
One engine family must consist of engines certified for only credit use 
following the procedure specified in this subpart. The other engine 
family must be certified for only NCP use following the procedure as 
specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart L.
    (17) Any 1990 or later model year urban bus engines which are to be 
used to generate PM credits for the 1991 and later model year urban bus 
PM standard shall be placed in separate engine families for 
certification purposes and the families shall be clearly designated as 
such in the application. Urban bus engines of different basic design 
will not be in the same family. If a manufacturer certifies two or more 
different urban bus engines these shall be in different engine families.
    (b) Emission data--(1) Emission-data vehicles. Paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section applies to light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck 
emission-data vehicles.
    (i) Vehicles will be chosen to be operated and tested for emission 
data based upon engine family groupings. Within each engine family, one 
test vehicle will be selected based on the following criteria: The 
Administrator shall select the vehicle with the heaviest equivalent test 
weight (including options) within the family. Then within that vehicle 
the Administrator shall select, in the order listed, the highest road-
load power, largest displacement, the transmission with the highest 
numerical final gear ratio (including overdrive), the highest numerical 
axle ratio offered in that engine family and the maximum fuel flow 
calibration.
    (ii) The Administrator shall select one additional test vehicle from 
within each engine family. The vehicle selected shall be the vehicle 
expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those

[[Page 121]]

vehicles remaining in the engine family. If all vehicles within the 
engine family are similar the Administrator may waive the requirements 
of this paragraph.
    (iii) Within an engine family and exhaust emission control system, 
the manufacturer may alter any emission-data vehicle (or other vehicles 
such as including current or previous model year emission-data vehicles, 
fuel economy data vehicles, and development vehicles provided they meet 
emission-data vehicles, protocol) to represent more than one selection 
under paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii), (iv), or (vii) of this section.
    (iv) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section do not represent each engine-system 
combination, then one vehicle of each engine-system combination not 
represented will be selected by the Administrator. The vehicle selected 
shall be the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those 
vehicles remaining in the engine family.
    (v) For high-altitude exhaust emission compliance for each engine 
family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the following procedures:
    (A) The manufacturer will select for testing under high-altitude 
conditions the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions from 
the nonexempt vehicles selected in accordance with Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) 
(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section or,
    (B) In lieu of testing vehicles according to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) 
of this section, a manufacturer may provide a statement in its 
application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's 
engineering evaluation of such high-altitude emission testing as the 
manufacturer deems appropriate,
    (1) That all light-duty vehicles not exempt under Sec. 86.090-8(h) 
comply with the emission standards at high-altitude, and
    (2) That light-duty trucks sold for principal use at designated 
high-altitude locations comply with the high-altitude emission 
requirements, and that all light-duty trucks sold at low-altitude, which 
are not exempt under Sec. 86.090-9(g)(2), are capable of being modified 
to meet high-altitude standards.
    (vi) If 90 percent or more of the engine family sales will be in 
California, a manufacturer may substitute emission-data vehicles 
selected by the California Air Resources Board criteria for the 
selections specified in paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii), and (iv) of this 
section.
    (vii)(A) Vehicles of each evaporative emission family will be 
divided into evaporative emission control systems.
    (B) The Administrator will select the vehicle expected to exhibit 
the highest evaporative emissions, from within each evaporative family 
to be certified, from among the vehicles represented by the exhaust 
emission-data selections for the engine family, unless evaporative 
testing has already been completed on the vehicle expected to exhibit 
the highest evaporative emissions for the evaporative family as part of 
another engine family's testing.
    (C) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii)(B) of this section do not represent each evaporative 
emission control system then the Administrator will select the highest 
expected evaporative emission vehicle from within the unrepresented 
evaporative system.
    (viii) For high-altitude evaporative emission compliance for each 
evaporative emission family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the 
following procedures:
    (A) The manufacturer will select for testing under high-altitude 
conditions the one nonexempt vehicle previously selected under 
paragraphs (b)(1)(vii) (B) or (C) of this section which is expected to 
have the highest level of evaporative emissions when operated at high 
altitude or
    (B) In lieu of testing vehicles according to paragraph 
(b)(1)(viii)(A) of this section, a manufacturer may provide a statement 
in its application for certification that based on the manufacturer's 
engineering evaluation of such high-altitude emission testing as the 
manufacturer deems appropriate,
    (1) That all light-duty vehicles not exempt under Sec. 86.090-8(h) 
comply with the emission standards at high altitude and

[[Page 122]]

    (2) That light-duty trucks sold for principal use at designated 
high-altitude locations comply with the high-altitude emission 
requirements, and that all light-duty trucks sold at low altitude, which 
are not exempt under Sec. 86.090-9(g)(2), are capable of being modified 
to meet high-altitude standards.
    (ix) Vehicles selected under paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section 
may be used to satisfy the requirements of (b)(1)(viii)(A) of this 
section.
    (x) Light-duty trucks only: (A) The manufacturer may reconfigure any 
of the low-altitude emission-data vehicles to represent the vehicle 
configuration required to be tested at high altitude.
    (B) The manufacturer is not required to test the reconfigured 
vehicle at low altitude.
    (2) Otto-cycle heavy-duty emission-data engines. Paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section applies to Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines.
    (i)-(ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) The Administrator shall select a maximum of two engines within 
each engine family based upon features indicating that they may have the 
highest emission levels of the engines in the engine family as follows:
    (A) The Administrator shall select one emission-data engine first 
based on the largest displacement within the engine family. Then within 
the largest displacement the Administrator shall select, in the order 
listed, highest fuel flow at the speed of maximum rated torque, the 
engine with the most advanced spark timing, no EGR or lowest EGR flow, 
and no air pump or lowest actual flow air pump.
    (B) The Administrator shall select one additional engine, from 
within each engine family. The engine selected shall be the engine 
expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those engines remaining in 
the engine family. If all engines within the engine family are similar 
the Administrator may waive the requirements of this paragraph.
    (iv) If the engines selected in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) 
(ii) and (iii) of this section do not represent each engine 
displacement-exhaust emission control system combination, then one 
engine of each engine displacement-exhaust emission control system 
combination not represented shall be selected by the Administrator.
    (v) Within an engine family/displacement/control system, the 
manufacturer may alter any emission-data engine (or other engine 
including current or previous model year emission-data vehicles and 
development engines provided they meet the emission-data engines 
protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraphs 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Diesel heavy-duty emission-data engines. Paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section applies to diesel heavy-duty emission-data vehicles.
    (i) Engines will be chosen to be run for emission data based upon 
engine family groupings. Within each engine family, the requirements of 
this paragraph must be met.
    (ii) Engines of each engine family will be divided into groups based 
upon their exhaust emission control systems. One engine of each engine 
system combination shall be run for smoke emission data (diesel engines 
only) and gaseous emission data. Either the complete gaseous emission 
test or the complete smoke test may be conducted first. Within each 
combination, the engine that features the highest fuel feed per stroke, 
primarily at the speed of maximum rated torque and secondarily at rated 
speed, will usually be selected. If there are military engines with 
higher fuel rates than other engines in the same engine system 
combinations, then one military engine shall also be selected. The 
engine with the highest fuel feed per stroke will usually be selected.
    (iii) The Administrator may select a maximum of one additional 
engine within each engine-system combination based upon features 
indicating that it may have the highest emission levels of the engines 
of that combination. In selecting this engine, the Administrator will 
consider such features as the injection system, fuel system, compression 
ratio, rated speed, rated horsepower, peak torque speed, and peak 
torque.
    (iv) Within an engine family control system combination, the 
manufacturer may alter any emission-data engine (or

[[Page 123]]

other engine including current or previous model year emission-data 
vehicles and development engines provided they meet the emission-data 
engines' protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraphs 
(b)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (c) Durability data--(1) Light-duty vehicle durability-data 
vehicles. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to light-duty vehicle 
durability-data vehicles.
    (i) A durability-data vehicle will be selected by the Administrator 
to represent each engine-system combination. The vehicle selected shall 
be of the engine displacement with the largest projected sales volume of 
vehicles with that control-system combination in that engine family and 
will be designated by the Administrator as to transmission type, fuel 
system, inertia weight class, and test weight.
    (ii) A manufacturer may elect to operate and test additional 
vehicles to represent any engine-system combination. The additional 
vehicles must be of the same engine displacement, transmission type, 
fuel system and inertia weight class as the vehicle selected for that 
engine-system combination in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section. Notice of an intent to operate and test 
additional vehicles shall be given to the Administrator no later than 30 
days following notification of the test fleet selection.
    (2) Light-duty trucks. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies to 
vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust 
emission deterioration factors for light-duty trucks.
    (i) The manufacturer shall select the vehicles, engines, subsystems, 
or components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether 
vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components are used, they shall be 
selected so that their emissions deterioration characteristics may be 
expected to represent those of in-use vehicles, based on good 
engineering judgment.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Heavy-duty engines. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies to 
engines, subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust emission 
deterioration factors for heavy-duty engines.
    (i) The manufacturer shall select the engines, subsystems, or 
components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether 
engines, subsystems, or components are used, they shall be selected so 
that their emissions deterioration characteristics may be expected to 
represent those of in-use engines, based on good engineering judgment.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (d) For purposes of testing under Sec. 86.084-26 (a)(9) or (b)(11), 
the Administrator may require additional emission-data vehicles (or 
emission-data engines) and durability-data vehicles (light-duty vehicles 
only) identical in all material respects to vehicles (or engines) 
selected in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
provided that the number of vehicles (or engines) selected shall not 
increase the size of either the emission-data fleet or the durability-
data fleet by more than 20 percent or one vehicle (or engine), whichever 
is greater.
    (e)(1) Any manufacturer whose projected sales for the model year in 
which certification is sought is less than:
    (i) 2,000 Otto-cycle light-duty vehicles, or
    (ii) 2,000 diesel light-duty vehicles, or
    (iii) 2,000 Otto-cycle light-duty trucks, or
    (iv) 2,000 diesel light-duty trucks, or
    (v) 2,000 Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, or
    (vi) 2,000 diesel heavy-duty engines, may request a reduction in the 
number of test vehicles (or engines) determined in accordance with the 
foregoing provisions of this section. The Administrator may agree to 
such lesser number as he determines would meet the objectives of this 
procedure.
    (2) Any manufacturer may request to certify engine families with 
combined total sales of fewer than 10,000 light-duty vehicles, light-
duty trucks, and heavy-duty engines utilizing assigned deterioration 
factors prescribed by the Administrator. The assigned deterioration 
factors shall be applied only to entire engine families.

[[Page 124]]

    (f) In lieu of testing an emission-data or durability-data vehicle 
(or engine) selected under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and 
submitting data therefore, a manufacturer may, with the prior written 
approval of the Administrator, submit exhaust emission data and/or fuel 
evaporative emission data, as applicable on a similar vehicle (or 
engine) for which certification has previously been obtained or for 
which all applicable data required under Sec. 86.090-23 has previously 
been submitted.
    (g)(1) This paragraph applies to light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks, but does not apply to the production vehicles selected under 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2)(i) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option), the full 
estimated weight of that item shall be included in the curb weight 
computation for each vehicle available with that option in that carline, 
within that engine-system combination.
    (ii) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of the carline, 
within an engine-system, will be equipped with an item of (whether that 
item is standard equipment or an option), no weight for that item will 
be added in computing curb weight for any vehicle in that carline, 
within that engine-system combination, unless that item is standard 
equipment on the vehicle.
    (iii) In the case of mutually exclusive options, only the weight of 
the heavier option will be added in computing curb weight.
    (iv) Optional equipment weighing less than 3 pounds per item need 
not be considered.
    (3)(i) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination will be equipped with an item of 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can 
reasonably be expected to influence emissions, then such items shall 
actually be installed (unless excluded under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of 
this section) on all emission data and durability data vehicles of that 
carline, within that engine-system combination, on which the items are 
intended to be offered in production. Items that can reasonably be 
expected to influence emissions are: air conditioning, power steering, 
power brakes and other items determined by the Administrator.
    (ii) If the manufacturer determines by test data or engineering 
evaluation that the actual installation of the optional equipment 
required by paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section does not affect the 
emissions or fuel economy values, the optional equipment need not be 
installed on the test vehicle.
    (iii) The weight of the options shall be included in the design curb 
weight and also be represented in the weight of the test vehicles.
    (iv) The engineering evaluation, including any test data, used to 
support the deletion of optional equipment from test vehicles, shall be 
maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made available to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (4) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of a carline, 
within an engine system combination will be equipped with an item of 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can 
reasonably be expected to influence emissions, that item shall not be 
installed on any emission data or durability data vehicles of that 
carline, within that engine-system combination, unless that item is 
standard equipment on the vehicle.
    (h) Alternative Durability Program durability-data vehicles. This 
section applies to light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck durability-
data vehicles selected under the Alternative Durability Program 
described in Sec. 86.085-13.
    (1) In order to update the durability data to be used to determine a 
deterioration factor for each engine family group, the Administrator 
will select durability-data vehicles from the manufacturer's production 
line. Production vehicles will be selected from each model year's 
production for those vehicles certified using the Alternative Durability 
Program procedures.
    (i) The Administrator shall select the production durability-data 
vehicle designs from the designs that the manufacturer offers for sale. 
For each model year and for each engine family group,

[[Page 125]]

the Administrator may select production durability-data vehicle designs 
of equal number to the number of engine families within the engine 
family group, up to a maximum of three vehicles.
    (ii) The production durability-data vehicles representing the 
designs selected in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section will be randomly 
selected from the manufacturer's production. The Administrator will make 
these random selections unless the manufacturer (with prior approval of 
the Administrator) elects to make the random selections.
    (iii) The manufacturer may select additional production durability-
data vehicle designs from within the engine family group. The production 
durability-data vehicles representing these designs shall be randomly 
selected from the manufacturer s production in accordance with paragraph 
(h)(l)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) For each production durability-data vehicle selected under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the manufacturer shall provide to the 
Administrator (before the vehicle is tested or begins service 
accumulation) the vehicle identification number. Before the vehicle 
begins service accumulation the manufacturer shall also provide the 
Administrator with a description of the durability-data vehicle as 
specified by the Administrator.
    (v) In lieu of testing a production durability-data vehicle selected 
under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and submitting data therefrom, a 
manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the Administrator, 
submit exhaust emission data from a production vehicle of the same 
configuration for which all applicable data has previously been 
submitted.
    (2) If, within an existing engine family group, a manufacturer 
requests to certify vehicles of a new design, engine family, emission 
control system, or with any other durability-related design difference, 
the Administrator will determine if the existing engine family group 
deterioration factor is appropriate for the new design. If the 
Administrator cannot make this determination or deems the deterioration 
factor not appropriate, the Administrator shall select preproduction 
durability-data vehicles under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section. If vehicles are then certified using the new design, the 
Administrator may select production vehicles with the new design under 
the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) If a manufacturer reguests to certify vehicles of a new design 
that the Administrator determines are a new engine family group, the 
Administrator shall select preproduction durability data vehicles under 
the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. If vehicles are then 
certified using the new design, the Administrator may select production 
vehicles of that design under the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 86.090-25  Maintenance.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to light-duty vehicles, 
light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty engines.
    (1) Maintenance performed on vehicles, engines, subsystems, or 
components used to determine exhaust or evaporative emission 
deterioration factors is classified as either emission-related or non-
emission-related and each of these can be classified as either scheduled 
or unscheduled. Further, some emission-related maintenance is also 
classified as critical emission-related maintenance.
    (b) This section specifies emission-related scheduled maintenance 
for purposes of obtaining durability data and for inclusion in 
maintenance instructions furnished to purchasers of new motor vehicles 
and new motor vehicles engines under Sec. 86.087-38.
    (1) All emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of 
obtaining durability data must occur at the same mileage intervals (or 
equivalent intervals if engines, subsystems, or components are used) 
that will be specified in the manufacturer's maintenance instructions 
furnished to the ultimate purchaser of the motor vehicle or engine under 
Sec. 86.088-35. This maintenance schedule may be updated as necessary 
throughout the testing of the vehicle/engine provided that no 
maintenance operation is deleted from the

[[Page 126]]

maintenance schedule after the operation has been performed on the test 
vehicle or engine.
    (2) Any emission-related maintenance which is performed on vehicles, 
engines, subsystems, or components must be technologically necessary to 
assure in-use compliance with the emission standards. The manufacturer 
must submit data which demonstrate to the Administrator that all of the 
emission-related scheduled maintenance which is to be performed is 
technologically necessary. Scheduled maintenance must be approved by the 
Administrator prior to being performed or being included in the 
maintenance instructions provided to purchasers under Sec. 86.087-38. As 
provided below, EPA has determined that emission-related maintenance at 
shorter intervals than that outlined in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of 
this section is not technologically necessary to ensure in-use 
compliance. However, the Administrator may determine that maintenance 
even more restrictive (e.g., longer intervals) than that listed in 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section is also not technologically 
necessary.
    (3) For Otto-cycle light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and heavy 
duty engines, emission-related maintenance in addition to, or at shorter 
intervals than, the following will not be accepted as technologically 
necessary, except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
    (i)(A) The cleaning or replacement of light-duty vehicle or light-
duty truck spark plugs at 30,000 miles of use and at 30,000 mile 
intervals thereafter.
    (B) The cleaning or replacement of Otto-cycle heavy duty engine 
spark plugs at 25,000 miles (or 750 hours) of use and at 25,000 mile 
intervals (or 750-hour) intervals thereafter, for engines certified for 
use with unleaded fuel only.
    (4) For diesel powered light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and 
heavy-duty engines, emission-related maintenance in addition to, or at 
shorter intervals than, the following will not be accepted as 
technologically necessary, except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of 
this section.
    (i) For light-duty vehicles, the adjustment, cleaning, repair, or 
replacement of the following may not be performed within the 50,000-mile 
useful life of the vehicle:
    (A) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related filters 
and control valves).
    (B) Positive crankcase ventilation valve.
    (C) Fuel injectors.
    (D) Turbocharger.
    (E) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors and 
actuators.
    (F) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system (including related 
components).
    (ii) For light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines, the adjustment, 
cleaning, repair, or replacement of the following at 50,000 miles (or 
1,500 hours) of use and at 50,000-mile (or 1,500-hour) intervals 
thereafter:
    (A) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related filters 
and control valves).
    (B) Positive crankcase ventilation valve.
    (C) Fuel injector tips (cleaning only).
    (iii) The following maintenance at 100,000 miles (or 3,000 hours) of 
use and at 100,000-mile (or 3,000-hour) intervals thereafter for light-
duty trucks and light heavy-duty engines, or, at 150,000 miles (or 4,500 
hours) of use and at 150,000-mile (or 4,500-hour) intervals thereafter 
for medium and heavy-duty engines: The adjustment, cleaning, repair, or 
replacement of:
    (A) Fuel injectors.
    (B) Turbocharger.
    (C) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors and 
actuators.
    (D) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system (including related 
components).
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6)(i) The following components are currently defined as critical 
emission-related components:
    (A) Catalytic converter.
    (B) Air injection system components.
    (C) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors 
(including oxygen sensor if installed) and actuators.
    (D) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related filters 
and control valves).

[[Page 127]]

    (E) Positive crankcase ventilation valve.
    (F) Evaporative emission control system components (excluding 
canister air filter).
    (G) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system.
    (ii) All critical emission-related scheduled maintenance must have a 
reasonable likelihood of being performed in-use. The manufacturer shall 
be required to show the reasonable likelihood of such maintenance being 
performed in-use, and such showing shall be made prior to the 
performance of the maintenance on the durability data vehicle. Critical 
emission-related scheduled maintenance items which satisfy one of the 
following conditions will be accepted as having a reasonable likelihood 
of the maintenance item being performed in-use:
    (A) Data are presented which establish for the Administrator a 
connection between emissions and vehicle performance such that as 
emissions increase due to lack of maintenance, vehicle performance will 
simultaneously deteriorate to a point unacceptable for typical driving.
    (B) Survey data are submitted which adequately demonstrate to the 
Administrator that, at an 80 percent confidence level, 80 percent of 
such engines already have this critical maintenance item performed in-
use at the recommended interval(s).
    (C) A clearly displayed visible signal system approved by the 
Administrator is installed to alert the vehicle driver that maintenance 
is due. A signal bearing the message ``maintenance needed'' or ``check 
engine,'' or a similar message approved by the Administrator, shall be 
actuated at the appropriate mileage point or by component failure. This 
signal must be continuous while the engine is in operation, and not be 
easily eliminated without performance of the required maintenance. 
Resetting the signal shall be a required step in the maintenance 
operation. The method for resetting the signal system shall be approved 
by the Administrator.
    (D) A manufacturer may desire to demonstrate through a survey that a 
critical maintenance item is likely to be performed without a visible 
signal on a maintenance item for which there is no prior in-use 
experience without the signal. To that end, the manufacturer may in a 
given model year market up to 200 randomly selected vehicles per 
critical emission-related maintenance item without such visible signals, 
and monitor the performance of the critical maintenance item by the 
owners to show compliance with paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. 
This option is restricted to two consecutive model years and may not be 
repeated until any previous survey has been completed. If the critical 
maintenance involves more than one engine family, the sample will be 
sales weighted to ensure that it is representative of all the families 
in question.
    (E) The manufacturer provides the maintenance free of charge, and 
clearly informs the customer that the maintenance is free in the 
instructions provided under Sec. 86.087-38.
    (F) Any other method which the Administrator approves as 
establishing a reasonable likelihood that the critical maintenance will 
be performed in-use.
    (iii) Visible signal systems used under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(C) of 
this section are considered an element of design of the emission control 
system. Therefore, disabling, resetting, or otherwise rendering such 
signals inoperative without also performing the indicated maintenance 
procedure is a prohibited act under section 203(a)(3) of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended in August 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(3)).
    (7) Changes to scheduled maintenance. (i) For maintenance practices 
that existed prior to the 1980 model year, only the maintenance items 
listed in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section are currently 
considered by EPA to be emission-related. The Administrator may, 
however, determine additional scheduled maintenance items that existed 
prior to the 1980 model year to be emission-related by announcement in a 
Federal Register Notice. In no event may this notification occur later 
than September 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the affected 
model year.
    (ii) In the case of any new scheduled maintenance, the manufacturer 
must submit a request for approval to the Administrator for any 
maintenance that it wishes to recommend to purchasers and perform during 
durability

[[Page 128]]

determination. New scheduled maintenance is that maintenance which did 
not exist prior to the 1980 model year, including that which is a direct 
result of the implementation of new technology not found in production 
prior to the 1980 model year. The manufacturer must also include its 
recommendations as to the category (i.e., emission-related or non-
emission- related, critical or non-critical) of the subject maintenance 
and, for suggested emission-related maintenance, the maximum feasible 
maintenance interval. Such requests must include detailed evidence 
supporting the need for the maintenance requested, and supporting data 
or other substantiation for the recommended maintenance category and for 
the interval suggested for emission-related maintenance. Requests for 
new scheduled maintenance must be approved prior to the introduction of 
the new maintenance. The Administrator will then designate the 
maintenance as emission-related or non-emission-related. For maintenance 
items established as emission-related, the Administrator will further 
designate the maintenance as critical if the component which receives 
the maintenance is a critical component under paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section. For each maintenance item designated as emission-related, the 
Administrator will also establish a technologically necessary 
maintenance interval, based on industry data and any other information 
available to EPA. Designations of emission-related maintenance items, 
along with their identification as critical or non-critical, and 
establishment of technologically necessary maintenance intervals, will 
be announced in the Federal Register.
    (iii) Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
determinations in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. The request shall be 
in writing, and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's 
objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of 
such objections. If, after review of the request and supporting data, 
the Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual 
issue, he shall provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with 
Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to such issue.
    (c) Non-emission-related scheduled maintenance which is reasonable 
and technologically necessary (e.g., oil change, oil filter change, fuel 
filter change, air filter change, cooling system maintenance, adjustment 
of idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, injector lash, 
timing, etc.) may be performed on durability-data vehicles at the 
intervals recommended by the manufacturer to the ultimate purchaser.
    (d) Unscheduled maintenance on light-duty durability data vehicles. 
(1) Unscheduled maintenance may be performed during the testing used to 
determine deterioration factors, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) 
and (d)(3) of this section, only under the following provisions:
    (i) A fuel injector or spark plug may be changed if a persistent 
misfire is detected.
    (ii) Readjustment of an Otto-cycle vehicle cold-start enrichment 
system may be performed if there is a problem of stalling.
    (iii) Readjustment of the engine idle speed (curb idle and fast 
idle) may be performed in addition to that performed as scheduled 
maintenance under paragraph (c) of this section, if the idle speed 
exceeds the manufacturer's recommended idle speed by 300 rpm or more, or 
if there is a problem of stalling.
    (2) Any other unscheduled vehicle, emission control system, or fuel 
system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or 
replacement during testing to determine deterioration factors shall be 
performed only with the advance approval of the Administrator. Such 
approval will be given if the Administrator:
    (i) Has made a preliminary determination that the part failure or 
system malfunction, or the repair of such failure or malfunction, does 
not render the vehicle or engine unrepresentative of vehicles or engines 
in-use, and does not require direct access to the combustion chamber, 
except for spark plug, fuel injection component, or removable prechamber 
removal or replacement; and,

[[Page 129]]

    (ii) Has made a determination that the need for maintenance or 
repairs is indicated by an overt indication of malfunction such as 
persistent misfiring, engine stalling, overheating, fluid leakage, loss 
of oil pressure, excessive fuel consumption or excessive power loss. The 
Administrator shall be given the opportunity to verify the existence of 
an overt indication of part failure and/or vehicle/engine malfunction 
(e.g., misfiring, stalling, black smoke), or an activation of an audible 
and/or visible signal, prior to the performance of any maintenance to 
which such overt indication or signal is relevant under the provisions 
of this section.
    (3) Emission measurement may not be used as a means of determining 
the need for unscheduled maintenance under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, except under the following conditions:
    (i) The Administrator may approve unscheduled maintenance on 
durability-data vehicles based upon a significant change in emission 
levels that indicates a vehicle or engine malfunction. In these cases 
the Administrator may first approve specific diagnostic procedures to 
identify the source of the problem. The Administrator may further 
approve of specific corrections to the problem after the problem has 
been identified. The Administrator may only approve the corrective 
action after it is determined that:
    (A) The malfunction was caused by nonproduction build practices or 
by a previously undetected design problem,
    (B) The malfunction will not occur in production vehicles or engines 
in-use, and
    (C) The deterioration factor generated by the durability-data 
vehicle or engine will remain unaffected by the malfunction or by the 
corrective action (e.g., the malfunction was present for only a short 
period of time before detection, replacement parts are functionally 
representative of the proper mileage or hours, etc.).
    (ii) Following any unscheduled maintenance approved under paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section, the manufacturer shall perform an after-
maintenance emissions test. If the Administrator determines that the 
after-maintenance emission levels for any pollutant indicates that the 
deterioration factor is no longer representative of production, the 
Administrator may disqualify the durability-data vehicle or engine.
    (4) If the Administrator determines that part failure or system 
malfunction occurrence and/or repair rendered the vehicle/engine 
unrepresentative of vehicles in-use, the vehicle/engine shall not be 
used for determining deterioration factors.
    (5) Repairs to vehicle components of a durability data vehicle other 
than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be 
performed only as a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, 
or with the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (e) Maintenance on emission data vehicles and engines. (1) 
Adjustment of engine idle speed on emission data vehicles may be 
performed once before the low-mileage/low-hour emission test point. Any 
other engine, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, 
repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on emission data 
vehicles shall be performed only with the advance approval of the 
Administrator.
    (2) Maintenance on light-duty truck emission-data vehicles selected 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (v) or (vii), and permitted to be tested for 
purposes of Sec. 86.090-23(c)(1)(ii) under the provisions of 
Sec. 86.090-24(b)(2), may be performed in conjunction with emission 
control system modifications at the low-mileage test point, and shall be 
performed in accordance with the maintenance instructions to be provided 
to the ultimate purchaser required under Sec. 86.087-38.
    (3) Maintenance on those light-duty truck emission-data vehicles 
selected under 86.090-24(b)(1)(v) which are not capable of being 
modified in the field for the purpose of complying with emissions 
standards at an altitude other than that intended by the original 
design, may be performed in conjunction with the emission control system 
modifications at the low-mileage test point, and shall be approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (4) Repairs to vehicle components of an emission data vehicle other 
than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be 
performed only as

[[Page 130]]

a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, or with the 
advance approval of the Administrator.
    (f) Equipment, instruments, or tools may not be used to identify 
malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the 
same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools will be available to 
dealerships and other service outlets and:
    (1) Are used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such 
components, or
    (2) Are used subsequent to the identification of a vehicle or engine 
malfunction, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for 
durability data vehicles or in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for 
emission-data vehicles, or
    (3) Unless specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (g)(1) Paragraph (g) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles.
    (2) Complete emission tests (see Secs. 86.106 through 86.145) are 
required, unless waived by the Administrator, before and after scheduled 
maintenance approved for durability data vehicles. The manufacturer may 
perform emission tests before unscheduled maintenance. Complete emission 
tests are required after unscheduled maintenance which may reasonably be 
expected to affect emissions. The Administrator may waive the 
requirement to test after unscheduled maintenance. These test data may 
be submitted weekly to the Administrator, but shall be air posted or 
delivered within 7 days after completion of the tests, along with a 
complete record of all pertinent maintenance, including a preliminary 
engineering report of any malfunction diagnosis and the corrective 
action taken. A complete engineering report shall be delivered to the 
Administrator concurrently with the manufacturer's application for 
certification.
    (h) All test data, maintenance reports, and required engineering 
reports shall be compiled and provided to the Administrator in 
accordance with Sec. 86.090-23.

<R05>
Sec. 86.090-26  Mileage and service accumulation; emission requirements.

    (a)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles.
    (2) The procedure for mileage accumulation will be the Durability 
Driving Schedule as specified in appendix IV to this part. A modified 
procedure may also be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. 
Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, all vehicles will 
accumulate mileage at a measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds 
of the estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100 
pounds of being included in the next higher inertia weight class as 
specified in Sec. 86.129, the manufacturer may elect to conduct the 
respective emission tests at higher loaded vehicle weight.
    (3) Emission-data vehicles. Unless otherwise provided for in 
Sec. 86.090-23(a), emission-data vehicles shall be operated and tested 
as follows:
    (i) Otto-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for engine 
family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized 
for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, and provide 
to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale used in 
making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 
4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family without making 
a determination. Any vehicle used to represent emission-data vehicle 
selections under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) shall be equipped with an engine 
and emission control system that has accumulated at least the mileage 
determined under this paragraph. Fuel economy data generated from 
certification vehicles selected in accordance with Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) 
with engine-system combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 
kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be factored in accordance with 
Sec. 600.006-82(c). Complete exhaust and evaporative (if required) 
emission tests shall be conducted for each emission-data vehicle 
selection under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1). The Administrator may determine 
under Sec. 86.090-24(f) that no testing is required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under

[[Page 131]]

Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (v) or (viii) shall be conducted at the mileage at 
which the engine system combination is stabilized for emission testing 
under high-altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emissions tests for emission-data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (i), (ii), 
(iii), (iv), or (vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage at which the 
engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing under low-
altitude conditions.
    (D) For each engine family, the manufacturer will either select one 
vehicle previously selected under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (i) through (iv) 
to be tested under high-altitude conditions or provide a statement in 
accordance with Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1)(v). Vehicles shall meet emission 
standards under both low- and high-altitude conditions without manual 
adjustments or modifications. In addition, any emission control device 
used to conform with the emission standards under high-altitude 
conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher than 4,000 
feet above sea level.
    (ii) Diesel. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each engine 
family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized 
for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, and provide 
to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale used in 
making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 
4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family without making 
a determination. Any vehicle used to represent emission-data vehicle 
selections under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) shall be equipped with an engine 
and emission control system that has accumulated at least the mileage 
determined under this paragraph. Fuel economy data generated from 
certification vehicles selected in accordance with Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) 
with engine-system combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 
kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be factored in accordance with 
Sec. 600.006-82(c). Complete exhaust emission tests shall be conducted 
for each emission-data vehicle selection under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1). The 
Administrator may determine under Sec. 86.090-24(f) that no testing is 
required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1)(v) shall be conducted at the mileage at which 
the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing under 
low-altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emission tests for emission-data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (i) through 
(iv) shall be conducted at the mileage at which the engine-system 
combination is stabilized for emission testing under low-altitude 
conditions.
    (D) For each engine family, the manufacturer will either select one 
vehicle previously selected under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (i) through (iv) 
to be tested under high-altitude conditions or provide a statement in 
accordance with Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1)(v). Vehicles shall meet emission 
standards under both low- and high-altitude conditions without manual 
adjustments or modifications. In addition, any emission control device 
used to conform with the emission standards under high-altitude 
conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher than 4,000 
feet above sea level.
    (4)(i) Durability data vehicles. (A) Unless otherwise provided for 
in Sec. 86.090-23(a), each durability-data vehicle shall be driven, with 
all emission control systems installed and operating, for 50,000 miles 
or such lesser distance as the Administrator may agree to as meeting the 
objective of this procedure.
    (B) Complete exhaust emission tests shall be made at test point 
mileage intervals that the manufacturer determines.
    (C) At a minimum, two complete exhaust emission tests shall be made. 
The first test shall be made at a distance not greater than 6,250 miles. 
The last shall be made at 50,000 miles.
    (D) The mileage interval between test points must be of equal length 
except for the interval between zero miles and the first test, and any 
interval before or after testing conducted in conjunction with vehicle 
maintenance as specified in Sec. 86.090-25(g)(2).
    (ii) The manufacturer may, at its option, alter the durability-data 
vehicle at the selected test point to represent

[[Page 132]]

emission-data vehicle(s) within the same engine/system combination and 
perform emission tests on the altered vehicle. Upon completion of 
emission testing, the manufacturer may return the test vehicle to the 
durability-data vehicle configuration prior to the continuation of 
mileage accumulation.
    (5)(i) All tests required by this subpart on emission-data vehicles 
shall be conducted at a mileage equal to or greater than the mileage the 
manufacturer determines under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (ii) All tests required by this subpart on durability-data vehicles 
shall be conducted within 250 miles of each of the test points.
    (6)(i)(A) The manufacturer may conduct multiple tests at any test 
point at which the data are intended to be used in the deterioration 
factor. At each test point where multiple tests are conducted, the test 
results from all valid tests shall be averaged to determine the data 
point to be used in the deterioration factor calculation, except under 
paragraph (a)(6)(i)(B) of this section. The test results from emission 
tests performed before maintenance affecting emissions shall not be 
averaged with test results after the maintenance.
    (B) The manufacturer is not required to average multiple tests if 
the manufacturer conducts no more than three tests at each test point 
and if the number of tests at each test point is equal. All test points 
must be treated the same for all exhaust pollutants.
    (ii) The results of all emission testing shall be supplied to the 
Administrator. The manufacturer shall furnish to the Administrator 
explanation for voiding any test. The Administrator will determine if 
voiding the test was appropriate based upon the explanation given by the 
manufacturer for the voided test. Tests between test points may be 
conducted as required by the Administrator. Data from all tests 
(including voided tests) may be submitted weekly to the Administrator, 
but shall be air posted or delivered to the Administrator within 7 days 
after completion of the test. In addition, all test data shall be 
compiled and provided to the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 86.090-23. Where the Administrator conducts a test on a durability-
data vehicle at a prescribed test point, the results of that test will 
be used in the calculation of the deterioration factor.
    (iii) The results of all emission tests shall be rounded, in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67, to the number of decimal places contained 
in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional 
significant figure.
    (7) Whenever a manufacturer intends to operate and test a vehicle 
which may be used for emission or durability data, the manufacturer 
shall retain in its records all information concerning all emissions 
tests and maintenance, including vehicle alterations to represent other 
vehicle selections. For emission-data vehicles, this information shall 
be submitted, including the vehicle description and specification 
information required by the Administrator, to the Administrator 
following the emission-data test. For durability-data vehicles, this 
information shall be submitted following the 5,000-mile test.
    (8) Once a manufacturer submits the information required in 
paragraphs (a)(7) of this section for a durability-data vehicle, the 
manufacturer shall continue to run the vehicle to 50,000 miles, and the 
data from the vehicle will be used in the calculations under 
Sec. 86.090-28. Discontinuation of a durability-data vehicle shall be 
allowed only with the consent of the Administrator.
    (9)(i) The Administrator may elect to operate and test any test 
vehicle during all or any part of the mileage accumulation and testing 
procedure. In such cases, the manufacturer shall provide the vehicle(s) 
to the Administrator with all information necessary to conduct this 
testing.
    (ii) The test procedures in Secs. 86.106 through 86.145 will be 
followed by the Administrator. The Administrator will test the vehicles 
at each test point. Maintenance may be performed by the manufacturer 
under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.
    (iii) The data developed by the Administrator for the engine-system 
combination shall be combined with any applicable data supplied by the 
manufacturer on other vehicles of that combination to determine the 
applicable

[[Page 133]]

deterioration factors for the combination. In the case of a significant 
discrepancy between data developed by the Administrator and that 
submitted by the manufacturer, the Administrator's data shall be used in 
the determination of deterioration factors.
    (10) Emission testing of any type with respect to any certification 
vehicle other than that specified in this part is not allowed except as 
such testing may be specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (11) This section does not apply to testing conducted to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 86.090-23(b)(2).
    (b)(1) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to light-duty trucks.
    (2) There are three types of mileage or service accumulation 
applicable to light-duty trucks:
    (i) Mileage or service accumulation on vehicles, engines, 
subsystems, or components selected by the manufacturer under 
Sec. 86.090-24(c)(2)(i). The manufacturer determines the form and extent 
of this mileage or service accumulation, consistent with good 
engineering practice, and describes it in the application for 
certification.
    (ii) Mileage accumulation of the duration selected by the 
manufacturer on emission-data vehicles selected under Sec. 86.090-
24(b)(1). The procedure for mileage accumulation will be the Durability 
Driving Schedule as specified in appendix IV to this part. A modified 
procedure may also be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. 
Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, all vehicles will 
accumulate mileage at a measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds 
of the estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100 
pounds of being included in the next higher inertia weight class as 
specified in Sec. 86.129, the manufacturer may elect to conduct the 
respective emission tests at the test weight corresponding to the higher 
loaded vehicle weight.
    (iii) Service or mileage accumulation which may be part of the test 
procedures used by the manufacturer to establish evaporative emission 
deterioration factors.
    (3) Exhaust emission deterioration factors will be determined on the 
basis of the mileage or service accumulation described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section and related testing, according to the 
manufacturer's procedures.
    (4) Each emission-data vehicle shall be operated and tested as 
follows:
    (i) Otto-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each 
engine family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, 
and provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale 
used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to 
accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family 
without making a determination. Any vehicle used to represent emission-
data vehicle selections under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) shall be equipped 
with an engine and emission control system that has accumulated at least 
the mileage determined under this paragraph. Fuel economy data generated 
from certification vehicles selected in accordance with Sec. 86.090-
24(b)(1) with engine-system combinations that have accumulated more than 
10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be factored in accordance with 
Sec. 600.006-82(c). Complete exhaust emission tests shall be conducted 
for each emission-data vehicle selection under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1). The 
Administrator may determine under Sec. 86.090-24(f) that no testing is 
required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (v) or (viii) shall be conducted at the 
mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing or at 6,436 kilometers (4,000-miles) under high-
altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emission tests for emission-data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (ii), (iii), 
(iv)(A), or (vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage at which the 
engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing or at the 
6,436-kilometer (4,000-mile) test point under low-altitude conditions.
    (D) If the manufacturer recommends adjustments or modifications in 
order to conform to emission standards at high altitude, such 
adjustments or modifications shall be made to the test vehicle selected 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (v) and (viii) (in accordance with the

[[Page 134]]

instructions to be provided to the ultimate purchaser) before being 
tested under high-altitude conditions.
    (ii) Diesel. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each engine 
family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized 
for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, and provide 
to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale used in 
making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 
4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family without making 
a determination. Any vehicle used to represent emission-data vehicle 
selections under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) shall be equipped with an engine 
and emission control system that has accumulated at least the mileage 
determined under this paragraph. Fuel economy data generated from 
certification vehicles selected in accordance with Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) 
with engine-system combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 
kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be factored in accordance with 
Sec. 600.006-82(c). Complete exhaust emission tests shall be conducted 
for each emission-data vehicle selection under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1). The 
Administrator may determine under Sec. 86.090-24(f) that no testing is 
required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (v) or (viii) shall be conducted at the 
mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing or at 6,436-kilometer (4,000-miles) under high-altitude 
conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emission tests for emission-data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (ii), (iii), 
(iv)(A), or (vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage at which the 
engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing or at the 
6,436-kilometer (4,000-mile) test point under low-altitude conditions.
    (D) If the manufacturer recommends adjustments or modifications in 
order to conform to emission standards at high altitude, such 
adjustments or modifications shall be made to the test vehicle selected 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (v) and (viii) (in accordance with the 
instructions to be provided to the ultimate purchaser) before being 
tested under high-altitude conditions.
    (ii) Diesel. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each engine 
family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized 
for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, and provide 
to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale used in 
making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 
4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family without making 
a determination. Any vehicle used to represent emission-data vehicle 
selections under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) shall be equipped with an engine 
and emission control system that has accumulated at least the mileage 
determined under this paragraph. Fuel economy data generated from 
certification vehicles selection in accordance with Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) 
with engine-system combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 
kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be factored in accordance with 
Sec. 600.006-82(c). Complete exhaust emission tests shall be conducted 
for each emission-data vehicle selection under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1). The 
Administrator may determine under Sec. 86.090-24(f) that no testing is 
required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1)(v) shall be conducted at the mileage at which 
the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing or at 
the 6,436-kilometer (4,000-mile) test point under low-altitude 
conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emission tests for emission-data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (ii), (iii), 
and (iv) shall be conducted at the mileage at which the engine-system 
combination is stabilized for emission testing or at the 6,436-kilometer 
(4,000-mile) test point under low-altitude conditions.
    (D) If the manufacturer recommends adjustments or modifications in 
order to conform to emission standards at high altitude, such 
adjustments or modifications shall be made to the test vehicle selected 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) (v) and (viii) (in accordance with the 
instructions to be provided to the ultimate purchaser) before being 
tested under high-altitude conditions.

[[Page 135]]

    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) All tests required by this subpart on emission-data vehicles 
shall be conducted at a mileage equal to or greater than the mileage the 
manufacturer determines under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (c)(1) Paragraph (c) of this section applies to heavy-duty engines.
    (2) There are two types of service accumulation applicable to heavy-
duty engines:
    (i) Service accumulation on engines, subsystems, or components 
selected by the manufacturer under Sec. 86.088-24(c)(3)(i). The 
manufacturer determines the form and extent of this service 
accumulation, consistent with good engineering practice, and describes 
it in the application for certification.
    (ii) Dynamometer service accumulation on emission-data engines 
selected under Sec. 86.090-24(b) (2) or (3). The manufacturer determines 
the engine operating schedule to be used for dynamometer service 
accumulation, consistent with good engineering practice. A single engine 
operating schedule shall be used for all engines in an engine family-
control system combination. Operating schedules may be different for 
different combinations.
    (3) Exhaust emission deterioration factors will be determined on the 
basis of the service accumulation described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section and related testing, according to the manufacturer's 
procedures.
    (4) The manufacturer shall determine, for each engine family, the 
number of hours at which the engine system combination is stabilized for 
emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, and provide to 
the Administrator if requested a record of the rationale used in making 
this determination. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 125 hours 
on each test engine within an engine family without making a 
determination. Any engine used to represent emission-data engine 
selections under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(2) shall be equipped with an engine 
system combination that has accumulated at least the number of hours 
determined under this paragraph. Complete exhaust emission tests shall 
be conducted for each emission-data engine selection under Sec. 86.090-
24(b)(2). Evaporative emission controls need not be connected provided 
normal operating conditions are maintained in the engine induction 
system. The Administrator may determine under Sec. 86.090-24(f) that no 
testing is required.
    (d)(1) Paragraph (d) of this section applies to both light-duty 
trucks and heavy-duty engines.
    (2)(i) The results of all emission testing shall be supplied to the 
Administrator. The manufacturer shall furnish to the Administrator 
explanation for voiding any test. The Administrator will determine if 
voiding the test was appropriate based upon the explanation given by the 
manufacturer for the voided test. Tests between test points may be 
conducted as required by the Administrator. Data from all tests 
(including voided tests) may be submitted weekly to the Administrator, 
but shall be air posted or delivered to the Administrator within 7 days 
after completion of the tests. In addition, all test data shall be 
compiled and provided to the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 86.090-23. Where the Administrator conducts a test on a durability-
data vehicle at a prescribed test point, the results of that test will 
be used in the calculation of the deterioration factor.
    (ii) The results of all emission tests shall be recorded and 
reported to the Administrator. These test results shall be rounded, in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67, to the number of decimal places contained 
in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional 
significant figure.
    (3) Whenever a manufacturer intends to operate and test a vehicle 
(or engine) which may be used for emission data, the manufacturer shall 
retain in its records all information concerning all emissions tests and 
maintenance, including vehicle (or engine) alterations to represent 
other vehicle (or engine) selections. This information shall be 
submitted, including the vehicle (or engine) description and 
specification information required by the Administrator, to the 
Administrator following the emission-data test.
    (4)-(5) [Reserved]
    (6) Emission testing of any type with respect to any certification 
vehicle or engine other than that specified in this subpart is not 
allowed except as such

[[Page 136]]

testing may be specifically authorized by the Administrator.

Sec. 86.090-27  Special test procedures.

    (a) The Administrator may, on the basis of written application by a 
manufacturer, prescribe test procedures, other than those set forth in 
this part, for any light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, heavy-duty 
engine, or heavy-duty vehicle which the Administrator determines is not 
susceptible to satisfactory testing by the procedures set forth in this 
part.
    (b) If the manufacturer does not submit a written application for 
use of special test procedures but the Administrator determines that a 
light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, heavy-duty engine, or heavy-duty 
vehicle is not susceptible to satisfactory testing by the procedures set 
forth in this part, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in 
writing and set forth the reasons for such rejection in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 86.090-22(c).

Sec. 86.091-2  Definitions.

    The definitions of Sec. 86.090-2 remain effective. The definitions 
listed in this section apply beginning with the 1991 model year.
    Urban bus means a heavy heavy-duty diesel-powered passenger-carrying 
vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen or more passengers and intended 
primarily for intra-city operation, i.e., within the confines of a city 
or greater metropolitan area. Urban bus operation is characterized by 
short rides and frequent stops. To facilitate this type of operation, 
more than one set of quick-operating entrance and exit doors would 
normally be installed. Since fares are usually paid in cash or tokens 
rather than purchased in advance in the form of tickets, urban buses 
would normally have equipment installed for collection of fares. Urban 
buses are also typically characterized by the absence of equipment and 
facilities for long distance travel, e.g., rest rooms, large luggage 
compartments, and facilities for stowing carry-on luggage. The useful 
life for urban buses is the same as the useful life for other heavy 
heavy-duty diesel engines.

operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without 
charge to EPA whether or not the applicant controls the facility.
    (6) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement 
Officer or EPA authorized representative applies whether or not the 
applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to 
domestic and to foreign manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not 
attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local 
law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to do what is 
necessary to insure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no 
informed judgment that a vehicle or engine is certifiable or is covered 
by a certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the 
responsibility of the manufacturer to locate its testing and 
manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not 
arise.
    (7) For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) Presentation of credentials shall mean display of the document 
designating a person as an EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized 
representative.
    (ii) Where vehicle, component, or engine storage areas or facilities

accumulation, production or compilation of records, or any other 
procedure or activity related to certification testing, to translation 
of designs from the test stage to the production stage, or to vehicle 
(or engine) manufacture or assembly is being carried out in a facility.
    (iv) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, 
clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services, the making 
available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during 
their working hours to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA 
authorized representative of how the facility operates and to answer his 
questions, and the performance on request of emissions tests on any 
vehicle (or engine) which is being, has been, or will be used for 
certification testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may 
require appropriate mileage (or service) accumulation. A manufacturer 
may be compelled to cause the personal appearance of any employee at 
such a facility before an EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized 
representative by written request for his appearance, signed by the 
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, served on the 
manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by the 
manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented, 
and advised by counsel.
    (v) Any entry without 24 hour prior written or oral notification to 
the affected manufacturer shall be authorized in writing by the 
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.
    (8) EPA may void ab initio a certificate of conformity for vehicle 
or engine families introduced into commerce if the manufacturer (or 
contractor for the manufacturer, if applicable) fails to comply with any 
provision of this section.
    (e) EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives are 
authorized to seek a warrant or court order authorizing the EPA 
Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct 
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section, as 
appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this section. EPA 
Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives may proceed ex 
parte to obtain a warrant whether or not the Enforcement Officers first 
attempted to seek permission of the manufacturer or the party in charge 
of the facilities in question to conduct activities related to entry and 
access as authorized in this section.
    (f) A manufacturer shall permit EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA 
authorized representatives who present a warrant or court order as 
described in paragraph (e) of this section to conduct activities related 
to entry and access as authorized in this section and as described in 
the warrant or court order. The manufacturer shall cause those in charge 
of its facility or facility operated for its benefit to permit EPA 
Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct 
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section 
pursuant to a warrant or court order whether or not the manufacturer 
controls the facility. In the absence of such a warrant or court order, 
EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives may conduct 
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section 
only upon the consent of the manufacturer or the party in charge of the 
facilities in question.
    (g) It is not a violation of this part or the Clean Air Act for any 
person to refuse to permit EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized 
representatives to conduct activities related to entry and access as 
authorized in this section without a warrant or court order.

Sec. 86.091-9  Emission standards for 1991 and later model year light-duty trucks.

    (a)(1) The standards set forth in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section shall apply to light-duty trucks sold for principal use at other 
than a designated high-altitude location. Exhaust emissions from 1991 
and later model year light-duty trucks shall not exceed:
    (i)(A) Hydrocarbons (for petroleum-fueled Otto-cycle and diesel 
light-duty trucks). 0.80 gram per vehicle mile (0.50 gram per vehicle 
kilometer).
    (B) Total Hydrocarbon Equivalent (for methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and 
diesel

[[Page 141]]

light-duty trucks). 0.80 gram per vehicle mile (0.50 gram per vehicle 
kilometer).
    (ii) Carbon monoxide.
    (A) 10 grams per vehicle mile (6.2 grams per vehicle kilometer).
    (B) 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle (for Otto-cycle 
and methanol-fueled diesel light-duty trucks only).
    (iii) Oxides of nitrogen.
    (A) For light-duty trucks up to and including 3,750 lbs loaded 
vehicle weight, 1.2 grams per vehicle mile (0.75 gram per vehicle 
kilometer).
    (B) For light-duty trucks greater loaded vehicle weight, 1.7 grams 
per vehicle mile (1.1 grams per vehicle kilometer).
    (C) A manufacturer may elect to include any light-duty truck engine 
families in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program, provided that it does 
not elect to pay an NCP for noncompliance with any emission standard 
applicable to that light-duty truck family. Trucks produced for sale in 
California or in designated high-altitude areas may be averaged only 
within each of those areas. Petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled engine 
families may not be averaged together. Otto-cycle and diesel engine 
families may not be averaged together. If the manufacturer elects to 
participate in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program, individual family 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limits may not exceed 2.3 grams per mile. If the 
manufacturer elects to average together NO<INF>X</INF> emissions of 
light-duty trucks subject to the standards of paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(A) 
and (a)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, its composite NO<INF>X</INF> 
standard applies to the combined fleets of light-duty trucks up to and 
including, and over, 3750 lbs loaded vehicle weight included in the 
average, and is calculated as defined in Sec. 86.088-2.
    (iv) Particulate (for diesel light-duty trucks only).
    (A) For light-duty trucks up to and including 3,750 lbs loaded 
vehicle weight, 0.26 gram per vehicle mile (0.16 gram per vehicle 
kilometer).
    (B) For light-duty trucks 3,751 lbs and greater loaded vehicle 
weight, 0.13 gram per vehicle mile (0.08 gram per vehicle kilometer).
    (C) A manufacturer may elect to include any diesel light-duty truck 
engine families in the appropriate particulate averaging program 
(petroleum and methanol), provided that it does not elect to pay an NCP 
for noncompliance with any emission standard applicable to that light-
duty truck family. Trucks produced for sale in California or in 
designated high-altitude areas may be averaged only within each of those 
areas, and light-duty trucks subject to the standard of paragraph 
(a)(1)(iv)(B) of this section may be averaged only with other light-duty 
trucks subject to the standard of paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(B) of this 
section. Averaging is not permitted between fuel types. If the 
manufacturer elects to average both light-duty trucks subject to the 
standards of paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section and light-duty 
vehicles together in the appropriate particulate averaging program, its 
composite particulate standard applies to the combined set of light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks that are included in the average and is 
calculated as defined in Sec. 86.088-2.
    (2) The standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii)(A), 
(a)(1)(iii), and (a)(1)(iv) of this section refer to the exhaust emitted 
over a driving schedule as set forth in subpart B of this part and 
measured and calculated in accordance with those procedures. The 
standard set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section refers to 
the exhaust emitted at curb idle and measured and calculated in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart P of this part.
    (b) Fuel evaporative emissions from 1991 and later model year light-
duty trucks shall not exceed (compliance with these standards is 
optional for 1991 model year methanol-fueled vehicles):
    (1) Hydrocarbons (for gasoline-fueled light-duty trucks). 2.0 grams 
per test.

[[Page 143]]

for exemption if the requirements of either paragraph (g)(2) (i), (ii), 
(iii), or (iv) of this section are met.
    (i) Its design parameters (displacement-to-weight ratio (D/W) and 
engine speed-to-vehicle-speed ratio (N/V)) fall within the exempted 
range for that manufacturer for that year. The exempted range is 
determined according to the following procedure:
    (A) The manufacturer shall graphically display the D/W and N/V data 
of all vehicle configurations it will offer for the model year in 
question. The axis of the abscissa shall be D/W (where (D) is the engine 
displacement expressed in cubic centimeters and (W) is the gross vehicle 
weight (GVW) expressed in pounds), and the axis of the ordinate shall be 
N/V (where (N) is the crankshaft speed expressed in revolutions per 
minute and (V) is the vehicle speed expressed in miles per hour). At the 
manufacturer's option, either the 1:1 transmission gear ratio or the 
lowest numerical gear ratio available in the transmission will be used 
to determine N/V. The gear selection must be the same for all N/V data 
points on the manufacturer's graph. For each transmission/axle ratio 
combination, only the lowest N/V value shall be used in the graphical 
display.
    (B) The product line is then defined by the equation, N/V = C(D/
W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP> where the constant, C, is determined by the 
requirement that all the vehicle data points either fall on the line or 
lie to the upper right of the line as displayed on the graphs.
    (C) The exemption line is then defined by the equation, N/V = C(0.84 
D/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP> where the constant, C, is the same as that found in 
paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
    (D) The exempted range includes all values of N/V and D/W which 
simultaneously fall to the lower left of the exemption line as drawn on 
the graph.
    (ii) Its design parameters fall within the alternate exempted range 
for that manufacturer that year. The alternate exempted range is 
determined by substituting rated horsepower (hp) for displacement (D) in 
the exemption procedure described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section 
and by using the product line N/V = C(hp/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>.
    (A) Rated horsepower shall be determined by using the Society of 
Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J 1349, or any subsequent version of 
that test procedure. Any of the horsepower determinants within that test 
procedure may be used, as long as it is used consistently throughout the 
manufacturer's product line in any model year.
    (B) No exemptions will be allowed under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this 
section to any manufacturer that has exempted vehicle configurations as 
set forth in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Its acceleration time (the time it takes a vehicle to 
accelerate from 0 to a speed not less than 40 miles per hour and not 
greater than 50 miles per hour) under high-altitude conditions is 
greater than the largest acceleration time under low-altitude conditions 
for that manufacturer for that year. The procedure to be followed in 
making this determination is:
    (A) The manufacturer shall list the vehicle configuration and 
acceleration time under low-altitude conditions of that vehicle 
configuration which has the highest acceleration time under low-altitude 
conditions of all the vehicle configurations it will offer for the model 
year in question. The manufacturer shall also submit a description of 
the methodology used to make this determination.
    (B) The manufacturer shall then list the vehicle configurations and 
acceleration times under high-altitude conditions of all those vehicles 
configurations which have higher acceleration times under high-altitude 
conditions than the highest acceleration time at low altitude identified 
in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (iv) In lieu of performing the test procedure of paragraph 
(g)(2)(iii) of this section, its acceleration time can be estimated 
based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation, in accordance with 
good engineering practice, to meet the exemption criteria of paragraph 
(g)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at a designated high-
altitude location that has been exempted as set forth in paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section

[[Page 144]]

will be considered a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air 
Act.

<R05>
Sec. 86.091-15  NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines.

    (a)(1) Heavy-duty engines eligible for the NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate averaging, trading, and banking programs are described in 
the applicable emission standards sections in this subpart. 
Participation in these programs is voluntary.
    (2)(i) Engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable standard 
shall obtain emission credits in a mass amount sufficient to address the 
shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, trading, or banking, 
within the averaging set restrictions described in this section.
    (ii) Engine families with FELs below the applicable standard will 
have emission credits available to average, trade, bank or a combination 
thereof. Credits may not be used to offset emissions that exceed an FEL. 
Credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity determined by 
a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing. However, credits may 
be used to allow subsequent production of engines for the family in 
question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (iii) Engine families within a given averaging set may not both 
generate and use like emission credits in the same model year. This 
restriction is to be applied on a pollutant-specific basis.
    (b) Participation in the NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate 
averaging, trading, and banking programs shall be done as follows.
    (1) During certification, the manufacturer shall:
    (i) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the 
averaging, trading and/or banking programs. Separate declarations are 
required for each program and for each pollutant (i.e., NO<INF>X</INF> 
and particulate).
    (ii) Declare an FEL for each engine family participating in one or 
more of these three programs.
    (A) The FEL must be to the same level of significant digits as the 
emission standard (one-tenth of a gram per brake horsepower for 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions and one-hundredth of a gram per brake 
horsepower-hour for particulate emissions).
    (B) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in the 
section concerning the applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate emission standards.
    (iii) Calculate the projected emission credits ( + / - ) based on 
quarterly production projections for each participating family and for 
each pollutant (NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate), using the equation in 
paragraph (c) of this section and the applicable factors for the 
specific engine family.
    (iv)(A) Determine and state the source of the needed credits 
according to quarterly projected production for engine families 
requiring credits for certification.
    (B) State where the quarterly projected credits will be applied for 
engine families generating credits.
    (C) Credits may be obtained from or applied to only engine families 
within the same averaging set as described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section. Credits available for averaging, trading, or banking as 
defined in Sec. 86.090-2, may be applied to a given engine famil(y) 
(ies), or reserved as defined in Sec. 86.091-2.

[[Page 149]]

    (2) Based on this information each manufacturer's certification 
application must demonstrate:
    (i) That at the end of model year production, each engine family has 
a net emissions credit balance of zero or more using the methodology in 
paragraph (c) of this section with any credits obtained from averaging, 
trading or banking.
    (ii) The source of the credits to be used to comply with the 
emission standard if the FEL exceeds the standard, or where credits will 
be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where 
credits are being obtained, each engine family involved must state 
specifically the source (manufacturer/engine family) of the credits 
being used. In cases where credits are being generated/supplied, each 
engine family involved must state specifically the designated use 
(manufacturer/engine family or reserved) of the credits involved. All 
such reports shall include all credits involved in averaging, trading or 
banking.
    (3) During the model year manufacturers must:
    (i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that 
compliance with the emission standards is achieved at the end of the 
model year.
    (ii) Provide the end of-model year reports required under 
Sec. 86.091-23.
    (iii) Maintain the quarterly records required under Sec. 86.091-
7(c)(8).
    (4) Projected credits based on information supplied in the 
certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of 
conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of 
end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any other verification 
steps deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
    (5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be 
determined at the end of the model year. Engine families without an 
adequate amount of actual NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate emission 
credits will violate the conditions of the certificate of conformity. 
The certificates of conformity may be voided ab initio for those engine 
families.
    (6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error 
occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this 
section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be 
recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous 
negative credit balances may be adjusted by EPA.
    (i) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates 
an inadvertent credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to 
purchase the necessary credits to bring the credit balance for that 
engine family to zero, at the ratio of 1.2 credits purchased for every 
credit needed to bring the balance to zero. If sufficient credits are 
not available to bring the credit balance for the engine family in 
question to zero, EPA may void the certificate for that engine family ab 
initio.
    (ii) If within 90 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year 
report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's 
favor (i.e., resulting in a positive credit balance) or if the 
manufacturer discovers such an error within 90 days of EPA receipt of 
the end-of-year report, the credits will be restored for use by the 
manufacturer.
    (c)(1) For each participating engine family, NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate emission credits (positive or negative) are to be calculated 
according to one of the following equations and rounded, in accordance 
with ASTM E29-67, to the nearest one-tenth of a Megagram (Mg). 
Consistent units are to be used throughout the equation.
    For determining credit need for all engine families and credit 
availability for engine families generating credits for averaging 
programs only:

Emission credits=(Std-FEL) x (CF) x (UL) x - 
(Production) x (10<SUP>-6</SUP>)

    For determining credit availability for engine families generating 
credits for trading or banking programs:

Emission credits=(Std-FEL) x (CF) x (UL) x - 
(Production) x (10<SUP>-6</SUP>) x (0.8)

Where:

Std=the current and applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> or 
particulate emission standard in grams per brake horsepower hour or 
grams per Megajoule.
FEL=the NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate family emission limit for the 
engine family in grams per brake horsepower-hour or grams per Megajoule.

[[Page 150]]

CF=a transient cycle conversion factor in BHP-hr/mi or MJ/mi, as given 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
UL=the useful life, or alternative life as described in paragraph (f) of 
Sec. 86.090-21, for the given engine family in miles.
Production=the number of engines produced for U.S. sales within the 
given engine family during the model year. Quarterly production 
projections are used for initial certification. Actual production is 
used for end-of-year compliance determination.
0.8=a one-time discount applied to all credits to be banked or traded 
within the model year generated. Banked credits traded in a subsequent 
model year will not be subject to an additional discount. Banked credits 
used in a subsequent model year's averaging program will not have the 
discount restored.

    (2) The transient cycle conversion factor is the total (integrated) 
cycle brake horsepower-hour or Megajoules, divided by the equivalent 
mileage of the applicable transient cycle. For Otto-cycle heavy-duty 
engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3 miles. For diesel heavy-duty 
engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.5 miles. When more than one 
configuration is chosen by EPA to be tested in the certification of an 
engine family (as described in Sec. 86.085-24), the conversion factor 
used is to be based upon the configuration generating the highest 
conversion factor when determining credit need and the lowest conversion 
factor when determining credit availability for banking, trading or 
averaging.
    (d) Averaging sets for NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits: The 
averaging and trading of NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits will only be 
allowed between heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set and 
in the same regional category. Engines produced for sale in California 
constitute a separate regional category than engines produced for sale 
in the other 49 states. Banking and trading are not applicable to 
engines sold in California. The averaging sets for the averaging and 
trading of NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits for heavy-duty engines are 
defined as follows:
    (1) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines:
    (i) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines constitute an averaging set. 
Averaging and trading among all Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families is 
allowed. There are no subclass restrictions.
    (ii) Gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles certified under the 
provisions of Sec. 86.085-1(b) may not average or trade credits with 
gasoline-fueled heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines, but may average or trade 
credits with light-duty trucks.
    (2) For diesel cycle heavy-duty engines:
    (i) Each of the three primary intended service classes for heavy-
duty diesel engines, as defined in Sec. 86.090-2, constitute an 
averaging set. Averaging and trading among all diesel cycle engine 
families within the same primary service class is allowed.
    (ii) Urban buses are treated as members of the primary intended 
service class where they would otherwise fall.
    (e) Averaging sets for particulate emission credits. The averaging 
and trading of particulate emission credits will only be allowed between 
diesel cycle heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set and in 
the same regional category. Engines produced for sale in California 
constitute a separate regional category than engines produced for sale 
in the other 49 states. Banking and trading are not applicable to 
engines sold in California. The averaging sets for the averaging and 
trading of particulate emission credits for diesel cycle heavy-duty 
engines are defined as follows:
    (1) Engines intended for use in urban buses constitute a separate 
averaging set from all other heavy-duty engines. Averaging and trading 
among all diesel cycle bus engine families is allowed.
    (2) For heavy-duty engines, exclusive of urban bus engines, each of 
the three primary intended service classes for heavy-duty diesel cycle 
engines, as defined in Sec. 86.090-2, constitute an averaging set. 
Averaging and trading between diesel cycle engine families within the 
same primary service class is allowed.
    (3) Otto-cycle engines may not participate in particulate averaging, 
trading, or banking.
    (f) Banking of NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate emission credits:
    (1) Credit deposits. (i) Under this phase of the banking program, 
emission credits may be banked from engine families produced during the 
three model years prior to the effective model year of the new HDE 
NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate emission

[[Page 151]]

standard. Credits may not be banked from engine families made during any 
other model years.
    (ii) Manufacturers may bank credits only after the end of the model 
year and after EPA has reviewed their end-of-year report. During the 
model year and before submittal of the end-of-year report, credits 
originally designated in the certification process for banking will be 
considered reserved and may be redesignated for trading or averaging.
    (2) Credit withdrawals. (i) After being generated, banked/reserved 
credits shall be available for use three model years prior to, through 
three model years immediately after the effective date of the new HDE 
NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate emission standard, as applicable. However, 
credits not used within the period specified above shall be forfeited.
    (ii) Manufacturers withdrawing banked emission credits shall 
indicate so during certification and in their credit reports, as 
described in Sec. 86.091-23.
    (3) Use of banked emission credits. The use of banked credits shall 
be within the averaging set and other restrictions described in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and only for the following 
purposes:
    (i) Banked credits may be used in averaging, trading, or in any 
combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits declared 
for banking from the previous model year but unreviewed by EPA may also 
be used. However, they may be revoked at a later time following EPA 
review of the end-of-year report or any subsequent audit actions.
    (ii) Banked credits may not be used for NO<INF>X</INF> or 
particulate averaging and trading to offset emissions that exceed an 
FEL. Banked credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity 
determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing. 
However, banked credits may be used for subsequent production of the 
engine family if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (g)(1) The following paragraphs assume NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate nonconformance penalties (NCPs) will be available for the 
1991 and later model year HDEs.
    (2) Engine families paying an NCP for noncompliance of any emission 
standard may not:
    (i) Participate in the averaging program,
    (ii) Generate emission credits for any pollutant under banking and 
trading, and
    (iii) Use emission credits for any pollutant from banking and 
trading.
    (3) If a manufacturer has any engine family to which application of 
NCPs and averaging, banking, and trading credits is desired, that family 
must be separated into two distinct families. One family, whose FEL 
equals the standard, must use NCPs only, while the other, whose FEL does 
not equal the standard, must use emission credits only.
    (4) If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given averaging set 
which is using NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate NCPs, none of that 
manufacturer's engine families in that averaging set may generate 
credits for banking and trading.
    (h) In the event of a negative credit balance in a trading 
situation, both the buyer and the seller would be liable.
    (i) Certification fuel used for credit generation must be of a type 
that is both available in use and expected to be used by the engine 
purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the Administrator, the engine 
manufacturer must provide information acceptable to the Administrator 
that the designated fuel is readily available commercially and would be 
used in customer service.

Sec. 86.091-21  Application for certification.

    (a) A separate application for a certificate of conformity shall be 
made for each set of standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate) and each class of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle 
engines. Such application shall be made to the Administrator by the 
manufacturer and shall be updated and corrected by amendment.
    (b) The application shall be in writing, signed by an authorized 
representative of the manufacturer, and shall include the following:

[[Page 152]]

    (1)(i) Identification and description of the vehicles (or engines) 
covered by the application and a description of their engine (vehicles 
only), emission control system and fuel system components. This shall 
include a detailed description of each auxiliary emission control device 
(AECD) to be installed in or on any certification test vehicle (or 
certification test engine).
    (ii)(A) The manufacturer shall provide to the Administrator in the 
application for certification:
    (1) A list of those parameters which are physically capable of being 
adjusted (including those adjustable parameters for which access is 
difficult) and that, if adjusted to settings other than the 
manufacturer's recommended setting, may affect emissions;
    (2) A specification of the manufacturer's intended physically 
adjustable range of each such parameter, and the production tolerances 
of the limits or stops used to establish the physically adjustable 
range;
    (3) A description of the limits or stops used to establish the 
manufacturer's intended physically adjustable range of each adjustable 
parameter, or any other means used to inhibit adjustment;
    (4) The nominal or recommended setting, and the associated 
production tolerances, for each such parameter.
    (B) The manufacturer may provide, in the application for 
certification, information relating to why certain parameters are not 
expected to be adjusted in actual use and to why the physical limits or 
stops used to establish the physically adjustable range of each 
parameter, or any other means used to inhibit adjustment, are effective 
in preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use vehicles to settings 
outside the manufacturer's intended physically adjustable ranges. This 
may include results of any tests to determine the difficulty of gaining 
access to an adjustment or exceeding a limit as intended or recommended 
by the manufacturer.
    (C) The Administrator may require to be provided detailed drawings 
and descriptions of the various emission related components, and/or 
hardware samples of such components, for the purpose of making his 
determination of which vehicle or engine parameter will be subject to 
adjustment for new certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing 
and of the physically adjustable range for each such vehicle or engine 
parameter.
    (2) Projected U.S. sales data sufficient to enable the Administrator 
to select a test fleet representative of the vehicles (or engines) for 
which certification is requested. The sales data shall also include the 
altitude of intended sale for light-duty trucks.

deterioration factors required to be determined and supplied in 
Sec. 86.091-23(b)(2).
    (ii) For heavy-duty vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or 
methanol-fueled engines, the Administrator does not assume that each 
evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combination will deteriorate in a unique manner during the useful life 
of the vehicle. The manufacturer shall therefore identify those 
evaporative emission deterioration factors which shall be applied to the 
various evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combinations which are expected to exhibit similar deterioration 
characteristics during the useful life of the vehicle.
    (5)(i)(A) A description of the test procedures to be used to 
establish the durability data or the exhaust emission deterioration

maintenance, and the equipment required.
    (B) A description of vehicle adjustments or modifications necessary, 
if any, to assure that light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks covered 
by a certificate of conformity conform to the regulations while being 
operated at any altitude locations, and a statement of the altitude at 
which the adjustments or modifications apply.
    (iv) At the option of the manufacturer, the proposed composition of 
the emission-data test fleet or (where applicable) the durability-data 
test fleet.
    (6)(i)(A) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the 
particulate averaging program for diesel light-duty vehicles and/or 
diesel light-duty trucks, the application must list the particulate FEL 
and the projected U.S. (49-state) production volume, by quarter, of the 
family for the model year.
    (B) The manufacturer shall choose the level of the family 
particulate emission limits, accurate to one-hundredth of a gram per 
mile.
    (C) The manufacturer may at any time during production elect to 
change the level of any family particulate emission limit(s) by 
submitting the new limit(s) to the Administrator and by demonstrating 
compliance with the limit(s) as described in Sec. 86.090-2 and 
Sec. 86.091-28(b)(5)(i).
    (ii)(A) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the 
NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program for light-duty trucks, the application 
must list the NO<INF>X</INF> FEL and the projected U.S. (49-state) 
production volume, by quarter, of the family for the model year.
    (B) The manufacturer shall choose the level of the family 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limits, accurate to one-tenth of a gram per 
mile.
    (C) The manufacturer may at any time during production elect to 
change the level of any family NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit(s) by 
submitting the new limits to the Administrator and by demonstrating 
compliance with the limit(s) as described in Sec. 86.088-2 and 86.091-
28(b)(5)(ii).
    (iii) If the manufacturer elects to participate in any of the 
particulate and/or the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging, trading, or banking 
programs for heavy-duty engines, the application must list the 
information required in Sec. 86.091-15 and Sec. 86.091-23.
    (7)(i) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, the application must state 
whether the engine family is being certified for use in all vehicles 
regardless of their Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (see Sec. 86.091-10 
(a)(1)(i) and (a)(3)(i)), or, only for use in vehicles with a Gross 
Vehicle Weight Rating greater than 14,000 pounds.
    (ii) If the engine family is being certified for use in all vehicles 
and, is being certified to the emission standards applicable to Otto-
cycle engines for use only in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight 
Rating over 14,000 pounds under the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of 
Sec. 86.091-10, then the application must also attest that the engine 
family, together with all other engine families being certified under 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 86.091-10, represent no more 
than 5 percent of model year sales of the manufacturer of all Otto-cycle

[[Page 154]]

family-evaporative emission control system combination.
    (f) Light-duty truck and heavy-duty engine manufacturers who believe 
that the useful life periods of Sec. 86.090-2 are significantly 
unrepresentative for one or more engine families (either too long or too 
short), may petition the Administrator to provide an alternative useful-
life period. This petition must include the full rationale behind the 
request together with any supporting data and other evidence. Based on 
this or other information the Administrator may assign an alternative 
useful-life period. Any petition should be submitted in a timely manner, 
to allow adequate time for a thorough evaluation.

or methanol-fueled diesel certification engines the Administrator may, 
on request of the manufacturer, allow the manufacturer to demonstrate 
(on the basis of previous emission tests, development tests, or other 
information) that the engine will conform with the applicable emission 
standards of Sec. 86.091-11.
    (ii) For heavy-duty diesel engines, a manufacturer may submit hot-
start data only, in accordance with subpart N of this part, when making 
application for certification. However, for conformity SEA and recall 
testing by the Agency, both the cold-start and hot-start test data, as 
specified in subpart N of this part, will be included in the official 
results.
    (d) A statement that the vehicles (or engines) for which 
certification is requested conform to the requirements in Sec. 86.084-

<R05>
Sec. 86.091-28  Compliance with emission standards.

    (a)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles.
    (2) The applicable exhaust and fuel evaporative emissions standards 
(and family particulate emission limits, as appropriate) of this subpart 
apply to the emissions of vehicles for their useful life.
    (3) Since it is expected that emission control efficiency will 
change with mileage accumulation on the vehicle, the emission level of a 
vehicle which has accumulated 50,000 miles will be used as the basis for 
determining compliance with the standards (or family particulate 
emission limit, as appropriate).
    (4) The procedure for determining compliance of a new motor vehicle 
with exhaust emission standards (or family particulate emission limit, 
as appropriate) is as follows, except where specified by paragraph 
(a)(7) of this section for the Alternative Durability Program:
    (i) Separate emission deterioration factors shall be determined from 
the exhaust emission results of the durability-data vehicle(s) for each 
engine-system combination. A separate factor shall be established, as 
required for compliance with applicable emission standards for exhaust 
HC, exhaust THCE, exhaust NMHC, exhaust CO, exhaust NO<INF>X</INF> and 
exhaust particulate for each engine-system combination. A separate 
evaporative emission deterioration factor, as required for compliance 
with applicable emission standards, shall be determined for each 
evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combination from the testing conducted by the manufacturer.
    (A) The applicable results to be used unless excluded by paragraph 
(a)(4)(i)(A)(4) of this section in determining the exhaust emission 
deterioration factors for each engine-system combination shall be:
    (1) All valid exhaust emission data from the tests required under 
Sec. 86.084-26(a)(4) except the zero-mile tests. This shall include the 
official test results, as determined in Sec. 86.091-29 for all tests 
conducted on all durability-data vehicles of the combination selected 
under Sec. 86.085-24(c) (including all vehicles elected to be operated 
by the manufacturer under Sec. 86.085-24(c)(1)(ii)).
    (2) All exhaust emission data from the tests conducted before and 
after the scheduled maintenance provided in Sec. 86.088-25.
    (3) All exhaust emission data from tests required by maintenance 
approved under Sec. 86.088-25, in those cases where the Administrator 
conditioned his approval for the performance of

[[Page 158]]

such maintenance on the inclusion of such data in the deterioration 
factor calculation.
    (4) The manufacturer has the option of applying an outlier test 
point procedure to completed durability data within its certification 
testing program for a given model year. The outlier procedure will be 
specified by the Administrator. For any pollutant, durability-data test 
points that are identified as outliers shall not be included in the 
determination of deterioration factors if the manufacturer has elected 
this option. The manufacturer shall specify to the Administrator before 
the certification of the first engine family for that model year, if it 
intends to use the outlier procedure. The manufacturer may not change 
procedures after the first engine family of the model year is certified. 
Where the manufacturer chooses to apply both the outlier procedure and 
averaging (as allowed under Sec. 86.084-26(a)(6)(i)) to the same data 
set, the outlier procedure shall be completed prior to applying the 
averaging procedure.
    (B) All applicable exhaust emission results shall be plotted as a 
function of the mileage on the system, rounded to the nearest mile, and 
the best fit straight lines, fitted by the method of least squares, 
shall be drawn through all these data points. The data will be 
acceptable for use in the calculation of the deterioration factor only 
if the interpolated 4,000-mile and 50,000-mile points on this line are 
within the low-altitude standards provided in Sec. 86.087-8. Exceptions 
to this where data are still acceptable are when a best fit straight 
line crosses an applicable standard but no data points exceeded the 
standard, or the best fit straight line crosses an applicable standard 
with a negative slope (the 4,000-mile interpolated point is higher than 
the 50,000-mile interpolated point) but the 50,000-mile actual data 
point is below the standard. An multiplicative exhaust emission 
deterioration factor shall be calculated for each engine-system 
combination as follows:

Factor=Exhaust emissions interpolated to 50,000 miles divided by exhaust 
          emissions interpolated to 4,000 miles.


These interpolated values shall be carried out to a minimum of four 
places to the right of the decimal point before dividing one by the 
other to determine the deterioration factor. The results shall be 
rounded to three places to the right of the decimal point in accordance 
with ASTM E 29-67.
    (C)(1) An evaporative emissions deterioration factor shall be 
determined from the testing conducted as described in Sec. 86.090-
21(b)(4)(i), for each evaporative emission family- evaporative emission 
control system combination to indicate the evaporative emission level at 
50,000 miles relative to the evaporative emission level at 4,000 miles 
as follows:

Factor = Evaporative emission level at 50,000 miles minus the 
          evaporative emission level at 4,000 miles.

    (2) The factor in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C)(1) of this section shall be 
established to a minimum of two places to the right of the decimal.
    (ii)(A) The official exhaust emission test results for each 
emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be multiplied by 
the appropriate deterioration factor: Provided, that if a deterioration 
factor as computed in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section is less 
than one, that deterioration factor shall be one for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (B) The official evaporative emission test results for each 
evaporative emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be 
adjusted by addition of the appropriate deterioration factor: Provided, 
that if a deterioration factor as computed in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of 
this section is less than zero, that deterioration factor shall be zero 
for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (iii) The emissions to compare with the standard (or the family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted 
emissions of paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section for each 
emission-data vehicle. Before any emission value is compared with the 
standard (or the family particulate emission limit, as appropriate), it 
shall be rounded, in accordance with ASTM E 29-67, to two significant 
figures. The rounded emission values may not exceed the standard (or the 
family particulate emission limit, as appropriate).

[[Page 159]]

    (iv) Every test vehicle of an engine family must comply with the 
exhaust emission standards (or the family particulate emission limit, as 
appropriate), as determined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, 
before any vehicle in that family may be certified.
    (v) Every test vehicle of an evaporative emission family must comply 
with the evaporative emission standard, as determined in paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii) of this section, before any vehicle in that family may be 
certified.
    (5) If a manufacturer chooses to change the level of any family 
particulate emission limit(s) in the particulate averaging program, 
compliance with the new limit(s) must be based upon existing 
certification data.
    (6) If a manufacturer chooses to participate in the diesel 
particulate averaging program, the production-weighted average of the 
family particulate emission limits of all affected engine families must 
comply with the particulate standards in Sec. 86.087-8(a)(1)(iv), or the 
composite particulate standard defined in Sec. 86.085-2, as appropriate, 
at the end of the production year.
    (7) The procedure to determine the compliance of new motor vehicles 
in the Alternative Durability Program (described in Sec. 86.085-13) is 
the same as described in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) through (a)(4)(v) of 
this section. For the engine families that are included in the 
Alternative Durability Program, the exhaust emission deterioration 
factors used to determine compliance shall be those that the 
Administrator has approved under Sec. 86.085-13(c). The evaporative 
emission deterioration factor for each evaporative emission family shall 
be determined and applied according to paragraph (a)(4) of this section. 
The procedures to determine the minimum exhaust emissions deterioration 
factors required under Sec. 86.085-13(d) are as follows:
    (i) Separate deterioration factors shall be determined from the 
exhaust emission results of the durability-data vehicles for each engine 
family group. A separate factor as necessary to establish compliance 
with applicable emission standards shall be established for exhaust HC, 
exhaust THCE, exhaust NMHC, exhaust CO and exhaust NO<INF>X</INF> for 
each engine family group. The evaporative emission deterioration factor 
for each evaporative family will be determined and applied in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The deterioration factors for each engine family group shall be 
determined by the Administrator using historical durability data from as 
many as three previous model years. These data will consist of 
deterioration factors generated by durability-data vehicles representing 
certified engine families and of deterioration factors from vehicles 
selected under Sec. 86.085-24(h). The Administrator shall determine how 
these data will be combined for each engine family group.
    (A) The test result to be used in the calculation of each 
deterioration factor to be combined for each engine family group shall 
be those test results specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this 
section.
    (B) For each durability-data vehicles selected under Sec. 86.085-
24(h), all applicable exhaust emissions results shall be plotted as a 
function of the mileage on the system rounded to the nearest mile, and 
the best fit straight lines, fitted by method of least squares, shall be 
drawn through all these data points. The exhaust deterioration factor 
for each durability-data vehicles shall be calculated as specified in 
paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
    (C) Line-crossing. For the purposes of paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section, line crossing occurs when either of the interpolated 4,000- and 
50,000-mile points of the best fit straight line exceeds the applicable 
emission standard and at least one applicable data point exceeds the 
standard.
    (1) The Administrator will not accept for certification line-
crossing data from preproduction durability-data vehicles selected under 
Sec. 86.085-24(c), Sec. 86.085-24(h)(2), or (h)(3).
    (2) The Administrator will not accept for certification line-
crossing data from production durability-data vehicles selected under 
Sec. 86.085-24(h)(1) unless the 4,000-mile test result multiplied by the 
engine family group deterioration factor does not exceed the applicable 
emission standards. The deterioration factors used for this purpose 
shall be those that were used in the certification of the production 
vehicle.

[[Page 160]]

Manufacturers may calculate this product immediately after the 4,000-
mile test of the vehicle. If the product exceeds the applicable 
standards, the manufacturer may, with the approval of the Administrator, 
discontinue the vehicle and substitute a new vehicle. The manufacturer 
may continue the original vehicle, but the data will not be acceptable 
if line crossing occurs.
    (b)(1) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to light-duty trucks.
    (2) The exhaust and evaporative emission standards (and family 
emission limits, as appropriate) of Sec. 86.091-9 apply to the emissions 
of vehicles for their useful life.
    (3) Since emission control efficiency generally decreases with the 
accumulation of mileage on the vehicle, deterioration factors will be 
used in combination with emission-data vehicle test results as the basis 
for determining compliance with the standards (or family emission 
limits, as appropriate).
    (4)(i) Paragraph (b)(4) of this section describes the procedure for 
determining compliance of a new vehicle with exhaust emission standards 
(or family emission limits, as appropriate), based on deterioration 
factors supplied by the manufacturers, except where specified by 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section for the Alternative Durability Program.
    (ii) Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors, determined 
from tests of vehicles, engines, subsystems or components conducted by 
the manufacturer, shall be supplied for each engine-system combination. 
Separate factors shall be established as required for compliance with 
applicable emission standards for transient HC, THCE, NMHC, CO, and 
NO<INF>X</INF>, idle CO and exhaust particulate.
    (iii) For transient HC, THCE, NMHC and CO, and NO<INF>X</INF>, idle 
CO and/or exhaust particulate as appropriate, the official exhaust 
emission results for each emission-data vehicle at the selected test 
point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate 
deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by 
the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (iv) The emission values to compare with the standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted emission values 
of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section rounded to two significant 
figures in accordance with ASTM E 29-67 for each emission-data engine.
    (5)(i) Paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section applies only to 
manufacturers electing to participate in the particulate averaging 
program.
    (A) If a manufacturer chooses to change the level of any family 
particulate emission limit(s), compliance with the new limit(s) must be 
based upon existing certification data.
    (B) The production-weighted average of the family particulate 
emission limits of all applicable engine families, rounded to two 
significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29-67, must comply with 
the particulate standards in Sec. 86.088-9 (a)(1)(iv) or (d)(1)(iv), or 
the composite particulate standard as defined in Sec. 86.085-2, as 
appropriate, at the end of the product year.
    (ii) Paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section applies only to 
manufacturers electing to participate in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging 
program.
    (A) If a manufacturer chooses to change the level of any family 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit(s), compliance with the new limit(s) must 
be based upon existing certification data.
    (B) The production-weighted average of the family NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission limits of all applicable engine families, rounded to two 
significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29-67, must comply with 
the NO<INF>X</INF> emission standards of Sec. 86.088-9(a)(1)(iii) (A) or 
(B), or of Sec. 86.088-9(d)(1)(iii) (A) or (B), or the composite 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard as defined in Sec. 86.088-2, at the end of the 
product year.
    (6) The procedure to determine the compliance of new motor vehicles 
in the Alternative Durability Program (described in Sec. 86.085-13) is 
the same as described in paragraph (b)(4)(iv), (b)(7)(iv) and (b)(8) of 
this section. For the engine families that are included in the 
Alternative Durability Program, the exhause emission deterioration 
factors used to determine compliance shall be those that the 
Administrator has approved under Sec. 86.085-13(c). The

[[Page 161]]

evaporative emission deterioration factor for each evaporative emission 
family shall be determined and applied according to paragraph (b)(7) of 
this section. The procedures to determine the minimum exhaust emissions 
deterioration factors required under Sec. 86.085-13(d) are as follows:
    (i) Separate deterioration factors shall be determined from the 
exhaust emission results of the durability-data vehicles for each engine 
family group. A separate factor shall be established for exhaust HC, 
exhaust THCE or exhaust NMHC as appropriate, and exhaust CO and exhaust 
NO<INF>X</INF> for each engine family group. The evaporative emission 
deterioration factor for each evaporative family will be determined and 
applied in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
    (ii) The deterioration factors for each engine family group shall be 
determined by the Administrator using historical durability data from as 
many as three previous model years. These data will consist of 
deterioration factors generated by durability-data vehicles representing 
certified engine families and of deterioration factors from vehicles 
selected under Sec. 86.085-24(h). The Administrator shall determine how 
these data will be combined for each engine family group.
    (A) The test results to be used in the calculations of each 
deterioration factor to be combined for each engine family group shall 
be those test results specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this 
section.
    (B) For each durability-data vehicle selected under Sec. 86.085-
24(h), all applicable exhaust emission results shall be plotted as a 
function of the mileage on the system rounded to the nearest mile, and 
the best fit straight lines, fitted by the method of least squares, 
shall be drawn through all these data points. The exhaust deterioration 
factor for each durability-data vehicle shall be calculated as specified 
in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
    (C) Line crossing. For the purposes of paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section, line crossing occurs when either of the interpolated 4,000- and 
120,000-mile points of the best fit straight line exceeds the applicable 
emission standard and at least one applicable data point exceeds the 
standard.
    (1) The Administrator will not accept for certification line-
crossing data from preproduction durability-data vehicles selected under 
Sec. 86.085-24(c)(1), or Sec. 86.085-24 (h)(2) or (h)(3).
    (2) The Administrator will not accept for certification line-
crossing data from production durability-data vehicles selected under 
Sec. 86.085-24(h)(1) unless the 4,000-mile test result multiplied by the 
engine family group deterioration factor does not exceed the applicable 
emission standard. The deterioration factors used for this purpose shall 
be those that were used in the certification of the production vehicle. 
Manufacturers may calculate this product immediately after the 4,000-
mile test of the vehicle. If the product exceeds the applicable 
standard, the manufacturer may, with the approval of the Administrator, 
discontinue the vehicle and substitute a new vehicle. The manufacturer 
may continue the original vehicle, but the data will not be acceptable 
if line crossing occurs.
    (7)(i) Paragraph (b)(7) of this section describes the procedure for 
determining compliance of a new vehicle with fuel evaporative emission 
standards. The procedure described here shall be used for all vehicles 
in all model years.
    (ii) The manufacturer shall determine, based on testing described in 
Sec. 86.091-21(b)(4)(i), and supply an evaporative emission 
deterioration factor for each evaporative emission family-evaporative 
emission control system combination. The factor shall be calculated by 
subtracting the emission level at the selected test point from the 
emission level at the useful life point.
    (iii) The official evaporative emission test results for each 
evaporative emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be 
adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. 
However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is 
less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (iv) The emission value to compare with the standards shall be the 
adjusted emission value of paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section rounded 
to two significant figures in accordance with

[[Page 162]]

ASTM E 29-67 for each evaporative emission-data vehicle.
    (8) Every test vehicle of an engine family must comply with all 
applicable standards (and family emission limits, as appropriate), as 
determined in paragraphs (b)(4)(iv) and (b)(7)(iv) of this section, 
before any vehicle in that family will be certified.
    (c)(1) Paragraph (c) of this section applies to heavy-duty engines.
    (2) The exhaust emission standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate) for Otto-cycle engines in Sec. 86.090-10 or for diesel 
engines in Sec. 86.091-11 apply to the emissions of engines for their 
useful life.
    (3) Since emission control efficiency generally decreases with the 
accumulation of service on the engine, deterioration factors will be 
used in combination with emission-data engine test results as the basis 
for determining compliance with the standards.
    (4)(i) Paragraph (c)(4) of this section describes the procedure for 
determining compliance of an engine with emission standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate), based on deterioration factors 
supplied by the manufacturer.
    (ii) Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors, determined 
from tests of engines, subsystems or components conducted by the 
manufacturer, shall be supplied for each engine-system combination. For 
Otto-cycle engines, separate factors shall be established for transient 
HC, THCE or NMHC as appropriate, CO and NO<INF>X</INF>; and idle CO, for 
those engines utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., catalytic 
converters). For diesel engines, separate factors shall be established 
for transient HC, THCE or NMHC as appropriate, CO, NO<INF>X</INF> and 
exhaust particulate. For diesel smoke testing, separate factors shall 
also be established for the acceleration mode (designated as ``A''), the 
lugging mode (designated as ``B''), and peak opacity (designated as 
``C'').
    (iii)(A) Paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to Otto-
cycle heavy-duty engines.
    (1) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines not utilizing aftertreatment 
technology (e.g., catalytic converters). For transient HC, THCE or NMHC 
as appropriate, CO and NO<INF>X</INF>, the official exhaust emission 
results for each emission-data engine at the selected test point shall 
be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. 
However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is 
less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (2) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines utilizing aftertreatment 
technology (e.g., catalytic converters). For transient HC, THCE or NMHC 
as appropriate, CO and NO<INF>X</INF>, and for idle CO, the official 
exhaust emission results for each emission-data engine at the selected 
test point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate 
deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by 
the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (B) Paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section applies to diesel 
heavy-duty engines.
    (1) Diesel heavy-duty engines not utilizing aftertreatment 
technology (e.g., particulate traps). For transient HC, THCE or NMHC as 
appropriate, CO, NO<INF>X</INF> and exhaust particulate, the official 
exhaust emission results for each emission-data engine at the selected 
test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate 
deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by 
the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (2) Diesel heavy-duty engines utilizing aftertreatment technology 
(e.g., particulate traps). For transient HC, THCE or NMHC as 
appropriate, CO, NO<INF>X</INF> and exhaust particulate, the official 
exhaust emission results for each emission-data engine at the selected 
test point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate 
deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by 
the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (3) Diesel heavy-duty engines only. For acceleration smoke (``A''), 
lugging smoke (``B''), and peak smoke (``C''), the official exhaust 
emission results for each emission-data engine at the selected test 
point shall be adjusted by

[[Page 163]]

the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the 
deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it 
shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (iv) The emission values to compare with the standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted emission values 
of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, rounded to the same number of 
significant figures as contained in the applicable standard in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67, for each emission-data engine.
    (5)-(6) [Reserved]
    (7) Every test engine of an engine family must comply with all 
applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), as 
determined in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, before any engine in 
that family will be certified.
    (d)(1) Paragraph (d) of this section applies to heavy-duty vehicles 
required to comply with evaporative emission standards.
    (2) The applicable evaporative emission standard in Sec. 86.091-10 
or Sec. 86.091-11 applies to the emissions of vehicles for their useful 
life.
    (3)(i) For vehicles with a GVWR of up to 26,000 pounds, because it 
is expected that emission control efficiency will change during the 
useful life of the vehicle, an evaporative emission deterioration factor 
shall be determined from the testing described in Sec. 86.088-23(b)(3) 
for each evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combination to indicate the evaporative emission control system 
deterioration during the useful life of the vehicle (minimum 50,000 
miles). The factor shall be established to a minimum of two places to 
the right of the decimal.
    (ii) For vehicles with a GVWR of greater than 26,000 pounds, because 
it is expected that emission control efficiency will change during the 
useful life of the vehicle, each manufacturer's statement as required in 
Sec. 86.088-23(b)(4)(ii) shall include, in accordance with good 
engineering practice, consideration of control system deterioration.
    (4) The evaporative emission test results, if any, shall be adjusted 
by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor: Provided, That 
if the deterioration factor as computed in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section is less than zero, that deterioration factor shall be zero for 
the purposes of this paragraph.
    (5) The emission level to compare with the standard shall be the 
adjusted emission level of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Before any 
emission value is compared with the standard, it shall be rounded, in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67, to two significant figures. The rounded 
emission values may not exceed the standard.
    (6) Every test vehicle of an evaporative emission family must comply 
with the evaporative emission standard, as determined in paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, before any vehicle in that family may be 
certified.
    (e) Unless a manufacturer develops specific cold temperature 
deterioration factors, 68-86  deg.F deterioration factors shall be used 
to determine compliance with cold temperature emission standards.

Sec. 86.091-29  Testing by the Administrator.

    (a)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles 
and light-duty trucks.
    (2) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the test 
vehicles be submitted to him, at such place or places as he may 
designate, for the purposes of conducting emissions tests. The 
Administrator may specify that he will conduct such testing at the 
manufacturer's facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment 
specified by the Administrator shall be made available by the 
manufacturer for test operations. Any testing conducted at a 
manufacturer's facility pursuant to this paragraph shall be scheduled by 
the manufacturer as promptly as possible.
    (3)(i) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test segment on a test 
vehicle, the results of that test segment, unless subsequently 
invalidated by the

[[Page 164]]

Administrator, shall comprise the official data for that test segment 
for the vehicle at the prescribed test point and the manufacturer's data 
for that test segment for that prescribed test point shall not be used 
in determining compliance with emission standards (or family emission 
limits, as appropriate). The Administrator may stop a test after any 
evaporative test segment and use as official data any valid results 
obtained up to that point in the test, as described in subpart B of this 
part.
    (ii) Whenever the Administrator does not conduct a test on a test 
vehicle at a test point, the manufacturer's test data will be accepted 
as the official data for that point: Provided, That if the Administrator 
makes a determination based on testing under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, that there is a lack of correlation between the manufacturer's 
test equipment and the test equipment used by the Administrator, no 
manufacturer's test data will be accepted for purposes of certification 
until the reasons for the lack of correlation are determined and the 
validity of the data is established by the manufacturer, And further 
provided, That if the Administrator has reasonable basis to believe that 
any test data submitted by the manufacturer is not accurate or has been 
obtained in violation of any provisions of this part, the Administrator 
may refuse to accept that data as the official data pending retesting or 
submission or further information. If the manufacturer conducts more 
than one test on a vehicle, as authorized under Sec. 86.084-26 
(a)(3)(i)(A) or (b)(4)(i)(A), the data from the last test in that series 
of tests on that vehicle, will constitute the official data.
    (iii)(A)(1) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any 
adjustable parameter of an emission-data vehicle or engine which the 
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for 
certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing in accordance with 
Sec. 86.085-22(e)(1), to any setting within the physically adjustable 
range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in 
accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(3)(i), prior to the performance of any 
tests to determine whether such vehicle or engine conforms to applicable 
emission standards, including tests performed by the manufacturer under 
Sec. 86.091-23(c)(1). However, if the idle speed parameter is one which 
the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the 
Administrator shall not adjust it to a setting which causes a higher 
engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically 
adjustable range of the idle speed parameter on the engine before it 
accumulated any dynamometer service, all other parameters being 
identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The 
Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, will consider 
the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting 
on emissions performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that 
similar settings will occur on in-use light-duty vehicles or light-duty 
trucks. In determining likelihood, the Administrator will consider 
factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on 
vehicle performance characteristics and surveillance information from 
similar in-use vehicles.
    (2) For those vehicles or engine parameters which the Administrator 
has not determined to be subject to adjustment during certification and 
Selective Enforcement Audit testing in accordance with Sec. 86.085-
22(e)(1), the emission-data vehicle presented to the Administrator for 
testing shall be calibrated within the production tolerances applicable 
to the manufacturer's specifications to be shown on the vehicle label 
(see Sec. 86.091-35 (a)(1)(iii)(D) or (a)(2)(iii)(D)) as specified in 
the application for certification. If the Administrator determines that 
a vehicle is not within such tolerances, the vehicle will be adjusted, 
at the facility designated by the Administrator, prior to the test and 
an engineering report shall be submitted to the Administrator describing 
the corrective action taken. Based on the engineering report, the 
Administrator will determine if the vehicle will be used as an emission-
data vehicle.
    (B) If the Administrator determines that the test data developed on 
an emission-data vehicle under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section would 
cause that vehicle to fail due to excessive 4,000-mile emissions or by 
application

[[Page 165]]

of the appropriate deterioration factor, then the following procedure 
shall be observed:
    (1) The manufacturer may request a retest. Before the retest, those 
vehicle or engine parameters which the Administrator has not determined 
to be subject to adjustment for certification and Selective Enforcement 
Audit testing in accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(1) may be readjusted 
to manufacturer's specification, if these adjustments were made 
incorrectly prior to the first test. The Administrator may adjust or 
cause to be adjusted any parameter which the Administrator has 
determined to be subject to adjustment to any setting within the 
physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(3)(i). Other 
maintenance or repairs may be performed in accordance with Sec. 86.088-
25. All work on the vehicle shall be done at such location and under 
such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.
    (2) The vehicle will be retested by the Administrator and the 
results of this test shall comprise the official data for the emission-
data vehicle.
    (iv) If sufficient durability data are not available at the time of 
any emission test conducted under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to 
enable the Administrator to determine whether an emission-data vehicle 
would fail, the manufacturer may request a retest in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. If the 
manufacturer does not promptly make such request, he shall be deemed to 
have waived the right to a retest. A request for retest must be made 
before the manufacturer removes the vehicle from the test premises.
    (b)(1) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to heavy-duty engines.
    (2) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the test 
engines be submitted to him, at such place or places as he may 
designate, for the purpose of conducting emissions tests. The 
Administrator may specify that he will conduct such testing at the 
manufacturer's facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment 
specified by the Administrator shall be made available by the 
manufacturer for test operations. Any testing conducted at a 
manufacturer's facility pursuant to this paragraph shall be scheduled by 
the manufacturer as promptly as possible.
    (3)(i) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test engine 
the results of that test, unless subsequently invalidated by the 
Administrator, shall comprise the official data for the engine at that 
prescribed test point and the manufacturer's data for that prescribed 
test point shall not be used in determining compliance with emission 
standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate).
    (ii) Whenever the Administrator does not conduct a test on a test 
engine at a test point, the manufacturer's test data will be accepted as 
the official data for that test point: Provided, That if the 
Administrator makes a determination based on testing under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, that there is a lack of correlation between the 
manufacturer's test equipment and the test equipment used by the 
Administrator, no manufacturer's test data will be accepted for purposes 
of certification until the reasons for the lack of correlation are 
determined and the validity of the data is established by the 
manufacturer, And further provided, That if the Administrator has 
reasonable basis to believe that any test data submitted by the 
manufacturer is not accurate or has been obtained in violation of any 
provision of this part, the Administrator may refuse to accept that data 
as the official data pending retesting or submission of further 
information.
    (iii)(A)(1) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any 
adjustable parameter of an emission-data engine which the Administrator 
has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in 
accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(1), to any setting within the 
physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(3)(i), prior to the 
performance of any tests to determine whether such engine conforms to 
applicable emission standards, including tests performed by the 
manufacturer under Sec. 86.088-23(c)(2). The Administrator, in making or 
specifying such adjustments, may consider the effect of the

[[Page 166]]

deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions 
performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar 
settings will occur on in-use heavy-duty engines. In determining 
likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not 
limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance 
characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use 
engines.
    (2) For those engine parameters which the Administrator has not 
determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in 
accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(1), the emission-data engine presented 
to the Administrator for testing shall be calibrated within the 
production tolerances applicable to the manufacturer's specifications to 
be shown on the engine label (see Sec. 86.091-35(a)(3)(iii)) as 
specified in the application for certification. If the Administrator 
determines that an engine is not within such tolerances, the engine 
shall be adjusted at the facility designated by the Administrator prior 
to the test and an engineering report shall be submitted to the 
Administrator describing the corrective action taken. Based on the 
engineering report, the Administrator will determine if the engine shall 
be used as an emission-data engine.
    (B) If the Administrator determines that the test data developed 
under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section would cause the emission-
data engine to fail due to excessive 125-hour emission values or by the 
application of the appropriate deterioration factor, then the following 
procedure shall be observed:
    (1) The manufacturer may request a retest. Before the retest, those 
engine parameters which the Administrator has not determined to be 
subject to adjustment for certification testing in accordance with 
Sec. 86.085-22(e)(1) may be readjusted to the manufacturer's 
specifications, if these adjustments were made incorrectly prior to the 
first test. The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any 
parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to 
adjustment in accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(3)(i). However, if the 
idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be 
subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a 
setting which causes a higher engine idle speed than would have been 
possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed 
parameter on the engine before it accumulated any dynamometer service, 
all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the 
comparison. Other maintenance or repairs may be performed in accordance 
with Sec. 86.088-25. All work on the vehicle shall be done at such 
location and under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.
    (2) The engine will be retested by the Administrator and the results 
of this test shall comprise the official data for the emission-data 
engine.
    (iv) If sufficient durability data are not available at the time of 
any emission test conducted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to 
enable the Administrator to determine whether an emission-data engine 
would fail, the manufacturer may request a retest in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) (1) and (2) of this section. If 
the manufacturer does not promptly make such request, he shall be deemed 
to have waived the right to a retest. A request for retest must be made 
before the manufacturer removes the engine from the test premises.
    (c)(1) Paragraph (c) of this section applies to gasoline-fueled and 
methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles.
    (2) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the 
evaporative emission family-system combinations included in the 
manufacturer's statement(s) of compliance be installed on an appropriate 
vehicle and such vehicle be submitted to him, at such place or places as 
he may designate, for the purpose of conducting emissions tests. The 
Administrator may specify that he will conduct such testing at the 
manufacturer's facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment 
specified by the Administrator shall be made available by the 
manufacturer for test operations. Any testing conducted at a 
manufacturer's facility pursuant to this paragraph shall be scheduled by 
the manufacturer as promptly as possible.

[[Page 167]]

    (3)(i) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test segment on an 
evaporative emission family-system combination, the results of that test 
segment, unless subsequently invalidated by the Administrator, shall 
comprise the official data for that test segment for the evaporative 
emission family-system combination, and the manufacturer's data, 
analyses, etc., for that test segment shall not be used in determining 
compliance with emission standards. The Administrator may stop a test 
after any evaporative test segment and use as official data any valid 
results obtained up to that point in the test, as described in subpart B 
of this part.
    (ii) Whenever the Administrator does not conduct a test on an 
evaporative emission family-system combination, the manufacturer's test 
data will be accepted as the official data: Provided, That if the 
Administrator makes a determination, based on testing under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, that there is a lack of correlation between the 
manufacturer's test equipment and the test equipment used by the 
Administrator, no manufacturer's test data will be accepted for purposes 
of certification until the reasons for the lack of correlation are 
determined and the validity of the data is established by the 
manufacturer, And further provided, That if the Administrator has 
reasonable basis to believe that any test data, analyses, or other 
information submitted by the manufacturer is not accurate or has been 
obtained in violation of any provision of this part, the Administrator 
may refuse to accept those data, analyses, etc., as the official data 
pending retesting or submission of further information.

Sec. 86.091-30  Certification.

    (a)(1)(i) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted 
by the manufacturer, data derived from any inspection carried out under 
Sec. 86.091-7(d), and any other pertinent data or information, the 
Administrator determines that a test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) 
meets(s) the requirements of the Act and of this subpart, he will issue 
a certificate of conformity with respect to such vehicles(s) (or 
engines(s)) except in cases covered by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (c) of 
this section.
    (ii) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles. If, 
after a review of the statement(s) of compliance submitted by the 
manufacturer under Sec. 86.091-23(b)(4) and any other pertinent data or 
information, the Administrator determines that the requirements of the 
Act and this subpart have been met, he will issue one certificate of 
conformity per manufacturer with respect to the evaporative emission 
family(s) covered by such statement(s) except in cases covered by 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Such certificate will be issued for such period not to exceed 
one model year as the Administrator may determine and upon such terms as 
he may deem necessary or appropriate to assure that any new motor 
vehicle (or new motor vehicle engine) covered by the certificate will 
meet the requirements of the Act and of this part.
    (3)(i) One such certificate will be issued for each engine family. 
For gasoline-fueled and methanol fueled light-duty vehicles and light-
duty trucks, one such certificate will be issued for each engine family 
evaporative emission family combination.
    (A) Light-duty vehicles. Each certificate will certify compliance 
with no more than one set of standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate).
    (B) Light-duty trucks. Each certificate will certify compliance with 
no more than one set of standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate), except for low-altitude standards and high altitude 
standards. The certificate shall state that it covers vehicles sold or 
delivered to an ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated 
high-altitude location only if the vehicle conforms in all material 
respects to the design specifications that apply to those vehicles 
described in the application for certification at high altitude.
    (ii) For gasoline-fueled and methanol fueled heavy-duty vehicles, 
one such

[[Page 168]]

certificate will be issued for each manufacturer and will certify 
compliance for those vehicles previously identified in that 
manufacturer's statement(s) of compliance as required in Sec. 86.091-
23(b)(4) (i) and (ii).
    (iii) For diesel light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, or 
diesel heavy-duty engines, included in the applicable particulate 
averaging program, the manufacturer may at any time during production 
elect to change the level of any family particulate emission limit by 
demonstrating compliance with the new limit as described in 
Secs. 86.091-28(a)(6) and 86.091-28(b)(5)(i). New certificates issued 
under this paragraph will be applicable only for vehicles (or engines) 
produced subsequent to the date of issuance.
    (iv) For light-duty trucks or heavy-duty engines included in the 
applicable NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program, the manufacturer may at any 
time during production elect to change the level of any family 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit by demonstrating compliance with the new 
limit as described in Sec. 86.091-28(b)(5)(ii). New certificates issued 
under this paragraph will be applicable only for vehicles (or engines) 
produced subsequent to the day of issue.
    (4)(i) The adjustment or modification of any light-duty truck in 
accordance with instructions provided by the manufacturer for the 
altitude where the vehicle is principally used will not be considered a 
violation of section 203(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act.
    (ii) A violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act occurs 
when a manufacturer sells or delivers to an ultimate purchaser any 
light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck, subject to the regulations under 
the Act, under any of the conditions specified in the remainder of this 
paragraph.
    (A) When a light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck is not configured 
to meet high-altitude requirements:
    (1) At a designated high-altitude location, unless such manufacturer 
has reason to believe that such vehicle will not be sold to an ultimate 
purchaser for principal use at a designated high-altitude location; or
    (2) At a location other than a designated high-altitude location, 
when such manufacturer has reason to believe that such motor vehicle 
will be sold to an ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated 
high-altitude location.
    (B) When a light-duty vehicle is not configured to meet low-altitude 
requirements, as provided in Sec. 86.087-8(i):
    (1) At a designated low-altitude location, unless such manufacturer 
has reason to believe that such vehicle will not be sold to an ultimate 
purchaser for principal use at a designated low-altitude location; or
    (2) At a location other than a designated low-altitude location, 
when such manufacturer has reason to believe that such motor vehicle 
will be sold to an ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated 
low-altitude location.
    (iii) A manufacturer shall be deemed to have reason to believe that 
a light-duty vehicle that has been exempted from compliance with 
emission standards at high-altitude, or a light-duty truck which is not 
configured to meet high-altitude requirements, will not be sold to an 
ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated high-altitude 
location if the manufacturer has informed its dealers and field 
representatives about the terms of these high-altitude regulations, has 
not caused the improper sale itself, and has taken reasonable action 
which shall include, but not be limited to, either paragraph (a)(4)(iii) 
(A) or (B), and (a)(4)(ii)(C) of this section:
    (A) Requiring dealers in designated high-altitude locations to 
submit written statements to the manufacturer signed by the ultimate 
purchaser that a vehicle which is not configured to meet high-altitude 
requirements will not be used principally at a designated high-altitude 
location; requiring dealers in counties contiguous to designated high-
altitude locations to submit written statements to the manufacturer, 
signed by the ultimate purchaser who represents to the dealer in the 
normal course of business that he or she resides in a designated high-
altitude location, that a vehicle which is not configured to meet high-
altitude requirements will not be used principally at a designated high-
altitude location; and for each sale or delivery of fleets of ten or 
more such vehicles in

a high-altitude location or in counties contiguous to high-altitude 
locations, requiring either the selling dealer or the delivering dealer 
to submit written statements to the manufacturer, signed by the ultimate 
purchaser who represents to the dealer in the normal course of business 
that he or she resides in a designated high-altitude location, that a 
vehicle which is not configured to meet high-altitude requirements will 
not be used principally at a designated high-altitude location. In 
addition, the manufacturer will make available to EPA, upon reasonable 
written request (but not more frequently than quarterly, unless EPA has 
demonstrated that it has substantial reason to believe that an 
improperly configured vehicle has been sold), sales, warranty, or other 
information pertaining to sales of vehicles by the dealers described 
above maintained by the manufacturer in the normal course of business 
relating to the altitude configuration of vehicles and the locations of 
ultimate purchasers; or
    (B) Implementing a system which monitors factory orders of low-
altitude vehicles by high-altitude dealers, or through other means, 
identifies dealers that may have sold or delivered a vehicle not 
configured to meet the high-altitude requirements to an ultimate 
purchaser for principal use at a designated high-altitude location; and 
making such information available to EPA upon reasonable written request 
(but not more frequently than quarterly, unless EPA has demonstrated 
that it has substantial reason to believe that an improperly configured 
vehicle has been sold); and
    (C) Within a reasonable time after receiving written notice from EPA 
or a State or local government agency that a dealer may have improperly 
sold or delivered a vehicle not configured to meet the high-altitude 
requirements to an ultimate purchaser residing in a designated high-
altitude location, or based on information obtained pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section that a dealer may have improperly 
sold or delivered a significant number of such vehicles to ultimate 
purchasers so residing, reminding the dealer in writing of the 
requirements of these regulations, and, where appropriate, warning the 
dealer that sale by the dealer of vehicles not configured to meet high-
altitude requirements may be contrary to the terms of its franchise 
agreement with the manufacturer and the dealer certification 
requirements of Sec. 85.2108 of this chapter.
    (iv) A manufacturer shall be deemed to have reason to believe that a 
light-duty vehicle which has been exempted from compliance with emission 
standards at low-altitude, as provided in Sec. 86.087-8(i), will not be 
sold to an ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated low-
altitude location if the manufacturer has informed its dealers and field 
representatives about the terms of the high-altitude regulations, has 
not caused the improper sale itself, and has taken reasonable action 
which shall include, but not be limited to, either paragraph (a)(4)(iv) 
(A) or (B), and (a)(4)(iv)(C) of this section:
    (A) Requiring dealers in designated low-altitude locations to submit 
written statements to the manufacturer signed by the ultimate purchaser 
that a vehicle which is not configured to meet low-altitude requirements 
will not be used principally at a designated low-altitude location; 
requiring dealers in counties contiguous to designated low-altitude 
locations to submit written statements to the manufacturer, signed by 
the ultimate purchaser who represents to the dealer in the normal course 
of business that he or she resides in a designated low-altitude 
location, that a vehicle which is not configured to meet low-altitude 
requirements will not be used principally at a designated low-altitude 
location; and for each sale or delivery of fleets of ten or more such 
vehicles in a low-altitude location or in counties contiguous to low-
altitude locations, requiring either the selling dealer or the 
delivering dealer to submit written statements to the manufacturer, 
signed by the ultimate purchaser who represents to the dealer in the 
normal course of business that he or she resides in a designated low-
altitude location, that a vehicle which is not configured to meet low-
altitude requirements will not be used principally at a designated high-
altitude location. In addition, the manufacturer will make available to 
EPA, upon reasonable written request (but

[[Page 170]]

not more frequently than quarterly, unless EPA has demonstrated that it 
has substantial reason to believe that an improperly configured vehicle 
has been sold), sales, warranty, or other information pertaining to 
sales of vehicles by the dealers described above maintained by the 
manufacturer in the normal course of business relating to the altitude 
configuration of vehicles and the locations of ultimate purchasers; or
    (B) Implementing a system which monitors factory orders of high-
altitude vehicles by low-altitude dealers, or through other means, 
identifies dealers that may have sold or delivered a vehicle not 
configured to meet the low-altitude requirements to an ultimate 
purchaser for principal use at a designated low-altitude location; and 
making such information available to EPA upon reasonable written request 
(but not more frequently than quarterly, unless EPA has demonstrated 
that it has substantial reason to believe that an improperly configured 
vehicle has been sold); and
    (C) Within a reasonable time after receiving written notice from EPA 
or a state or local government agency that a dealer may have improperly 
sold or delivered a vehicle not configured to meet the low-altitude 
requirements to an ultimate purchaser residing in a designated low-

    (6) Catalyst-equipped vehicles, otherwise covered by a certificate, 
which are driven outside the United States, Canada, and Mexico will be 
presumed to have been operated on leaded gasoline resulting in 
deactivation of the catalysts. If these vehicles are imported or offered 
for importation without retrofit of the catalyst, they will be 
considered not to be within the coverage of the certificate unless 
included in a catalyst control program operated by a manufacturer or a 
United States Government agency and approved by the Administrator.
    (7) For incomplete light-duty trucks, a certificate covers only 
those new motor vehicles which, when completed by having the primary 
load-carrying device or container attached, conform to the maximum curb 
weight and frontal area limitations described in the application for 
certification as required in Sec. 86.091-21(d).
    (8) For heavy-duty engines, a certificate covers only those new 
motor vehicle engines installed in heavy-duty vehicles which conform to 
the minimum gross vehicle weight rating, curb weight, or frontal area 
limitations for heavy-duty vehicles described in Sec. 86.082-2.
    (9) For incomplete gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty 
vehicles a certificate covers only those new motor vehicles which, when 
completed, conform to the nominal maximum fuel tank capacity limitations 
as described in the application for certification as required in 
Sec. 86.091-21(e).

[[Page 172]]

    (10)(i) For diesel light-duty vehicle and diesel light-duty truck 
families which are included in a particulate averaging program, the 
manufacturer's production-weighted average of the particulate emission 
limits of all engine families in a participating class or classes shall 
not exceed the applicable diesel particulate standard, or the composite 
particulate standard defined in Sec. 86.090-2 as appropriate, at the end 
of the model year, as determined in accordance with 40 CFR part 86. The 
certificate shall be void ab initio for those vehicles causing the 
production-weighted FEL to exceed the particulate standard.
    (ii) For all heavy-duty diesel engines which are included in the 
particulate averaging, trading, or banking programs under Sec. 86.091-
15:
    (A) All certificates issued are conditional upon the manufacturer 
complying with the provisions of Sec. 86.091-15 and the averaging, 
trading, and banking related provision of other applicable sections, 
both during and after the model year production.
    (B) Failure to comply with all provisions of Sec. 86.091-15 will be 
considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the 
certificate was issued, and the certificate may be deemed void ab 
initio. 
    (C) The manufacturer shall bear the burden of establishing to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the 
certificate was issued were satisfied or excused.
    (b)(1) The Administrator will determine whether a vehicle (or 
engine) covered by the application complies with applicable standards 
(or family emission limits, as appropriate) by observing the following 
relationships:
    (i) Light-duty vehicles. (A) The durability data vehicle(s) selected 
under Sec. 86.090-24(c)(1)(i) shall represent all vehicles of the same 
engine system combination.
    (B) The emission data vehicle(s) selected under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1) 
(ii) through (iv) shall represent all vehicles of the same engine-system 
combination as applicable.
    (C) The emission-data vehicle(s) selected under Sec. 86.090-
24(b)(l)(vii) (A) and (B) shall represent all vehicles of the same 
evaporative control system within the evaporative family.
    (ii) Light-duty trucks. (A) The emission-data vehicle(s) selected 
under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(1)(ii), shall represent all vehicles of the same 
engine-system combination as applicable.
    (B) The emission-data vehicle(s) selected under Sec. 86.090-

24(b)(1)(v) shall represent all vehicles of the same engine-system 
combination as applicable.
    (D) The emission-data vehicle(s) selected under Sec. 86.090-
24(b)(1)(viii) shall represent all vehicles of the same evaporative 
control system within the evaporative emission family, as applicable.
    (iii) Heavy-duty engines. (A) An Otto-cycle emission-data test 
engine selected under Sec. 86.090-24(b)(2)(iv) shall represent all 
engines in the same family of the same engine displacement-exhaust 
emission control system combination.
    (B) An Otto-cycle emission-data test engine selected under 
Sec. 86.090-24(b)(2)(iii) shall represent all engines in the same engine 
family of the same engine displacement-exhaust emission control system 
combination.
    (C) A diesel emission data test engine selected under Sec. 86.090-
24(b)(3)(ii) shall represent all engines in the same engine-system 
combination.
    (D) A diesel emission-data test engine selected under Sec. 86.090-
24(b)(3)(iii) shall represent all engines of that emission control 
system at the rated fuel delivery of the test engine.
    (iv) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles. A 
statement of compliance submitted under Sec. 86.091-23(b)(4) (i) or (ii) 
shall represent all vehicles in the same evaporative emission family-
evaporative emission control system combination.
    (2) The Administrator will proceed as in paragraph (a) of this 
section with respect to the vehicles (or engines) belonging to an engine 
family or engine family-evaporative emission family combination (as 
applicable), all of which comply with all applicable

[[Page 173]]

standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate).
    (3) If after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the 
manufacturer, data derived from any additional testing conducted 
pursuant to Sec. 86.090-29, data or information derived from any 
inspection carried out under Sec. 86.091-7(d) or any other pertinent 
data or information, the Administrator determines that one or more test 
vehicles (or test engines) of the certification test fleet do not meet 
applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), he 
will notify the manufacturer in writing, setting forth the basis for his 
determination. Within 30 days following receipt of the notification, the 
manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determination. 
The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative 
of the manufacturer and shall include a statement specifying the 
manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determination and data 
in support of such objections. If, after a review of the request and 
supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a 
substantial factual issue, he shall provide the manufacturer a hearing 
in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to such issue.
    (4) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the manufacturer 
may, at its option, proceed with any of the following alternatives with 
respect to an emission-data vehicle determined not in compliance with 
all applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) for 
which it was tested:
    (i) Request a hearing under Sec. 86.078-6; or
    (ii) Remove the vehicle configuration (or evaporative vehicle 
configuration, as applicable) which failed, from his application;
    (A) If the failed vehicle was tested for compliance with exhaust 
emission standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) only: The 
Administrator may select, in place of the failed vehicle, in accordance 
with the selection criteria employed in selecting the failed vehicle, a 
new emission-data vehicle to be tested for exhaust emission compliance 
only.
    (B) If the failed vehicle was tested for compliance with both 
exhaust and evaporative emission standards: The Administrator may 
select, in place of the failed vehicle, in accordance with the selection 
criteria employed in selecting the failed vehicle, a new emission-data 
vehicle which will be tested for compliance with both exhaust and 
evaporative emission standards. If one vehicle cannot be selected in 
accordance with the selection criteria employed in selecting the failed 
vehicle, then two vehicles may be selected (i.e., one vehicle to satisfy 
the exhaust emission vehicle selection criteria and one vehicle to 
satisfy the evaporative emission vehicle selection criteria). The 
vehicle selected to satisfy the exhaust emission vehicle selection 
criteria will be tested for compliance with exhaust emission standards 
(or family emission limits, as appropriate) only. The vehicle selected 
to satisfy the evaporative emission vehicle selection criteria will be 
tested for compliance with both exhaust and evaporative emission 
standards; or
    (iii) Remove the vehicle configuration (or evaporative vehicle 
configuration, as applicable) which failed from the application and add 
a vehicle configuration(s) (or evaporative vehicle configuration(s), as 
applicable) not previously listed. The Administrator may require, if 
applicable, that the failed vehicle be modified to the new engine code 
(or evaporative emission code, as applicable) and demonstrate by testing 
that it meets applicable standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate) for which it was originally tested. In addition, the 
Administrator may select, in accordance with the vehicle selection 
criteria given in Sec. 86.090-24(b), a new emission-data vehicle or 
vehicles. The vehicles selected to satisfy the exhaust emission vehicle 
selection criteria will be tested for compliance with exhaust emission 
standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) only. The vehicles 
selected to satisfy the evaporative emission vehicle selection criteria 
will be tested for compliance with both exhaust and evaporative emission 
standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate); or

[[Page 174]]

    (iv) Correct a component or system malfunction and show that with a 
correctly functioning system or component the failed vehicle meets 
applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) for 
which it was originally tested. The Administrator may require a new 
emission-data vehicle, of identical vehicle configuration (or 
evaporative vehicle configuration, as applicable) to the failed vehicle, 
to be operated and tested for compliance with the applicable standards 
(or family emission limits, as appropriate) for which the failed vehicle 
was originally tested.
    (5) For heavy-duty engines the manufacturer may, at his option, 
proceed with any of the following alternatives with respect to any 
engine family represented by a test engine(s) determined not in 
complinace with applicable standards (or family emission limit, as 
appropriate):
    (i) Request a hearing under Sec. 86.078-6; or
    (ii) Delete from the application for certification the engines 
represented by the failing test engine. (Engines so deleted may be 
included in a later request for certification under Sec. 86.079-32.) The 
Administrator may then select in place of each failing engine an 
alternate engine chosen in accordance with selection criteria employed 
in selecting the engine that failed; or
    (iii) Modify the test engine and demonstrate by testing that it 
meets applicable standards. Another engine which is in all material 
respects the same as the first engine, as modified, may then be operated 
and tested in accordance with applicable test procedures.
    (6) If the manufacturer does not request a hearing or present the 
required data under paragraphs (b)(4) or (b)(5) of this section (as 
applicable) of this section, the Administrator will deny certification.
    (c)(1) Notwithstanding the fact that any certification vehicle(s) 
(or certification engine(s)) may comply with other provisions of this 
subpart, the Administrator may withhold or deny the issuance of a 
certificate of conformity (or suspend or revoke any such certificate 
which has been issued) with respect to any such vehicle(s) (or 
engine(s)) if:
    (i) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in his 
application for certification thereof;
    (ii) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which he 
submits pertaining thereto or otherwise circumvents the intent of the 
Act, or of this part with respect to such vehicle (or engine);
    (iii) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied access on the terms 
specified in Sec. 86.091-7(d) to any facility or portion thereof which 
contains any of the following:
    (A) The vehicle (or engine):
    (B) Any components used or considered for use in its modification or 
buildup into a certification vehicle (or certification engine);
    (C) Any production vehicle (or production engine) which is or will 
be claimed by the manufacturer to be covered by the certificate;
    (D) Any step in the construction of a vehicle (or engine) described 
in paragraph (c)(iii)(C) of this section;
    (E) Any records, documents, reports, or histories required by this 
part to be kept concerning any of the above;
    (iv) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied ``reasonable assistance'' 
(as defined in Sec. 86.091-7(d) in examining any of the items listed in 
paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) The sanctions of withholding, denying, revoking, or suspending 
of a certificate may be imposed for the reasons in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i),(ii),(iii), or (iv) of this section only when the infraction 
is substantial.
    (3) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submits false or 
inaccurate information or knowingly renders inaccurate or invalid any 
test data or commits any other fraudulent acts and such acts contribute 
substantially to the Administrator's decision to issue a certificate of 
conformity, the Administrator may deem such certificate void ab initio.
    (4) In any case in which certification of a vehicle (or engine) is 
proposed to be withheld, denied, revoked, or suspended under paragraph 
(c)(1) (iii) or (iv) of this section, and in which the Administrator has 
presented to the manufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a 
violation of Sec. 86.091-7(d) in fact occurred, the manufacturer, if he

[[Page 175]]

wishes to contend that, even though the violation occurred, the vehicle 
(or engine) in question was not involved in the violation to a degree 
that would warrant withholding, denial, revocation, or suspension of 
certification under either paragraph (c)(1) (iii) or (iv) of this 
section, shall have the burden of establishing that contention to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator.
    (5) Any revocation or suspension of certification under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section shall:
    (i) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered 
an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 
hereof.
    (ii) Extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce 
of vehicles (or engines) previously covered by the certification which 
are still in the hands of the manufacturer, except in cases of such 
fraud or other misconduct as makes the certification invalid ab initio.
    (6) The manufacturer may request in the form and manner specified in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section that any determination made by the 
Administrator under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to withhold or deny 
certification be reviewed in a hearing conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 86.078-6. If the Administrator finds, after a review of the request 
and supporting data, that the request raises a substantial factual 
issue, he will grant the request with respect to such issue.
    (d)(1) For light-duty vehicles. Notwithstanding the fact that any 
vehicle configuration or engine family may be covered by a valid 
outstanding certificate of conformity, the Administrator may suspend 
such outstanding certificate of conformity in whole or in part with 
respect to such vehicle configuration or engine family if:
    (i) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test 
order issued by the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 86.603; or
    (ii) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements 
of Sec. 86.603; or
    (iii) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in 
any report or information provided pursuant to the requirements of 
Sec. 86.609; or
    (iv) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which he 
submits pursuant to Sec. 86.609; or
    (v) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied the opportunity to conduct 
activities related to entry and access as authorized in Sec. 86.606 of 
this part and in a warrant or court order presented to the manufacturer 
or the party in charge of a facility in question; or
    (vi) EPA Enforcement Officers are unable to conduct activities 
related to entry and access or to obtain ``reasonable assistance'' as 
authorized in Sec. 86.606 of this part because a manufacturer has 
located its facility in a foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits 
those activities; or
    (vii) The manufacturer refuses to or in fact does not comply with 
Secs. 86.604(a), 86.605, 86.607, 86.608, or 86.610.
    (2) The sanction of suspending a certificate may not be imposed for 
the reasons in paragraph (d)(1)(i), (ii), or (vii) of this section where 
the refusal is caused by conditions and circumstances outside the 
control of the manufacturer which render it impossible to comply with 
those requirements.
    (3) The sanction of suspending a certificate may be imposed for the 
reasons in paragraph (d)(1)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this section only when 
the infraction is substantial.
    (4) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submitted false or 
inaccurate information or knowingly rendered inaccurate any test data or 
committed any other fraudulent acts, and such acts contributed 
substantially to the Administrator's original decision not to suspend or 
revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part, the 
Administrator may deem such certificate void from the date of such 
fraudulent act.
    (5) In any case in which certification of a vehicle is proposed to 
be suspended under paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section and in which the 
Administrator has presented to the manufacturer involved reasonable 
evidence that a violation of Sec. 86.606 in fact occurred, if the 
manufacturer wishes to contend that, although the violation occurred, 
the vehicle configuration or engine family in question was not involved 
in the violation to a

[[Page 176]]

degree that would warrant suspension of certification under paragraph 
(d)(1)(v) of this section, the manufacturer shall have the burden of 
establishing the contention to the satisfaction of the Administrator.
    (6) Any suspension of certification under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall:
    (i) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered 
an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.614; 
and
    (ii) Not apply to vehicles no longer in the hands of the 
manufacturer.
    (7) Any voiding of a certificate of conformity under paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section will be made only after the manufacturer 
concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in 
accordance with Sec. 86.614.
    (e) For light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines. (1) 
Notwithstanding the fact that any vehicle configuration or engine family 
may be covered by a valid outstanding certificate of conformity, the 
Administrator may suspend such outstanding certificate of conformity in 
whole or in part with respect to such vehicle or engine configuration or 
engine family if:
    (i) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test 
order issued by the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 86.1003; or
    (ii) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements 
of Sec. 86.1003; or
    (iii) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in 
any report or information provided pursuant to the requirements of 
Sec. 86.1009; or
    (iv) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 86.1009; or

inaccurate information or knowingly rendered inaccurate any test data or 
committed any other fraudulent acts, and such acts contributed 
substantially to the Administrator's original decision not to suspend or 
revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part, the 
Administrator may deem such certificate void from the date of such 
fraudulent act.
    (5) In any case in which certification of a light-duty truck or 
heavy-duty engine is proposed to be suspended under paragraph (e)(1)(v) 
of this section and in which the Administrator has presented to the 
manufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a violation of 
Sec. 86.1006 in fact occurred, if the manufacturer wishes to contend 
that, although the violation occurred, the vehicle or engine 
configuration or engine family in question was not involved in the 
violation to a degree that would warrant suspension of certification

[[Page 177]]

under paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section, he shall have the burden of 
establishing that contention to the satisfaction of the Administrator.
    (6) Any suspension of certification under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section shall:
    (i) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered 
an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.1014,

    (2) Measurement procedures, other than that described in subpart I, 
may be used by the manufacturer provided the manufacturer satisfies the 
requirements of Sec. 86.091-23(f).
    (3) When a manufacturer chooses to use an alternative measurement 
procedure it has the responsibility to determine whether the results 
obtained by the procedure will correlate with the results which would be 
obtained from the measurement procedure in subpart I. Consequently, the 
Administrator will not routinely approve or disapprove any alternative 
opacity measurement procedure or any associated correlation data which 
the manufacturer elects to use to satisfy the data requirements for 
subpart I.
    (4) If a confirmatory test(s) is performed and the results indicate 
there is a systematic problem suggesting that the data generated under 
an optional alternative measurement procedure do not adequately 
correlate with subpart I data, EPA may require that all certificates of 
conformity not already issued be based on data from subpart I 
procedures.

Sec. 86.092-2  Definitions.

    The definitions of Sec. 86.091-2 remain effective. The definitions 
listed in this section apply beginning with the 1992 model year.
    (a) Proven emission control systems are emission control components 
or systems (and fuel metering systems) that have completed full 
durability testing evaluation over a vehicle's useful life in some other 
certified engine family, or have completed bench or road testing 
demonstrated to be equal or more severe than certification mileage 
accumulation requirements. Alternatively, proven components or systems 
are those that are determined by EPA to be of comparable functional 
quality and manufactured using comparable materials and production 
techniques as components or systems which have been durability 
demonstrated in some other certified engine family. In addition, the 
components or systems must be employed in an operating environment 
(e.g., temperature, exhaust flow, etc.,) similar to that experienced by 
the original or comparable components or systems in the original 
certified engine family.
    (b) Unproven emission control systems are emission control 
components or systems (and fuel metering systems) that do not qualify as 
proven emission control systems.
    (c) Similar systems are engine, fuel metering and emission control 
system combinations which use the same fuel (e.g., gasoline, diesel, 
etc.), combustion cycle (i.e., two or four stroke), general type of fuel 
system (i.e., carburetor or fuel injection), catalyst system (e.g., 
none, oxidization, three-way plus oxidization, three-way only, etc.), 
fuel control system (i.e., feedback or non-feedback), secondary air 
system (i.e., equipped or not equipped) and EGR (i.e., equipped or not 
equipped).
    (d) Conveniently available service facility and spare parts for 
small-volume manufacturers means that the vehicle manufacturer has a 
qualified service facility at or near the authorized point of sale or 
delivery of its vehicles and maintains an inventory of all emission-
related spare parts or has made arrangements for the part manufacturers 
to supply the parts by expedited shipment (e.g., utilizing overnight 
express delivery service, UPS, etc.).

Sec. 86.092-14  Small-volume manufacturers certification procedures.

    (a) The small-volume manufacturers certification procedures 
described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are optional. Small-
volume manufacturers may use these optional procedures to demonstrate 
compliance with the general standards and specific emission requirements 
contained in this subpart.
    (b)(1) The optional small-volume manufacturers certification 
procedures apply to light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty 
vehicles, and heavy-duty engines produced by manufacturers with U.S. 
sales, including all vehicles and engines imported under the provisions 
of 40 CFR 85.1505 and 40 CFR 85.1509 (for the model year in which 
certification is sought) of fewer than 10,000 units (Light-Duty 
Vehicles, Light-Duty Trucks, Heavy-Duty Vehicles and Heavy-Duty Engines 
combined).
    (2) For the purpose of determining the applicability of paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, the sales the Administrator shall use shall be 
the aggregate of the projected or actual sales of those vehicles and/or 
engines in any of the groupings identified below in this subparagraph.
    (i) Vehicles and/or engines produced by two or more firms, one of 
which is 10 percent or greater part owned by another;
    (ii) Vehicles and/or engines produced by any two or more firms if a 
third party has equity ownership of 10 percent or more in each of the 
firms;
    (iii) Vehicles and/or engines produced by two or more firms having a 
common corporate officer(s) who is(are) responsible for the overall 
direction of the companies;
    (iv) Vehicles and/or engines imported or distributed by all firms 
where the vehicles and/or engines are manufactured by the same entity 
and the importer or distributer is an authorized agent of the entity.
    (3) If the aggregated sales, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section are less than 301 units, the manufacturers in the 
aggregated relationship may certify under the provisions in this section 
that apply to manufacturers with sales of less than 301 units.
    (4) If the aggregated sales, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section are greater than 300 but fewer than 10,000 units, the 
manufacturers in the aggregated relationship may certify under the 
provisions in this section that apply to manufacturers with sales from 
and including 301 through 9,999 motor vehicles and motor vehicles 
engines per year.
    (5) If the aggregated sales, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section are equal to or greater than 10,000 units, then the 
manufacturers involved in the aggregated relationship will be allowed to 
certify a number of units under the small-volume engine family 
certification procedures (40 CFR 86.092-24(e)) in accordance with the 
criteria identified below in this subparagraph.
    (i) If a manufacturer purchases less than 50 percent of another 
manufacturer, each manufacturer retains its right to certify 9,999 units 
using the small-volume engine family certification procedures.
    (ii) If a manufacturer purchases 50 percent or more of another 
manufacturer, the manufacturer with the over 50 percent interest must 
share, with the manufacturer it purchased, its 9,999 units under the 
small-volume engine family certification procedures.
    (iii) In a joint venture arrangement (50/50 ownership) between two 
manufacturers, each manufacturer retains its eligibility for 9,999 units 
under the small-volume engine family certification procedures, but the 
joint venture must draw its maximum 9,999 units from the units allocated 
to its parent manufacturers.
    (c) Small-volume manufacturers shall demonstrate compliance with the 
applicable sections of this subpart. The appropriate model year of the 
following applicable sections shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 86.084-4:
    (1) Sections 86.092-1, 86.092-2, 86.090-3, 86.084-4, 86.090-5, 
86.078-6, 86.078-7, and 86.090-8 through 86.090-11 of this subpart are 
applicable.
    (2) Section 86.080-12 of this subpart is not applicable.
    (3) Section 86.085-13, 86.092-14, 86.084-15, and 86.085-20 of this 
subpart are applicable.
    (4) Small-volume manufacturers shall include in their records all of 
the

[[Page 185]]

information that EPA requires in Sec. 86.090-21 of this subpart. This 
information will be considered part of the manufacturer's application 
for certification. However, the manufacturer is not required to submit 
the information to the Administrator unless the Administrator requests 
it.
    (5) Section 86.085-22 of this subpart is applicable except as noted 
below.
    (i) Small-volume light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck 
manufacturers may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e) of 
Sec. 86.085-22 by including a statement of compliance on adjustable 
parameters in the application for certification. In the statement of 
compliance the manufacturer shall state that the limits, stops, seals, 
or other means used to inhibit adjustment have been designed to 
accomplish their intended purpose based on good engineering practice and 
past experience. If the vehicle parameter is adjustable the vehicle must 
meet emission standards with the parameter set any place within the 
adjustable range (Reference Sec. 86.090-21 of this subpart).
    (6) Section 86.090-23 of this subpart is applicable.
    (7) Section 86.092-24 of this subpart is applicable except as noted 
below.
    (i) Small-volume manufacturers may satisfy the requirements of 
paragraph (b) and (c) of Sec. 86.092-24 of this subpart by:
    (A) Emission-data--Selecting one emission-data test vehicle (engine) 
per engine family by the worst-case emissions criteria as follows:
    (1) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The manufacturer 
shall select the vehicle with the heaviest equivalent test weight 
(including options) within the engine family. Then within that vehicle 
the manufacturer shall select, in the order listed, the highest road 
load power, largest displacement, the transmission with the highest 
numerical final gear ratio (including overdrive), the highest numerical 
axle ratio offered in the engine family, and the maximum fuel flow 
calibration.
    (2) Heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines. The manufacturer shall select one 
emission-data engine first based on the largest displacement within the 
engine family. Then within the largest displacement the manufacturer 
shall select, in the order listed, highest fuel flow at the speed of 
maximum rated torque, the engine with the most advanced spark timing, no 
EGR or lowest EGR flow, and no air pump or lowest actual flow air pump.
    (3) Heavy-duty diesel engines. The manufacturer shall select one 
emission-data engine based on the highest fuel feed per stroke, 
primarily at the speed of maximum rated torque and secondarily at rated 
speed.
    (B) Testing light-duty vehicles or light-duty truck emission-data 
vehicles at any service accumulation distance of at least 2,000 miles 
(3,219 kilometers) or, catalyst equipped heavy-duty emission-data 
engines at any service accumulation time of at least 62 hours, or non-
catalyst equipped heavy-duty engine emission-data engines at any service 
accumulation time determined by the manufacturer to result in stabilized 
emissions. The emission performance of the emission-data vehicle or 
engine must be stabilized prior to emission testing.
    (C) Durability data--Satisfying the durability-data requirements by 
complying with the applicable procedures below:
    (1) Manufacturers with aggregated sales of less than 301 motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year may use assigned 
deterioration factors that the Administrator determines and prescribes. 
The factors will be the Administrator's estimate, periodically updated 
and published in an advisory letter or advisory circular, of the 70th 
percentile deterioration factors calculated using the industrywide data 
base of previously completed durability-data vehicles or engines used 
for certification. However, the manufacturer may, at its option, 
accumulate miles (hours) on a durability-data vehicle (engine) and 
complete emission tests for the purpose of establishing its own 
deterioration factors.
    (2) Manufacturers with aggregated sales from and including 301 
through 9,999 motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year 
certifying light-duty vehicle exhaust emissions from vehicles equipped 
with proven emission

[[Page 186]]

control systems shall use assigned deterioration factors that the 
manufacturer determines based on its good engineering judgment. However, 
the manufacturer may not use deterioration factors less than either the 
average or 70th percentile of all of that manufacturer's deterioration 
factor data, whichever is less. These minimum deterioration factors 
shall be calculated according to procedures in paragraph 
(c)(7)(i)(C)(2)(i), of this section. If the manufacturer does not have 
at least two data points to calculate these manufacturer specific 
average deterioration factors, then the deterioration factors shall be 
no less than the EPA supplied industrywide deterioration factors. 
However, the manufacturer may, at its option, accumulate miles on a 
durability-data vehicle and complete emission tests for the purpose of 
establishing its own deterioration factors.
    (i) The manufacturer's minimum deterioration factors shall be 
calculated using the deterioration factors from all engine families, 
within the same vehicle/engine-fuel usage category (e.g., gasoline-
fueled light-duty vehicle, etc.) previously certified to the same 
emission standards. The manufacturer shall use only deterioration 
factors engine families previously certified by the manufacturer and the 
deterioration factors shall not be included in the calculation more than 
once. The deterioration factors for each pollutant shall be calculated 
separately. The manufacturer may, at its option, limit the deterioration 
factors used in the calculation of the manufacturer's minimum 
deterioration factors to those from all similar systems to the system 
being certified if sufficient data (i.e., from at least two certified 
systems) exists. All data eligible to be grouped as similar system data 
shall be used in calculating similar system deterioration factors. Any 
deterioration factors used in calculating similar system deterioration 
factors shall not be included in calculating the manufacturer's minimum 
deterioration factors used to certify any of the manufacturer's 
remaining vehicle systems.
    (3) Manufacturers with aggregated sales from 301 through 9,999 motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle engines and certifying light-duty vehicle 
exhaust emissions from vehicles equipped with unproven emission control 
systems shall use deterioration factors that the manufacturer determines 
from official certification durability data generated by vehicles from 
engine families representing a minimum of 25 percent of the 
manufacturer's sales equipped with unproven emission control systems. 
The sales projections are to be based on total sales projected for each 
engine/system combination. The durability-data vehicle (engine) mileage 
accumulation and emission tests are to be conducted according 
Sec. 86.092-26 of this subpart. The manufacturer must develop 
deterioration factors by generating durability data in accordance with 
Sec. 86.092-26 of this subpart on a minimum of 25 percent of the 
manufacturer's projected sales (by engine/system combination) that is 
equipped with unproven emission control systems. The manufacturer must 
complete the 25 percent durability requirement before the remainder of 
the manufacturer's sales equipped with unproven emission control systems 
is certified using manufacturer-determined assigned deterioration 
factors. Alternatively, any of these manufacturers may, at their option, 
accumulate miles on durability-data vehicles and complete emission tests 
for the purpose of establishing their own deterioration factors on the 
remaining sales.
    (4) For light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, and heavy-duty vehicle 
evaporative emissions and light-duty truck, and heavy-duty engine 
exhaust emissions, deterioration factors shall be determined in 
accordance with Sec. 86.092-24 of this subpart.
    (ii) Paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec. 86.092-24 of this subpart are 
not applicable.
    (8) Section 86.090-25 of this subpart is applicable to maintenance 
performed on durability-data light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, 
heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines when the manufacturer 
completes durability-data vehicles or engines; section 86.087-38 of this 
subpart is applicable to the recommended maintenance the manufacturer 
includes in the maintenance instructions furnished the purchasers of

[[Page 187]]

new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines under Sec. 86.087-38 of 
this subpart.
    (9)(i) Section 86.092-26 of this subpart is applicable if the 
manufacturer completes durability-data vehicles or engines.
    (ii) Section 86.085-27 of this subpart is applicable.
    (10) Sections 86.090-28 and 86.090-29 of this subpart are 
applicable.
    (11)(i) Section 86.090-30 of this subpart is applicable, except for 
paragraph (a)(2) and (b) of that section. In the place of these 
paragraphs, small-volume manufacturer shall comply with paragraphs 
(c)(11)(ii) through (v) of this section, as shown below.
    (ii) Small-volume manufacturers shall submit an application for 
certification containing the following:

manufacturer shall assure (by conducting emission tests as it deems 
necessary) that the affected vehicles (engines) remain in compliance 
with the requirements of this part.
    (ii) The manufacturer shall notify the Administrator within seven 
days after implementing any production related change (running change) 
that would affect vehicle emissions. This notification shall include any 
changes to the information required under paragraph (c)(11)(ii) of this 
section. The manufacturer shall also amend as necessary its records 
required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to confirm with the 
production design change.
    (14) Section 86.082-34 of this subpart is not applicable.
    (15) Sections 86.092-35, 86.079-36, 86.082-37, 86.087-38 and 86.084-

<R05>
Sec. 86.092-15  NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines.

    (a)(1) Heavy-duty engines eligible for the NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate averaging, trading, and banking programs are described in 
the applicable emission standards sections in this subpart. 
Participation in these programs is voluntary.
    (2)(i) Engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable standard 
shall obtain emission credits in a mass amount sufficient to address the 
shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, trading, or banking, 
within the averaging set restrictions described in this section.
    (ii) Engine families with FELs below the applicable standard will 
have emission credits available to average, trade, bank or a combination 
thereof. Credits may not be used to offset emissions that exceed an FEL. 
Credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity determined by 
a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing. However, credits may 
be used to allow subsequent production of engines for the family in 
question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (iii) Credits scheduled to expire in the earliest model year shall 
be used, prior to using other available credits, to offset emissions of 
engine families with FELS exceeding the applicable standard.
    (b) Participation in the NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate 
averaging, trading, and banking programs shall be done as follows. (1) 
During certification, the manufacturer shall:
    (i) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the 
averaging, trading and/or banking programs. Separate declarations are 
required for each program and for each pollutant (i.e., NO<INF>X</INF> 
and particulate).
    (ii) Declare an FEL for each engine family participating in one or 
more of these three programs.
    (A) The FEL must be to the same level of significant digits as the 
emission standard (one-tenth of a gram per brake horsepower for 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions and one-hundredth of a gram per brake 
horsepower-hour for particulate emissions).
    (B) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in the 
section concerning the applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate emission standards.
    (iii) Calculate the projected emission credits (+/-) based on 
quarterly production projections for each participating family and for 
each pollutant (NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate), using the equation in 
paragraph (c) of this section and the applicable factors for the 
specific engine family.
    (iv)(A) Determine and state the source of the needed credits 
according to quarterly projected production for engine families 
requiring credits for certification.
    (B) State where the quarterly projected credits will be applied for 
engine families generating credits.
    (C) Credits may be obtained from or applied to only engine families 
within the same averaging set as described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section. Credits available for averaging, trading, or banking as 
defined in Sec. 86.090-2, may be applied to a given engine famil(y) 
(ies), or reserved as defined in Sec. 86.091-2.
    (2) Based on this information each manufacturer's certification 
application must demonstrate:
    (i) That at the end of model year production, each engine family has 
a net emissions credit balance of zero or more using the methodology in 
paragraph (c) of this section with any credits obtained from averaging, 
trading or banking.
    (ii) The source of the credits to be used to comply with the 
emission standard if the FEL exceeds the standard, or where credits will 
be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where 
credits are being obtained, each engine family involved must state 
specifically the source (manufacturer/engine family) of the credits 
being used. In cases where credits are being generated/supplied, each 
engine family involved must state specifically the designated use 
(manufacturer/engine family or reserved) of the credits involved. All 
such reports shall include all credits involved in averaging, trading or 
banking.
    (3) During the model year manufacturers must:

[[Page 190]]

    (i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that 
compliance with the emission standards is achieved at the end of the 
model year.
    (ii) Provide the end of-model year reports required under 
Sec. 86.091-23.
    (iii) Maintain the quarterly records required under Sec. 86.091-
7(c)(8).
    (4) Projected credits based on information supplied in the 
certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of 
conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of 
end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any other verification 
steps deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
    (5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be 
determined at the end of the model year. Engine families without an 
adequate amount of actual NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate emission 
credits will violate the conditions of the certificate of conformity. 
The certificates of conformity may be voided ab initio for those engine 
families.
    (6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error 
occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this 
section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be 
recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous 
negative credit balances may be adjusted by EPA.
    (i) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates 
an inadvertent credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to 
purchase the necessary credits to bring the credit balance for that 
engine family to zero, at the ratio of 1.2 credits purchased for every 
credit needed to bring the balance to zero. If sufficient credits are 
not available to bring the credit balance for the engine family in 
question to zero, EPA may void the certificate for that engine family ab 
initio.
    (ii) If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year 
report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's 
favor (i.e., resulting in a positive credit balance) or if the 
manufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of 
the end-of-year report, the credits will be restored for use by the 
manufacturer. For the 1992 model year, corrections to the end-of-year 
reports may be submitted until May 9, 1994.
    (c)(1) For each participating engine family, NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate emission credits (positive or negative) are to be calculated 
according to one of the following equations and rounded, in accordance 
with ASTM E29-67, to the nearest one-tenth of a Megagram (Mg). 
Consistent units are to be used throughout the equation.
    For determining credit need for all engine families and credit 
availability for engine families generating credits for averaging 
programs only:

Emission credits = (StdFEL)  x  (CF)  x  (UL)  x  (Production)  x  (106)

    For determining credit availability for engine families generating 
credits for trading or banking programs:

Emission credits = (StdFEL)  x  (CF)  x  (UL)  x  (Production)  x  (106) 
 x  (0.8)

Where:

Std=the current and applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> or 
particulate emission standard in grams per brake horsepower hour or 
grams per Megajoule.
FEL=the NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate family emission limit for the 
engine family in grams per brake horsepower-hour or grams per Megajoule.
CF=a transient cycle conversion factor in BHP-hr/mi or MJ/mi, as given 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
UL=the useful life, or alternative life as described in paragraph (f) of 
Sec. 86.090-21, for the given engine family in miles.
Production=the number of engines produced for U.S. sales within the 
given engine family during the model year. Quarterly production 
projections are used for initial certification. Actual production is 
used for end-of-year compliance determination.
0.8=a one-time discount applied to all credits to be banked or traded 
within the model year generated. Banked credits traded in a subsequent 
model year will not be subject to an additional discount. Banked credits 
used in a subsequent model year's averaging program will not have the 
discount restored.

    (2) The transient cycle conversion factor is the total (integrated) 
cycle brake horsepower-hour or Megajoules, divided by the equivalent 
mileage of the applicable transient cycle. For Otto-cycle heavy-duty 
engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3 miles. For diesel heavy-duty 
engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.5 miles. When more

[[Page 191]]

than one configuration is chosen by EPA to be tested in the 
certification of an engine family (as described in Sec. 86.085-24), the 
conversion factor used is to be based upon the configuration generating 
the highest conversion factor when determining credit need and the 
lowest conversion factor when determining credit availability for 
banking, trading or averaging.
    (d) Averaging sets for NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits: The 
averaging and trading of NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits will only be 
allowed between heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set and 
in the same regional category. Engines produced for sale in California 
constitute a separate regional category than engines produced for sale 
in the other 49 states. Banking and trading are not applicable to 
engines sold in California. The averaging sets for the averaging and 
trading of NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits for heavy-duty engines are 
defined as follows:
    (1) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines:
    (i) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines constitute an averaging set. 
Averaging and trading among all Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families is 
allowed. There are no subclass restrictions.
    (ii) Gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles certified under the 
provisions of Sec. 86.085-1(b) may not average or trade credits with 
gasoline-fueled heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines, but may average or trade 
credits with light-duty trucks.
    (2) For diesel cycle heavy-duty engines:
    (i) Each of the three primary intended service classes for heavy-
duty diesel engines, as defined in Sec. 86.090-2, constitute an 
averaging set. Averaging and trading among all diesel cycle engine 
families within the same primary service class is allowed.
    (ii) Urban buses are treated as members of the primary intended 
service class where they would otherwise fall.
    (e) Averaging sets for particulate emission credits. The averaging 
and trading of particulate emission credits will only be allowed between 
diesel cycle heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set and in 
the same regional category. Engines produced for sale in California 
constitute a separate regional category than engines produced for sale 
in the other 49 states. Banking and trading are not applicable to 
engines sold in California. The averaging sets for the averaging and 
trading of particulate emission credits for diesel cycle heavy-duty 
engines are defined as follows:
    (1) Engines intended for use in urban buses constitute a separate 
averaging set from all other heavy-duty engines. Averaging and trading 
among all diesel cycle bus engine families is allowed.
    (2) For heavy-duty engines, exclusive of urban bus engines, each of 
the three primary intended service classes for heavy-duty diesel cycle 
engines, as defined in Sec. 86.090-2, constitute an averaging set. 
Averaging and trading between diesel cycle engine families within the 
same primary service class is allowed.
    (3) Otto-cycle engines may not participate in particulate averaging, 
trading, or banking.
    (f) Banking of NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate emission credits:
    (1) Credit deposits. (i) Under this phase of the banking program, 
emission credits may be banked from engine families produced during the 
three model years prior to the effective model year of the new HDE 
NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate emission standard. Credits may not be 
banked from engine families made during any other model years.
    (ii) Manufacturers may bank credits only after the end of the model 
year and after EPA has reviewed their end-of-year report. During the 
model year and before submittal of the end-of-year report, credits 
originally designated in the certification process for banking will be 
considered reserved and may be redesignated for trading or averaging.
    (2) Credit withdrawals. (i) After being generated, banked/reserved 
credits shall be available for use three model years prior to, through 
three model years immediately after the effective date of the new HDE 
NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate emission standard, as applicable. However, 
credits not used within the period specified above shall be forfeited.
    (ii) Manufacturers withdrawing banked emission credits shall 
indicate so during certification and in their credit reports, as 
described in Sec. 86.091-23.

[[Page 192]]

    (3) Use of banked emission credits. The use of banked credits shall 
be within the averaging set and other restrictions described in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and only for the following 
purposes:
    (i) Banked credits may be used in averaging, trading, or in any 
combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits declared 
for banking from the previous model year but unreviewed by EPA may also 
be used. However, they may be revoked at a later time following EPA 
review of the end-of-year report or any subsequent audit actions.
    (ii) Banked credits may not be used for NO<INF>X</INF> or 
particulate averaging and trading to offset emissions that exceed an 
FEL. Banked credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity 
determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing. 
However, banked credits may be used for subsequent production of the 
engine family if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (g)(1) For purposes of this paragraph (g), assume NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate nonconformance penalties (NCPs) will be available for the 
1991 and later model year HDEs.
    (2) Engine families paying an NCP for noncompliance of any emission 
standard may not:
    (i) Participate in the averaging program,
    (ii) Generate emission credits for any pollutant under banking and 
trading, and
    (iii) Use emission credits for any pollutant from banking and 
trading.
    (3) If a manufacturer has any engine family to which application of 
NCPs and averaging, banking, and trading credits is desired, that family 
must be separated into two distinct families. One family, whose FEL 
equals the standard, must use NCPs only, while the other, whose FEL does 
not equal the standard, must use emission credits only.
    (4) If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given averaging set 
which is using NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate NCPs, none of that 
manufacturer's engine families in that averaging set may generate 
credits for banking and trading.
    (h) In the event of a negative credit balance in a trading 
situation, both the buyer and the seller would be liable.
    (i) Certification fuel used for credit generation must be of a type 
that is both available in use and expected to be used by the engine 
purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the Administrator, the engine 
manufacturer must provide information acceptable to the Administrator 
that the designated fuel is readily available commercially and would be 
used in customer service.

    (iv) Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in the end-of-year 
report, including changes in the 49 state production counts, may be 
corrected up to 180 days subsequent to submission of the end-of-year 
report. Errors discovered by EPA after 180 days shall be corrected if 
credits are reduced. Errors in the manufacturer's favor will not be 
corrected if discovered after the 180 day correction period allowed.
    (i) Failure by a manufacturer participating in the averaging, 
trading, or banking programs to submit any quarterly or end-of-year 
report (as applicable) in the specified time for all vehicles and 
engines that are part of an averaging set is a violation of section 
203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act for each such vehicle and engine.
    (j) Failure by a manufacturer generating credits for deposit only in 
either the HDE NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate banking programs to submit 
their end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (i.e., 
90 days after the end of the model year) shall result in the credits not 
being available for use until such reports are received and reviewed by 
EPA. Use of projected credits pending EPA review will not be permitted 
in these circumstances.
    (k) Engine families certified using NCPs are not required to meet 
the requirements outlined above.

<R05>
Sec. 86.092-24  Test vehicles and engines.

    (a)(1) The vehicles or engines covered by an application for 
certification will be divided into groupings of engines which are 
expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their 
useful life. Each group of engines with similar emission characteristics 
shall be defined as a separate engine family.
    (2) To be classed in the same engine family, engines must be 
identical in all the following respects:
    (i) The cylinder bore center-to-center dimensions.
    (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) The cylinder block configuration (air cooled or water cooled; 
L-6, 90 deg. V-8, etc.).
    (v) The location of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
    (vi) The method of air aspiration.
    (vii) The combustion cycle.
    (viii) Catalytic converter characteristics.
    (ix) Thermal reactor characteristics.
    (x) Type of air inlet cooler (e.g., intercoolers and after-coolers) 
for diesel heavy-duty engines.
    (3)(i) Engines identical in all the respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section may be further divided into different engine 
families if the Administrator determines that they may be expected to 
have different emission characteristics. This determination will be 
based upon a consideration of the following features of each engine:

[[Page 196]]

    (A) The bore and stroke.
    (B) The surface-to-volume ratio of the nominally dimensioned 
cylinder at the top dead center positions.
    (C) The intake manifold induction port size and configuration.
    (D) The exhaust manifold port size and configuration.
    (E) The intake and exhaust valve sizes.
    (F) The fuel system.
    (G) The camshaft timing and ignition or injection timing

    (ii) Light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines produced in different 
model years and distinguishable in the respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section shall be treated as belonging to a single engine 
family if the Administrator requires it, after determining that the 
engines may be expected to have similar emission deterioration 
characteristics.
    (4) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine 
families based upon the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this section, the Administrator will establish families for those 
engines based upon those features most related to their emission 
characteristics. Engines that are eligible to be included in the same 
engine family based on the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) 
of this section may be further divided into different engine families if 
the manufacturer determines that they may be expected to have different 
emission characteristics. This determination will be based upon a 
consideration of the following features of each engine:
    (i) The dimension from the center line of the crankshaft to the 
center line of the camshaft.
    (ii) The dimension from the center line of the crankshaft to the top 
of the cylinder block head face.
    (iii) The size of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
    (5) The gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks covered by an application for certification will be

emission characteristics throughout their useful life. Each group of 
vehicles with similar evaporative emission characteristics shall be 
defined as a separate evaporative emission family.
    (6) For gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks to be classed in the same evaporative emission family, 
vehicles must be similar with respect to:
    (i) Type of vapor storage device (e.g., canister, air cleaner, 
crankcase).
    (ii) Basic canister design.
    (iii) Fuel system.
    (7) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into 
evaporative emission families based on the criteria listed above, the 
Administrator will establish families for those vehicles based upon the 
features most related to their evaporative emission characteristics.
    (8)(i) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the Alternative 
Durability Program, the engine families covered by an application for 
certification shall be grouped based upon similar engine design and 
emission control system characteristics. Each of these groups shall 
constitute a separate engine family group.
    (ii) To be classed in the same engine family group, engine families 
must contain engines identical in all of the following respects:
    (A) The combustion cycle.
    (B) The cylinder block configuration (air-cooled or water-cooled; L-
6, V-8, rotary, etc.).
    (C) Displacement (engines of different displacement within 50 cubic 
inches or 15 percent of the largest displacement and contained within a 
multi-displacement engine family will be included in the same engine 
family group).
    (D) Catalytic converter usage and basic type (non-catalyst, 
oxidation catalyst only, three-way catalyst equipped).
    (9) Engine families identical in all respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(8) of this section may be further divided into different engine 
family groups if the Administrator determines that they are expected to 
have significantly different exhaust emission control system 
deterioration characteristics.
    (10) A manufacturer may request the Administrator to include in an 
engine

[[Page 197]]

family group, engine families in addition to those grouped under the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. This request must be 
accompanied by information the manufacturer believes supports the 
inclusion of these additional engine families.
    (11) A manufacturer may combine into a single engine family group 
those light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck engine families which 
otherwise meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(8) through (a)(10) of 
this section.
    (12) The vehicles covered by an application for certification 
equipped with gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty engines 
will be divided into groupings of vehicles on the basis of physical 
features which are expected to affect evaporative emissions. Each group 
of vehicles with similar features shall be defined as a separate 
evaporative emission family.
    (13) For gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles to 
be classified in the same evaporative emission family, vehicles must be 
identical with respect to:
    (i) Method of fuel/air metering (i.e., carburetion versus fuel 
injection).
    (ii) Carburetor bowl fuel volume, within a 10 cc range.
    (14) For vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled 
heavy-duty engines to be classified in the same evaporative emission 
control system, vehicles must be identical with respect to:
    (i) Method of vapor storage.
    (ii) Method of carburetor sealing.
    (iii) Method of air cleaner sealing.
    (iv) Vapor storage working capacity, within a 20g range.

    (ix) Vapor storage material.
    (15) Where vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled 
heavy-duty engines are types which cannot be divided into evaporative 
emission family-control system combinations based on the criteria listed 
above, the Administrator will establish evaporative emission family-
control system combinations for those vehicles based on features most 
related to their evaporative emission characteristics.
    (16) No 1992 or later model year heavy-duty engine which is to be 
used to generate emission credits for 1992 and later banking, trading 
and averaging programs may also utilize nonconformance penalties (NCPs). 
Use of an NCP thus becomes an engine family criterion.
    (i) Use of either a NO<INF>X</INF> or a particulate matter NCP by an 
engine family precludes that family from generating either 
NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate matter emission credits.
    (ii) If a manufacturer desires to use both banked credits and NCPs 
on an engine family, two separate engine families must be established. 
One engine family must consist of engines certified for only credit use 
following the procedure specified in this subpart. The other engine 
family must be certified for only NCP use following the procedure as 
specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart L.
    (b) Emission data--(1) Emission-data vehicles. Paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section applies to light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck 
emission-data vehicles.
    (i) Vehicles will be chosen to be operated and tested for emission 
data based upon engine family groupings. Within each engine family, one 
test vehicle will be selected based on the following criteria: The 
Administrator shall select the vehicle with the heaviest equivalent test 
weight (including options) within the family. Then within that vehicle 
the Administrator shall select, in the order listed, the highest road-
load power, largest displacement, the transmission with the highest 
numerical final gear ratio (including overdrive), the highest numerical 
axle ratio offered in that engine family, and the maximum fuel flow 
calibration.
    (ii) The Administrator shall select one additional test vehicle from 
within each engine family. The vehicle selected shall be the vehicle 
expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those vehicles remaining in 
the engine family. If all vehicles within the engine family are similar 
the Administrator may waive the requirements of this paragraph.
    (iii) Within an engine family and exhaust emission control system, 
the

[[Page 198]]

manufacturer may alter any emission-data vehicle (or other vehicles such 
as including current or previous model year emission-data vehicles, fuel 
economy data vehicles, and development vehicles provided they meet 
emission-data vehicles' protocol) to represent more than one selection 
under paragraph (b)(1) (i), (ii), (iv), or (vii) of this section.
    (iv) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section do not represent each engine-system 
combination, then one vehicle of each engine-system combination not 
represented will be selected by the Administrator. The vehicle selected 
shall be the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those 
vehicles remaining in the engine family.
    (v) For high-altitude exhaust emission compliance for each engine 
family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the following procedures:

    (B) In lieu of testing vehicles according to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) 
of this section, a manufacturer may provide a statement in its 
application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's 
engineering evaluation of such high-altitude emission testing as the 
manufacturer deems appropriate,
    (1) That all light-duty vehicles not exempt under Sec. 86.090-8(h) 
comply with the emission standards at high altitude; and
    (2) That light-duty trucks sold for principal use at designated 
high-altitude locations comply with the high-altitude emission 
requirements and that all light-duty trucks sold at low altitude, which 
are not exempt under Sec. 86.091-9(g)(2), are capable of being modified 
to meet high-altitude standards.
    (vi) If 90 percent or more of the engine family sales will be in 
California, a manufacturer may substitute emission-data vehicles 
selected by the California Air Resources Board criteria for the 
selections specified in paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii), and (iv) of this 
section.
    (vii)(A) Vehicles of each evaporative emission family will be 
divided into evaporative emission control systems.
    (B) The Administrator will select the vehicle expected to exhibit 
the highest evaporative emissions, from within each evaporative family 
to be certified, from among the vehicles represented by the exhaust 
emission-data selections for the engine family, unless evaporative 
testing has already been completed on the vehicle expected to exhibit 
the highest evaporative emissions for the evaporative family as part of 
another engine family's testing.
    (C) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii)(B) of this section do not represent each evaporative 
emission control system then the Administrator will select the highest 
expected evaporative emission vehicle from within the unrepresented 
evaporative system.
    (viii) For high-altitude evaporative emission compliance for each 
evaporative emission family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the 
following procedures:
    (A) The manufacturer will select for testing under high-altitude 
conditions the one nonexempt vehicle previously selected under 
paragraphs (b)(1)(vii) (B) or (C) of this section which is expected to 
have the highest level of evaporative emissions when operated at high 
altitude or
    (B) In lieu of testing vehicles according to paragraph 
(b)(1)(viii)(A) of this section, a manufacturer may provide a statement 
in its application for certification that based on the manufacturer's 
engineering evaluation of such high-altitude emission testing as the 
manufacturer deems appropriate,
    (1) That all light-duty vehicles not exempt under Sec. 86.090-8(h) 
comply with the emission standards at high altitude, and
    (2) That light-duty trucks sold for principal use at designated 
high-altitude locations comply with the high-altitude emission 
requirements and that all light-duty trucks sold at low-altitude, which 
are not exempt under Sec. 86.091-9(g)(2), are capable of being modified 
to meet high-altitude standards.

[[Page 199]]

    (ix) Vehicles selected under paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section 
may be used to satisfy the requirements of (b)(1)(viii)(A) of this 
section.
    (x) Light-duty trucks only: (A) The manufacturer may reconfigure any 
of the low-altitude emission-data vehicles to represent the vehicle 
configuration required to be tested at high altitude.
    (B) The manufacturer is not required to test the reconfigured 
vehicle at low altitude.
    (2) Otto-cycle heavy-duty emission-data engines. Paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section applies to Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines.
    (i)-(ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) The Administrator shall select a maximum of two engines within 
each engine family based upon features indicating that they may have the 
highest emission levels of the engines in the engine family as follows:
    (A) The Administrator shall select one emission-data engine first 
based on the largest displacement within the engine family. Then within 
the largest displacement the Administrator shall select, in the order 
listed, highest fuel flow at the speed of maximum rated torque, the 
engine with the most advanced spark timing, no EGR or lowest EGR flow, 
and no air pump or lowest actual flow air pump.
    (B) The Administrator shall select one additional engine, from 
within each engine family. The engine selected shall be the engine 
expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those engines remaining in 
the engine family. If all engines within the engine family are similar 
the Administrator may waive the requirements of this paragraph.
    (iv) If the engines selected in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) 
(ii) and (iii) of this section do not represent each engine 
displacement-exhaust emission control system combination, then one 
engine of each engine displacement-exhaust emission control system 
combination not represented shall be selected by the Administrator.
    (v) Within an engine family/displacement/control system combination, 
the manufacturer may alter any emission-data engine (or other engine 
including current or previous model year emission-data engines and 
development engines provided they meet the emission-data engines' 
protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Diesel heavy-duty emission-data engines. Paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section applies to diesel heavy-duty emission-data vehicles.
    (i) Engines will be chosen to be run for emission data based upon 
engine family groupings. Within each engine family, the requirements of 
this paragraph must be met.
    (ii) Engines of each engine family will be divided into groups based 
upon their exhaust emission control systems. One engine of each system 
combination shall be run for smoke emission data and gaseous emission 
data. Either the complete gaseous emission test or the complete smoke 
test may be conducted first. Within each combination, the engine that 
features the highest fuel feed per stroke, primarily at the speed of 
maximum rated torque and secondarily at rated speed, will usually be 
selected. If there are military engines with higher fuel rates than 
other engines in the same engine system combinations, then one military 
engine shall also be selected. The engine with the highest fuel feed per 
stroke will usually be selected.
    (iii) The Administrator may select a maximum of one additional 
engine within each engine-system combination based upon features 
indicating that it may have the highest emission levels of the engines 
of that combination. In selecting this engine, the Administrator will 
consider such features as the injection system, fuel system, compression 
ratio, rated speed, rated horsepower, peak torque speed, and peak 
torque.
    (iv) Within an engine family control system combination, the 
manufacturer may alter any emission-data engine (or other engine 
including current or previous model year emission-data engines and 
development engines provided they meet the emission-data engines' 
protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (c) Durability data--(1) Light-duty vehicle durability-data 
vehicles. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to light-duty vehicle 
durability-data vehicles.

[[Page 200]]

    (i) A durability-data vehicle will be selected by the Administrator 
to represent each engine-system combination. The vehicle selected shall 
be of the engine displacement with the largest projected sales volume of 
vehicles with that control-system combination in that engine family and 
will be designated by the Administration as to transmission type, fuel 
system, inertia weight class, and test weight.
    (ii) A manufacturer may elect to operate and test additional 
vehicles to represent any engine-system combination. The additional 
vehicles must be of the same engine displacement, transmission type, 
fuel system and inertia weight class as the vehicle selected for that 
engine-system combination in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section. Notice of an intent to operate and test 
additional vehicles shall be given to the Administrator no later than 30 
days following notification of the test fleet selection.
    (2) Light-duty trucks. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies to 
vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust 
emission deterioration factors for light-duty trucks.
    (i) The manufacturer shall select the vehicles, engines, subsystems, 
or components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether 
vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components are used, they shall be 
selected so that their emissions deterioration characteristics may be 
expected to represent those of in-use vehicles, based on good 
engineering judgment.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Heavy-duty engines. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies to 
engines, subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust emission 
deterioration factors for heavy-duty engines.
    (i) The manufacturer shall select the engines, subsystems, or 
components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether 
engines, subsystems, or components are used, they shall be selected so 
that their emissions deterioration characteristics may be expected to 
represent those of in-use engines, based on good engineering judgment.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (d) For purposes of testing under Sec. 86.092-26 (a)(9) or (b)(11), 
the Administrator may require additional emission-data vehicles (or 
emission-data engines) and durability-data vehicles (light-duty vehicles 
only) identical in all material respects to vehicles (or engines) 
selected in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
Provided That the number of vehicles (or engines) selected shall not 
increase the size of either the emission-data fleet or the durability-
data fleet by more than 20 percent or one vehicle (or engine), whichever 
is greater.
    (e)(1) [Reserved]
    (2) Any manufacturer may request to certify engine families with 
combined total sales of fewer than 10,000 light-duty vehicles, light-
duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines utilizing the 
procedures contained in Sec. 86.092-14 of this subpart for emission-data 
vehicle selection and determination of deterioration factors. The 
deterioration factors shall be applied only to entire engine families.
    (f) In lieu of testing an emission-data or durability-data vehicle 
(or engine) selected under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and 
submitting data therefore, a manufacturer may, with the prior written 
approval of the Administrator, submit exhaust emission data and/or fuel 
evaporative emission data, as applicable on a similar vehicle (or 
engine) for which certification has previously been obtained or for 
which all applicable data required under Sec. 86.091-23 has previously 
been submitted.
    (g)(1) This paragraph applies to light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks, but does not apply to the production vehicles selected under 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2)(i) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination, may be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option), the full 
estimated weight of that item shall be included in the curb weight 
computation of each vehicle

[[Page 201]]

available with that item in that carline, within that engine-system 
combination.
    (ii) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of the carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option), no weight for 
that item will be added in computing the curb weight for any vehicle in 
that carline, within that engine-system combination, unless that item is 
standard equipment on the vehicle.
    (iii) In the case of mutually exclusive options, only the weight of 
the heavier option will be added in computing the curb weight.
    (iv) Optional equipment weighing less than three pounds per item 
need not be considered.
    (3)(i) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can 
reasonably be expected to influence emissions, then such items shall 
actually be installed (unless excluded under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of 
this section) on all emission-data and durability-data vehicles of that 
carline, within that engine-system combination, on which the items are 
intended to be offered in production. Items that can reasonably be 
expected to influence emissions are: air conditioning, power steering, 
power brakes, and other items determined by the Administrator.
    (ii) If the manufacturer determines by test data or engineering 
evaluation that the actual installation of the optional equipment 
required by paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section does not affect the 
emissions or fuel economy values, the optional equipment need not be 
installed on the test vehicle.
    (iii) The weight of the options shall be included in the design curb 
weight and also be represented in the weight of the test vehicles.
    (iv) The engineering evaluation, including any test data, used to 
support the deletion of optional equipment from test vehicles, shall be 
maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made available to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (4) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of a carline within 
an engine-system combination will be equipped with an item (whether that 
item is standard equipment or an option) that can reasonably be expected 
to influence emissions, that item shall not be installed on any 
emission-data vehicle or durability-data vehicle of that carline, within 
that engine-system combination, unless that item is standard equipment 
on that vehicle or specifically required by the Administrator.
    (h) Alternative Durability Program durability-data vehicles. This 
section applies to light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck durability-
data vehicles selected under the Alternative Durability Program 
described in Sec. 86.085-13.
    (1) To update the durability data to be used to determine a 
deterioration factor for each engine family group, the Administrator 
will select durability-data vehicles from the manufacturer's production 
line. Production vehicles will be selected from each model year's 
production for those vehicles certified using the Alternative Durability 
Program procedures.
    (i) The Administrator shall select the production durability-data 
vehicle designs from the designs that the manufacturer offers for sale. 
For each model year and for each engine family group, the Administrator 
may select production durability-data vehicle designs of equal number to 
the number of engine families within the engine family group, up to a 
maximum of three vehicles.
    (ii) The production durability-data vehicles representing the 
designs selected in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section will be randomly 
selected from the manufacturer's production. The Administrator will make 
these random selections unless the manufacturer (with prior approval of 
the Administrator) elects to make the random selections.
    (iii) The manufacturer may select additional production durability-
data vehicle designs from within the engine family group. The production 
durability-data vehicles representing these designs shall be randomly 
selected from the manufacturer's production in

[[Page 202]]

accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) For each production durability-data vehicle selected under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the manufacturer shall provide to the 
Administrator (before the vehicle is tested or begins service 
accumulation) the vehicle identification number. Before the vehicle 
begins service accumulation the manufacturer shall also provide the 
Administrator with a description of the durability-data vehicle as 
specified by the Administrator.
    (v) In lieu of testing a production durability-data vehicle selected 
under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and submitting data therefrom, a 
manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the Administrator, 
submit exhaust emission data from a production vehicle of the same 
configuration for which all applicable data has previously been 
submitted.
    (2) If, within an existing engine family group, a manufacturer 
requests to certify vehicles of a new design, engine family, emission 
control system, or with any other durability-related design difference, 
the Administrator will determine if the existing engine family group 
deterioration factor is appropriate for the new design. If the 
Administrator cannot make this determination or deems the deterioration 
factor not appropriate, the Administrator shall select preproduction 
durability-data vehicles under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section. If vehicles are then certified using the new design, the 
Administrator may select production vehicles with the new design under 
the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) If a manufacturer requests to certify vehicles of a new design 
that the Administrator determines are a new engine family group, the 
Administrator shall select preproduction durability-data vehicles under 
the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. If vehicles are then 
certified using the new design, the Administrator may select production 
vehicles of that design under the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 86.092-26  Mileage and service accumulation; emission measurements.

    (a)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles.
    (2) The procedure for mileage accumulation will be the Durability 
Driving Schedule as specified in appendix IV to this part. A modified 
procedure may also be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. 
Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, all vehicles will 
accumulate mileage at a measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds 
of the estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100 
pounds of being included in the next higher inertia weight class as 
specified in Sec. 86.129, the manufacturer may elect to conduct the 
respect emission tests at higher loaded vehicle weight.
    (3) Emission-data vehicles. Unless otherwise provided for in 
Sec. 86.091-23(a), emission-data vehicles shall be operated and tested 
as follows:
    (i) Otto-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each 
engine family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, 
and provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale 
used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to 
accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family 
without making a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate a 
minimum of 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) on each test vehicle within an 
engine family. All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, 
recorded, and reported to the Administrator. Any vehicle used to 
represent emission-data vehicle selections under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) 
shall be equipped with an engine and emission control system that has 
accumulated the mileage the manufacturer chose to accumulate on the test 
vehicle. Fuel economy data generated from certification vehicles 
selected in accordance with Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) with engine-system 
combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 
miles) shall be factored in accordance with Sec. 600.006-87(c). Complete 
exhaust and evaporative (if required) emission tests shall be conducted 
for each emission-data

[[Page 203]]

vehicle selection under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1). The Administrator may 
determine under Sec. 86.092-24(f) that no testing is required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1)(v) or (viii) shall be conducted at the 
mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission testing under high-altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emissions tests for emission-data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) (i), (ii), 
(iii), (iv), or (vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile 
minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing under low-altitude conditions.
    (D) For each engine family, the manufacturer will either select one 
vehicle previously selected under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) (i) through (iv) 
to be tested under high-altitude conditions or provide a statement in 
accordance with Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1)(v). Vehicles shall meet emission 
standards under both low- and high-altitude conditions without manual 
adjustments or modifications. In addition, any emission control device 
used to conform with the emission standards under high-altitude 
conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher than 4,000 
feet above sea level.
    (4)(i) Durability data vehicles. (A) Unless otherwise provided for 
in Sec. 86.091-23(a), each durability-data vehicle shall be driven, with 
all emission control systems installed and operating, for 50,000 miles 
or such lesser distance as the Administrator may agree to as meeting the 
objective of this procedure.
    (B) Complete exhaust emission tests shall be made at test point 
mileage intervals that the manufacturer determines.
    (C) At a minimum, two complete exhaust emission tests shall be made. 
The first test shall be made at a distance not greater than 6,250 miles. 
The last shall be made at 50,000 miles.
    (D) The mileage interval between test points must be of equal length 
except for the interval between zero miles and the first test, and any 
interval before or after testing conducted in conjunction with vehicle 
maintenance as specified in Sec. 86.090-25(g)(2).
    (ii) The manufacturer may, at its option, alter the durability-data 
vehicle at the selected test point to represent emission-data vehicle(s) 
within the same engine-system combination and perform emission tests on 
the altered vehicle. Upon completion of emission testing, the 
manufacturer may return the test vehicle to the durability-data vehicle 
configuration and continue mileage accumulation.
    (5)(i) All tests required by this subpart on emission-data vehicles 
shall be conducted at a mileage equal to or greater than the mileage the 
manufacturer determines under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (ii) All tests required by this subpart on durability-data vehicles 
shall be conducted within 250 miles of each of the test points.
    (6)(i)(A) The manufacturer may conduct multiple tests at any test 
point at which the data are intended to be used in the deterioration 
factor. At each test point where multiple tests are conducted, the test 
results from all valid tests shall be averaged to determine the data 
point to be used in the deterioration factor calculation, except under 
paragraph (a)(6)(i)(B) of this section. The test results from emission 
tests performed before maintenance affecting emissions shall not be 
averaged with test results after the maintenance.
    (B) The manufacturer is not required to average multiple tests if 
the manufacturer conducts no more than three tests at each test point 
and if the number of tests at each test point is equal. All test points 
must be treated the same for all exhaust pollutants.
    (ii) The results of all emission testing shall be supplied to the 
Administrator. The manufacturer shall furnish to the Administrator 
explanation for voiding any test. The Administrator will determine if 
voiding the test was appropriate based upon the explanation given by the 
manufacturer for the voided test. Tests between test points may be 
conducted as required by the Administrator. Data from all tests 
(including voided tests) may be submitted weekly to the Administrator, 
but shall be air

[[Page 204]]

posted or delivered to the Administrator within 7 days after completion 
of the test. In addition, all test data shall be compiled and provided 
to the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 86.091-23. Where the 
Administrator conducts a test on a durability-data vehicle at a 
prescribed test point, the results of that test will be used in the 
calculation of the deterioration factor.
    (iii) The results of all emission tests shall be rounded, using the 
``Rounding Off Method'' specified in ASTM E 29-67, to the number of 
places to the right of the decimal point indicated by expressing the 
applicable emission standard of this subpart to one additional 
significant figure.
    (7) Whenever a manufacturer intends to operate and test a vehicle 
which may be used for emission or durability data, the manufacturer 
shall retain in its records all information concerning all emissions 
tests and maintenance, including vehicle alterations to represent other 
vehicle selections. For emission-data vehicles, this information shall 
be submitted, including the vehicle description and specification 
information required by the Administrator, to the Administrator 
following the emission-data test. For durability-data vehicles, this 
information shall be submitted following the 5,000-mile test.
    (8) Once a manufacturer submits the information required in 
paragraphs (a)(7) of this section for a durability-data vehicle, the 
manufacturer shall continue to run the vehicle to 50,000 miles, and the 
data from the vehicle will be used in the calculations under 
Sec. 86.091-28. Discontinuation of a durability-data vehicle shall be 
allowed only with the consent of the Administrator.
    (9)(i) The Administrator may elect to operate and test any test 
vehicle during all or any part of the mileage accumulation and testing 
procedure. In such cases, the manufacturer shall provide the vehicle(s) 
to the Administrator with all information necessary to conduct this 
testing.
    (ii) The test procedures in Secs. 86.106 through 86.145 will be 
followed by the Administrator. The Administrator will test the vehicles 
at each test point. Maintenance may be performed by the manufacturer 
under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.
    (iii) The data developed by the Administrator for the engine-system 
combination shall be combined with any applicable data supplied by the 
manufacturer on other vehicles of that combination to determine the 
applicable deterioration factors for the combination. In the case of a 
significant discrepancy between data developed by the Administrator and 
that submitted by the manufacturer, the Administrator's data shall be 
used in the determination of deterioration factors.
    (10) Emission testing of any type with respect to any certification 
vehicle other than that specified in this part is not allowed except as 
such testing may be specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (11) This section does not apply to testing conducted to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 86.091-23(b)(2).
    (b)(1) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to light-duty trucks.
    (2) There are three types of mileage or service accumulation 
applicable to light-duty trucks:
    (i) Mileage or service accumulation on vehicles, engines, 
subsystems, or components selected by the manufacturer under 
Sec. 86.092-24(c)(2)(i). The manufacturer determines the form and extent 
of this mileage or service accumulation, consistent with good 
engineering practice, and describes it in the application for 
certification.
    (ii) Mileage accumulation of the duration selected by the 
manufacturer on emission-data vehicles selected under Sec. 86.092-
24(b)(1). The procedure for mileage accumulation will be the Durability 
Driving Schedule as specified in appendix IV to this part. A modified 
procedure may also be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. 
Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, all vehicles will 
accumulate mileage at a measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds 
of the estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100

    (iii) Service or mileage accumulation which may be part of the test 
procedures used by the manufacturer to establish evaporative emission 
deterioration factors.
    (3) Exhaust emission deterioration factors will be determined on the 
basis of the mileage or service accumulation described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section and related testing, according to the 
manufacturer's procedures.
    (4) Each emission-data vehicle shall be operated and tested as 
follows:
    (i) Otto-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each 
engine family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, 
and provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale 
used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to 
accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family 
without making a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate a 
minimum of 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) on each test vehicle within an 
engine family. All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, 
recorded, and reported to the Administrator. Any vehicle used to 
represent emission-data vehicle selections under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) 
shall be equipped with an engine and emission control system that has 
accumulated the mileage the manufacturer chose to accumulate on the test 
vehicle. Fuel economy data generated from certification vehicles 
selected in accordance with Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) with engine-system 
combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 
miles) shall be factored in accordance with Sec. 600.006-87(c). Complete 
exhaust emission tests shall be conducted for each emission-data vehicle 
selection under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1). The Administrator may determine 
under Sec. 86.092-24(f) that no testing is required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.092-24 (b)(1)(v) or (b)(1)(viii) shall be conducted at the 
mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission testing or at 6,436 kilometers (4,000 miles) 
under high-altitude conditions.

vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) (ii), (iii), 
(iv)(A), or (vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile 
minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing or at 6,436 kilometer (4,000 mile) test point under 
low-altitude conditions.
    (D) If the manufacturer recommends adjustments or modifications in 
order to conform to emission standards at high altitude, such 
adjustments or modifications shall be made to the test vehicle selected 
under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) (v) and (viii) (in accordance with the 
instructions to be provided to the ultimate purchaser) before being 
tested under high-altitude conditions.
    (ii) Diesel. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each engine 
family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized 
for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, and provide 
to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale used in 
making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 
4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family without making 
a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate a minimum of 2,000 
miles (3,219 kilometers) on each test vehicle within an engine family. 
All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, recorded, and 
reported to the Administrator. Any vehicle used to represent emission-
data vehicle selections under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) shall be equipped 
with an engine and emission control system that has accumulated the 
mileage the manufacturer chose to accumulate on the test vehicle. Fuel 
economy data generated from certification vehicles selected in 
accordance with Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) with engine-system combinations 
that have accumulated more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be 
factored in accordance with Sec. 600.006-87(c). Complete exhaust 
emission tests shall be conducted for each emission-data vehicle 
selection under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1). The administrator may determine 
under Sec. 86.092-24(f) that no testing is required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.092-24 (b)(1)(v) shall be conducted at

[[Page 206]]

the mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination 
is stabilized for emission testing or at the 6,436 kilometer (4,000 
mile) test point under high-altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emission tests for emission-data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.092-24 (b)(1) (ii), (iii), 
and (iv) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which 
the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing or at 
the 6,436 kilometer (4,000 mile) test point under low-altitude 
conditions.
    (D) If the manufacturer recommends adjustments or modifications in 
order to conform to emission standards at high altitude, such 
adjustments or modifications shall be made to the test vehicle selected 
under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(1) (v) and (viii) (in accordance with the 
instructions to be provided to the ultimate purchaser) before being 
tested under high-altitude conditions.
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) All tests required by this subpart on emission-data vehicles 
shall be conducted at a mileage equal to or greater than the mileage the 
manufacturer determines under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (c)(1) Paragraph (c) of this section applies to heavy-duty engines.
    (2) There are two types of service accumulation applicable to heavy-
duty engines:
    (i) Service accumulation on engines, subsystems, or components 
selected by the manufacturer under Sec. 86.092-24(c)(3)(i). The 
manufacturer determines the form and extent of this service 
accumulation, consistent with good engineering practice, and describes 
it in the application for certification.
    (ii) Dynamometer service accumulation on emission-data engines 
selected under Sec. 86.092-24 (b)(2) or (b)(3). The manufacturer 
determines the engine operating schedule to be used for dynamometer 
service accumulation, consistent with good engineering practice. A 
single engine operating schedule shall be used for all engines in an 
engine family-control system combination. Operating schedules may be 
different for different combinations.
    (3) Exhaust emission deterioration factors will be determined on the 
basis of the service accumulation described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section and related testing, according to the manufacturer's 
procedures.
    (4) The manufacturer shall determine, for each engine family, the 
number of hours at which the engine system combination is stabilized (no 
less than 62 hours for catalyst equipped) for emission-data testing. The 
manufacturer shall maintain, and provide to the Administrator if 
requested a record of the rationale used in making this determination. 
The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 125 hours on each test engine 
within an engine family without making a determination. Any engine used 
to represent emission-data engine selections under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(2) 
shall be equipped with an engine system combination that has accumulated 
at least the number of hours determined under this paragraph. Complete 
exhaust emission tests shall be conducted for each emission-data engine 
selection under Sec. 86.092-24(b)(2). Evaporative emission controls need 
not be connected provided normal operating conditions are maintained in 
the engine induction system. The Administrator may determine under 
Sec. 86.092-24(f) that no testing is required.
    (d)(1) Paragraph (d) of this section applies to both light-duty 
trucks and heavy-duty engines.
    (2)(i) The results of all emission testing shall be supplied to the 
Administrator. The manufacturer shall furnish to the Administrator 
explanation for voiding any test. The Administrator will determine if 
voiding the test was appropriate based upon the explanation given by the 
manufacturer for the voided test. Tests between test points may be 
conducted as required by the Administrator. Data from all tests 
(including voided tests) may be submitted weekly to the Administrator, 
but shall be air posted or delivered to the Administrator within 7 days 
after completion of the test. In addition, all test data shall be 
compiled and provided to the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 86.092-23. Where the Administrator conducts a test on a durability-
data vehicle at a prescribed test point, the results of that test will 
be used in the calculation of the deterioration factor.
    (ii) The results of all emission tests shall be recorded and 
reported to the

[[Page 207]]

Administrator. These test results shall be rounded, in accordance with 
ASTM E 29-67, to the number of decimal places contained in the 
applicable emission standard expressed to one additional significant 
figure.
    (3) Whenever a manufacturer intends to operate and test a vehicle 
(or engine) which may be used for emission data, the manufacturer shall 
retain in its records all information concerning all emissions tests and 
maintenance, including vehicle (or engine) alterations to represent 
other vehicle (or engine) selections. This information shall be 
submitted, including the vehicle (or engine) description and 
specification information required by the Administrator, to the 
Administrator following the emission-data test.
    (4)-(5) [Reserved]
    (6) Emission testing of any type with respect to any certification 
vehicle or engine other than that specified in this subpart is not 
allowed except as such testing may be specifically authorized by the 
Administrator.

Sec. 86.093-2  Definitions.

    The definitions of Sec. 86.092-2 continue to apply. The definitions 
listed in this section apply beginning with the 1993 model year.
    Bus means a heavy heavy-duty diesel-powered passenger-carrying 
vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen or more passengers that is 
centrally fueled, and all urban buses. This definition only applies in 
the context of Secs. 86.093-11 and 86.093-35.
    Centrally fueled bus means a bus that is refueled at least 75 
percent of the time at one refueling facility that is owned, operated, 
or controlled by the bus operator.
    Urban bus means a passenger-carrying vehicle powered by a heavy 
heavy-duty diesel engine, or of a type normally powered by a heavy 
heavy-duty diesel engine, with a load capacity of fifteen or more 
passengers and intended primarily for intracity operation, i.e., within 
the confines of a city or greater metropolitan area. Urban bus operation 
is characterized by short rides and frequent stops. To facilitate this 
type of operation, more than one set of quick-operating entrance and 
exit doors would normally be installed. Since fares are usually paid in 
cash or tokens, rather than purchased in advance in the form of tickets, 
urban buses would normally have equipment installed for collection of 
fares. Urban buses are also typically characterized by the absence of 
equipment and facilities for long distance travel, e.g., rest rooms, 
large luggage compartments, and facilities for stowing carry-on luggage. 
The useful life for urban buses is the same as the useful life for other 
heavy heavy-duty diesel engines.

Sec. 86.094-1  General applicability.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart generally apply to 1994 and later 
model year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles, 1994 and 
later model year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty trucks, and 
1994 and later model year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle heavy-duty 
engines. In cases where a provision applies only to a certain vehicle 
group based on its model year, vehicle class, motor fuel, engine type, 
or other distinguishing characteristics, the limited applicability is 
cited in the appropriate section or paragraph.
    (b) Optional applicability. A manufacturer may request to certify 
any heavy-duty vehicle of 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating or 
less in accordance with the light-duty truck provisions. Heavy-duty 
engine or vehicle provisions do not apply to such a vehicle.
    (c)-(d) [Reserved]
    (e) Small volume manufacturers. Special certification procedures are 
available for any manufacturer whose projected combined U.S. sales of 
light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-
duty engines in its product line (including all vehicles and engines 
imported under the provisions of Secs. 85.1505 and 85.1509 of this 
chapter are fewer than 10,000 units for the model year in which the 
manufacturer seeks certification. To certify its product line under 
these optional procedures, the small-volume manufacturer must first 
obtain the Administrator's approval. The manufacturer must meet the 
eligibility criteria specified in Sec. 86.092-14(b) before the 
Administrator's approval will be granted. The small-volume 
manufacturer's certification procedures are described in Sec. 86.092-14.
    (f) Optional procedures for determining exhaust opacity. (1) The 
provisions of subpart I of this part apply to tests which are performed 
by the Administrator, and optionally, by the manufacturer.
    (2) Measurement procedures, other than that described in subpart I 
of this part, may be used by the manufacturer provided the manufacturer 
satisfies the requirements of Sec. 86.091-23(f).
    (3) When a manufacturer chooses to use an alternative measurement 
procedure it has the responsibility to determine whether the results 
obtained by the procedure will correlate with the results which would be 
obtained from the measurement procedure in subpart I of this part. 
Consequently, the Administrator will not routinely approve or disapprove 
any alternative opacity measurement procedure or any associated 
correlation data which the manufacturer elects to use to satisfy the 
data requirements for subpart I of this part.
    (4) If a confirmatory test(s) is performed and the results indicate 
there is a systematic problem suggesting that the data generated under 
an optional alternative measurement procedure do not adequately 
correlate with data obtained in accordance with the procedures described 
in subpart I of this part, EPA may require that all certificates of 
conformity not already issued be based on data obtained from procedures 
described in subpart I of this part.

intelligent sensors connected in parallel with either one or two 
communication wires. The information is broadcast over the communication 
wires for use by other modules (e.g., chassis, transmission, etc.) to 
conduct normal vehicle operation or for use by diagnostic tools. Data 
stream information does not include engine calibration related 
information.

vehicle against damage or accident; or
    (3) The AECD does not go beyond the requirements of engine starting.
    Durability useful life means the highest useful life mileage out of 
the set of all useful life mileages that apply to a given vehicle. The 
durability useful life determines the duration of service accumulation 
on a durability data vehicle. The determination of durability useful 
life shall reflect any alternative useful life mileages approved by the 
Administrator under Sec. 86.094-21(f). The determination of durability 
useful life shall exclude any standard and related useful life mileage 
for which the manufacturer has obtained a waiver of emission data 
submission requirements under Sec. 86.094-23(c)
    Element of design means any control system (i.e., computer software, 
electronic control system, emission control system, computer logic), 
and/or control system calibrations, and/or the results of systems 
interaction, and/or hardware items on a motor vehicle or motor vehicle 
engine.

    (B)(1)(i) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining 
compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section shall be based on 
total actual U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles of the applicable model 
year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, 
or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale. If the 
option of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(1)(ii) of this section is taken, such 
sales percentages shall be based on the total actual combined U.S. sales 
of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks of the applicable 
model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, 
broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale.
    (ii) The manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual 
volume produced for U.S. sale to be used in lieu of actual U.S. sales 
for purposes of determining compliance with the implementation schedule 
sales percentages of tables A94-1 and A94-4 of this section. Such 
petition shall be submitted within 30 days of the end of the model year 
to the Manufacturers Operations Division. For the petition to be 
granted, the manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that actual production volume is functionally equivalent 
to actual sales volume.
    (iii) The manufacturer may count toward the sales percentages light-
duty vehicles of the applicable model year that meet certain standards 
for that same model year contained in Title 13, California Code of 
Regulations, Section 1960.1, and the incorporated ``California Exhaust 
Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1988 and Subsequent Model 
Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-Duty Vehicles.'' (Copies 
may be obtained from Barclays Law Publishers, P.O. Box 3066, San 
Francisco, CA 94080.) The relevant standards from that source are those 
that are designated as phase-in standards for selected pollutants and 
were first applied in the 1993 model year, as well as those for all 
remaining pollutants that require compliance at the one hundred percent 
level. If this option is taken, all light-duty vehicles sold in 
jurisdictions adopting such standards shall be counted toward the total 
upon which the sales percentage is based. If this option is not taken, 
light-duty vehicles sold in such jurisdictions are to be excluded from 
counting toward either the total upon which the sales percentage is 
based or the sales percentage itself.
    (iv) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14 (b)(1) 
and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedules of tables A94-1 
and A94-4 of this section for model years 1994 and 1995. For small 
volume manufacturers, Tier 0 standards of tables A94-2 and A94-5 
continue to apply until model year 1996 when one hundred percent

[[Page 228]]

compliance with the Tier 1 standards of tables A94-2, A94-3, A94-5, and 
A94-6 is required. This exemption does not apply to small volume engine 
families as defined in Sec. 86.092-14 (b)(5).
    (2)(i) Where the required implementation schedule sales percentages 
for in-use purposes, as prescribed in subpart H of this part, are the 
same in a given model year as the required implementation schedule sales 
percentages for certification purposes, as prescribed in this section, 
the same engine families must comprise the respective percentages.
    (ii) Where the required implementation schedule sales percentages 
for in-use purposes differ from implementation schedule sales 
percentages for certification purposes in a particular model year, the 
manufacturer must designate, at the time of Application for 
Certification, which families will meet each applicable in-use phase-in 
percentage.
    (3) The manufacturer must state at the time of Application for 
Certification, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which families will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages for certification purposes.
    (4) A manufacturer can not use one set of engine families to meet 
its intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its full 
useful life standards. The same families which are used to meet the 
intermediate useful life standards will be required without deviation to 
meet the corresponding full useful life standards.
    (ii) A manufacturer may elect to include all or some of its diesel-
cycle light-duty vehicle engine families subject to the Tier 0 standards 
in the appropriate particulate averaging program (petroleum or 
methanol), provided that vehicles produced for sale in California or in 
designated high-altitude areas may be averaged only within each of these 
areas. Averaging is not permitted between fuel types. If the 
manufacturer elects to average light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks 
together in the appropriate particulate averaging program, its composite 
particulate standard applies to the combined set of light-duty vehicles 
and light-duty trucks included in the average and is calculated as 
defined in Sec. 86.090-2.
    (2) The standards set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section 
refer to the exhaust emitted over a driving schedule as set forth in 
subpart B of this part and measured and calculated in accordance with 
those procedures. The test weight basis for light-duty vehicles, for the 
purposes of determining equivalent test weight as prescribed in 
Sec. 86.129-94, shall be loaded vehicle weight.
    (b) Fuel evaporative emissions from 1994 and later model year light-
duty vehicles shall not exceed (compliance with these standards is 
optional for 1994 model year methanol-fueled engines):
    (1) Hydrocarbons (for gasoline-fueled vehicles). 2.0 grams per test.
    (2) Total Hydrocarbon Equivalent (for methanol-fueled vehicles). 2.0 
grams carbon per test.
    (3) The standards set forth in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this 
section refers to a composite sample of the fuel evaporative emissions 
collected under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part and 
measured in accordance with those procedures.
    (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient 
atmosphere from any 1994 and later model year Otto-cycle, or methanol-or 
gaseous-fueled diesel light-duty vehicle. This requirement is optional 
for 1994 through 1996 model year gaseous-fueled light-duty vehicles.
    (d)-(f) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.090-8.
    (g) Any 1994 and later model year light-duty vehicle that a 
manufacturer wishes to certify for sale shall meet the emission 
standards under both low- and high-altitude conditions as specified in 
Sec. 86.082-2, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this 
section. Vehicles shall meet emission standards under both low- and 
high-altitude conditions without manual adjustments or modifications. 
Any emission control device used to meet emission standards under high-
altitude conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher 
than 4,000 feet above sea level.
    (h) The manufacturer may exempt 1994 and later model year vehicles 
from

[[Page 229]]

compliance at high altitude with the emission standards set forth in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if the vehicles are not intended 
for sale at high altitude and if the requirements of paragraphs (h) (1) 
and (2) of this section are met.
    (1) A vehicle configuration shall only be considered eligible for 
exemption under paragraph (h) of this section if the requirements of 
either paragraph (h)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section are 
met.
    (i) Its design parameters (displacement-to-weight ratio (D/W) and 
engine speed-to-vehicle-speed ratio (N/V)) fall within the exempted 
range for that manufacturer for that year. The exempted range is 
determined according to the following procedure:
    (A) The manufacturer shall graphically display the D/W and N/V data 
of all vehicle configurations it will offer for the model year in 
question. The axis of the abscissa shall be D/W (where (D) is the engine 
displacement expressed in cubic centimeters and (W) is the equivalent 
vehicle test weight expressed in pounds), and the axis of the ordinate 
shall be N/V (where (N) is the crankshaft speed expressed in revolutions 
per minute and (V) is the vehicle speed expressed in miles per hour). At 
the manufacturer's option, either the 1:1 transmission gear ratio or the 
lowest numerical gear ratio available in the transmission will be used 
to determine N/V. The gear selection must be the same for all N/V data 
points on the manufacturer's graph. For each transmission/axle ratio 
combination, only the lowest N/V value shall be used in the graphical 
display.
    (B) The product line is then defined by the equation, N/V = C(D/W) 
<SUP>-0.9</SUP>, where the constant, C, is determined by the requirement 
that all the vehicle data points either fall on the line or lie to the 
upper right of the line as displayed on the graphs.
    (C) The exemption line is then defined by the equation, N/V = C(0.84 
D/W) <SUP>-0.9</SUP>, where the constant, C, is the same as that found 
in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (D) The exempted range includes all values of N/V and D/W which 
simultaneously fall to the lower left of the exemption line as drawn on 
the graph.
    (ii) Its design parameters fall within the alternate exempted range 
for that manufacturer that year. The alternate exempted range is 
determined by substituting rated horsepower (hp) for displacement (D) in 
the exemption procedure described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section 
and by using the product line N/V = C(hp/W) <SUP>-0.9</SUP>.
    (A) Rated horsepower shall be determined by using the Society of 
Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J 1349, June 1990, Engine Power Test 
Code--Spark Ignition and Compression Ignition--Net Power Rating. This 
incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal 
Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies 
may be obtained from SAE International, 400 Commonwealth Drive, 
Warrendale, PA, 15096-0001. Copies may be inspected at U.S. EPA, OAR, 
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, or at the Office of the Federal 
Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Any 
of the horsepower determinants within that test procedure may be used, 
as long as it is used consistently throughout the manufacturer's product 
line in any model year.
    (B) No exemptions will be allowed under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this 
section to any manufacturer that has exempted vehicle configurations as 
set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Its acceleration time (the time it takes a vehicle to 
accelerate from 0 miles per hour to a speed not less than 40 miles per 
hour and not greater than 50 miles per hour) under high-altitude 
conditions is greater than the largest acceleration time under low-
altitude conditions for that manufacturer for that year. The procedure 
to be followed in making this determination is:
    (A) The manufacturer shall list the vehicle configuration and 
acceleration time under low-altitude conditions of that vehicle 
configuration which has the highest acceleration time under low-altitude 
conditions of all the vehicle configurations it will offer for the model 
year in question. The manufacturer shall also submit a description of 
the methodology used to make this determination.

[[Page 230]]

    (B) The manufacturer shall then list the vehicle configurations and 
acceleration times under high-altitude conditions of all those vehicle 
configurations which have higher acceleration times under high-altitude 
conditions than the highest acceleration time at low altitude identified 
in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (iv) In lieu of performing the test procedure of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section, its acceleration time can be 
estimated based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation, in 
accordance with good engineering practice, to meet the exemption 
criteria of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) A vehicle shall only be considered eligible for exemption under 
this paragraph (h) if at least one configuration of its model type (and 
transmission configuration in the case of vehicles equipped with manual 
transmissions, excluding differences due to the presence of overdrive) 
is certified to meet emission standards under high-altitude conditions 
as specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) and (g) of this section. The 
Certificate of Conformity (the Certificate) covering any exempted 
configuration(s) will also apply to the corresponding non-exempt 
configuration(s) required under this paragraph (h)(2). As a condition to 
the exemption, any suspension, revocation, voiding, or withdrawal of the 
Certificate as it applies to a non-exempt configuration for any reason 
will result in a suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
corresponding exempted configuration(s) of that model type, unless there 
is at least one other corresponding non-exempt configuration of the same 
model type still covered by the Certificate. The suspension of the 
Certificate as it applies to the exempted configuration(s) will be 
terminated when any one of the following occurs:
    (i) Another corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) receive(s) 
coverage under the Certificate; or
    (ii) Suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) is terminated; or
    (iii) The Agency's action(s), with respect to suspension, 
revocation, voiding, or withdrawal of the Certificate as it applies to 
the corresponding non-exempt configuration(s), is reversed.
    (3) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at a designated high-
altitude location that has been exempted as set forth in paragraph (h) 
of this section will be considered a violation of section 203(a)(1) of 
the Clean Air Act.
    (i)(1) The manufacturers may exempt 1994 and later model year 
vehicles from compliance at low altitude with the emission standards set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 86.090-8 (b) if the 
vehicles:
    (i) Are not intended for sale at low altitude; and
    (ii) Are equipped with a unique, high-altitude axle ratio (rear-
wheel drive vehicles) or a unique, high-altitude drivetrain (front-wheel 
drive vehicles) with a higher N/V ratio than other configurations of 
that model type which are certified in compliance with the emission 
standards of paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 86.090-8 (b) under 
low-altitude conditions.
    (2) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at low altitude that has 
been exempted as set forth in paragraph (i)(1) of this section will be 
considered a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act.
    (j) Any exempted light-duty vehicle that a manufacturer wishes to 
certify for sale under the provisions of Sec. 86.090-8 (h) or paragraph 
(i) of this section is subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this 
part.
    (k) Cold Temperature Carbon Monoxide (CO) Standards. (1) For 
gasoline-fueled light-duty vehicles, a minimum of the percentage shown 
in table A94-16 of a manufacturer's sales of the applicable model year's 
light-duty vehicles shall not exceed the applicable cold temperature CO 
standard of 10.0 grams per mile for an intermediate useful life of 
50,000 miles, as measured and calculated under the provisions set forth 
in subpart C of this part. This standard applies under both low and high 
altitude conditions. At the manufacturer's option, the manufacturer may 
combine the sales of gasoline-fueled light-duty vehicles and gasoline-
fueled light-duty trucks in determining compliance with the required 
1994 and 1995 model year phase-in percentages as included in table A94-
16.

[[Page 231]]

    (2)(i) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining compliance 
with paragraph (k)(1) of this section shall be based on total actual 
and, at the manufacturer's option, combined U.S. sales of light-duty 
vehicles, light light-duty trucks, and heavy light-duty trucks of the 
applicable model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet 
operator, broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first 
sale.
    (ii) The manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual 
volume produced for U.S. sales to be used in lieu of actual U.S. sales 
for purposes of determining compliance with the implementation schedule 
sales percentages of table A94-16. Such petition shall be submitted 
within 30 days of the end of the model year the Manufacturers Operations 
Division. For the petition to be granted, the manufacturer must 
establish to the satisfaction of the Administrator that actual 
production volume is functionally equivalent to actual sales volume.
    (iii) The manufacturer may count towards the sales percentages those 
light-duty vehicles, light light-duty trucks, and heavy light-duty 
trucks of the applicable model year sold in the state of California or 
in jurisdictions which have adopted the California emission standards 
under section 177 of the Clean Air Act if those light-duty vehicles, 
light light-duty trucks, and heavy light-duty trucks certified have been 
to meet the federally mandated cold CO standards. If this option is 
taken, all light-duty vehicles, light light-duty trucks, and heavy 
light-duty trucks sold in California and such jurisdictions shall be 
counted toward the total upon which the sales percentage is based. If 
this option is not taken, light-duty vehicles, light light-duty trucks, 
and heavy light-duty trucks sold in California or such jurisdictions are 
to be excluded from counting toward either the total upon which the 
sales percentage is based or the sales percentage itself.
    (iv) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b) (1) 
and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedules of table A94-16 
for model years 1994 and 1995. This exemption does not apply to small 
volume engine families as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b)(5).
    (v) The manufacturer must state at the time of applying for the 
Certificate, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which engine families will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages.

\1\ Applicable only to diesel-cycle vehicles.

    (B)(1)(i) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining 
compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section shall be based on 
total actual U.S. sales of light light-duty trucks of the applicable 
model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, 
broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale. If 
the option of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(1)(ii) of this section is taken, 
such sales percentages shall be based on the total actual combined U.S. 
sales of light-duty vehicles and

[[Page 234]]

light light-duty trucks of the applicable model year by a manufacturer 
to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any other entity 
which comprises the point of first sale.
    (ii) The manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual 
volume produced for U.S. sales to be used in lieu of actual U.S. sales 
for purposes of determining compliance with the implementation schedule 
sales percentages of tables A94-7 and A94-10 of this section. Such 
petition shall be submitted within 30 days of the end of the model year 
to the Manufacturers Operations Division. For the petition to be 
granted, the manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that actual production volume is functionally equivalent 
to actual sales volume.
    (iii) The manufacturer may count toward the sales percentages light 
light-duty trucks of the applicable model year that meet certain 
standards for that same model year contained in Title 13, ``California 
Code of Regulations, Section 1960.1, and the incorporated California 
Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1988 and Subsequent 
Model Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-Duty Vehicles.'' 
(Copies may be obtained from Barclays Law Publishers, P.O. Box 3066, San 
Francisco, CA 94080.) The relevant standards from that source are those 
that are designated as phase-in standards for selected pollutants and 
were first applied in the 1993 model year, as well as those for all 
remaining pollutants that require compliance at the one hundred percent 
level. If this option is taken, all light light-duty trucks sold in 
jurisdictions adopting such standards shall be counted toward the total 
upon which the sales percentage is based. If this option is not taken, 
light light-duty trucks sold in such jurisdictions are to be excluded 
from counting toward either the total upon which the sales percentage is 
based or the sales percentage itself.
    (iv) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b) (1) 
and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedules of table A94-7 of 
this section for model years 1994 and 1995 and from the implementation 
schedules of table A94-10 of this section for model years 1995 and 1996. 
For small volume manufacturers, the Tier 0 standards of table A94-9 
continue to apply until model year 1996, and the Tier 0 standards of 
table A94-12 continue to apply until model year 1997, when one hundred 
percent compliance with the Tier 1 standards of tables A94-8, A94-9, 
A94-11, and A94-12 is required. This exemption does not apply to small 
volume engine families as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b)(5).
    (2)(i)Where the required implementation schedule sales percentages 
for in-use purposes, as prescribed in subpart H of this part, are the 
same in a given model year as the required implementation schedule sales 
percentages for certification purposes, as prescribed in this section, 
the same engine families must comprise the respective percentages.
    (ii) Where the required implementation schedule sales percentages 
for in-use purposes differ from implementation schedule sales 
percentages for certification purposes in a particular model year, the 
manufacturer must designate, at the time of Application for 
Certification, which families will meet each applicable in-use phase-in 
percentage.
    (3) The manufacturer must state at the time of Application for 
Certification, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which families will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages for certification purposes.
    (4) A manufacturer can not use one set of engine families to meet 
its intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its full 
useful life standards. The same families which are used to meet the 
intermediate useful life standards will be required without deviation to 
meet the corresponding full useful life standards.
    (ii) Heavy light-duty trucks. Exhaust emissions from 1994 and later 
model year heavy light-duty trucks shall meet all standards in Tables 
A94-14 and A94-15 in the rows designated with the applicable fuel type 
and loaded vehicle weight or adjusted loaded vehicle weight, as 
applicable, according to the implementation schedule in Table A94-13, as 
follows (optional for 1994 through

    (B)(1)(i) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining 
compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall be based 
on total actual U.S. sales of heavy light-duty trucks of the applicable 
model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, 
broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale.
    (ii) The manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual 
volume produced for U.S. sale to be used in lieu of actual U.S. sales 
for purposes of determining compliance with the implementation schedule 
sales percentages of table A94-13 of this section. Such petition shall 
be submitted within 30 days of the end of the model year to the 
Manufacturers Operations Division. For the petition to be granted, the 
manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the Administrator 
that actual production volume is functionally equivalent to actual sales 
volume.
    (iii) The manufacturer may count toward the sales percentages heavy 
light-duty trucks of the applicable model year that meet certain 
standards for that same model year contained in Title 13, California 
Code of Regulations, Section 1960.1, and the incorporated ``California 
Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1988 and Subsequent 
Model Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-Duty Vehicles.'' The 
relevant standards from that source are those that are designated as 
phase-in standards for selected pollutants and were first applied in the 
1995 model year, as well as those for all remaining pollutants that 
require compliance at the one hundred percent level. If this option is 
taken, all heavy light-duty trucks sold in jurisdictions adopting such 
standards shall be counted toward the total upon which the sales 
percentage is based. If this option is not taken, heavy light-duty 
trucks sold in such jurisdictions are to be excluded from counting 
toward either the total upon which the sales percentage is based or the 
sales percentage itself.
    (iv) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b) (1) 
and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedule of table A94-13 of 
this section for model year 1996. For small volume manufacturers, the 
Tier 0 standards of table A94-15 continue to apply until model year 
1997, when one hundred percent compliance with the Tier 1 standards of 
tables A94-14 and A94-15 is required. This exemption does not apply to 
small volume engine families as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b)(5).
    (2)(i) Where the required implementation schedule sales percentages 
for in-use purposes, as prescribed in subpart H of this part, are the 
same in a given model year as the required implementation schedule sales 
percentages for certification purposes, as prescribed in this section, 
the same engine families must comprise the respective percentages.
    (ii) Where the required implementation schedule sales percentages 
for in-use purposes differ from implementation schedule sales 
percentages for certification purposes in a particular model year, the 
manufacturer must designate, at the time of Application for 
Certification, which families will meet each applicable in-use phase-in 
percentage.
    (3) The manufacturer must state at the time of Application for 
Certification, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which families will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages for certification purposes.
    (4) A manufacturer cannot use one set of engine families to meet its 
intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its full useful 
life standards. The same families which are used to meet the 
intermediate useful life standards will be required without deviation to 
meet the corresponding full useful life standards.
    (iii) Exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide from 1994 and later model 
year light-duty trucks shall not exceed 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow 
at curb idle at a useful life of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever 
first occurs (for Otto-cycle, and methanol-and gaseous-fueled diesel 
light-duty trucks only--optional for 1994 through 1996 model year 
gaseous-fueled light-duty trucks).
    (iv)(A) A manufacturer may elect to include all or some of its 
light-duty truck engine families subject to the Tier 0 standards in the 
NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program, provided that it does not

[[Page 237]]

elect to pay an NCP for noncompliance with any emission standard 
applicable to that light-duty truck family. Trucks produced for sale in 
California or in designated high-altitude areas may be averaged only 
within each of those areas. Petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled engine 
families may not be averaged together. Otto-cycle and diesel engines 
families also may not be averaged together. If the manufacturer elects 
to participate in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program, individual 
family NO<INF>X</INF> emission limits may not exceed 2.3 grams per mile. 
If the manufacturer elects to average together NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
of light-duty trucks subject to different standards based on GVWR and 
loaded vehicle weight, its composite NO<INF>X</INF> standard applies to 
the combined fleets of light-duty trucks of all weight categories 
included in the average, and is calculated as defined in Sec. 86.088-2.
    (B) A manufacturer may elect to include any diesel light-duty truck 
engine families subject to the Tier 0 standards in the appropriate 
particulate averaging program (petroleum or methanol), provided that it 
does not elect to pay an NCP for noncompliance with any emission 
standard applicable to that light-duty truck family. Trucks produced for 
sale in California or in designated high-altitude areas may be averaged 
only within each of those areas, and light-duty trucks greater than 
3,750 lbs loaded vehicle weight may be averaged only with other light-
duty trucks greater than 3,750 lbs loaded vehicle weight. Averaging is 
not permitted between fuel types. If the manufacturer elects to average 
both light-duty trucks 3,750 lbs loaded vehicle weight or less and 
light-duty vehicles together in the appropriate particulate averaging 
program, its composite particulate standard applies to the combined set 
of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks included in the average and 
is calculated as defined in Sec. 86.088-2.
    (2) The standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section refer to the exhaust emitted over a driving schedule as 
set forth in subpart B of this part and measured and calculated in 
accordance with those procedures. The test weight basis for light light-
duty trucks, and for heavy light-duty trucks certified to the Tier 0 
standards of this section, for the purposes of determining equivalent 
test weight as prescribed in Sec. 86.129-94, shall be loaded vehicle 
weight. The test weight basis for heavy light-duty trucks certified to 
the Tier 1 standards of this section, for the purposes of determining 
equivalent test weight as prescribed in Sec. 86.129-94, shall be 
adjusted loaded vehicle weight. The standard set forth in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section refers to the exhaust emitted at curb idle 
and measured and calculated in accordance with the procedures set forth 
in subpart P of this part.
    (b) Fuel evaporative emissions from 1994 and later model year light-
duty trucks shall not exceed:
    (1) Hydrocarbons (for gasoline-fueled light-duty trucks). 2.0 grams 
per test.
    (2) Total Hydrocarbon Equivalent (for methanol-fueled light-duty 
trucks). 2.0 grams per test.
    (3) The standards set forth in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this 
section refer to a composite sample of the fuel evaporative emissions 
collected under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part and 
measured in accordance with those procedures.
    (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient 
atmosphere from any 1994 and later model year light-duty truck. This 
requirement is optional for 1994 through 1996 model year gaseous-fueled 
light-duty trucks.
    (d) The CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, and particulate standards set forth in 
paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A), (d)(1)(iii), and (d)(1)(iv) of this section, 
respectively, are applicable only to model year 1994 light-duty trucks 
certified to the Tier 0 standards of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section. The HC, THCE, and idle CO standards set forth in 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A), (d)(1)(i)(B) and (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, 
respectively, are applicable only to model year 1994 light-duty trucks.
    (1) Model year 1994 light-duty trucks sold for principal use at a 
designated high-altitude location shall be capable of meeting the 
following exhaust emission standards when tested under high-altitude 
conditions:

[[Page 238]]

    (i)(A) Hydrocarbons (for Otto-cycle and diesel light-duty trucks 
when fueled with petroleum fuel and/or liquefied petroleum gas). 1.0 
grams per vehicle mile (0.62 grams per vehicle kilometer).
    (B) Total Hydrocarbon Equivalent (for methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and 
diesel light-duty trucks). 1.0 gram per vehicle mile (0.62 gram per 
vehicle kilometer).
    (C) Nonmethane hydrocarbons (for Otto-cycle and diesel light-duty 
trucks when fueled with natural gas). 0.83 gram per vehicle mile (0.52 
gram per vehicle kilometer).
    (ii) Carbon Monoxide. (A) 14 grams per vehicle mile (8.7 grams per 
vehicle kilometer).
    (B) 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle (for Otto-cycle 
and methanol-fueled diesel light-duty trucks only).
    (iii) Oxides of Nitrogen. (A) For light-duty trucks up to and 
including 3,750 lbs. loaded vehicle weight, 1.2 grams per vehicle mile 
(0.75 grams per vehicle kilometer).
    (B) For light-duty trucks 3,751 lbs. and greater loaded vehicle 
weight, 1.7 grams per vehicle mile (1.1 grams per vehicle kilometer).
    (iv) Particulate (for diesel light-duty trucks only). (A) For light-
duty trucks up to and including 3,750 lbs. loaded vehicle weight, 0.26 
gram per vehicle mile (0.16 gram per vehicle kilometer).
    (B) For light-duty trucks 3,751 lbs. and greater loaded vehicle 
weight, 0.13 gram per vehicle mile (0.08 gram per vehicle kilometer).
    (2) The standards set forth in paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii)(A), 
(d)(1)(iii), and (d)(1)(iv) of this section refer to the exhaust emitted 
over a driving schedule as set forth in subpart B of this part and 
measured and calculated in accordance with those procedures. The 
standard set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section refers to 
the exhaust emitted at curb idle and measured and calculated in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart P of this part.
    (e) Fuel evaporative emissions from 1994 model year light-duty 
trucks sold for principal use at a designated high-altitude location, 
when tested under high-altitude conditions, shall not exceed:
    (1) Hydrocarbons (for gasoline-fueled light-duty trucks). 2.6 grams 
per test.
    (2) Total Hydrocarbon Equivalent (for methanol-fueled light-duty 
trucks). 2.6 grams per test.
    (3) The standards set forth in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this 
section refer to a composite sample of the fuel evaporative emissions 
collected under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part and 
measured in accordance with those procedures.
    (f) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient 
atmosphere from any 1994 model year light-duty trucks sold for principal 
use at a designated high-altitude location.
    (g)(1) Any model year 1994 light-duty truck that a manufacturer 
wishes to certify for sale at low altitude must be capable of meeting 
high-altitude emission standards (specified in paragraphs (d) through 
(f) of this section). The manufacturer may specify vehicle adjustments 
or modifications to allow the vehicle to meet high-altitude standards 
but these adjustments or modifications may not alter the vehicle's basic 
engine, inertia weight class, transmission configuration, and axle 
ratio.
    (i) A manufacturer may certify unique configurations to meet the 
high-altitude standards but is not required to certify these vehicle 
configurations to meet the low-altitude standards.
    (ii) Any adjustments or modifications that are recommended to be 
performed on vehicles to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section:
    (A) Shall be capable of being effectively performed by commercial 
repair facilities, and
    (B) Must be included in the manufacturer's application for 
certification.
    (2) Any model year 1995 and later light-duty truck and optionally 
model year 1994 light-duty truck that a manufacturer wishes to certify 
for sale shall meet the emission standards of paragraphs (a) through (c) 
of this section under both low- and high-altitude conditions as 
specified in Sec. 86.082-2, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) 
of this section. Vehicles shall meet emission standards under both low- 
and high-altitude conditions without manual adjustments or 
modifications. Any emission control device used to meet emission 
standards under high-altitude

[[Page 239]]

conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher than 4,000 
feet above sea level.
    (h) The manufacturer may exempt 1994 and later model year light-duty 
trucks from compliance at high altitude with the emission standards set 
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and may exempt 1994 
model year light-duty trucks from compliance with the high-altitude 
emission standards set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
if the vehicles are not intended for sale at high altitude and if the 
requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section are met.
    (1) A vehicle configuration shall only be considered eligible for 
exemption under paragraph (h) of this section if the requirements of any 
of paragraphs (h)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section are met.
    (i) Its design parameters (displacement-to-weight ratio (D/W) and 
engine speed-to-vehicle-speed ratio (N/V)) fall within the exempted 
range for that manufacturer for that year. The exempted range is 
determined according to the following procedure:
    (A) The manufacturer shall graphically display the D/W and N/V data 
of all vehicle configurations it will offer for the model year in 
question. The axis of the abscissa shall be D/W (where (D) is the engine 
displacement expressed in cubic centimeters and (W) is the gross vehicle 
weight (GVW) expressed in pounds), and the axis of the ordinate shall be 
N/V (where (N) is the crankshaft speed expressed in revolutions per 
minute and (V) is the vehicle speed expressed in miles per hour). At the 
manufacturer's option, either the 1:1 transmission gear ratio or the 
lowest numerical gear ratio available in the transmission will be used 
to determine N/V. The gear selection must be the same for all N/V data 
points on the manufacturer's graph. For each transmission/axle ratio 
combination, only the lowest N/V value shall be used in the graphical 
display.
    (B) The product line is then defined by the equation, N/V = C(D/
W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP> where the constant, C, is determined by the 
requirement that all the vehicle data points either fall on the line or 
lie to the upper right of the line as displayed on the graphs.
    (C) The exemption line is then defined by the equation, N/V = C(0.84 
D/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP> where the constant, C, is the same as that found in 
paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (D) The exempted range includes all values of N/V and D/W which 
simultaneously fall to the lower left of the exemption line as drawn on 
the graph.
    (ii) Its design parameters fall within the alternate exempted range 
for that manufacturer that year. The alternate exempted range is 
determined by substituting rated horsepower (hp) for displacement (D) in 
the exemption procedure described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section 
and by using the product line N/V = C(hp/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>.
    (A) Rated horsepower shall be determined by using the Society of 
Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J 1349 (copies may be obtained from 
SAE, 400 Commonwealth Dr., Warrendale, PA 15096), or any subsequent 
version of that test procedure. Any of the horsepower determinants 
within that test procedure may be used, as long as it is used 
consistently throughout the manufacturer's product line in any model 
year.
    (B) No exemptions will be allowed under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this 
section to any manufacturer that has exempted vehicle configurations as 
set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Its acceleration time (the time it takes a vehicle to 
accelerate from 0 to a speed not less than 40 miles per hour and not 
greater than 50 miles per hour) under high-altitude conditions is 
greater than the largest acceleration time under low-altitude conditions 
for that manufacturer for that year. The procedure to be followed in 
making this determination is:
    (A) The manufacturer shall list the vehicle configuration and 
acceleration time under low-altitude conditions of that vehicle 
configuration which has the highest acceleration time under low-altitude 
conditions of all the vehicle configurations it will offer for the model 
year in question. The manufacturer shall also submit a description of 
the methodology used to make this determination.

[[Page 240]]

    (B) The manufacturer shall then list the vehicle configurations and 
acceleration times under high-altitude conditions of all those vehicle 
configurations which have higher acceleration times under high-altitude 
conditions than the highest acceleration time at low altitude identified 
in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (iv) In lieu of performing the test procedure of paragraph 
(h)(1)(iii) of this section, its acceleration time can be estimated 
based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation, in accordance with 
good engineering practice, to meet the exemption criteria of paragraph 
(h)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) A vehicle shall only be considered eligible for exemption under 
this paragraph if at least one configuration of its model type (and 
transmission configuration in the case of vehicles equipped with manual 
transmissions, excluding differences due to the presence of overdrive) 
is certified to meet emission standards under high-altitude conditions 
as specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section. The 
Certificate of Conformity (the Certificate) covering any exempted 
configuration(s) will also apply to the corresponding non-exempt 
configuration(s) required under this subparagraph. As a condition to the 
exemption, any suspension, revocation, voiding, or withdrawal of the 
Certificate as it applies to a non-exempt configuration for any reason 
will result in a suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
corresponding exempted configuration(s) of that model type, unless there 
is at least one other corresponding non-exempt configuration of the same 
model type still covered by the Certificate. The suspension of the 
Certificate as it applies to the exempted configuration(s) will be 
terminated when any one of the following occurs:
    (i) Another corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) receive(s) 
coverage under the Certificate; or
    (ii) Suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) is terminated; or
    (iii) The Agency's action(s), with respect to suspension, 
revocation, voiding or withdrawal of the Certificate as it applies to 
the corresponding non-exempt configuration(s), is reversed.
    (3) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at a designated high-
altitude location that has been exempted as set forth in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section will be considered a violation of section 
203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act.

light-duty vehicles, light light-duty trucks, and heavy light-duty 
trucks of the applicable model year sold in the state of California or 
in jurisdictions which have adopted the California emission standards 
under section 177 of the Clean Air Act if those light-duty vehicles, 
light light-duty trucks, and heavy light-duty trucks have been certified 
to meet the federally mandated cold CO standards. If this option is 
taken, all light-duty vehicles, light light-duty trucks and heavy light-
duty trucks sold in California and such jurisdictions shall be counted 
toward the total upon which the sales percentage is based. If this 
option is not taken, light-duty vehicles, light light-duty trucks, and 
heavy light-duty trucks sold in California or such jurisdictions are to 
be excluded from counting toward either the total upon which the sales 
percentage is based or the sales percentage itself.
    (iv) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b) (1) 
and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedules of table A94-16 
for model years 1994 and 1995. This exemption does not apply to small 
volume engine families as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b)(5).
    (v) The manufacturer must state at the time of applying for the 
Certificate, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which engine families will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages.

Sec. 86.094-13  Light-duty exhaust durability programs.

    (a)(1) This section describes the various durability programs 
available to manufacturers for determining exhaust deterioration factors 
(DFs) for the certification of 1994 and beyond model year light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks. While this section describes many of the 
important elements of these durability programs, it is not intended as 
an exhaustive list of all requirements applicable either to these 
programs or to the certification process.
    (2) The durability programs consist of various elements, such as a 
statement of applicability, a service accumulation method, vehicle/
component selection methods, durability data vehicle compliance 
requirements, in-use verification requirements, optional elements, data 
reporting requirements, and additional requirements. Cross references to 
other sections in this subpart are indicated where appropriate.
    (b) The following table summarizes the durability programs available 
to all manufacturers of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The 
Tier 1 and Tier 0 standards cited in the table are those specified in 
Sec. 86.094-8 (for light-duty vehicles) and Sec. 86.094-9 (for light-
duty trucks). The durability programs described in this section are 
separate and distinct alternatives, such that determination of an 
exhaust deterioration factor under one program does not require 
compliance with the requirements of a different durability program.

    (B) Are equal to or greater than the deterioration factors that EPA 
determines under paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) EPA shall determine minimum deterioration factors for engine 
families subject to the Production AMA Durability Program. This 
determination shall be based on a procedure of grouping engine families 
(see Sec. 86.094-24(a)) in order to use historical certification data to 
determine deterioration factors for each engine family group. The 
historical data shall be updated yearly through the testing of 
production durability data vehicles. Test vehicle requirements under 
these procedures are contained in Sec. 86.094-24 (h) and compliance 
requirements are contained in Sec. 86.094-28(a)(7).

in the Production AMA Durability Program must submit to the 
Administrator, for each model year, a written request describing the 
engine families that the manufacturer elects to be included in the 
program.
    (B) The Administrator may declare ineligible any engine family for 
which the Administrator determines there is unreasonable risk in 
determining a deterioration factor using the methods of the Production 
AMA Durability Program. Furthermore, the Administrator may limit the 
number of engine families within the manufacturer's product line that 
are eligible for the Production AMA Durability Program.
    (C) Upon approval of the manufacturer's request to participate, the 
Administrator and the manufacturer may enter into a written agreement 
prescribing the terms and conditions of the program. This agreement 
shall be equitable as compared to agreements entered into with other 
manufacturers. The agreement shall specify:
    (1) The engine families to be included in the program and the engine 
family groups that have been established by the provisions of

year most recently certified under the production AMA Durability Program 
is projected to exceed an emission standard by applying deterioration 
factors generated by a production durability data vehicle within the 
same engine family; or
    (2) Any of the most recent model year's production durability data 
vehicle configurations tested under paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(B) of this 
section line crosses as defined in Sec. 86.094-28(a)(7)(ii)(C). For the 
purpose of this paragraph, data from identical vehicles will be averaged 
as under Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4)(i) (A) and (B)
    (D) If the Administrator notifies a manufacturer of such a 
nonconformity, the manufacturer shall submit, by a date specified by the 
Administrator, a plan to remedy the nonconformity which is acceptable to 
the Director, Office of Mobile Sources. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, the term ``remedy the nonconformity'' will have the same 
meaning as it does when it appears in section 207(c)(1) of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7541(c)(1)).
    (E) The manufacturer shall comply with the terms of the remedial 
plan approved by the Director, Office of Mobile Sources.
    (F) If a manufacturer does not comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(8)(iv) (B), (D), or (E) of this section, the Administrator 
may deem the certificate of conformity for the affected engine families 
void ab initio.
    (e) Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Program--(1) 
Applicability. The Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Program 
is applicable to light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks in model 
years 1994 and beyond.
    (2) Service accumulation method. (i) The manufacturer shall propose 
a service accumulation method for the Alternative Service Accumulation 
Durability Program, for advance approval by the Administrator. The 
method shall be consistent with good engineering practice and be 
designed to accurately predict the deterioration of the vehicle's 
emissions in actual use over its full useful life.
    (ii) Manufacturers may propose service accumulation methods based 
upon whole-vehicle mileage accumulation, bench aging of individual 
components or systems, or a combination of the two approaches. Bench 
procedures should simulate the aging of components or systems over the 
applicable durability useful life as defined in Sec. 86.094-2 and should 
simulate cycles and environments found in actual use. For this purpose, 
manufacturers may remove the emission-related components, in whole or in 
part, from the durability vehicle itself and deteriorate them 
independently. Vehicle testing for the purpose of determining 
deterioration factors may include the testing of durability vehicles 
that incorporate such bench-aged components.
    (iii) Service accumulation shall be according to the method approved 
in advance by the Administrator.
    (3) Vehicle/component selection method. The manufacturer shall 
propose a vehicle/component selection method for the Alternative Service 
Accumulation Durability Program for advance approval by the 
Administrator. The vehicle/component selection shall be according to the 
method approved in advance by the

[[Page 247]]

Administrator. The selection of durability data vehicles and components 
is also governed by Sec. 86.091-7(a)(2)(i)(A), which generally requires 
that vehicles and components used for certification must be 
representative of production vehicles and components.
    (4) Durability data vehicle compliance requirements. The 
manufacturer shall propose procedures for the calculation of 
deterioration factors and for the determination of vehicle compliance 
for advance approval by the Administrator. The Administrator may approve 
the use of such procedures if the manufacturer demonstrates that the 
resulting deterioration factors are likely to be representative of the 
in-use performance of the vehicles. The calculation of deterioration 
factors and the determination of vehicle compliance shall be according 
to the procedures approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (5) In-use verification. Manufacturers selecting the Alternative 
Service Accumulation Durability Program shall agree to perform an in-use 
verification program, which shall include testing on in-use vehicles 
certified under the program in the years subsequent to certification. 
The purpose of the in-use verification program is to confirm the 
adequacy of the manufacturer-designed components of the Alternative 
Service Accumulation Durability program. The manufacturer shall propose 
sample sizes, recruitment procedures, testing procedures, optional 
provisions for the cessation of testing in the event the in-use testing 
confirms the adequacy of elements of the Alternative Service 
Accumulation Durability Program, and remedies in the event the in-use 
testing fails to confirm the adequacy of elements of the Alternative 
Service Accumulation Durability program. These and other elements of in-
use verification are subject to advance approval by the Administrator.
    (6) Optional element: Carryover and carryacross. Manufacturers 
selecting the Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Program may 
petition the Administrator for the conditional use of carryover or 
carryacross mileage accumulation data according to the provisions of 
Sec. 86.094-24(f). If use of carryover or carryacross data is approved, 
deterioration factors are determined by the method described in 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (7) Data reporting requirements. (i) Data reporting requirements for 
the Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Program are contained in 
Secs. 86.094-21, 86.094-23(b)(1)(i), and 86.094-26(a)(6)(ii) and (a)(7).
    (ii) In addition to the reporting of deterioration factors 
determined under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the manufacturer 
shall provide reliability data that shows to the Administrator's 
satisfaction that all emission-related components are designed to 
operate properly for the durability useful life of the vehicles in 
actual use (or such shorter intervals as permitted in section 
Sec. 86.094-25).
    (8) Additional requirements. (i) The manufacturer shall consolidate 
the approved versions for each of the required elements of the 
Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Program into a written 
agreement that documents the details of the program and the 
manufacturer's responsibilities. The manufacturer shall submit this 
agreement for approval by the Administrator as part of the application 
for certification.
    (ii) The manufacturer may amend the written agreement entered into 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section so long as the 
manufacturer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that 
the proposed amendments to the agreement improve upon the in-use 
verification portion of the existing agreement. Such amendment to the 
Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Program agreement is subject 
to the prior approval of the Administrator.
    (iii) The certification requirements described in Sec. 86.094-
30(a)(14) are applicable.
    (f) Standard Self-Approval Durability Program--(1) Applicability. 
The Standard Self-Approval Durability Program is applicable to light-
duty trucks in the 1994 and beyond model years.
    (2) Service accumulation method. The manufacturer shall determine 
the form and extent of service accumulation used in the Standard Self-
Approval Durability Program, according to the provisions of Sec. 86.094-
26(b)(2). The method

[[Page 248]]

shall be consistent with good engineering practice and be designed to 
evaluate the mechanisms that are expected to cause deterioration of the 
vehicle's emissions over its full useful life.
    (3) Vehicle/component selection method. The manufacturer shall 
determine the vehicle/component selection method for use in the Standard 
Self-Approval Durability Program according to the provisions of 
Sec. 86.094-24(c)(2). Manufacturers shall select the vehicles, engines, 
subsystems, or components for each engine-system so that their emissions 
deterioration characteristics may be expected to represent those of in-
use vehicles, based on good engineering judgment. The selection of 
durability data vehicles or components is also governed by Sec. 86.091-
7(a)(2)(A), which generally requires that vehicles and components used 
for certification must be representative of production vehicles and 
components.
    (4) Durability data vehicle compliance requirements. Durability data 
vehicle compliance requirements for the Standard Self-approval 
Durability Program are contained in Sec. 86.094-28(b). These include the 
method of calculating deterioration factors and related requirements.
    (5) In-use verification. The Standard Self-Approval Durability 
Program includes no requirement for manufacturer testing of in-use 
vehicles subsequent to certification.
    (6) Data reporting requirements. Data reporting requirements for the 
Standard Self-Approval Durability Program are contained in Secs. 86.094-
21, 86.094-23(b)(1)(ii), and 86.094-26(d).
    (7) Additional requirement. The Administrator does not approve the 
test procedures for establishing exhaust emission deterioration factors.

Sec. 86.094-14  Small-volume manufacturers certification procedures.

    (a)(1) The small-volume manufacturers certification procedures 
described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are optional. Small-
volume manufacturers may use these optional procedures to demonstrate 
compliance with the general standards and specific emission requirements 
contained in this subpart.
    (2) To satisfy the durability data requirements of the small-volume 
manufacturers certification procedures, manufacturers of vehicles (or 
engines) as described in paragraph (b) of this section may use assigned 
deterioration factors that the Administrator determines by methods 
described in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of this section. However, if no 
deterioration factor data (either the manufacturer's or industry-wide 
deterioration factor data) are available from previously completed 
durability data vehicles or engines used for certification, 
manufacturers of vehicles (or engines) as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section or with new technology not previously certified may use 
assigned deterioration

factors that the Administrator determines by alternative methods, based 
on good engineering judgement. The factors that the Administrator 
determines by alternative methods will be published in an advisory 
letter or advisory circular.
    (b)(1) The optional small-volume manufacturers certification 
procedures apply to light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty 
vehicles, and heavy-duty engines produced by manufacturers with U.S. 
sales, including all vehicles and engines imported under the provisions 
of Secs. 85.1505 and 85.1509 of this chapter (for the model year in 
which certification is sought) of fewer than 10,000 units (Light-Duty 
Vehicles, Light-Duty Trucks, Heavy-Duty Vehicles and Heavy-Duty Engines 
combined).
    (2) For the purpose of determining the applicability of paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, the sales the Administrator shall use shall be 
the aggregate of the projected or actual sales of those vehicles and/or 
engines in any of these groupings:
    (i) Vehicles and/or engines produced by two or more firms, one of 
which is 10 percent or greater part owned by another;
    (ii) Vehicles and/or engines produced by any two or more firms if a 
third party has equity ownership of 10 percent or more in each of the 
firms;
    (iii) Vehicles and/or engines produced by two or more firms having a 
common corporate officer(s) who is (are) responsible for the overall 
direction of the companies;
    (iv) Vehicles and/or engines imported or distributed by all firms 
where the vehicles and/or engines are manufactured by the same entity 
and the importer or distributor is an authorized agent of the entity.
    (3) If the aggregated sales, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section are less than 301 units, the manufacturers in the 
aggregated relationship may certify under the provisions in this section 
that apply to manufacturers with sales of less than 301 units.
    (4) If the aggregated sales, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section are greater than 300 but fewer than 10,000 units, the 
manufacturers in the aggregated relationship may certify under the 
provisions in this section that apply to manufacturers with sales from 
and including 301 through 9,999 motor vehicles and motor vehicles 
engines per year.
    (5) If the aggregated sales, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section are equal to or greater than 10,000 units, then the 
manufacturers involved in the aggregated relationship will be allowed to 
certify a number of units under the small-volume engine family 
certification procedures (reference Sec. 86.094-24(e)) in accordance 
with the criteria identified in paragraphs (b)(5) (i) through (iii) of 
this section.
    (i) If a manufacturer purchases less than 50 percent of another 
manufacturer, each manufacturer retains its right to certify 9,999 units 
using the small-volume engine family certification procedures.
    (ii) If a manufacturer purchases 50 percent or more of another 
manufacturer, the manufacturer with the over 50 percent interest must 
share, with the manufacturer it purchased, its 9,999 units under the 
small-volume engine family certification procedures.
    (iii) In a joint venture arrangement (50/50 ownership) between two 
manufacturers, each manufacturer retains its eligibility for 9,999 units 
under the small-volume engine family certification procedures, but the 
joint venture must draw its maximum 9,999 units from the units allocated 
to its parent manufacturers.
    (c) Small-volume manufacturers shall demonstrate compliance with the 
applicable sections of this subpart. The appropriate model year of the 
applicable sections detailed in paragraphs (c) (1) through (15) of this 
section shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 86.084-4.
    (1) Sections 86.094-1, 86.094-2, 86.094-3, 86.084-4, 86.090-5, 
86.078-6, 86.094-7, 86.094-8, 86.094-9, and 86.094-11 are applicable.

the information that EPA requires in Sec. 86.094-21. This information 
will be considered part of the manufacturer's application for 
certification. However,

[[Page 250]]

the manufacturer is not required to submit the information to the 
Administrator unless the Administrator requests it.
    (5) Section 86.094-22 is applicable except as noted in paragraph 
(c)(5)(i) of this section.
    (i) Small-volume light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck 
manufacturers may satisfy the requirements of Sec. 86.094-22(e) by 
including a statement of compliance on adjustable parameters in the 
application for certification. In the statement of compliance the 
manufacturer shall state that the limits, stops, seals, or other means 
used to inhibit adjustment have been designed to accomplish their 
intended purpose based on good engineering practice and past experience. 
If the vehicle parameter is adjustable the vehicle must meet emission 
standards with the parameter set any place within the adjustable range 
(reference Sec. 86.094-21).
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (6) Section 86.094-23 is applicable.
    (7) Section 86.094-24 is applicable except as noted in paragraphs 
(c)(7) (i) through (ii) of this section.
    (i) Small-volume manufacturers may satisfy the requirements of 
Sec. 86.094-24 (b) and (c) in accordance with paragraphs (c)(7)(i) (A) 
through (C) of this section.
    (A) Emission data. Selecting one emission data test vehicle (engine) 
per engine family by the worst-case emissions criteria in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) (1), (2), or (3) of this section.
    (1) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The manufacturer 
shall select the vehicle with the heaviest equivalent test weight 
(including options) within the engine family. Then within that vehicle 
the manufacturer shall select, in the order listed, the highest road 
load power, largest displacement, the transmission with the highest 
numerical final gear ratio (including overdrive), the highest numerical 
axle ratio offered in the engine family, and the maximum fuel flow 
calibration.
    (2) Heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines. The manufacturer shall select one 
emission data engine first based on the largest displacement within the 
engine family. Then within the largest displacement the manufacturer 
shall select, in the order listed, highest fuel flow at the speed of 
maximum rated torque, the engine with the most advanced spark timing, no 
EGR or lowest EGR flow, and no air pump or lowest actual flow air pump.
    (3) Heavy-duty diesel engines. The manufacturer shall select one 
emission data engine based on the highest fuel feed per stroke, 
primarily at the speed of maximum rated torque and secondarily at rated 
speed.
    (B) Testing light-duty vehicles or light-duty truck emission data 
vehicles at any service accumulation distance of at least 2,000 miles 
(3,219 kilometers) or, catalyst equipped heavy-duty emission data 
engines at any service accumulation time of at least 62 hours, or non-
catalyst equipped heavy-duty engine emission data engines at any service 
accumulation time determined by the manufacturer to result in stabilized 
emissions. The emission performance of the emission data vehicle or 
engine must be stabilized prior to emission testing.
    (C) Durability data. Satisfying the durability data requirements by 
complying with the applicable procedures described in paragraphs 
(c)(7)(i)(C) (1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) Manufacturers with aggregated sales of less than 301 motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year may use assigned 
deterioration factors that the Administrator determines and prescribes. 
The factors will be the Administrator's estimate, periodically updated 
and published in an advisory letter or advisory circular, of the 70th 
percentile deterioration factors calculated using the industry-wide data 
base of previously completed durability data vehicles or engines used 
for certification. However, the manufacturer may, at its option, 
accumulate miles (hours) on a durability data vehicle (engine) and 
complete emission tests for the purpose of establishing its own 
deterioration factors.
    (2)(i) Manufacturers with aggregated sales from and including 301 
through 9,999 motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year 
certifying light-duty vehicle exhaust emissions from vehicles equipped 
with proven emission

[[Page 251]]

control systems shall use assigned deterioration factors that the 
manufacturer determines based on its good engineering judgment. However, 
the manufacturer may not use deterioration factors less than either the 
average or 70th percentile of all of that manufacturer's deterioration 
factor data, whichever is less. These minimum deterioration factors 
shall be calculated according to procedures in paragraph 
(c)(7)(i)(C)(2)(ii), of this section. If the manufacturer does not have 
at least two data points to calculate these manufacturer specific 
average deterioration factors, then the deterioration factors shall be 
no less than the EPA supplied industry-wide deterioration factors. 
However, the manufacturer may, at its option, accumulate miles on a 
durability data vehicle and complete emission tests for the purpose of 
establishing its own deterioration factors.
    (ii) The manufacturer's minimum deterioration factors shall be 
calculated using the deterioration factors from all engine families, 
within the same vehicle/engine-fuel usage category (e.g., gasoline-
fueled light-duty vehicle, etc.) previously certified to the same 
emission standards. The manufacturer shall use only deterioration 
factors from engine families previously certified by the manufacturer 
and the deterioration factors shall not be included in the calculation 
more than once. The deterioration factors for each pollutant shall be 
calculated separately. The manufacturer may, at its option, limit the 
deterioration factors used in the calculation of the manufacturer's 
minimum deterioration factors to those from all similar systems to the 
system being certified if sufficient data (i.e., from at least two 
certified systems) exists. All data eligible to be grouped as similar 
system data shall be used in calculating similar system deterioration 
factors. Any deterioration factors used in calculating similar system 
deterioration factors shall not be included in calculating the 
manufacturer's minimum deterioration factors used to certify any of the 
manufacturer's remaining vehicle systems.
    (3) Manufacturers with aggregated sales from 301 through 9,999 motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle engines and certifying light-duty vehicle 
exhaust emissions from vehicles equipped with unproven emission control 
systems shall use deterioration factors that the manufacturer determines 
from official certification durability data generated by vehicles from 
engine families representing a minimum of 25 percent of the 
manufacturer's sales equipped with unproven emission control systems. 
The sales projections are to be based on total sales projected for each 
engine/system combination. The durability programs applicable to such 
manufacturers for this purpose shall be the Standard AMA, the Production 
AMA and the Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Programs of 
Sec. 86.094-13. The durability data vehicle (engine) mileage 
accumulation and emission tests are to be conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 86.094-13. The manufacturer must develop deterioration factors by 
generating durability data in accordance with Sec. 86.094-13 on a 
minimum of 25 percent of the manufacturer's projected sales (by engine/
system combination) that is equipped with unproven emission control 
systems. The manufacturer must complete the 25 percent durability 
requirement before the remainder of the manufacturer's sales equipped 
with unproven emission control systems is certified using manufacturer-
determined assigned deterioration factors. Alternatively, any of these 
manufacturers may, at their option, accumulate miles on durability data 
vehicles and complete emission tests for the purpose of establishing 
their own deterioration factors on the remaining sales.
    (4) For light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, and heavy-duty vehicle 
evaporative emissions and for light-duty truck, and heavy-duty engine 
exhaust emissions, deterioration factors shall be determined in 
accordance with Sec. 86.094-24.
    (ii) Section 86.094-24(d) and (e) are not applicable.
    (8) Section 86.094-25 is applicable to maintenance performed on 
durability data light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty 
vehicles, and heavy-duty engines when the manufacturer completes 
durability data vehicles or engines; Sec. 86.087-38 is applicable to the 
recommended maintenance the

    (iii) If the manufacturer meets the requirements of this subpart, 
the Administrator will issue a certificate of conformity for the 
vehicles or engines described in the application for certification.
    (iv) The certificate will be issued for such a period not to exceed 
one model year as the Administrator may determine and upon such terms as 
he may deem necessary to assure that any vehicle or engine covered by 
the certificate will meet the requirements of the Act and of this 
subpart.
    (v)(A) If, after a review of the statements and descriptions 
submitted by the manufacturer, the Administrator determines that the 
manufacturer has not met the applicable requirements, the Administrator 
shall notify the manufacturer in writing of his intention to deny 
certification, setting forth the basis for his determination. The 
manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determination.
    (B) If the manufacturer does not request a hearing or present the 
required information, the Administrator will deny certification.
    (12) Sections 86.079-31 and 86.079-32 are not applicable.
    (13) Under Sec. 86.079-33, small-volume manufacturers are covered by 
paragraphs (c)(13) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Small-volume manufacturers may make production changes (running 
changes) without receiving the Administrator's prior approval. The 
manufacturer shall assure (by conducting emission tests as it deems 
necessary) that the affected vehicles (engines) remain in compliance 
with the requirements of this part.
    (ii) The manufacturer shall notify the Administrator within seven 
days after implementing any production related change (running change) 
that would affect vehicle emissions. This notification shall include any 
changes to the information required under paragraph (c)(11)(ii) of this 
section. The manufacturer shall also amend as necessary its records 
required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to confirm with the 
production design change.
    (14) Section 86.082-34 is not applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 86.094-15  NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines.

    (a)(1) Heavy-duty engines eligible for NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate averaging, trading and banking programs are described in the 
applicable emission standards sections in this subpart. All heavy-duty 
engine families which include any engines labeled for use in clean-fuel 
vehicles as specified in 40 CFR part 88 are not eligible for these 
programs. Participation in these programs is voluntary.
    (2)(i) Engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable standard 
shall obtain emission credits in a mass amount sufficient to address the 
shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, trading, or banking, 
within the averaging set restrictions described in this section.
    (ii) Engine families with FELs below the applicable standard will 
have emission credits available to average, trade, bank or a combination 
thereof. Credits may not be used for averaging or trading to offset 
emissions that exceed an FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy an in-
use nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by 
recall testing. However, credits may be used to allow subsequent 
production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer 
elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (iii) Credits scheduled to expire in the earliest model year shall 
be used, prior to using other available credits, to offset emissions of 
engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable standard.
    (b) Participation in the NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate 
averaging, trading, and banking programs shall be done as follows.
    (1) During certification, the manufacturer shall:
    (i) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the 
averaging, trading and/or banking programs. Separate declarations are 
required for each program and for each pollutant (i.e., NO<INF>X</INF> 
and particulate).
    (ii) Declare an FEL for each engine family participating in one or 
more of these three programs.
    (A) The FEL must be to the same level of significant digits as the 
emission standard (one-tenth of a gram per brake horsepower for 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions and one-hundredth of a gram per brake 
horsepower-hour for particulate emissions).
    (B) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in the 
section concerning the applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate emission standards.
    (iii) Calculate the projected emission credits (+/-) based on 
quarterly production projections for each participating family and for 
each pollutant (NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate), using the applicable 
equation in paragraph (c) of this section and the applicable factors for 
the specific engine family.
    (iv)(A) Determine and state the source of the needed credits 
according to quarterly projected production for engine families 
requiring credits for certification.
    (B) State where the quarterly projected credits will be applied for 
engine families generating credits.
    (C) Credits may be obtained from or applied to only engine families 
within the same averaging set as described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section. Credits available for averaging, trading, or banking as 
defined in Sec. 86.090-2, may be applied exclusively to a given engine 
family, or reserved as defined in Sec. 86.091-2.
    (2) Based on this information each manufacturer's certification 
application must demonstrate:
    (i) That at the end of model year production, each engine family has 
a net emissions credit balance of zero or more using the methodology in 
paragraph (c) of this section with any credits obtained from averaging, 
trading or banking.
    (ii) The source of the credits to be used to comply with the 
emission standard if the FEL exceeds the standard, or where credits will 
be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where 
credits are

[[Page 255]]

being obtained, each engine family involved must state specifically the 
source (manufacturer/engine family) of the credits being used. In cases 
where credits are being generated/supplied, each engine family involved 
must state specifically the designated use (manufacturer/engine family 
or reserved) of the credits involved. All such reports shall include all 
credits involved in averaging, trading or banking.
    (3) During the model year manufacturers must:
    (i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that 
compliance with the emission standards is achieved at the end of the 
model year.
    (ii) Provide the end-of-model year reports required under 
Sec. 86.091-23.
    (iii) For manufacturers participating in emission credit trading, 
maintain the quarterly records required under Sec. 86.091-7(c)(8).
    (4) Projected credits based on information supplied in the 
certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of 
conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of 
end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any other compliance 
measures deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
    (5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be 
determined at the end of the model year. Engine families without an 
adequate amount of NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate emission credits 
will violate the conditions of the certificate of conformity. The 
certificates of conformity may be voided ab initio for engine families 
exceeding the emission standard.
    (6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error 
occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this 
section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be 
recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous 
negative balances may be adjusted by EPA for retroactive use.
    (i) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates a 
credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to purchase the 
necessary credits to bring the credit balance for that engine family to 
zero, at the ratio of 1.2 credits purchased for every credit needed to 
bring the balance to zero. If sufficient credits are not available to 
bring the credit balance for the engine family in question to zero, EPA 
may void the certificate for that engine family ab initio.
    (ii) If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year 
report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's 
favor (i.e. resulting in a positive credit balance) or if the 
manufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of 
the end-of-year report, the credits will be restored for use by the 
manufacturer.
    (c)(1) For each participating engine family, NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate emission credits (positive or negative) are to be calculated 
according to one of the following equations and rounded, in accordance 
with ASTM E29-67, to the nearest one-tenth of a Megagram (Mg). 
Consistent units are to be used throughout the equation.

    For determining credit need for all engine families and credit 
availability for engine families generating credits for averaging 
programs only:

Emission credits = (Std FEL)  x  (CF)  x  (UL)  x  (Production)  x  
(10<SUP>-6</SUP>)

For determining credit availability for engine families generating 
credits for trading or banking programs:

Emission credits = (Std FEL)  x  (CF)  x  (UL)  x  (Production)  x  
(10<SUP>-6</SUP>)  x  (0.8)

Where:

Std = the current and applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> or 
particulate emission standard in grams per brake horsepower hour or 
grams per Megajoule.
FEL = the NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate family emission limit for the 
engine family in grams per brake horsepower-hour or grams per Megajoule.
CF = a transient cycle conversion factor in BHP-hr/mi or MJ/mi, as given 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
UL = the useful life, or alternative life as described in paragraph (f) 
of Sec. 86.090-21, for the given engine family in miles.
Production = the number of engines produced for U.S. sales within the 
given engine family during the model year. Quarterly production 
projections are used for initial certification. Actual production is 
used for end-of-year compliance determination.
0.8 = a one-time discount applied to all credits to be banked or traded 
within the model year generated. Banked credits traded in a subsequent 
model year will not be

[[Page 256]]

subject to an additional discount. Banked credits used in a subsequent 
model year's averaging program will not have the discount restored.

    (2) The transient cycle conversion factor is the total (integrated) 
cycle brake horsepower- hour or Megajoules, divided by the equivalent 
mileage of the applicable transient cycle. For Otto-cycle-heavy duty 
engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3 miles. For diesel heavy-duty 
engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.5 miles. When more than one 
configuration is chosen by EPA to be tested in the certification of an 
engine family (as described in Sec. 86.085-24), the conversion factor 
used is to be based upon the configuration generating the highest 
conversion factor when determining credit need for a family and the 
lowest conversion factor when determining credit availability from a 
family for banking, trading and averaging.
    (d) Averaging sets for NO<INF>x</INF> emission credits: The 
averaging and trading of NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits will only be 
allowed between heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set and 
in the same regional category. Engines produced for sale in California 
constitute a separate regional category than engines produced for sale 
in the other 49 states. Banking and trading are not applicable to 
engines sold in California. The averaging sets for the averaging and 
trading of NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits for heavy-duty engines are 
defined as follows:
    (1) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines:
    (i) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines constitute an averaging set. 
Averaging and trading among all Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families is 
allowed. There are no subclass restrictions.
    (ii) Gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles certified under the 
provisions of Sec. 86.085-1 (b) may not average or trade credits with 
gasoline fueled heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines, but may average or trade 
credits with light-duty trucks.
    (2) For diesel cycle heavy-duty engines:
    (i) Each of the three primary intended service classes for heavy-
duty diesel engines, as defined in Sec. 86.090-2, constitute an 
averaging set. Averaging and trading among all diesel-cycle engine 
families within the same primary service class is allowed.
    (ii) Urban buses are treated as members of the primary intended 
service class where they otherwise would fall.
    (e) Averaging sets for particulate emission credits. The averaging 
and trading of particulate emission credits will only be allowed between 
diesel cycle heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set and in 
the same regional category. Engines produced for sale in California 
constitute a separate regional category than engines produced for sale 
in the other 49 states. Banking and trading are not applicable to 
engines sold in California. The averaging sets for the averaging and 
trading of particulate emission credits for diesel cycle heavy-duty 
engines are defined as follows:
    (1) Engines intended for use in urban buses constitute a separate 
averaging set from all other heavy-duty engines. Averaging and trading 
between diesel cycle bus engine families is allowed.
    (2) For heavy-duty engines, exclusive of urban bus engines, each of 
the three primary intended service classes for heavy-duty diesel cycle 
engines, as defined in Sec. 86.090-2, constitute an averaging set. 
Averaging and trading between diesel-cycle engine families within the 
same primary service class is allowed.
    (3) Otto cycle engines may not participate in particulate averaging, 
trading, or banking.
    (f) Banking of NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate emission credits:
    (1) Credit deposits. (i) NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate emission 
credits may be banked from engine families produced in any model year.
    (ii) Manufacturers may bank credits only after the end of the model 
year and after actual credits have been reported to EPA in the end-of-
year report. During the model year and before submittal of the end-of-
year report, credits originally designated in the certification process 
for banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for 
trading or averaging.
    (2) Credit withdrawals. (i) After being generated, banked credits 
shall be available for use within three model years following the model 
year in which they were generated. Credits not

[[Page 257]]

used within the period specified above shall be forfeited.
    (ii) Manufacturers withdrawing banked emission credits shall 
indicate so during certification and in their credit reports, as 
described in Sec. 86.091-23.
    (3) Use of banked emission credits. The use of banked credits shall 
be within the averaging set and other restrictions described in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and only for the following 
purposes:
    (i) Banked credits may be used in averaging, or in trading, or in 
any combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits 
declared for banking from the previous model year but not reported to 
EPA may also be used. However, if EPA finds that the reported credits 
can not be proven, they will be revoked and unavailable for use.
    (ii) Banked credits may not be used for NO<INF>X</INF> or 
particulate averaging and trading to offset emissions that exceed an 
FEL. Banked credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity 
determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing. 
However, banked credits may be used for subsequent production of the 
engine family if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (g)(1) The following paragraphs assume NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate nonconformance penalties (NCPs) will be available for the 
1991 and later model year HDEs.
    (2) Engine families using NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate NCPs but 
not involved in averaging:
    (i) May not generate either NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate credits 
for banking and trading.
    (ii) May not use either NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate credits from 
banking and trading.
    (3) If a manufacturer has any engine family to which application of 
NCPs and banking and trading credits is desired, that family must be 
separated into two distinct families. One family, whose FEL equals the 
standard, must use NCPs only while the other, whose FEL does not equal 
the standard, must use credits only.
    (4) If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given averaging set 
which is using NO<INF>X</INF> and/or particulate NCPs, none of that 
manufacturer's engine families in that averaging set may generate 
credits for banking and trading.
    (h) In the event of a negative credit balance in a trading 
situation, both the buyer and the seller would be liable.
    (i) Certification fuel used for credit generation must be of a type 
that is both available in use and expected to be used by the engine 
purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the Administrator, the engine 
manufacturer must provide information acceptable to the Administrator 
that the designated fuel is readily available commercially and would be 
used in customer service.

Sec. 86.094-16  Prohibition of defeat devices.

    (a) No new gasoline-fueled light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck 
shall be equipped with a defeat device.
    (b) The Administrator may test or require testing on any vehicle at 
a designated location, using driving cycles and conditions which may 
reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use, 
for the purposes of investigating a potential defeat device.
    (c) For cold temperature CO emission control, the Administrator will 
use a guideline to determine the appropriateness of the CO emission 
control at ambient temperatures between 25  deg.F (-4  deg.C) and 68 
deg.F (20  deg.C). The guideline for CO emission congruity across the 
intermediate temperature range is the linear interpolation between the 
CO standard applicable at 25  deg.F (-4  deg.C) and the CO standard 
applicable at 68  deg.F (20  deg.C). For vehicles that exceed this CO 
emissions guideline upon intermediate temperature cold testing:
    (1) If the CO emission level is greater than the 20  deg.F (-7 
deg.C) emission standard, the vehicle will automatically be considered 
to be equipped with a defeat device without further investigation.
    (2) If the CO emission level does not exceed the 20  deg.F emission 
standard, the Administrator may investigate the vehicle design for the 
presence of a defeat device under paragraph (d) of this section.

[[Page 258]]

    (d) For vehicle designs designated by the Administrator to be 
investigated for possible defeat devices:
    (1) The manufacturer must show to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that the vehicle design does not incorporate strategies 
that unnecessarily reduce emission control effectiveness exhibited 
during the Federal emissions test procedure when the vehicle is operated 
under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in 
normal operation and use.
    (2) Information Submissions Required:
    (i) The manufacturer will provide an explanation containing detailed 
information (including information which the Administrator may request 
to be submitted) regarding test programs, engineering evaluations, 
design specifications, calibrations, on-board computer algorithms, and 
design strategies incorporated for operation both during and outside of 
the Federal emission test procedure.
    (ii) For purposes of investigations of possible cold temperature CO 
defeat devices under this paragraph (d), the manufacturer shall provide 
an explanation which must show, to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator, that CO emissions are reasonably controlled in reference 
to the linear guideline, across the intermediate temperature range.

Sec. 86.094-17  Emission control diagnostic system for 1994 and later light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.

    (a) All light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks shall be equipped 
with an emission control diagnostic system capable of identifying, for 
each vehicle's useful life, the following types of deterioration or 
malfunction which could cause emission increases greater than or 
exceeding the following threshold levels as measured and calculated in 
accordance with test procedures set forth in subpart B of this part. 
Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section do not apply to diesel 
cycle light-duty vehicles or light-duty trucks. Paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (a)(4) of this section do not apply to natural gas-fueled light-
duty vehicles and light-duty trucks until the 1998 model year.
    (1) Catalyst deterioration before it results in both an exhaust 
emission exceedance of 0.6 g/mi HC and an exhaust emission increase of 
0.4 g/mi HC.
    (2) Engine misfire before it results in an exhaust emission increase 
of greater than 0.4 g/mi HC, 3.4 g/mi CO, or 1.0 g/mi NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (3) Oxygen sensor deterioration before it results in an exhaust 
emission increase of greater than 0.2 g/mi HC, 1.7 g/mi CO, or 0.5 g/mi 
NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (4) Any other deterioration or malfunction within the powertrain 
which occurs in actual use and which results in an exhaust emission 
increase of greater than 0.2 g/mi HC, 1.7 g/mi CO, or 0.5 g/mi 
NO<INF>X</INF>, or any vapor leak which results in an evaporative 
emissions increase of greater than 30.0 g/test measured over the first 
24 hours of the diurnal portion of the revised evaporative emissions 
test procedure, in accordance with test procedures set forth in subpart 
B of this part, for vehicles certified to that test procedure.
    (b)(1) The electronic evaporative emission purge control, if 
equipped, and all emission-related powertrain components connected to a 
computer shall, at a minimum, be monitored for circuit continuity. In 
lieu of monitoring circuit continuity, a functional system check may be 
performed provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that the functional 
check is equivalent or superior to the circuit continuity monitor. All 
components required by these regulations to be monitored shall be 
evaluated periodically, but no less frequently than once per Urban 
Dynamometer Driving Schedule as defined in appendix I, paragraph (a), of 
this part, or similar trip.
    (2) For non-diesel cycle light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, 
the emission control diagnostic system shall at a minimum, monitor 
catalytic converters and oxygen sensors and shall detect misfiring 
cylinders.
    (3) Oxygen sensor deterioration or malfunction which renders that 
sensor incapable of performing its function as part of the OBD system 
shall be identified on vehicles so equipped.
    (c) The emission control diagnostic system shall incorporate a 
malfunction

[[Page 259]]

indicator light (MIL) readily visible to the vehicle operator. When 
illuminated, it shall display ``Check Engine,'' ``Service Engine Soon,'' 
or a similar phrase approved by the Administrator. A vehicle shall not 
be equipped with more than one general purpose malfunction indicator 
light for emission-related problems; separate specific purpose warning 
lights (e.g. brake system, fasten seat belt, oil pressure, etc.) are 
permitted. The use of red for the OBD-related malfunction indicator 
light is prohibited.
    (d) The MIL shall illuminate and remain illuminated when any of the 
conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met, 
or whenever the engine control enters a default or secondary mode of 
operation. The MIL shall blink under any period of operation during 
which engine misfire is occurring at a level likely to cause catalyst 
damage as determined by the manufacturer. The MIL shall also illuminate 
when the vehicle's ignition is in the ``key-on'' position before engine 
starting or cranking and extinguish after engine starting if no 
malfunction has previously been detected. If a fuel system or engine 
misfire malfunction has previously been detected, the MIL may be 
extinguished if the malfunction does not reoccur during three subsequent 
sequential trips during which engine speed is within 375 rpm, engine 
load is within 10 percent, and the engine's warm-up status is the same 
as that under which the malfunction was first detected, and no new 
malfunctions have been detected. If any malfunction other than a fuel 
system or engine misfire malfunction has been detected, the MIL may be 
extinguished if the malfunction does not reoccur during three subsequent 
sequential trips during which the monitoring system responsible for 
illuminating the MIL functions without detecting the malfunction, and no 
new malfunctions have been detected.
    (e)(1) The emission control diagnostic system shall record code(s) 
indicating the status of the emission control system. Absent the 
presence of any fault codes, separate status codes shall be used to 
identify correctly functioning emission control systems and those 
emission control systems which need further vehicle operation to be 
fully evaluated. Fault codes shall be stored for deterioration or 
malfunction causing MIL illumination; the fault code shall identify the 
type of malfunction.
    (2) For a single misfiring cylinder, the fault code(s) shall 
identify the cylinder, unless the manufacturer submits data and/or an 
engineering evaluation which adequately demonstrate that the misfiring 
cylinder cannot be reliably identified under certain operating 
conditions; multiple misfiring cylinders need not be uniquely identified 
if a distinct multiple misfire fault code is stored.
    (3) A fault code shall be stored when the emission control system 
reverts to a default or secondary mode of operation.
    (4) The diagnostic system may erase a fault code if the same fault 
is not re-registered in at least 40 engine warm-up cycles, and the 
malfunction indicator light (see paragraph (d) of this section) is not 
illuminated for that fault code.
    (f) Available Diagnostic Signals. (1) Upon determination of the 
first malfunction of any component or system, ``freeze frame'' engine 
conditions present at the time shall be stored in computer memory. 
Should a subsequent fuel system or misfire malfunction occur, any 
previously stored freeze frame conditions shall be replaced by the fuel 
system or misfire conditions (whichever occurs first). Stored engine 
conditions shall include, but are not limited to: Engine speed, open or 
closed loop operation, fuel system commands, coolant temperature, 
calculated load value, fuel pressure, vehicle speed, air flow rate, and 
intake manifold pressure if the information needed to determine these 
conditions is available to the computer. For freeze frame storage, the 
manufacturer shall include the most appropriate set of conditions to 
facilitate effective repairs. If the fault code causing the conditions 
to be stored is erased in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, 
the stored engine conditions may also be erased.
    (2) The following signals in addition to the required freeze frame 
information shall be made available on demand

[[Page 260]]

through the serial port on the standardized data link connector, if the 
information is available to the on-board computer or can be determined 
using information available to the on-board computer: Diagnostic trouble 
codes, engine coolant temperature, fuel control system status (closed 
loop, open loop, other), fuel trim, ignition timing advance, intake air 
temperature, manifold air pressure, air flow rate, engine RPM, throttle 
position sensor output value, secondary air status (upstream, 
downstream, or atmosphere), calculated load value, vehicle speed, and 
fuel pressure. The signals shall be provided in standard units based on 
SAE specifications incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this 
section. Actual signals shall be clearly identified separately from 
default value or limp home signals. In addition, the capability to 
perform bi-directional diagnostic control based on SAE specifications 
shall be made available on demand through the serial port on the 
standardized data link connector per SAE specifications as referenced in 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (3) For all emission control components and systems for which 
specific on-board evaluation tests are conducted (catalyst, oxygen 
sensor, etc.), the results of the most recent test performed by the 
vehicle, and the limits to which the system is compared shall be 
available through the data link per SAE J1979 specifications as 
referenced in paragraph (h) of this section beginning no later than the 
1997 model year. The Administrator may allow a pass/fail indication for 
the most recent test results for those monitored components and systems 
for which such an indication is more appropriate (e.g., misfire 
detection, fuel system monitoring, etc.).
    (4) The OBD requirements to which the vehicle is certified (i.e., 
California OBD II or Federal OBD), and the major emission control 
systems monitored by the OBD system consistent with paragraph (h)(3) of 
this section, shall be available through the serial data port on the 
standardized data link connector per SAE specifications as referenced in 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g) The emission control diagnostic system is not required to 
evaluate components during malfunction conditions if such evaluation 
would result in a risk to safety or component failure.
    (h) The emission control diagnostic system shall provide for 
standardized access and conform with the following Society of Automotive 
Engineers (SAE) standards. The following SAE documents are incorporated 
by reference. This incorporation by reference was approved by the 
Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 
1 CFR part 51. Copies of the SAE documents may be obtained from the 
Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., 400 Commonwealth Drive, 
Warrendale, PA 15096-0001. Copies may be inspected at Docket No. A-90-35 
at EPA's Air docket (LE-131), room 1500 M, 1st Floor, Waterside Mall, 
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, or at the Office of the Federal 
Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.
    (1) SAE J1850 ``Class B Data Communication Network Interface,'' 
(AUG91) shall be used as the on-board to off-board communications 
protocol. All emission related messages sent to the scan tool over a 
J1850 data link shall use the Cyclic Redundancy Check and the three byte 
header, and shall not use inter-byte separation or checksums.
    (2) Basic diagnostic data (as specified in Sec. 86.094-17(f)) shall 
be provided in the format and units in SAE J1979 ``E/E Diagnostic Test 
Modes,'' (DEC91). Basic bi-directional diagnostic capability shall be 
available and be consistent with SAE J1979 messages.
    (3) Fault codes shall be consistent with SAE J2012 ``Recommended 
Format and Messages for Diagnostic Trouble Code Definitions,'' (MAR92)

    (i) Upon application by the manufacturer, the Administrator may 
either waive the requirements of this section for specific components of 
any class or category of light-duty vehicles or light-duty trucks for 
model years 1994 or 1995 (or both), or through the 1999 model year, the 
Administrator may accept an OBD system as compliant even though specific 
requirements are not fully met. Such waivers or compliances without 
meeting specific requirements will be granted only if compliance would 
be infeasible or unreasonable considering such factors as, but not 
limited to, technical feasibility, lead time and production cycles 
including phase-in or phase-out of engines or vehicle designs and 
programmed upgrades of computers, and if any unmet requirements are not 
carried over from the previous model year except where unreasonable 
hardware modifications would be necessary to correct the non-compliance, 
and the manufacturer has demonstrated an acceptable level of effort 
toward compliance as determined by the Administrator. For alternate 
fueled vehicles (i.e. natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, or 
methanol), beginning with the model year for which alternate fuel 
emission standards are applicable and extending through the 1999 model 
year, manufacturers may request the Administrator to waive specific 
monitoring requirements of this section for which monitoring may not be 
reliable with respect to the use of the alternate fuel. At a minimum, 
all vehicles covered by this section, including those receiving a waiver 
as described in this paragraph, shall be equipped with an OBD system 
meeting either the California OBD I requirements, or some acceptable 
portion of the California OBD II or federal OBD requirements as 
specified in this section, except that for the 1994 and 1995 model years 
EPA may grant a waiver to a system less than OBD I giving consideration 
to such factors as manufacturer projections of very low sales volume for 
an engine family (e.g., 5000 or less), scheduled phase-out of 
significant engine technology with the 1994 or 1995 model years for that 
engine family, and whether or not the engine, or any similar engine 
within the manufacturer's product line, has ever been equipped with an 
OBD I or similar OBD system.
    (j) Demonstration of compliance with California OBD II requirements 
(Title 13 California Code section 1968.1)as modified pursuant to 
California Mail Out 95-34 (September 26, 1995), shall satisfy the 
requirements of this section through the 1998 model year except that 
compliance with Title 13 California Code section 1968.1(d), pertaining 
to tampering protection, is not required to satisfy the requirements of 
this section.

Sec. 86.094-21  Application for certification.

    (a) A separate application for a certificate of conformity shall be 
made for each set of standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate) and each class of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle 
engines. Such application shall be made to the Administrator by the 
manufacturer and shall be updated and corrected by amendment.
    (b) The application shall be in writing, signed by an authorized 
representative of the manufacturer, and shall include the following:
    (1)(i) Identification and description of the vehicles (or engines) 
covered by the application and a description of their engine (vehicles 
only), emission control system, and fuel system components. This 
description will include:
    (A) A detailed description of each Auxiliary Emission Control Device 
(AECD) to be installed in or on any vehicle (or engine) covered by the 
application;
    (B) A detailed justification of each AECD (described in (b)(1)(i)(A) 
of this section) which results in a reduction in effectiveness of the 
emission control system. Such a justification may be disapproved by 
consideration of currently available technology, whereupon the 
application for certification may be disapproved under Sec. 86.094-22(b) 
for the incorporation of a defeat device;

[[Page 262]]

    (C) The manufacturer must submit a Statement of Compliance in the 
application for certification which attests to the fact that they have 
assured themselves that the engine family is designed to be within the 
intermediate temperature cold testing defeat device guidance as 
described in Sec. 86.094-16.
    (1) This Statement of Compliance will be supported by a brief 
description of the vehicle's technological method of controlling CO 
emissions at intermediate temperatures.
    (2) The manufacturer will determine a method (e.g., a test program, 
an engineering evaluation) which is adequate to support their Statement 
of Compliance. The manufacturer will support this Statement with a brief 
summary of the chosen method. Further details must be made available 
upon the Administrator's request.
    (ii)(A) The manufacturer shall provide to the Administrator in the 
application for certification:
    (1) A list of those parameters which are physically capable of being 
adjusted (including those adjustable parameters for which access is 
difficult) and that, if adjusted to settings other than the 
manufacturer's recommended setting, may affect emissions;
    (2) A specification of the manufacturer's intended physically 
adjustable range of each such parameter, and the production tolerances 
of the limits or stops used to establish the physically adjustable 
range;
    (3) A description of the limits or stops used to establish the 
manufacturer's intended physically adjustable range of each adjustable 
parameter, or any other means used to inhibit adjustment;
    (4) The nominal or recommended setting, and the associated 
production tolerances, for each such parameter.
    (B) The manufacturer may provide, in the application for 
certification, information relating to why certain parameters are not 
expected to be adjusted in actual use and to why the physical limits or 
stops used to establish the physically adjustable range of each 
parameter, or any other means used to inhibit adjustment, are effective 
in preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use vehicles to settings 
outside the manufacturer's intended physically adjustable ranges. This 
may include results of any tests to determine the difficulty of gaining 
access to an adjustment or exceeding a limit as intended or recommended 
by the manufacturer.
    (C) The Administrator may require to be provided detailed drawings 
and descriptions of the various emission related components, and/or 
hardware samples of such components, for the purpose of making his 
determination of which vehicle or engine parameter will be subject to 
adjustment for new certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing 
and of the physically adjustable range for each such vehicle or engine 
parameter.
    (2) Projected U.S. sales data sufficient to enable the Administrator 
to select a test fleet representative of the vehicles (or engines) for 
which certification is requested, and, for model year 1994 through 1995 
light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks and model year 1996 
heavy light-duty trucks, data sufficient to determine projected 
compliance with the Tier 1 standards implementation schedules of 
Secs. 86.094-8 and 86.094-9. The data shall also include the altitude of 
intended sale for model year 1994 light-duty trucks certified to the 
Tier 0 standards of Sec. 86.094-9. Volume projected to be produced for 
U.S. sale may be used in lieu of projected U.S. sales.
    (3) A description of the test equipment and fuel proposed to be 
used.
    (4)(i) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, a description 
of the test procedures to be used to establish the evaporative emission 
deterioration factors required to be determined and supplied in 
Sec. 86.094-23(b)(2).
    (ii) For heavy-duty vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or 
methanol-fueled engines, the Administrator does not assume that each 
evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combination will deteriorate in a unique manner during the useful life 
of the vehicle. The manufacturer shall therefore identify those 
evaporative emission deterioration factors which shall be applied to the 
various evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combinations which are expected to exhibit

[[Page 263]]

similar deterioration characteristics during the useful life of the 
vehicle.
    (5)(i)(A) A description of the test procedures to be used to 
establish the durability data or the exhaust emission deterioration 
factors required to be determined and supplied in Sec. 86.094-23(b)(1).
    (B) For each light-duty truck engine family provided an optional 
useful life period under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this 
section, and for each heavy-duty engine family, a statement of the 
useful life.
    (C) For engine families provided an alternative useful-life period 
under paragraph (f) of this section, a statement of that alternative 
period and a brief synopsis of the justification.
    (ii) For heavy-duty diesel engine families, a statement of the 
primary intended service class (light, medium, or heavy) and an 
explanation as to why that service class was selected. Each diesel 
engine family shall be certified under one primary intended service 
class only. After reviewing the guidance in Sec. 86.090-2, the class 
shall be determined on the basis of which class best represents the 
majority of the sales of that engine family.
    (iii)(A) For each light-duty vehicle engine family, each light-duty 
truck engine family, and each heavy-duty engine family, a statement of 
recommended maintenance and procedures necessary to assure that the 
vehicles (or engines) covered by a certificate of conformity in 
operation conform to the regulations, and a description of the program 
for training of personnel for such maintenance, and the equipment 
required.
    (B) A description of vehicle adjustments or modifications necessary, 
if any, to assure that light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks covered 
by a certificate of conformity conform to the regulations while being 
operated at any altitude locations, and a statement of the altitude at 
which the adjustments or modifications apply.
    (iv) At the option of the manufacturer, the proposed composition of 
the emission data test fleet or (where applicable) the durability data 
test fleet.
    (6) Participation in averaging programs--(i) Particulate averaging. 
(A) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the particulate 
averaging program for diesel light-duty vehicles and/or diesel light-
duty trucks or the particulate averaging program for heavy-duty diesel 
engines, the application must list the family particulate emission limit 
and the projected U.S. production volume of the family for the model 
year.
    (B) The manufacturer shall choose the level of the family 
particulate emission limits, accurate to hundredth of a gram per mile or 
hundredth of a gram per brake horsepowerhour for heavy-duty engines.
    (C) The manufacturer may at any time during production elect to 
change the level of any family particulate emission limit(s) by 
submitting the new limit(s) to the Administrator and by demonstrating 
compliance with the limit(s) as described in Secs. 86.090-2 and 86.094-
28(b)(5)(i).
    (ii) NO<INF>x</INF> averaging. (A) If the manufacturer elects to 
participate in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program for light-duty 
trucks or the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program for heavy-duty engines, 
the application must list the family NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit and 
the projected U.S. production volume of the family for the model year.
    (B) The manufacturer shall choose the level of the family 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limits, accurate to one-tenth of a gram per mile 
or to one-tenth of a gram per brake horsepower-hour for heavy-duty 
engines.
    (C) The manufacturer may at any time during production elect to 
change the level of any family NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit(s) by 
submitting the new limits to the Administrator and by demonstrating 
compliance with the limit(s) as described in Secs. 86.088-2 and 86.094-
28(b)(5)(ii).
    (7)(i) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, the application must state 
whether the engine family is being certified for use in all vehicles 
regardless of their Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (see Sec. 86.091-10 
(a)(1)(i) and (a)(3)(i)), or only for use in vehicles with a Gross 
Vehicle Weight Rating greater than 14,000 pounds.
    (ii) If the engine family is being certified for use in all vehicles 
and is being certified to the emission standards applicable to Otto-
cycle engines

[[Page 264]]

for use only in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating over 14,000 
pounds under the provisions of Sec. 86.091-10(a)(3), then the 
application must also attest that the engine family, together with all 
other engine families being certified under the provisions of 
Sec. 86.091-10(a)(3), represent no more than 5 percent of model year 
sales of the manufacturer of all Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines for use 
in vehicles with Gross Vehicle Weight Ratings of up to 14,000 pounds.
    (8) For each light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck engine family, 
the exhaust emission standards (or family emission limits, if 
applicable) to which the engine family is to be certified, and the 
corresponding exhaust emission standards (or family emission limits, if 
applicable) which the engine family must meet in-use.
    (c) Complete copies of the application and of any amendments 
thereto, and all notifications under Secs. 86.079-32, 86.079-33, and 
86.082-34 shall be submitted in such multiple copies as the 
Administrator may require.
    (d) Incomplete light-duty trucks shall have a maximum completed curb 
weight and maximum completed frontal area specified by the manufacturer.
    (e) For vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled 
heavy-duty engines, the manufacturer shall specify a maximum nominal 
fuel tank capacity for each evaporative emission family-evaporative 
emission control system combination.
    (f) Light-duty truck and heavy-duty engine manufacturers who believe 
that the useful life periods of Sec. 86.094-2 are significantly 
unrepresentative for one or more engine families (either too long or too 
short), may petition the Administrator to provide an alternative useful-
life period. This petition must include the full rationale behind the 
request together with any supporting data and other evidence. Based on 
this or other information the Administrator may assign an alternative 
useful-life period. Any petition should be submitted in a timely manner, 
to allow adequate time for a thorough evaluation. For model year 1994 
and later light-duty trucks not subject to the Tier 0 standards of 
Sec. 86.094-9, alternative useful life periods will be granted only for 
THC, THCE, and idle CO requirements.
    (g) The manufacturer shall identify those families which will not 
comply with cold temperature carbon monoxide standards.
    (h) For each engine family incorporating an emission control 
diagnostic system, the manufacturer shall submit the following 
information:
    (1) Detailed written information fully describing the functional 
operation characteristics of the diagnostic system.
    (2) The general method of detecting malfunctions for each emission-
related powertrain component.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) For methanol-fueled vehicles, the manufacturer shall specify:
    (1) Whether the vehicle is a flexible fuel vehicle or a dedicated 
vehicle (manufacturers must obtain advance approval from the 
Administrator to classify methanol-fueled vehicles that can use gasoline 
as dedicated vehicles); and
    (2) The fuel(s) (i.e., the percent methanol) for which the vehicle 
was designed.

<R05>
Sec. 86.094-22  Approval of application for certification; test fleet 
selections; determinations of parameters subject to adjustment for 

certification and Selective Enforcement Audit, adequacy of limits, and 
          physically adjustable ranges.

    (a) After a review of the application for certification and any 
other information which the Administrator may require, the Administrator 
may approve the application and select a test fleet in accordance with 
Sec. 86.094-24.
    (b) Disapproval of application. (1) The Administrator may disapprove 
in whole or in part an application for certification for reasons 
including incompleteness, inaccuracy, inappropriate proposed mileage (or 
service) accumulation procedures, test equipment, or fuel; or 
incorporation of defeat devices in vehicles (or on engines) described by 
the application.
    (2) The issuance of a certificate of conformity does not exempt the 
covered vehicles from further evaluation

[[Page 265]]

or testing for defeat device purposes as described in Sec. 86.094-16.
    (c) Where any part of an application is rejected, the Administrator 
shall notify the manufacturer in writing and set forth the reasons for 
such rejection. Within 30 days following receipt of such notification, 
the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
determination. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized 
representative of the manufacturer and shall include a statement 
specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's 
determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after the 
review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that 
the request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the 
manufacturer a hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to 
such issue.
    (d) Approval of test procedures. (1) The Administrator does not 
approve the test procedures for establishing the evaporative emission 
deterioration factors for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The 
manufacturer shall submit the procedures as required in Sec. 86.094-
21(b)(4)(i) prior to the Administrator's selection of the test fleet 
under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1), and if such procedures will involve testing 
of durability data vehicles selected by the Administrator or elected by 
the manufacturer under Sec. 86.094-24(c)(1), prior to initiation of such 
testing.
    (2) Light-duty trucks using the Standard Self-Approval durability 
Program and heavy-duty engines only. The Administrator does not approve 
the test procedures for establishing exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for light-duty trucks using the Standard Self-Approval 
Durability Program described in Sec. 86.094-13(f) nor for heavy-duty 
engines. The manufacturer shall submit these procedures and 
determinations as required in Sec. 86.094-21(b)(5)(i) prior to 
determining the deterioration factors.
    (3) Heavy-duty vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-
fueled engines only. The Administrator does not approve the test 
procedures for establishing the evaporative emission deterioration 
factors. The test procedure will conform to the requirements in 
Sec. 86.094-23(b)(3).
    (e) Parameter adjustment requirements. When the Administrator 
selects emission data vehicles for the test fleet, he will at the same 
time determine those vehicle or engine parameters which will be subject 
to adjustment for certification, Selective Enforcement Audit and 
Production Compliance Audit testing, the adequacy of the limits, stops, 
seals, or other means used to inhibit adjustment, and the resulting 
physically adjustable ranges for each such parameter and will then 
notify the manufacturer of his determinations.
    (1) Determining parameters subject to adjustment. (i) Except as 
noted in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, the Administrator may 
determine to be subject to adjustment the idle fuel-air mixture 
parameter on Otto-cycle vehicles (or engines) (carbureted or fuel-
injected); the choke valve action parameter(s) on carbureted, Otto-cycle 
vehicles (or engines); or any parameter on any vehicle (or engine) 
(Otto-cycle or diesel) which is physically capable of being adjusted, 
may significantly affect emissions, and was not present on the 
manufacturer's vehicles (or engines) in the previous model year in the 
same form and function.
    (ii) The Administrator may, in addition, determine to be subject to 
adjustment any other parameters on any vehicle or engine which is 
physically capable of being adjusted and which may significantly affect 
emissions. However, the Administrator may do so only if he has 
previously notified the manufacturer that he might do so and has found, 
at the time he gave this notice, that the intervening period would be 
adequate to permit the development and application of the requisite 
technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance 
within such period. In no event will this notification be given later 
than September 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the model year.
    (iii) In determining the parameters subject to adjustment, the 
Administrator will consider the likelihood that, for each of the 
parameters listed in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, 
settings other than the manufacturer's recommended setting will occur on 
in-use vehicles (or engines). In

[[Page 266]]

determining likelihood, the Administrator may consider such factors as, 
but not limited to, information contained in the preliminary 
application, surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles (or 
engines), the difficulty and cost of gaining access to an adjustment, 
damage to the vehicle (or engine) if an attempt is made to gain such 
access and the need to replace parts following such attempt, and the 
effect of settings other than the manufacturer's recommended setting on 
vehicle (or engine) performance characteristics including emission 
characteristics.
    (iv) Manual chokes of heavy-duty engines only will not be considered 
a parameter subject to adjustment under the parameter adjustment 
requirements.
    (2)(i) The Administrator shall determine a parameter to be 
adequately inaccessible or sealed if:
    (A) In the case of an idle mixture screw, the screw is recessed 
within the carburetor casting and sealed with lead, thermosetting 
plastic, or an inverted elliptical spacer or sheared off after 
adjustment at the factory, and the inaccessibility is such that the 
screw cannot be accessed and/or adjusted with simple tools in one-half 
hour or for $20 (1978 dollars) or less;
    (B) In the case of a choke bimetal spring, the plate covering the 
bimetal spring is riveted or welded in place, or held in place with 
nonreversible screws;
    (C) In the case of a parameter which may be adjusted by elongating 
or bending adjustable members (e.g., the choke vacuum break), the 
elongation of the adjustable member is limited by design or, in the case 
of a bendable member, the member is constructed of a material which when 
bent would return to its original shape after the force is removed 
(plastic or spring steel materials);
    (D) In the case of any parameter, the manufacturer demonstrates that 
adjusting the parameter to settings other than the manufacturer's 
recommended setting takes more than one-half hour or costs more than $20 
(1978 dollars).
    (ii) The Administrator shall determine a physical limit or stop to 
be an adequate restraint on adjustability if:
    (A) In the case of a threaded adjustment, the threads are 
terminated, pinned, or crimped so as to prevent additional travel 
without breakage or need for repairs which take more than one-half hour 
or cost more than $20 (1978 dollars);
    (B) The adjustment is ineffective at the end of the limits of travel 
regardless of additional forces or torques applied to the adjustment;
    (C) The manufacturer demonstrates that travel or rotation limits 
cannot be exceeded with the use of simple and inexpensive tools 
(screwdriver, pliers, open-end or box wrenches, etc.) without incurring 
significant and costly damage to the vehicle (or engine) or control 
system or without taking more than one-half hour or costing more than 
$20 (1978 dollars).
    (iii) If manufacturer service manuals or bulletins describe routine 
procedures for gaining access to a parameter or for removing or 
exceeding a physical limit, stop, seal or other means used to inhibit 
adjustment, or if surveillance data indicate that gaining access, 
removing, or exceeding is likely, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section shall not apply for that parameter.
    (iv) In determining the adequacy of a physical limit, stop, seal, or 
other means used to inhibit adjustment of a parameter not covered by 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the Administrator will 
consider the likelihood that it will be circumvented, removed, or 
exceeded on in-use vehicles. In determining likelihood, the 
Administrator may consider such factors as, but not limited to, 
information contained in the preliminary application; surveillance 
information from similar in-use vehicles (or engines); the difficulty 
and cost of circumventing, removing, or exceeding the limit, stop, seal, 
or other means; damage to the vehicle (or engine) if an attempt is made 
to circumvent, remove, or exceed it and the need to replace parts 
following such attempt; and the effect of settings beyond the limit, 
stop, seal, or other means on vehicle (or engine) performance 
characteristics other than emission characteristics.
    (3) The Administrator shall determine two physically adjustable 
ranges

[[Page 267]]

for each parameter subject to adjustment:
    (i)(A) In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately 
inaccessible or sealed, the Administrator may include within the 
physically adjustable range applicable to testing under this subpart 
(certification testing) all settings within the production tolerance 
associated with the nominal setting for that parameter, as specified by 
the manufacturer in the preliminary application for certification; or
    (B) In the case of other parameters, the Administrator shall include 
within this range all settings within physical limits or stops 
determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability. The Administrator 
may also include the production tolerances on the location of these 
limits or stops when determining the physically adjustable range.
    (ii)(A) In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately 
inaccessible or sealed, the Administrator shall include within the 
physically adjustable range applicable to testing under subparts G or K 
(Selective Enforcement Audit and Production Compliance Audit) only the 
actual settings to which the parameter is adjusted during production; or
    (B) In the case of other parameters, the Administrator shall include 
within this range all settings within physical limits or stops 
determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability, as they are 
actually located on the test vehicle (or engine).
    (f) Submittal of advance information. (1) If the manufacturer 
submits the information specified in Sec. 86.094-21(b)(1)(ii) in advance 
of its full preliminary application for certification, the Administrator 
shall review the information and make the determinations required in 
paragraph (e) of this section within 90 days of the manufacturer's 
submittal.
    (2) The 90-day decision period is exclusive of the elapsed time 
during which EPA may request additional information from manufacturers 
regarding an adjustable parameter and the receipt of the manufacturers' 
response(s).
    (g) Within 30 days following receipt of notification of the 
Administrator's determinations made under paragraph (e) of this section, 
the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
determinations. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized 
representative of the manufacturer, and shall include a statement 
specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's 
determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after review 
of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the 
request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the 
manufacturer a hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to 
such issue.

[48 FR 4010, Jan. 12, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 86.094-23  Required data.

    (a) The manufacturer shall perform the tests required by the 
applicable test procedures and submit to the Administrator the 
information described in paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section, 
provided, however, that if requested by the manufacturer, the 
Administrator may waive any requirement of this section for testing of 
vehicle (or engine) for which emission data are available or will be 
made available under the provisions of Sec. 86.091-29.
    (b) Durability data. (1)(i) The manufacturer shall submit exhaust 
emission durability data on such light-duty vehicles tested in 
accordance with applicable test procedures and in such numbers as 
specified, which will show the performance of the systems installed on 
or incorporated in the vehicle for extended mileage, as well as a record 
of all pertinent maintenance performed on the test vehicles.
    (ii) The manufacturer shall submit exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines and all test data

Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., 
Washington, DC 20460.
    (ii) These reports shall indicate the model year, engine family, and 
the actual U.S. sales volume. The manufacturer may petition the 
Administrator to allow volume produced for U.S.. sale to be used in lieu 
of U.S. sales. Such petition shall be submitted within 30 days of the 
end of the model year to the Manufacturers Operations Division. For the 
petition to be granted, the manufacturer must establish to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that production volume is functionally 
equivalent to sales volume.
    (iii) The U.S. sales volume for end-of-year reports shall be based 
on the location of the point of sale to a dealer, distributor, fleet 
operator, broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first 
sale.
    (iv) Failure by a manufacturer to submit the end-of-year report 
within the specified time may result in certificate(s) for the engine 
family(ies) certified to Tier 0 certification standards being voided ab 
initio plus any applicable civil penalties for failure to submit the 
required information to the Agency.
    (v) The information shall be organized in such a way as to allow the

Sec. 86.094-24  Test vehicles and engines.

    (a) General. Paragraph (a) of this section applies to the grouping 
of vehicles or engines into families.
    (1) The vehicles or engines covered by an application for 
certification will be divided into groupings of engines which are 
expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their 
useful life. Each group of engines with similar emission characteristics 
shall be defined as a separate engine family.
    (2) To be classed in the same engine family, engines must be 
identical in all the respects listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through 
(x) of this section.

[[Page 272]]

    (i) The cylinder bore center-to-center dimensions.
    (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) The cylinder block configuration (air-cooled or water-cooled: 
L-6, 90 deg., V-8, etc.).
    (v) The location of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
    (vi) The method of air aspiration.
    (vii) The combustion cycle.
    (viii) Catalytic converter characteristics.
    (ix) Thermal reactor characteristics.
    (x) Type of air inlet cooler (e.g., intercoolers and after-coolers) 
for diesel heavy-duty engines.
    (3)(i) Engines identical in all the respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section may be further divided into different engine 
families if the Administrator determines that they may be expected to 
have different emission characteristics. This determination will be 
based upon a consideration of the features of each engine listed in 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i) (A) through (G) of this section.
    (A) The bore and stroke.
    (B) The surface-to-volume ratio of the nominally dimensioned 
cylinder at the top dead center positions.
    (C) The intake manifold induction port sizes and configuration.
    (D) The exhaust manifold port size and configuration.
    (E) The intake and exhaust valve sizes.
    (F) The fuel system.
    (G) The camshaft timing and ignition or injection timing 
characteristics.
    (ii) Light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines produced in different 
model years and distinguishable in the respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section shall be treated as belonging to a single engine 
family if the Administrator requires it, after determining that the 
engines may be expected to have similar emission deterioration 
characteristics.
    (iii) Engines identical in all of the respects listed in paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) of this section may be further divided into 
different engine families if some of the engines are expected to be sold 
as clean-fuel vehicles under 40 CFR part 88, and if the manufacturer 
chooses to certify the engines to both the clean-fuel vehicle standards 
of 40 CFR part 88 and the general standards of this part 86. One engine 
family shall include engines that are intended for general use. For this 
engine family, only the provisions of this part 86 shall apply. The 
second engine family shall include all engines that are intended to be 
used in clean-fuel vehicles. For this engine family, the provisions of 
both this part 86 and 40 CFR part 88 shall apply. The manufacturer may 
submit one set of data to certify both engine families.
    (4) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine 
families based upon the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this section, the Administrator will establish families for those 
engines based upon those features most related to their emission 
characteristics. Engines that are eligible to be included in the same 
engine family based on the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) 
of this section may be further divided into different engine families if 
the manufacturer determines that they may be expected to have different 
emission characteristics, or if the manufacturer chooses to certify the 
engines to both the clean-fuel vehicle standards of 40 CFR part 88 and 
the general standards of this part 86 as described in paragraph 
(a)(3)(iii) of this section. The determination of the emission 
characteristics will be based upon a consideration of the following 
features of each engine:
    (i) The dimension from the center line of the crankshaft to the 
center line of the camshaft.
    (ii) The dimension from the center line of the crankshaft to the top 
of the cylinder block head face.
    (iii) The size of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
    (5) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks covered by an 
application for certification will be divided into groupings (e.g., by 
fuel type) which are expected to have similar evaporative emission 
characteristics throughout their useful life. Each group of vehicles 
with similar evaporative emission characteristics shall be defined as a 
separate evaporative emission family.
    (6) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks to be classed in 
the same evaporative emission family, vehicles must be similar with 
respect to:

[[Page 273]]

    (i) Type of vapor storage device (e.g., canister, air cleaner, 
crankcase).
    (ii) Basic canister design.
    (iii) Fuel system.
    (iv) Fuel type.
    (7) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into 
evaporative emission families based on the criteria listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the Administrator will establish families for 
those vehicles based upon the features most related to their evaporative 
emission characteristics.
    (8)(i) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the Production 
AMA Durability Program, the engine families covered by an application 
for certification shall be grouped based upon similar engine design and 
emission control system characteristics. Each of these groups shall 
constitute a separate engine family group.
    (ii) To be classed in the same engine family group, engine families 
must contain engines identical in all of the respects listed in 
paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) The combustion cycle.
    (B) The cylinder block configuration (air-cooled or water-cooled: L-
6, V-8, rotary, etc.).
    (C) Displacement (engines of different displacement within 50 cubic 
inches or 15 percent of the largest displacement and contained within a 
multidisplacement engine family will be included in the same engine 
family group).
    (D) Catalytic converter usage and basic type (noncatalyst, oxidation 
catalyst only, three-way catalyst equipped).
    (9) Engine families identical in all respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(8) of this section may be further divided into different engine 
family groups if the Administrator determines that they are expected to 
have significantly different exhaust emission control system 
deterioration characteristics.
    (10) A manufacturer may request the Administrator to include in an 
engine family group engine families in addition to those grouped under 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. This request must be 
accompanied by information the manufacturer believes supports the 
inclusion of these additional engine families.
    (11) A manufacturer may combine into a single engine family group 
those light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck engine families which 
otherwise meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) (8) through (10) of 
this section.
    (12) Vehicles powered by heavy-duty engines covered by an 
application for certification and using fuels for which there is an 
applicable evaporative emission standard will be divided into groupings 
of vehicles on the basis of physical features, including fuel type, 
which are expected to affect evaporative emissions. Each group of 
vehicles with similar features shall be defined as a separate 
evaporative emission family.
    (13) For vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for 
which there are applicable evaporative emission standards to be classed 
in the same evaporative emission family, vehicles must be identical with 
respect to:
    (i) Method of fuel/air metering (i.e., carburetion versus fuel 
injection).
    (ii) Carburetor bowl fuel volume, within a 10 cc range.
    (iii) Fuel type.
    (14) For vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for 
which there are applicable evaporative emission standards to be classed 
in the same evaporative emission control system family, vehicles must be 
identical with respect to:
    (i) Method of vapor storage.
    (ii) Method of carburetor sealing.
    (iii) Method of air cleaner sealing.
    (iv) Vapor storage working capacity, within a 20g range.
    (v) Number of storage devices.
    (vi) Method of purging stored vapors.
    (vii) Method of venting the carburetor during both engine off and 
engine operation.
    (viii) Liquid fuel hose material.
    (ix) Vapor storage material.
    (15) Where vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for 
which there are applicable evaporative emission standards and which 
cannot be divided into evaporative emission family-control system 
combinations based on the criteria listed above, the Administrator will 
establish evaporative emission family-control system combinations for 
those vehicles based

[[Page 274]]

on features most related to their evaporative emission characteristics.
    (b) Emission data--(1) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. 
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to light-duty vehicle and 
light-duty truck emission data vehicles.
    (i) Vehicles will be chosen to be operated and tested for emission 
data based upon engine family groupings. Within each engine family, one 
test vehicle will be selected based on the criterion that the 
Administrator shall select the vehicle with the heaviest equivalent test 
weight (including options) within the family. If more than one vehicle 
meets this criterion, then within that vehicle grouping the 
Administrator shall select, in the order listed, the highest road-load 
power, largest displacement, the transmission with the highest numerical 
final gear ratio (including overdrive), the highest numerical axle ratio 
offered in that engine family, and the maximum fuel flow calibration
    (ii) The Administrator shall select one additional test vehicle from 
within each engine family. The additional vehicle selected shall be the 
vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those vehicles 
remaining in the engine family. If all vehicles within the engine family 
are similar the Administrator may waive the requirements of this 
paragraph.
    (iii) Within an engine family and exhaust emission control system, 
the manufacturer may alter any emission data vehicle (or other vehicles 
such as current or previous model year emission data vehicles, fuel 
economy data vehicles, and development vehicles provided they meet 
emission data vehicles' protocol) to represent more than one selection 
under paragraph (b)(1) (i), (ii), (iv), or (vii) of this section.
    (iv) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section do not represent each engine-system 
combination, then one vehicle of each engine-system combination not 
represented will be selected by the Administrator. The vehicle selected 
shall be the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those 
vehicles remaining in the engine family.
    (v) For high-altitude exhaust emission compliance for each engine 
family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the procedures described in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(v) (A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) The manufacturer will select for testing under high-altitude 
conditions the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions from 
the nonexempt vehicles selected in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section; or
    (B) In lieu of testing vehicles according to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) 
of this section, a manufacturer may provide a statement in its 
application for certification, based on the manufacturer's engineering 
evaluation of such high altitude emission testing as the manufacturer 
deems appropriate,
    (1) That all light-duty vehicles not exempt under Sec. 86.094-8(h) 
comply with the emission standards at high altitude; and
    (2) That light-duty trucks sold for principal use at designated 
high-altitude locations comply with the high-altitude emission 
requirements and that all light-duty trucks sold at low altitude, which 
are not exempt under Sec. 86.094-9(h), are capable of being modified to 
meet high-altitude standards.
    (vi) If 90 percent or more of the engine family sales will be in 
California, a manufacturer may substitute emission data vehicles 
selected by the California Air Resources Board criteria for the 
selections specified in paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii), and (iv) of this 
section.
    (vii) Vehicles will be chosen to be operated and tested for 
evaporative emission data based upon evaporative emission family 
groupings as defined in paragraphs (a) (12) through (15) of this 
section.
    (A) Vehicles of each evaporative emission family will be divided 
into evaporative emission control systems.
    (B) The Administrator will select the vehicle expected to exhibit 
the highest evaporative emissions from within each evaporative family to 
be certified. This vehicle is selected from among the vehicles 
represented by the exhaust emission data selections for the engine 
family, unless evaporative testing has already been completed for the 
vehicle

[[Page 275]]

expected to exhibit the highest evaporative emissions for the 
evaporative family as part of another engine family's testing.
    (C) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii)(B) of this section do not represent each evaporative 
emission control system then the Administrator will select the highest 
expected evaporative emission vehicle from within the unrepresented 
evaporative system.
    (viii) For high-altitude evaporative emission compliance for each 
evaporative emission family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the 
procedures described in paragraphs (b)(1)(viii) (A) and (B) of this 
section.
    (A) The manufacturer will select for testing under high-altitude 
conditions the one nonexempt vehicle previously selected under paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii) (B) or (C) of this section which is expected to have the 
highest level of evaporative emissions when operated at high altitude; 
or
    (B) In lieu of testing vehicles according to paragraph 
(b)(1)(viii)(A) of this section, a manufacturer may provide a statement 
in its application for certification, based on the manufacturer's 
engineering evaluation of such high-altitude emission testing as the 
manufacturer deems appropriate,
    (1) That all light-duty vehicles not exempt under Sec. 86.094-8(h) 
comply with the emission standards at high altitude; and
    (2) That light-duty trucks sold for principal use at designated 
high-altitude locations comply with the high-altitude emission 
requirements and that all light-duty trucks sold at low-altitude, which 
are not exempt under Sec. 86.094-9(h), are capable of being modified to 
meet high-altitude standards.
    (ix) Vehicles selected for high altitude exhaust emission testing 
under paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section may be used to satisfy the 
evaporative emission testing requirements of paragraph (b)(1) (viii) (A) 
of this section.
    (x) Light-duty trucks only. (A) The manufacturer may reconfigure any 
of the low-altitude emission data vehicles to represent the vehicle 
configuration required to be tested at high altitude.
    (B) The manufacturer is not required to test the reconfigured 
vehicle at low altitude.
    (xi) For cold temperature CO exhaust emission compliance for each 
engine family, the Administrator will select for testing the vehicle 
expected to emit the highest emissions from the vehicles selected in 
accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section. This vehicle shall be tested by the manufacturer in accordance 
with the test procedures in subpart C of this part or with alternative 
procedures requested by the manufacturer and approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (2) Otto-cycle heavy-duty emission data engines. Paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section applies to Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines.
    (i)-(ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) The Administrator shall select a maximum of two engines within 
each engine family based upon features indicating that they may have the 
highest emission levels of the engines in the engine family in 
accordance with the criteria described in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) (A) and 
(B) of this section.
    (A) The Administrator shall select one emission data engine first 
based on the largest displacement within the engine family. Then from 
those within the largest displacement the Administrator shall select, in 
the order listed, highest fuel flow at the speed of maximum rated 
torque, the engine with the most advanced spark timing, no EGR or lowest 
EGR flow, and no air pump or lowest actual flow air pump.
    (B) The Administrator shall select one additional engine, from 
within each engine family. The engine selected shall be the engine 
expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those engines remaining in 
the engine family. If all engines within the engine family are similar 
the Administrator may waive the requirements of this paragraph.
    (iv) If the engines selected in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) 
(ii) and (iii) of this section do not represent each engine 
displacement-exhaust emission control system combination, then one

[[Page 276]]

engine of each engine displacement-exhaust emission control system 
combination not represented shall be selected by the Administrator.
    (v) Within an engine family/displacement/control system combination, 
the manufacturer may alter any emission data engine (or other engine 
including current or previous model year emission data engines and 
development engines provided they meet the emission data engines' 
protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Diesel heavy-duty emission data engines. Paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section applies to diesel heavy-duty emission data vehicles.
    (i) Engines will be chosen to be run for emission data based upon 
engine family groupings. Within each engine family, the requirements of 
paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section must be met.
    (ii) Engines of each engine family will be divided into groups based 
upon their exhaust emission control systems. One engine of each engine 
system combination shall be run for smoke emission data (diesel engines 
only) and gaseous emission data. Either the complete gaseous emission 
test or the complete smoke test may be conducted first. Within each 
combination, the engine that features the highest fuel feed per stroke, 
primarily at the speed of maximum rated torque and secondarily at rated 
speed, will usually be selected. If there are military engines with 
higher fuel rates than other engines in the same engine system 
combinations, then one military engine shall also be selected. The 
engine with the highest fuel feed per stroke will usually be selected.
    (iii) The Administrator may select a maximum of one additional 
engine within each engine-system combination based upon features 
indicating that it may have the highest emission levels of the engines 
of that combination. In selecting this engine, the Administrator will 
consider such features as the injection system, fuel system, compression 
ratio, rated speed, rated horsepower, peak torque speed, and peak 
torque.
    (iv) Within an engine family control system combination, the 
manufacturer may alter any emission data engine (or other engine 
including current or previous model year emission data engines and 
development engines provided they meet the emission data engines' 
protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraphs (b)(3) 
(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (c) Durability data--(1) Light-duty vehicle durability data 
vehicles. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to light-duty vehicle 
durability data vehicles.
    (i) A durability data vehicle will be selected by the Administrator 
to represent each engine-system combination. The vehicle selected shall 
be of the engine displacement with the largest projected sales volume of 
vehicles with that control-system combination in that engine family and 
will be designated by the Administrator as to transmission type, fuel 
system, inertia weight class, and test weight.
    (ii) A manufacturer may elect to operate and test additional 
vehicles to represent any engine-system combination. The additional 
vehicles must be of the same engine displacement, transmission type, 
fuel system and inertia weight class as the vehicle selected for that 
engine-system combination in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section. Notice of an intent to operate and test 
additional vehicles shall be given to the Administrator no later than 30 
days following notification of the test fleet selection.
    (2) Light-duty trucks. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies to 
vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust 
emission deterioration factors for light-duty trucks.
    (i) The manufacturer shall select the vehicles, engines, subsystems, 
or components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether 
vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components are used, they shall be 
selected so that their emissions deterioration characteristics may be 
expected to represent those of in-use vehicles, based on good 
engineering judgment.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Heavy-duty engines. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies to 
engines,

[[Page 277]]

subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust emission 
deterioration factors for heavy-duty engines.
    (i) The manufacturer shall select the engines, subsystems, or 
components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether 
engines, subsystems, or components are used, they shall be selected so 
that their emissions deterioration characteristics may be expected to 
represent those of in-use engines, based on good engineering judgment.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (d) For purposes of testing under Sec. 86.094-26(a)(9) or (b)(11), 
the Administrator may require additional emission data vehicles (or 
emission data engines) and durability data vehicles (light-duty vehicles 
only) identical in all material respects to vehicles (or engines) 
selected in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
provided that the number of vehicles (or engines) selected shall not 
increase the size of either the emission data fleet or the durability 
data fleet by more than 20 percent or one vehicle (or engine), whichever 
is greater.
    (e)(1) [Reserved]
    (2) Any manufacturer may request to certify engine families with 
combined total sales of fewer than 10,000 light-duty vehicles, light-
duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines utilizing the 
procedures contained in Sec. 86.094-14 for emission data vehicle 
selection and determination of deterioration factors. The deterioration 
factors shall be applied only to entire engine families.
    (f) Carryover and carryacross of durability and emission data. In 
lieu of testing an emission data or durability data vehicle (or engine) 
selected under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and submitting data 
therefore, a manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the 
Administrator, submit exhaust emission data and/or evaporative emission 
data, as applicable on a similar vehicle (or engine) for which 
certification has previously been obtained or for which all applicable 
data required under Sec. 86.094-23 has previously been submitted.
    (g)(1) Paragraph (g) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles 
and light-duty trucks, but does not apply to the production vehicles 
selected under paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2)(i) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination, shall be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option), the full 
estimated weight of that item shall be included in the curb weight 
computation for each vehicle available with that item in that carline, 
within that engine-system combination.
    (ii) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of the carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option), no weight for 
that item will be added in computing the curb weight for any vehicle in 
that carline, within that engine-system combination, unless that item is 
standard equipment on the vehicle.
    (iii) In the case of mutually exclusive options, only the weight of 
the heavier option will be added in computing the curb weight.
    (iv) Optional equipment weighing less than three pounds per item 
need not be considered.
    (3)(i) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can 
reasonably be expected to influence emissions, then such items shall 
actually be installed (unless excluded under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of 
this section) on all emission data and durability data vehicles of that 
carline, within that engine-system combination, on which the items are 
intended to be offered in production. Items that can reasonably be 
expected to influence emissions are: air conditioning, power steering, 
power brakes, and other items determined by the Administrator.
    (ii) If the manufacturer determines by test data or engineering 
evaluation that the actual installation of the optional equipment 
required by paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section does not affect the 
emissions or fuel economy values, the optional equipment need not be 
installed on the test vehicle.

[[Page 278]]

    (iii) The weight of the options shall be included in the design curb 
weight and also be represented in the weight of the test vehicles.
    (iv) The engineering evaluation, including any test data, used to 
support the deletion of optional equipment from test vehicles, shall be 
maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made available to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (4) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can 
reasonably be expected to influence emissions, that item shall not be 
installed on any emission data vehicle or durability data vehicle of 
that carline, within that engine-system combination, unless that item is 
standard equipment on that vehicle or specifically required by the 
Administrator.
    (h) Production AMA Durability Program durability data vehicles. 
Paragraph (h) of this section applies to light-duty vehicle durability 
data vehicles selected under the Production AMA Durability Program 
described in Sec. 86.094-13.
    (1) In order to update the durability data to be used to determine a 
deterioration factor for each engine family group, the Administrator 
will select durability data vehicles from the manufacturer's production 
line. Production vehicles will be selected from each model year's 
production for those vehicles certified using the Production AMA 
Durability Program procedures.
    (i) The Administrator shall select the production durability data 
vehicle designs from the designs that the manufacturer offers for sale. 
For each model year and for each engine family group, the Administrator 
may select production durability data vehicle designs of equal number to 
the number of engine families within the engine family group, up to a 
maximum of three vehicles.
    (ii) The production durability data vehicles representing the 
designs selected in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section will be randomly 
selected from the manufacturer's production. The Administrator will make 
these random selections unless the manufacturer (with prior approval of 
the Administrator) elects to make the random selections.
    (iii) The manufacturer may select additional production durability 
data vehicle designs from within the engine family group. The production 
durability data vehicles representing these designs shall be randomly 
selected from the manufacturer's production in accordance with paragraph 
(h)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) For each production on durability data vehicle selected under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the manufacturer shall provide to the 
Administrator (before the vehicle is tested or begins service 
accumulation) the vehicle identification number. Before the vehicle 
begins service accumulation the manufacturer shall also provide the 
Administrator with a description of the durability data vehicle as 
specified by the Administrator.
    (v) In lieu of testing a production durability data vehicle selected 
under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and submitting data therefrom, a 
manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the Administrator, 
submit exhaust emission data from a production vehicle of the same 
configuration for which all applicable data has previously been 
submitted.
    (2) If, within an existing engine family group, a manufacturer 
requests to certify vehicles of a new design, engine family, emission 
control system, or with any other durability-related design difference, 
the Administrator will determine if the existing engine family group 
deterioration factor is appropriate for the new design. If the 
Administrator cannot make this determination or deems the deterioration 
factor not appropriate, the Administrator shall select preproduction 
durability data vehicles under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section. If vehicles are then certified using the new design, the 
Administrator may select production vehicles with the new design under 
the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) If a manufacturer requests to certify vehicles of a new design 
that the Administrator determines are a new engine family group, the 
Administrator

[[Page 279]]

shall select preproduction durability data vehicles under the provisions 
of paragraph (c) of this section. If vehicles are then certified using 
the new design, the Administrator may select production vehicles of that 
design under the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

Sec. 86.094-25  Maintenance.

    (a)(1) Applicability. This section applies to light-duty vehicles, 
light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty engines.
    (2) Maintenance performed on vehicles, engines, subsystems, or 
components used to determine exhaust or evaporative emission 
deterioration factors is classified as either emission-related or non-
emission-related and each of these can be classified as either scheduled 
or unscheduled. Further, some emission-related maintenance is also 
classified as critical emission-related maintenance.
    (b) This section specifies emission-related scheduled maintenance 
for purposes of obtaining durability data and for inclusion in 
maintenance instructions furnished to purchasers of new motor vehicles 
and new motor vehicles engines under Sec. 86.087-38.
    (1) All emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of 
obtaining durability data must occur at the same mileage intervals (or 
equivalent intervals if engines, subsystems, or components are used) 
that will be specified in the manufacturer's maintenance instructions 
furnished to the ultimate purchaser of the motor vehicle or engine under 
Sec. 86.094-35. This maintenance schedule may be updated as necessary 
throughout the testing of the vehicle/engine, provided that no 
maintenance operation is deleted from the maintenance schedule after the 
operation has been performed on the test vehicle or engine.
    (2) Any emission-related maintenance which is performed on vehicles, 
engines, subsystems, or components must be technologically necessary to 
assure in-use compliance with the emission standards. The manufacturer 
must submit data which demonstrate to the Administrator that all of the 
emission-related scheduled maintenance which is to be performed is 
technologically necessary. Scheduled maintenance must be approved by the 
Administrator prior to being performed or being included in the 
maintenance instructions provided to purchasers under Sec. 86.087-38. 
The Administrator has determined that emission-related maintenance at 
shorter intervals than those outlined in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of 
this section is not technologically necessary to ensure in-use 
compliance. However, the Administrator may determine that maintenance 
even more restrictive (e.g., longer intervals) than that listed in 
paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section is also not technologically 
necessary.
    (3) For Otto-cycle light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and heavy 
duty engines, emission-related maintenance in addition to, or at shorter 
intervals than, that listed in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (vii) of 
this section will not be accepted as technologically necessary, except 
as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.

spark plugs shall occur at 25,000 miles (or 750 hours) of use and at 
25,000-mile (or 750-hour) intervals thereafter, for engines certified 
for use with unleaded fuel only.
    (ii) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, the adjustment, 
cleaning, repair, or replacement of the items listed in paragraphs 
(b)(3)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section shall occur at 50,000 miles 
of use and at 50,000-mile intervals thereafter.

[[Page 281]]

    (G) Superchargers.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6)(i) The components listed in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) (A) through (G) 
of this section are currently defined as critical emission-related 
components.
    (A) Catalytic converter.
    (B) Air injection system components.
    (C) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors 
(including oxygen sensor if installed) and actuators.
    (D) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related filters 
and control valves).
    (E) Positive crankcase ventilation valve.
    (F) Evaporative emission control system components (excluding 
canister air filter).
    (G) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system.
    (ii) All critical emission-related scheduled maintenance must have a 
reasonable likelihood of being performed in-use. The manufacturer shall 
be required to show the reasonable likelihood of such maintenance being 
performed in-use, and such showing shall be made prior to the 
performance of the maintenance on the durability data vehicle. Critical 
emission-related scheduled maintenance items which satisfy one of the 
conditions defined in paragraphs (b)(6)(ii) (A) through (F) of this 
section will be accepted as having a reasonable likelihood of the 
maintenance item being performed in-use.
    (A) Data are presented which establish for the Administrator a 
connection between emissions and vehicle performance such that as 
emissions increase due to lack of maintenance, vehicle performance will 
simultaneously deteriorate to a point unacceptable for typical driving.
    (B) Survey data are submitted which adequately demonstrate to the 
Administrator that, at an 80 percent confidence level, 80 percent of 
such engines already have this critical maintenance item performed in-
use at the recommended interval(s)
    (C) A clearly displayed visible signal system approved by the 
Administrator is installed to alert the vehicle driver that maintenance 
is due. A signal bearing the message ``maintenance needed'' or ``check 
engine,'', or a similar message approved by the Administrator, shall be 
actuated at the appropriate mileage point or by component failure. This 
signal must be continuous while the engine is in operation and not be 
easily eliminated without performance of the required maintenance. 
Resetting the signal shall be a required step in the maintenance 
operation. The method for resetting the signal system shall be approved 
by the Administrator.
    (D) A manufacturer may desire to demonstrate through a survey that a 
critical maintenance item is likely to be performed without a visible 
signal on a maintenance item for which there is no prior in-use 
experience without the signal. To that end, the manufacturer may in a 
given model year market up to 200 randomly selected vehicles per 
critical emission-related maintenance item without such visible signals, 
and monitor the performance of the critical maintenance item by the 
owners to show compliance with paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. 
This option is restricted to two consecutive model years and may not be 
repeated until any previous survey has been completed. If the critical 
maintenance involves more than one engine family, the sample will be 
sales weighted to ensure that it is representative of all the families 
in question.
    (E) The manufacturer provides the maintenance free of charge, and 
clearly informs the customer that the maintenance is free in the 
instructions provided under Sec. 86.087-38.
    (F) Any other method which the Administrator approves as 
establishing a reasonable likelihood that the critical maintenance will 
be performed in-use.
    (iii) Visible signal systems used under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(C) of 
this section are considered an element of design of the emission control 
system. Therefore, disabling, resetting, or otherwise rendering such 
signals inoperative without also performing the indicated maintenance 
procedure is a prohibited act under section 203(a)(3) of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7522(a) (3)).
    (7) Changes to scheduled maintenance. (i) For maintenance practices 
that existed prior to the 1980 model year, only the maintenance items 
listed in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section are currently 
considered by EPA to be

[[Page 282]]

emission-related. The Administrator may, however, determine additional 
scheduled maintenance items that existed prior to the 1980 model year to 
be emission-related by announcement in a Federal Register Notice. In no 
event may this notification occur later than September 1 of the calendar 
year two years prior to the affected model year.
    (ii) In the case of any new scheduled maintenance, the manufacturer 
must submit a request for approval to the Administrator for any 
maintenance that it wishes to recommend to purchasers and perform during 
durability determination. New scheduled maintenance is that maintenance 
which did not exist prior to the 1980 model year, including that which 
is a direct result of the implementation of new technology not found in 
production prior to the 1980 model year. The manufacturer must also 
include its recommendations as to the category (i.e., emission-related 
or non-emission-related, critical or non-critical) of the subject 
maintenance and, for suggested emission-related maintenance, the maximum 
feasible maintenance interval. Such requests must include detailed 
evidence supporting the need for the maintenance requested, and 
supporting data or other substantiation for the recommended maintenance 
category and for the interval suggested for emission-related 
maintenance. Requests for new scheduled maintenance must be approved 
prior to the introduction of the new maintenance. The Administrator will 
then designate the maintenance as emission-related or non-emission-
related. For maintenance items established as emission-related, the 
Administrator will further designate the maintenance as critical if the 
component which receives the maintenance is a critical component under 
paragraph (b)(6) of this section. For each maintenance item designated 
as emission-related, the Administrator will also establish a 
technologically necessary maintenance interval, based on industry data 
and any other information available to EPA. Designations of emission-
related maintenance items, along with their identification as critical 
or non-critical, and establishment of technologically necessary 
maintenance intervals, will be announced in the Federal Register.
    (iii) Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
determinations in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. The request shall be 
in writing and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's 
objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of 
such objections. If, after review of the request and supporting data, 
the Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual 
issue, he shall provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with 
Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to such issue.
    (c) Non-emission-related scheduled maintenance which is reasonable 
and technologically necessary (e.g., oil change, oil filter change, fuel 
filter change, air filter change, cooling system maintenance, adjustment 
of idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, injector lash, 
timing, adjustment of air pump drive belt tension, lubrication of the 
exhaust manifold heat control valve, lubrication of carburetor choke 
linkage, retorqueing carburetor mounting bolts, etc.) may be performed 
on durability data vehicles at the least frequent intervals recommended 
by the manufacturer to the ultimate purchaser, (e.g., not at the 
intervals recommended for severe service).
    (d) Unscheduled maintenance on light-duty durability data vehicles. 
(1) Unscheduled maintenance may be performed during the testing used to 
determine deterioration factors, except as provided in paragraphs (d) 
(2) and (3) of this section, only under the following provisions defined 
in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) A fuel injector or spark plug may be changed if a persistent 
misfire is detected.
    (ii) Readjustment of an Otto-cycle vehicle cold-start enrichment 
system may be performed if there is a problem of stalling.
    (iii) Readjustment of the engine idle speed (curb idle and fast 
idle) may be performed in addition to that performed as scheduled 
maintenance under paragraph (c) of this section if the idle speed 
exceeds the manufacturer's recommended idle speed by 300 rpm

[[Page 283]]

or more, or if there is a problem of stalling.
    (2) Any other unscheduled vehicle, emission control system, or fuel 
system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or 
replacement during testing to determine deterioration factors shall be 
performed only with the advance approval of the Administrator. Such 
approval will be given if the Administrator:
    (i) Has made a preliminary determination that the part failure or 
system malfunction, or the repair of such failure or malfunction, does 
not render the vehicle or engine unrepresentative of vehicles or engines 
in-use and does not require direct access to the combustion chamber, 
except for spark plug, fuel injection component, or removable prechamber 
removal or replacement.
    (ii) Has made a determination that the need for maintenance or 
repairs is indicated by an overt indication of malfunction such as 
persistent misfiring, engine stalling, overheating, fluid leakage, loss 
of oil pressure, excessive fuel consumption, or excessive power loss. 
The Administrator shall be given the opportunity to verify the existence 
of an overt indication of part failure and/or vehicle/engine malfunction 
(e.g., misfiring, stalling, black smoke), or an activation of an audible 
and/or visible signal, prior to the performance of any maintenance to 
which such overt indication or signal is relevant under the provisions 
of this section.
    (iii) Has made a determination that the OBD system of a durability 
data vehicle representing an engine family certifying fully to the 
Federal OBD requirements as specified in Sec. 86.094-17(a) through (h) 
has specifically detected the problem and has illuminated the 
malfunction indicator light.
    (3) Emission measurement may not be used as a means of determining 
the need for unscheduled maintenance under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, except under the conditions defined in paragraphs (d)(3) (i) 
through (ii) of this section.
    (i) The Administrator may approve unscheduled maintenance on 
durability data vehicles based upon a significant change in emission 
levels that indicates a vehicle or engine malfunction. In these cases 
the Administrator may first approve specific diagnostic procedures to 
identify the source of the problem. The Administrator may further 
approve of specific corrections to the problem after the problem has 
been identified. The Administrator may only approve the corrective 
action after it is determined that:
    (A) The malfunction was caused by nonproduction build practices or 
by a previously undetected design problem;
    (B) The malfunction will not occur in production vehicles or engines 
in-use; and
    (C) The deterioration factor generated by the durability data 
vehicle or engine will remain unaffected by the malfunction or by the 
corrective action (e.g., the malfunction was present for only a short 
period of time before detection, replacement parts are functionally 
representative of the proper mileage or hours, etc.).
    (ii) Following any unscheduled maintenance approved under paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section, the manufacturer shall perform an after-
maintenance emission test. If the Administrator determines that the 
after-maintenance emission levels for any pollutant indicates that the 
deterioration factor is no longer representative of production, the 
Administrator may disqualify the durability data vehicle or engine.
    (4) If the Administrator determines that part failure or system 
malfunction occurrence and/or repair rendered the vehicle/engine 
unrepresentative of vehicles in-use, the vehicle/engine shall not be 
used for determining deterioration factors.
    (5) Repairs to vehicle components of a durability data vehicle other 
than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be 
performed only as a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, 
or with the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (e) Maintenance on emission data vehicles and engines. (1) 
Adjustment of engine idle speed on emission data vehicles may be 
performed once before the low-mileage/low-hour emission test point. Any 
other engine, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, 
repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning,

[[Page 284]]

or replacement on emission data vehicles shall be performed only with 
the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (2)-(3) [Reserved]
    (4) Repairs to vehicle components of an emission data vehicle other 
than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be 
performed only as a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, 
or with the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (f) Equipment, instruments, or tools may not be used to identify 
malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the 
same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools will be available to 
dealerships and other service outlets and:
    (1) Are used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such 
components; or
    (2) Are used subsequent to the identification of a vehicle or engine 
malfunction, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for 
durability data vehicles or in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for 
emission data vehicles; or
    (3) Unless specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (g)(1) Paragraph (g) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles.
    (2) Complete emission tests (see Secs. 86.106 through 86.145) are 
required, unless waived by the Administrator, before and after scheduled 
maintenance approved for durability data vehicles. The manufacturer may 
perform emission tests before unscheduled maintenance. Complete emission 
tests are required after unscheduled maintenance which may reasonably be 
expected to affect emissions. The Administrator may waive the 
requirement to test after unscheduled maintenance. These test data may 
be submitted weekly to the Administrator, but shall be air posted or 
delivered within 7 days after completion of the tests, along with a 
complete record of all pertinent maintenance, including a preliminary 
engineering report of any malfunction diagnosis and the corrective 
action taken. A complete engineering report shall be delivered to the 
Administrator concurrently with the manufacturer's application for 
certification.
    (h) All test data, maintenance reports, and required engineering 
reports shall be compiled and provided to the Administrator in 
accordance with Sec. 86.090-23.

[58 FR 4018, Jan. 12, 1993, as amended at 58 FR 9487, Feb. 19, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 86.094-26  Mileage and service accumulation; emission requirements.

    (a)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles. 
It prescribes mileage and service accumulation requirements for 
durability data vehicles run under either the Standard AMA Durability 
Program of Sec. 86.094-13(c) or the Production AMA Durability Program of 
Sec. 86.094-13(d), and for emission data vehicles regardless of the 
durability program employed. Service accumulation requirements for 
durability data vehicles run under the Alternative Service Accumulation 
Program may be found in Sec. 86.094-13(e).
    (2) The standard method of whole-vehicle service accumulation for 
durability data vehicles and for emission data vehicles in model years 
1994 and beyond shall be mileage accumulation using the Durability 
Driving Schedule as specified in appendix IV to this part. A modified 
procedure may also be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. 
Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, all vehicles will 
accumulate mileage at a measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds 
of the estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100 
pounds of being included in the next higher inertia weight class as 
specified in Sec. 86.129, the manufacturer may elect to conduct the 
respective emission tests at higher loaded vehicle weight.
    (3) Emission data vehicles. Unless otherwise provided for in 
Sec. 86.094-23(a), emission data vehicles shall be operated and tested 
as described in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Otto-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each 
engine family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, 
and provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale 
used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to 
accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family 
without making a determination.

[[Page 285]]

The manufacturer must accumulate a minimum of 2,000 miles (3,219 
kilometers) on each test vehicle within an engine family. All test 
vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, recorded, and reported to 
the Administrator. Any vehicle used to represent emission data vehicle 
selections under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) shall be equipped with an engine 
and emission control system that has accumulated the mileage the 
manufacturer chose to accumulate on the test vehicle. Fuel economy data 
generated from certification vehicles selected in accordance with 
Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) with engine-system combinations that have 
accumulated more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be factored 
in accordance with Sec. 600.006(c) of this chapter. Complete exhaust and 
evaporative (if required) emission tests shall be conducted for each 
emission data vehicle selection under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) . The 
Administrator may determine under Sec. 86.094-24(f) that no testing is 
required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (v) or (viii) shall be conducted at the 
mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission testing under high-altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emissions tests for emission data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (i), (ii), 
(iii), (iv), or (vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile 
minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing under low-altitude conditions.
    (D) For each engine family, the manufacturer will either select one 
vehicle previously selected under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (i) through (iv) 
to be tested under high-altitude conditions or provide a statement in 
accordance with Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1)(v). Vehicles shall meet emission 
standards under both low- and high-altitude conditions without manual 
adjustments or modifications. In addition, any emission control device 
used to conform with the emission standards under high-altitude 
conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher than 4,000 
feet above sea level.
    (ii) Diesel-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each 
engine family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, 
and provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale 
used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to 
accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family 
without making a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate a 
minimum of 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) on each test vehicle within an 
engine family. All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, 
recorded, and reported to the Administrator. Any vehicle used to 
represent emission data vehicle selections under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) 
shall be equipped with an engine and emission control system that has 
accumulated the mileage the manufacturer chose to accumulate on the test 
vehicle. Fuel economy data generated from certification vehicles 
selected in accordance with Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) with engine-system 
combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 
miles) shall be factored in accordance with Sec. 600.006 of this 
chapter. Complete exhaust emission tests shall be conducted for each 
emission data vehicle selection under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1). The 
Administrator may determine under Sec. 86.094-24(f) that no testing is 
required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1)(v) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 
mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing under high-altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emission tests for emission data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (i), (ii), 
(iii), (iv), or (vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile 
minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing under low-altitude conditions.
    (D) For each engine family, the manufacturer will either select one 
vehicle previously selected under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (i) through (iv) 
to be tested under high-altitude conditions or provide a statement in 
accordance with Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1)(v). Vehicles shall meet

[[Page 286]]

emission standards under both low- and high-altitude conditions without 
manual adjustments or modifications. In addition, any emission control 
device used to conform with the emission standards under high-altitude 
conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher than 4,000 
feet above sea level.
    (4)(i) Durability data vehicles. (A) Unless otherwise provided for 
in Sec. 86.094-13(e) or Sec. 86.094-23(a) or in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) 
of this section, each durability data vehicle shall be driven on the 
whole-vehicle mileage accumulation cycle specified in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, with all emission control systems installed and 
operating, up to a mileage endpoint corresponding to the vehicle's 
durability useful life as defined in Sec. 86.094-2.
    (B) Extrapolation of durability data and changes to the mileage 
accumulation cycle. (1) Once a durability vehicle has reached the 
greater of 75,000 miles or three-quarters of the applicable durability 
useful life, the manufacturer may petition the Administrator to 
extrapolate the durability data obtained up to that point out to the 
durability useful life or to replace the mileage accumulation cycle with 
an alternative that meets the criteria of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. In the petition, the manufacturer shall supplement the 
durability vehicle data with other information demonstrating the 
durability of the vehicle's emission control components and systems at 
or beyond the durability useful life.
    (2) Factors the Administrator will consider in evaluating petitions 
for extrapolation of durability data or for changes to the mileage 
accumulation cycle include, but are not limited to, any unusual 
scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, the general linearity 
and scatter of the actual data, reasonable explanations for all outlier 
data, the technical validity of any substitute mileage accumulation 
cycle, and evidence supplied by the vehicle manufacturer of component 
and system durability.
    (3) If a petition for extrapolation of durability data is approved, 
the endpoint for whole-vehicle mileage accumulation of the durability 
data vehicle shall be the mileage attained by the vehicle as reflected 
in the petition.
    (4) Discontinuation of a durability data vehicle shall be allowed 
only with the consent of the Administrator.
    (C) Complete exhaust emission tests shall be made at nominal test 
point mileage intervals that the manufacturer determines. At a minimum, 
two complete exhaust emission tests shall be made. The first test shall 
be made at a distance not greater than 6,250 miles. The last shall be 
made at the mileage accumulation endpoint determined in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) (A) or (B) of this section, whichever is applicable.
    (D) Except with advance approval of the Administrator, the mileage 
interval between nominal test points must be of equal length except for 
the interval between zero miles and the first test, and any interval 
before or after testing conducted in conjunction with vehicle 
maintenance as specified in Sec. 86.094-25(g)(2).
    (ii) The manufacturer may, at its option, alter the durability data 
vehicle at the selected nominal test point to represent emission data 
vehicle(s) within the same engine-system combination and perform 
emission tests on the altered vehicle. Upon completion of emission 
testing, the manufacturer may return the test vehicle to the durability 
data vehicle configuration and continue mileage accumulation.
    (5)(i) All tests required by this subpart on emission data vehicles 
shall be conducted at a mileage equal to or greater than the mileage the 
manufacturer determines under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (ii) All tests required by this subpart on durability data vehicles 
shall be conducted within 250 miles of each of the nominal test points. 
This <plus-minus>250 mile test point mileage tolerance may be modified 
with the advance approval of the Administrator if the basis for the 
written request is to prevent an interruption of durability mileage 
accumulation due to test scheduling conflicts for weekends, holidays, 
and other similar circumstances.
    (6)(i)(A) The manufacturer may conduct multiple tests at any test 
point at which the data are intended to be used in the deterioration 
factor. At each

[[Page 287]]

test point where multiple tests are conducted, the test results from all 
valid tests shall be averaged to determine the data point to be used in 
the deterioration factor calculation, except under paragraph 
(a)(6)(i)(B) of this section. The test results from emission tests 
performed before maintenance affecting emissions shall not be averaged 
with test results after the maintenance.
    (B) The manufacturer is not required to average multiple tests if 
the manufacturer conducts no more than three tests at each test point 
and if the number of tests at each test point is equal. All test points 
must be treated the same for all exhaust pollutants.
    (ii) The results of all emission testing shall be supplied to the 
Administrator. The manufacturer shall furnish to the Administrator 
explanation for voiding any test. The Administrator will determine if 
voiding the test was appropriate based upon the explanation given by the 
manufacturer for the voided test. Tests between test points may be 
conducted as required by the Administrator. Data from all tests 
(including voided tests) may be submitted weekly to the Administrator, 
but shall be air posted or delivered to the Administrator within 7 days 
after completion of the test. In addition, all test data shall be 
compiled and provided to the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 86.091-23. Where the Administrator conducts a test on a durability 
data vehicle at a prescribed test point, the results of that test will 
be used in the calculation of the deterioration factor.
    (iii) The results of all emission tests shall be rounded to the 
number of places to the right of the decimal point indicated by 
expressing the applicable emission standard of this subpart to one 
additional significant figure, in accordance with the rounding off 
method specified in ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) (``Standard 
recommended practice for indicating which places of figures are to be 
considered significant in specified limiting values,'' American Society 
for Testing and Materials). This incorporation by reference was approved 
by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from American Society 
for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103. Copies 
may be inspected at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Air Docket 
Section, room M-1500, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460 
or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., 
suite 700, Washington DC.
    (7) Whenever a manufacturer intends to operate and test a vehicle 
which may be used for emission or durability data, the manufacturer 
shall retain in its records all information concerning all emissions 
tests and maintenance, including vehicle alterations to represent other 
vehicle selections. For emission data vehicles, this information shall 
be submitted, including the vehicle description and specification 
information required by the Administrator, to the Administrator 
following the emission data test. For durability data vehicles, this 
information shall be submitted following the 5,000-mile test.
    (8) The data from emission data vehicles and durability data 
vehicles obtained pursuant to the provisions of this section will be 
used in the calculations under Sec. 86.094-28.
    (9)(i) The Administrator may elect to operate and test any test 
vehicle during all or any part of the mileage accumulation and testing 
procedure. In such cases, the manufacturer shall provide the vehicle(s) 
to the Administrator with all information necessary to conduct this 
testing.
    (ii) The test procedures in Secs. 86.106 through 86.145 will be 
followed by the Administrator. The Administrator will test the vehicles 
at each test point. Maintenance may be performed by the manufacturer 
under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.
    (iii) The data developed by the Administrator for the engine-system 
combination shall be combined with any applicable data supplied by the 
manufacturer on other vehicles of that combination to determine the 
applicable deterioration factors for the combination. In the case of a 
significant discrepancy between data developed by the Administrator and 
that submitted by the manufacturer, the Administrator's data shall be 
used in the determination of deterioration factors.

[[Page 288]]

    (10) Emission testing of any type with respect to any certification 
vehicle other than that specified in this part is not allowed except as 
such testing may be specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (11) This section does not apply to testing conducted to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 86.091-23(b)(2).
    (b)(1) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to light-duty trucks.
    (2) Four types of mileage or service accumulation are applicable to 
light-duty trucks, as described in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (iv) of 
this section.
    (i) Paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section applies to service 
accumulation conducted under the Standard Self-Approval Durability 
Program of Sec. 86.094-13(f). This type of service accumulation is 
applicable for model years 1994 and beyond only. The manufacturer 
determines the form and extent of this service accumulation, consistent 
with good engineering practice, and describes it in the application for 
certification. Service accumulation under the Standard Self-Approval 
Durability Program is conducted on vehicles, engines, subsystems, or 
components selected by the manufacturer under Sec. 86.094-24(c)(2)(i).
    (ii) Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section applies to service 
accumulation conducted under the Alternative Service Accumulation 
Durability Program of Sec. 86.094-13(e). This type of service 
accumulation is applicable for model years 1994 and beyond only. The 
service accumulation method is developed by the manufacturer to be 
consistent with good engineering practice and to accurately predict the 
deterioration of the vehicle's emissions in actual use over its full 
useful life. The method is subject to advance approval by the 
Administrator and to verification by an in-use verification program 
conducted by the manufacturer under Sec. 86.094-13(e)(5).
    (iii) Paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section applies to mileage 
accumulation of the duration selected by the manufacturer on emission 
data vehicles selected under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1). The procedure for 
mileage accumulation will be the Durability Driving Schedule as 
specified in appendix IV to this part. A modified procedure may also be 
used if approved in advance by the Administrator. Except with the 
advance approval of the Administrator, all vehicles will accumulate 
mileage at a measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds of the 
estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100 pounds 
of being included in the next higher inertia weight class as specified 
in Sec. 86.129, the manufacturer may elect to conduct the respective 
emission tests at higher loaded vehicle weight.
    (iv) Service or mileage accumulation may also be part of the test 
procedures used by the manufacturer to establish evaporative emission 
deterioration factors.
    (3) Exhaust emission deterioration factors will be determined on the 
basis of the mileage or service accumulation described in paragraph 
(b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section and related testing, according to the 
manufacturer's procedures.
    (4) Each emission data vehicle shall be operated and tested as 
follows:
    (i) Otto-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each 
engine family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, 
and provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale 
used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to 
accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family 
without making a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate a 
minimum of 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) on each test vehicle within an 
engine family. All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, 
recorded, and reported to the Administrator. Any vehicle used to 
represent emission data vehicle selections under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) 
shall be equipped with an engine and emission control system that has 
accumulated the mileage the manufacturer chose to accumulate on the test 
vehicle. Fuel economy data generated from certification vehicles 
selected in accordance with Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) with engine-system 
combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 
miles) shall be factored in accordance with Sec. 600.006 of this 
chapter. Complete exhaust emission tests shall be conducted for each 
emission data vehicle selection under

[[Page 289]]

Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1). The Administrator may determine under Sec. 86.094-
24(f) that no testing is required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (v) or (viii) shall be conducted at the 
mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission testing or at 6,436 kilometers (4,000 miles) 
under high-altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emission tests for emission data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (ii), (iii), 
(iv)(A), or (vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile 
minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing or at 6,436 kilometer (4,000 mile) test point under 
low-altitude conditions.
    (D) If the manufacturer recommends adjustments or modifications in 
order to conform to emission standards at high altitude, such 
adjustments or modifications shall be made to the test vehicle selected 
under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (v) and (viii) (in accordance with the 
instructions to be provided to the ultimate purchaser) before being 
tested under high-altitude conditions.
    (ii) Diesel-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each 
engine family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is 
stabilized for emission data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, 
and provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale 
used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to 
accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family 
without making a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate a 
minimum of 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) on each test vehicle within an 
engine family. All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, 
recorded, and reported to the Administrator. Any vehicle used to 
represent emission data vehicle selections under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) 
shall be equipped with an engine and emission control system that has 
accumulated the mileage the manufacturer chose to accumulate on the test 
vehicle. Fuel economy data generated from certification vehicles 
selected in accordance with Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) with engine-system 
combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 
miles) shall be factored in accordance with Sec. 600.006(c) of this 
chapter. Complete exhaust emission tests shall be conducted for each 
emission data vehicle selection under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1). The 
administrator may determine under Sec. 86.094-24(f) that no testing is 
required.
    (B) Emission tests for emission data vehicle(s) selected for testing 
under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1)(v) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 
mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission testing or at the 6,436 kilometer (4,000 mile) test point under 
high-altitude conditions.
    (C) Exhaust and evaporative emission tests for emission data 
vehicle(s) selected for testing under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (ii), (iii), 
and (iv) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which 
the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing or at 
the 6,436 kilometer (4,000 mile) test point under low-altitude 
conditions.
    (D) If the manufacturer recommends adjustments or modifications in 
order to conform to emission standards at high-altitude, such 
adjustments or modifications shall be made to the test vehicle selected 
under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(1) (v) and (viii) (in accordance with the 
instructions to be provided to the ultimate purchaser) before being 
tested under high-altitude conditions.
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) All tests required by this subpart on emission data vehicles 
shall be conducted at a mileage equal to or greater than the mileage the 
manufacturer determines under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (c)(1) Paragraph (c) of this section applies to heavy-duty engines.
    (2) Two types of service accumulation are applicable to heavy-duty 
engines, as described in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Service accumulation on engines, subsystems, or components 
selected by the manufacturer under Sec. 86.094-24(c)(3)(i). The 
manufacturer determines the form and extent of this service 
accumulation, consistent with good engineering practice, and describes 
it in the application for certification.
    (ii) Dynamometer service accumulation on emission data engines 
selected

[[Page 290]]

under Sec. 86.094-24(b) (2) or (3). The manufacturer determines the 
engine operating schedule to be used for dynamometer service 
accumulation, consistent with good engineering practice. A single engine 
operating schedule shall be used for all engines in an engine family-
control system combination. Operating schedules may be different for 
different combinations.
    (3) Exhaust emission deterioration factors will be determined on the 
basis of the service accumulation described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section and related testing, according to the manufacturer's 
procedures.
    (4) The manufacturer shall determine, for each engine family, the 
number of hours at which the engine system combination is stabilized (no 
less than 62 hours for catalyst equipped) for emission data testing. The 
manufacturer shall maintain, and provide to the Administrator if 
requested, a record of the rationale used in making this determination. 
The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 125 hours on each test engine 
within an engine family without making a determination. Any engine used 
to represent emission data engine selections under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(2) 
shall be equipped with an engine system combination that has accumulated 
at least the number of hours determined under this paragraph. Complete 
exhaust emission tests shall be conducted for each emission data engine 
selection under Sec. 86.094-24(b)(2). Evaporative emission controls need 
not be connected provided normal operating conditions are maintained in 
the engine induction system. The Administrator may determine under 
Sec. 86.094-24(f) that no testing is required.
    (d)(1) Paragraph (d) of this section applies to both light-duty 
trucks and heavy-duty engines.
    (2)(i) The results of all emission testing shall be supplied to the 
Administrator. The manufacturer shall furnish to the Administrator 
explanation for voiding any test. The Administrator will determine if 
voiding the test was appropriate based upon the explanation given by the 
manufacturer for the voided test. Tests between test points may be 
conducted as required by the Administrator. Data from all tests 
(including voided tests) may be submitted weekly to the Administrator, 
but shall be air posted or delivered to the Administrator within 7 days 
after completion of the test. In addition, all test data shall be 
compiled and provided to the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 86.094-23. Where the Administrator conducts a test on a durability 
data vehicle at a prescribed test point, the results of that test will 
be used in the calculation of the deterioration factor.
    (ii) The results of all emission tests shall be recorded and 
reported to the Administrator. These test results shall be rounded, in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in 
paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section), to the number of decimal places 
contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one 
additional significant figure.
    (3) Whenever a manufacturer intends to operate and test a vehicle 
(or engine) which may be used for emission data, the manufacturer shall 
retain in its records all information concerning all emissions tests and 
maintenance, including vehicle (or engine) alterations to represent 
other vehicle (or engine) selections. This information shall be 
submitted, including the vehicle (or engine) description and 
specification information required by the Administrator, to the 
Administrator following the emission data test.
    (4)-(5) [Reserved]
    (6) Emission testing of any type with respect to any certification 
vehicle or engine other than that specified in this subpart is not 
allowed except as such testing may be specifically authorized by the 
Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 86.094-28  Compliance with emission standards.

    (a)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to lightduty vehicles.
    (2) Each exhaust and evaporative emission standard (and family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate) of

[[Page 291]]

Sec. 86.094-8 applies to the emissions of vehicles for the appropriate 
useful life as defined in Secs. 86.094-2 and 86.094-8.
    (3) Since it is expected that emission control efficiency will 
change with mileage accumulation on the vehicle, the emission level of a 
vehicle which has accumulated mileage equal to the specified useful life 
will be used as the basis for determining compliance with the standard 
(or family particulate emission limit, as appropriate).
    (4) The procedure for determining compliance of a new motor vehicle 
with exhaust and evaporative emission standards (or family particulate 
emission limit, as appropriate) is as described in paragraphs (a)(4) (i) 
through (v) of this section, except where specified by paragraph (a)(7) 
of this section for the Production AMA Durability Program.
    (i) Separate emission deterioration factors shall be determined from 
the exhaust emission results of the durability data vehicle(s) for each 
engine-system combination. A separate evaporative emission deterioration 
factor shall be determined for each evaporative emission family-
evaporative emission control system combination from the testing 
conducted by the manufacturer (gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled 
vehicles only).
    (A) The applicable results to be used, unless excluded by paragraph 
(a)(4)(i)(A)(4) of this section, in determining the exhaust emission 
deterioration factors for each engine-system combination shall be those 
described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A) (1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) All valid exhaust emission data from the tests required under 
Sec. 86.094-26(a)(4) except the zero-mile tests. This shall include the 
official test results, as determined in Sec. 86.094-29 for all tests 
conducted on all durability data vehicles of the combination selected 
under Sec. 86.094-24(c) (including all vehicles elected to be operated 
by the manufacturer under Sec. 86.094-24(c)(1)(ii)).
    (2) All exhaust emission data from the tests conducted before and 
after the scheduled maintenance provided in Sec. 86.094-25.
    (3) All exhaust emission data from tests required by maintenance 
approved under Sec. 86.094-25, in those cases where the Administrator 
conditioned his approval for the performance of such maintenance on the 
inclusion of such data in the deterioration factor calculation.
    (4) The manufacturer has the option of applying an outlier test 
point procedure to completed durability data within its certification 
testing program for a given model year. The outlier procedure will be 
specified by the Administrator. For any pollutant, durability data test 
points that are identified as outliers shall not be included in the 
determination of deterioration factors if the manufacturer has elected 
this option. The manufacturer shall specify to the Administrator before 
the certification of the first engine family for that model year, if it 
intends to use the outlier procedure. The manufacturer may not change 
procedures after the first engine family of the model year is certified. 
Where the manufacturer chooses to apply both the outlier procedure and 
averaging (as allowed under Sec. 86.094-26(a)(6)(i)) to the same data 
set, the outlier procedure shall be completed prior to applying the 
averaging procedure.
    (B)(1) Line crossing. For each exhaust constituent to which a 
standard in Sec. 86.094-8 applies, all applicable exhaust emission 
results shall be rounded to the nearest mile and plotted as a function 
of the mileage on the system. The best fit straight line, fitted by the 
method of least squares, shall be drawn through all these data points. 
The data for a given exhaust constituent will be acceptable for use in 
the calculation of deterioration factors only if the first official test 
point as determined in Sec. 86.094-26(a)(4)(i)(C), the interpolated 
intermediate useful life mile point, and the interpolated full useful 
life mile point on this line, as applicable, are each less than or equal 
to the respective low-altitude standards provided in Sec. 86.094-8. An 
exception to this where data are still acceptable is when a best fit 
straight line crosses an applicable standard but no data points exceeded 
the standard. This exception shall not apply when mileage accumulation 
has been curtailed before the durability useful life has been reached, 
under the provisions of Sec. 86.094-26(a)(4)(i)(B).

[[Page 292]]

    (2) Exhaust deterioration factor determination. Multiplicative 
exhaust emission deterioration factors shall be calculated for each 
standard and for each engine-system combination from points on the 
regression line derived in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(1) of this section, 
and in accordance with paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(B)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) Factor=Exhaust emissions at the useful life mileage for that 
standard divided by exhaust emissions at 4,000 miles.
    (ii) These interpolated values shall be carried out to a minimum of 
four places to the right of the decimal point before dividing one by the 
other to determine the deterioration factor. The results shall be 
rounded to three places to the right of the decimal point in accordance 
with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) (``Standard recommended practice for 
indicating which places of figures are to be considered significant in 
specified limiting values,'' American Society for Testing and 
Materials). This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director 
of the Federal Register in acccordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR 
part 51. Copies may be obtained from American Society for Testing and 
Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103. Copies may be 
inspected at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Air Docket 
Section, room M-1500, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460 
or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., 
suite 700, Washington, DC.
    (iii) When calculating intermediate and full useful life 
deterioration factors all data points should be included in the 
calculations, except that total hydrocarbon (THC) test points beyond the 
50,000-mile (useful life) test point shall not be included in the 
calculations.
    (iv) The calculation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(2) of this 
section may be modified with advance approval of the Administrator for 
engine-system combinations which are certified under the Alternative 
Service Accumulation Durability Program specified in Sec. 86.094-13(e).
    (C) Evaporative deterioration factor determination. An evaporative 
emissions deterioration factor (gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled 
vehicles only) shall be determined from the testing conducted as 
described in Sec. 86.094-21(b)(4)(i) and in accordance with paragraphs 
(a)(4)(i)(C) (1) and (2) of this section, for each evaporative emission 
family-evaporative emission control system combination to indicate the 
evaporative emission level at the applicable useful life relative to the 
evaporative emission level at 4,000 miles.
    (1) Factor=Evaporative emission level at the useful life mileage for 
that standard minus the evaporative emission level at 4,000 miles.
    (2) The factor shall be established to a minimum of two places to 
the right of the decimal.
    (ii)(A)(1) The official exhaust emission test results for each 
applicable exhaust emission standard for each emission data vehicle at 
the selected test point shall be multiplied by the appropriate 
deterioration factor: Provided, That if a deterioration factor as 
computed in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section is less than one, 
that deterioration factor shall be one for the purposes of this 
paragraph.
    (2) The calculation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A)(1) of this 
section may be modified with advance approval of the Administrator for 
engine-system combinations which are certified under the Alternative 
Service Accumulation Durability Program specified in Sec. 86.094-13(e).
    (B) The official evaporative emission test results (gasoline-fueled 
and methanol-fueled vehicles only) for each evaporative emission data 
vehicle at the selected test point shall be adjusted by addition of the 
appropriate deterioration factor, provided that if a deterioration 
factor as computed in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of this section is less 
than zero, that deterioration factor shall be zero for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (iii) The emissions to compare with the standard (or the family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted 
emissions of paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section for each 
emission data vehicle. Before any emission value is compared with the 
standard (or the family particulate emission limit, as appropriate) it 
shall be rounded, in accordance with ASTM

[[Page 293]]

E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section), to two significant figures. The 
rounded emission values may not exceed the standard (or the family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate).
    (iv) Every test vehicle of an engine family must comply with the 
exhaust emission standards (or the family particulate emission limit, as 
appropriate), as determined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, 
before any vehicle in that family may be certified.
    (v) Every test vehicle of an evaporative emission family must comply 
with the evaporative emission standard, as determined in paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii) of this section, before any vehicle in that family may be 
certified.
    (5) If a manufacturer chooses to change the level of any family 
particulate emission limit(s) in the particulate averaging program, 
compliance with the new limit(s) must be based upon existing 
certification data.
    (6) If a manufacturer chooses to participate in the diesel 
particulate averaging program, the production-weighted average of the 
family particulate emission limits of all affected engine families must 
comply with the particulate standards in Sec. 86.094-8(a)(1)(iv), or the 
composite particulate standard defined in Sec. 86.094-2, as appropriate, 
at the end of the production year.
    (7) The procedure to determine the compliance of new motor vehicles 
in the Production AMA Durability Program described in Sec. 86.094-13 is 
the same as described in paragraphs (a)(4) (iii) through (v) of this 
section. For the engine families that are included in the Production AMA 
Durability Program, the exhaust emission deterioration factors used to 
determine compliance shall be those that the Administrator has approved 
under Sec. 86.094-13. The evaporative emission deterioration factor for 
each evaporative emission family shall be determined and applied 
according to paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The procedures to 
determine the minimum exhaust emission deterioration factors required 
under Sec. 86.094-13(d) are as described in paragraphs (a)(7) (i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) Separate deterioration factors shall be determined from the 
exhaust emission results of the durability data vehicles for each 
emission standard applicable under Sec. 86.094-8, for each engine family 
group. The evaporative emission deterioration factor for each 
evaporative family will be determined and applied in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The deterioration factors for each engine family group shall be 
determined by the Administrator using historical durability data from as 
many as three previous model years. These data will consist of 
deterioration factors generated by durability data vehicles representing 
certified engine families and of deterioration factors from vehicles 
selected under Sec. 86.094-24(h) . The Administrator shall determine how 
these data will be combined for each engine family group.
    (A) The test result to be used in the calculation of each 
deterioration factor to be combined for each engine family group shall 
be those test results specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this 
section.
    (B) For each durability data vehicle selected under Sec. 86.094-
24(h), all applicable exhaust emission results shall be plotted as a 
function of the mileage on the system rounded to the nearest mile, and 
the best fit straight lines, fitted by method of least squares, shall be 
drawn through all these data points. The exhaust deterioration factor 
for each durability data vehicle shall be calculated as specified in 
paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
    (C) Line-crossing. The line-crossing criteria of Sec. 86.094-28 
(a)(4)(i)(B) apply.
    (1) The Administrator will not accept for certification line-
crossing data from preproduction durability data vehicles selected under 
Sec. 86.094-24(c).
    (2) The Administrator will not accept for certification line-
crossing data from production durability data vehicles selected under 
Sec. 86.094-24(h)(1) unless the 4,000-mile test result multiplied by the 
engine family group deterioration factor does not exceed the applicable 
emission standards. The deterioration factors used for this purpose 
shall be those that were used in the certification of the production 
vehicle. Manufacturers may calculate this product immediately after the 
4,000-mile test of the vehicle. If the product exceeds the applicable 
standards, the

[[Page 294]]

manufacturer may, with the approval of the Administrator, discontinue 
the vehicle and substitute a new vehicle. The manufacturer may continue 
the original vehicle, but the data will not be acceptable if line 
crossing occurs.
    (b)(1) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to light-duty trucks.
    (2) Each exhaust and evaporative emission standard (and family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate) of Sec. 86.094-9 applies to 
the emissions of vehicles for the appropriate useful life as defined in 
Secs. 86.094-2 and 86.094-9.
    (3) Since emission control efficiency generally decreases with the 
accumulation of mileage on the vehicle, deterioration factors will be 
used in combination with emission data vehicle test results as the basis 
for determining compliance with the standards (or family emission 
limits, as appropriate).
    (4)(i) Paragraph (b)(4) of this section describes the procedure for 
determining compliance of a new vehicle with exhaust emission standards 
(or family emission limits, as appropriate), based on deterioration 
factors. If the manufacturer certifies under the Standard Self-Approval 
Program as specified in Sec. 86.094-13(f), the manufacturer supplies the 
deterioration factors. If the manufacturer certifies under the 
Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Program as specified in 
Sec. 86.094-13(e), the applicable procedure for the determination of 
deterioration factors for light-duty trucks is the same as that 
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section for light-duty vehicles.
    (ii) Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors, determined 
from tests of vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components conducted by 
the manufacturer, shall be supplied for each standard and for each 
engine-system combination.
    (iii) The official exhaust emission results for each applicable 
exhaust emission standard for each emission data vehicle at the selected 
test point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate 
deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by 
the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (iv) The emission values to compare with the standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted emission values 
of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section rounded to two significant 
figures in accordance with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced 
in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section) for each emission data 
engine.
    (5)(i) Paragraphs (b)(5)(i) (A) and (B) of this section apply only 
to manufacturers electing to participate in the particulate averaging 
program.
    (A) If a manufacturer chooses to change the level of any family 
particulate emission limit(s), compliance with the new limit(s) must be 
based upon existing certification data.
    (B) The production-weighted average of the family particulate 
emission limits of all applicable engine families, rounded to two 
significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) 
(as referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section), must 
comply with the particulate standards in Sec. 86.094-9(a)(1)(iv) or 
(d)(1)(iv), or the composite particulate standard as defined in 
Sec. 86.094-2, as appropriate, at the end of the product year.
    (ii) Paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section apply only to 
manufacturers electing to participate in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging 
program.
    (A) If a manufacturer chooses to change the level of any family 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit(s), compliance with the new limit(s) must 
be based upon existing certification data.
    (B) The production-weighted average of the family NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission limits of all applicable engine families, rounded to two 
significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) 
(as referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section), must 
comply with the NO<INF>X</INF> emission standards of Sec. 86.094-
9(a)(1)(iii) (A) or (B) of Sec. 86.094-9(d)(1)(iii) (A) or (B), or the 
composite NO<INF>X</INF> standard as defined in Sec. 86.094-2, at the 
end of the product year.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (7)(i) Paragraph (b)(7) of this section describes the procedure for 
determining compliance of a new vehicle with evaporative emission 
standards.

[[Page 295]]

The procedure described here shall be used for all vehicles in all model 
years.
    (ii) The manufacturer shall determine, based on testing described in 
Sec. 86.091-21(b)(4)(i), and supply an evaporative emission 
deterioration factor for each evaporative emission family-evaporative 
emission control system combination. The factor shall be calculated by 
subtracting the emission level at the selected test point from the 
emission level at the useful life point.
    (iii) The official evaporative emission test results for each 
evaporative emission data vehicle at the selected test point shall be 
adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. 
However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is 
less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (iv) The emission value to compare with the standards shall be the 
adjusted emission value of paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section rounded 
to two significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 
1980) (as referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section) 
for each evaporative emission data vehicle.
    (8) Every test vehicle of an engine family must comply with all 
applicable standards (and family emission limits, as appropriate), as 
determined in paragraphs (b)(4)(iv) and (b)(7)(iv) of this section, 
before any vehicle in that family will be certified.
    (c)(1) Paragraph (c) of this section applies to heavy-duty engines.
    (2) The exhaust emission standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate) for Otto-cycle engines in Sec. 86.094-10 or for diesel-
cycle engines in Sec. 86.094-11 apply to the emissions of engines for 
their useful life.
    (3) Since emission control efficiency generally decreases with the 
accumulation of service on the engine, deterioration factors will be 
used in combination with emission data engine test results as the basis 
for determining compliance with the standards.
    (4)(i) Paragraph (c)(4) of this section describes the procedure for 
determining compliance of an engine with emission standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate), based on deterioration factors 
supplied by the manufacturer.
    (ii) Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors, determined 
from tests of engines, subsystems, or components conducted by the 
manufacturer, shall be supplied for each engine-system combination. For 
Otto-cycle engines, separate factors shall be established for transient 
HC (THCE), CO, and NO<INF>X</INF>; and idle CO, for those engines 
utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., catalytic converters). For 
diesel-cycle engines, separate factors shall be established for 
transient HC (THCE), CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, and exhaust particulate. For 
diesel-cycle smoke testing, separate factors shall also be established 
for the acceleration mode (designated as ``A''), the lugging mode 
(designated as ``B''), and peak opacity (designated as ``C'').
    (iii)(A) Paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) (1) and (2) of this section apply 
to Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines.
    (1) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines not utilizing aftertreatment 
technology (e.g., catalytic converters). For transient HC (THCE), CO, 
and NO<INF>X</INF>, the official exhaust emission results for each 
emission data engine at the selected test point shall be adjusted by the 
addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the 
deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it 
shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (2) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines utilizing aftertreatment 
technology (e.g., catalytic converters). For transient HC (THCE), CO, 
and NO<INF>X</INF>, and for idle CO, the official exhaust emission 
results for each emission data engine at the selected test point shall 
be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate deterioration factor. 
However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is 
less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (B) Paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section applies to diesel-cycle 
heavy-duty engines.
    (1) Diesel-cycle heavy-duty engines not utilizing aftertreatment 
technology (e.g., particulate traps). For transient HC (THCE), CO, 
NO<INF>X</INF>, and exhaust particulate, the official exhaust emission 
results for each emission data engine at the selected test point shall 
be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. 
However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the

[[Page 296]]

manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (2) Diesel-cycle heavy-duty engines utilizing aftertreatment 
technology (e.g., particulate traps). For transient HC (THCE), CO, 
NO<INF>X</INF>, and exhaust particulate, the official exhaust emission 
results for each emission data engine at the selected test point shall 
be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate deterioration factor. 
However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is 
less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (3) Diesel-cycle heavy-duty engines only. For acceleration smoke 
(``A''), lugging smoke (``B''), and peak smoke (``C''), the official 
exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at the selected 
test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate 
deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by 
the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (iv) The emission values to compare with the standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted emission values 
of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, rounded to the same number of 
significant figures as contained in the applicable standard in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in 
paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section), for each emission data 
engine.
    (5)-(6) [Reserved]
    (7) Every test engine of an engine family must comply with all 
applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), as 
determined in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, before any engine in 
that family will be certified.
    (d)(1) Paragraph (d) of this section applies to heavy-duty vehicles 
equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled engines.
    (2) The applicable evaporative emission standard in Sec. 86.091-10 
or Sec. 86.094-11 applies to the emissions of vehicles for their useful 
life.
    (3)(i) For vehicles with a GVWR of up to 26,000 pounds, because it 
is expected that emission control efficiency will change during the 
useful life of the vehicle, an evaporative emission deterioration factor 
shall be determined from the testing described in Sec. 86.088-23(b)(3) 
for each evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combination to indicate the evaporative emission control system 
deterioration during the useful life of the vehicle (minimum 50,000 
miles). The factor shall be established to a minimum of two places to 
the right of the decimal.
    (ii) For vehicles with a GVWR of greater than 26,000 pounds, because 
it is expected that emission control efficiency will change during the 
useful life of the vehicle, each manufacturer's statement as required in 
Sec. 86.094-23(b) (4) (ii) shall include, in accordance with good 
engineering practice, consideration of control system deterioration.
    (4) The evaporative emission test results, if any, shall be adjusted 
by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor, provided that 
if the deterioration factor as computed in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section is less than zero, that deterioration factor shall be zero for 
the purposes of this paragraph.
    (5) The emission level to compare with the standard shall be the 
adjusted emission level of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Before any 
emission value is compared with the standard, it shall be rounded, in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in 
paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section), to two significant 
figures. The rounded emission values may not exceed the standard.
    (6) Every test vehicle of an evaporative emission family must comply 
with the evaporative emission standard, as determined in paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, before any vehicle in that family may be 
certified.

Sec. 86.094-30  Certification.

    (a)(1)(i) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted 
by the manufacturer, data derived from any inspection carried out under 
Sec. 86.091-

[[Page 297]]

7(c) and any other pertinent data or information, the Administrator 
determines that a test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) meets the 
requirements of the Act and of this subpart, he will issue a certificate 
of conformity with respect to such vehicle(s) (or engine(s)) except in 
cases covered by paragraphs (a) (1) (ii) and (c) of this section.
    (ii) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles. If, 
after a review of the statement(s) of compliance submitted by the 
manufacturer under Sec. 86.094-23(b)(4) and any other pertinent data or 
information, the Administrator determines that the requirements of the 
Act and this subpart have been met, he will issue one certificate of 
conformity per manufacturer with respect to the evaporative emission 
family(ies) covered by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Such certificate will be issued for such period not to exceed 
one model year as the Administrator may determine and upon such terms as 
he may deem necessary or appropriate to assure that any new motor 
vehicle (or new motor vehicle engine) covered by the certificate will 
meet the requirements of the Act and of this part.
    (3)(i) One such certificate will be issued for each engine family. 
For gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-
duty trucks, one such certificate will be issued for each engine family 
evaporative emission family combination.
    (A) Light-duty vehicles. Each certificate will certify compliance 
with no more than one set of in-use and certification standards (or 
family emission limits, as appropriate).
    (B) Light-duty trucks. Each certificate will certify compliance with 
no more than one set of in-use and certification standards (or family 
emission limits, as appropriate), except where there are both low-
altitude standards and high altitude standards applicable. The 
certificate shall state that it covers vehicles sold or delivered to an 
ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated high-altitude 
location only if the vehicle conforms in all material respects to the 
design specifications that apply to those vehicles described in the 
application for certification at high altitude.
    (ii) For gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles, 
one such certificate will be issued for each manufacturer and will 
certify compliance for those vehicles previously identified in that 
manufacturer's statement(s) of compliance as required in Sec. 86.094-
23(b)(4) (i) and (ii).
    (iii) For diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, or 
diesel-cycle heavy-duty engines, included in the applicable particulate 
averaging program, the manufacturer may at any time during production 
elect to change the level of any family particulate emission limit by 
demonstrating compliance with the new limit as described in 
Secs. 86.094-28(a)(6) and 86.094-28(b)(5)(i) . New certificates issued 
under this paragraph will be applicable only for vehicles (or engines) 
produced subsequent to the date of issuance.
    (iv) For light-duty trucks or heavy-duty engines included in the 
applicable NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program, the manufacturer may at any 
time during production elect to change the level of any family 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit by demonstrating compliance with the new 
limit as described in Sec. 86.094-28(b)(5)(ii). New certificates issued 
under this paragraph will be applicable only for vehicles (or engines) 
produced subsequent to the day of issue.
    (4)(i) The adjustment or modification of any light-duty truck in 
accordance with instructions provided by the manufacturer for the 
altitude where the vehicle is principally used will not be considered a 
violation of section 203(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7522 
(a)(3)).
    (ii) A violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7522(a)(1)) occurs when a manufacturer sells or delivers to an 
ultimate purchaser any light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck, subject 
to the regulations under the Act, under any of the conditions specified 
in the remainder of this paragraph.
    (A) When a light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck is not configured 
to meet high-altitude requirements:
    (1) At a designated high-altitude location, unless such manufacturer 
has reason to believe that such vehicle will not be sold to an ultimate 
purchaser for principal use at a designated high-altitude location; or

[[Page 298]]

    (2) At a location other than a designated high-altitude location, 
when such manufacturer has reason to believe that such motor vehicle 
will be sold to an ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated 
high-altitude location.
    (B) When a light-duty vehicle is not configured to meet low-altitude 
requirements, as provided in Sec. 86.094-8(i) :
    (1) At a designated low-altitude location, unless such manufacturer 
has reason to believe that such vehicle will not be sold to an ultimate 
purchaser for principal use at a designated low-altitude location; or
    (2) At a location other than a designated low-altitude location, 
when such manufacturer has reason to believe that such motor vehicle 
will be sold to an ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated 
low-altitude location.
    (iii) A manufacturer shall be deemed to have reason to believe that 
a light-duty vehicle that has been exempted from compliance with 
emission standards at high-altitude, or a light-duty truck which is not 
configured to meet high-altitude requirements, will not be sold to an 
ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated high-altitude 
location if the manufacturer has informed its dealers and field 
representatives about the terms of these high-altitude regulations, has 
not caused the improper sale itself, and has taken reasonable action 
which shall include, but not be limited to, either paragraph (a)(4)(iii) 
(A) or (B), and paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(C) of this section:
    (A) Requiring dealers in designated high-altitude locations to 
submit written statements to the manufacturer signed by the ultimate 
purchaser that a vehicle which is not configured to meet high-altitude 
requirements will not be used principally at a designated high-altitude 
location; requiring dealers in counties contiguous to designated high-
altitude locations to submit written statements to the manufacturer, 
signed by the ultimate purchaser who represents to the dealer in the 
normal course of business that he or she resides in a designated high-
altitude location, that a vehicle which is not configured to meet high-
altitude requirements will not be used principally at a designated high-
altitude location; and for each sale or delivery of fleets of ten or 
more such vehicles in a high-altitude location or in counties contiguous 
to high-altitude locations, requiring either the selling dealer or the 
delivering dealer to submit written statements to the manufacturer, 
signed by the ultimate purchaser who represents to the dealer in the 
normal course of business that he or she resides in a designated high-

altitude requirements will not be used principally at a designated high-
altitude location. In addition, the manufacturer will make available to 
EPA, upon reasonable written request (but not more frequently than 
quarterly, unless EPA has demonstrated that it has substantial reason to 
believe that an improperly configured vehicle has been sold), sales, 
warranty, or other information pertaining to sales of vehicles by the 
dealers described above maintained by the manufacturer in the normal 
course of business relating to the altitude configuration of vehicles 
and the locations of ultimate purchasers; or
    (B) Implementing a system which monitors factory orders of low-
altitude vehicles by high-altitude dealers, or through other means, 
identifies dealers that may have sold or delivered a vehicle not 
configured to meet the high-altitude requirements to an ultimate 
purchaser for principal use at a designated high-altitude location; and 
making such information available to EPA upon reasonable written request 
(but not more frequently than quarterly, unless EPA has demonstrated 
that it has substantial reason to believe that an improperly configured 
vehicle has been sold); and
    (C) Within a reasonable time after receiving written notice from EPA 
or a State or local government agency that a dealer may have improperly 
sold or delivered a vehicle not configured to meet the high-altitude 
requirements to an ultimate purchaser residing in a designated high-
altitude location, or based on information obtained pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section that a dealer may have improperly 
sold or delivered a significant number of such vehicles to ultimate 
purchasers

[[Page 299]]

so residing, reminding the dealer in writing of the requirements of 
these regulations, and, where appropriate, warning the dealer that sale 
by the dealer of vehicles not configured to meet high-altitude 
requirements may be contrary to the terms of its franchise agreement 
with the manufacturer and the dealer certification requirements of 
Sec. 85.2108 of this chapter.
    (iv) A manufacturer shall be deemed to have reason to believe that a 
light-duty vehicle which has been exempted from compliance with emission 
standards at low-altitude, as provided in Sec. 86.094-8(i), will not be 
sold to an ultimate purchaser for principal use at a designated low-
altitude location if the manufacturer has informed its dealers and field 
representatives about the terms of the high-altitude regulations, has 
not caused the improper sale itself, and has taken reasonable action 
which shall include, but not be limited to, either paragraph (a)(4)(iv) 
(A) or (B), and (a)(4)(iv)(C) of this section:
    (A) Requiring dealers in designated low-altitude locations to submit 
written statements to the manufacturer signed by the ultimate purchaser 
that a vehicle which is not configured to meet low-altitude requirements 
will not be used principally at a designated low-altitude location; 
requiring dealers in counties contiguous to designated low-altitude 
locations to submit written statements to the manufacturer, signed by 
the ultimate purchaser who represents to the dealer in the normal course 
of business that he or she resides in a designated low-altitude

altitude requirements will not be used principally at a designated high-
altitude location. In addition, the manufacturer will make available to 
EPA, upon reasonable written request (but not more frequently than 
quarterly, unless EPA has demonstrated that it has substantial reason to 
believe that an improperly configured vehicle has been sold), sales, 
warranty, or other information pertaining to sales of vehicles by the 
dealers described above maintained by the manufacturer in the normal 
course of business relating to the altitude configuration of vehicles 
and the locations of ultimate purchasers; or
    (B) Implementing a system which monitors factory orders of high-
altitude vehicles by low-altitude dealers, or through other means, 
identifies dealers that may have sold or delivered a vehicle not 
configured to meet the low-altitude requirements to an ultimate

    (2) The Administrator will proceed as in paragraph (a) of this 
section with respect to the vehicles (or engines) belonging to an engine 
family or engine family-evaporative emission family combination (as 
applicable), all of which comply with all applicable standards (or 
family emission limits, as appropriate).
    (3) If after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the 
manufacturer, data derived from any additional testing conducted 
pursuant to Sec. 86.091-29, data or information derived from any 
inspection carried out under Sec. 86.094-7(d) or any other pertinent 
data or information, the Administrator determines that one or more test 
vehicles (or test engines) of the certification test fleet do not meet 
applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), he 
will notify the manufacturer in writing, setting forth the basis for his 
determination. Within 30 days following receipt of the notification, the 
manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determination. 
The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative 
of the manufacturer and shall include a statement specifying the 
manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determination and data 
in support of such objections. If, after a review of the request and 
supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a 
substantial factual issue, he shall provide the manufacturer a hearing 
in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to such issue.
    (4) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the manufacturer 
may, at its option, proceed with any of the following alternatives with 
respect to an emission data vehicle determined not in compliance with 
all applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) for 
which it was tested:
    (i) Request a hearing under Sec. 86.078-6; or
    (ii) Remove the vehicle configuration (or evaporative vehicle 
configuration, as applicable) which failed, from his application:
    (A) If the failed vehicle was tested for compliance with exhaust 
emission standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) only: The 
Administrator may select, in place of the failed vehicle, in accordance 
with the selection criteria employed in selecting the

[[Page 304]]

failed vehicle, a new emission data vehicle to be tested for exhaust 
emission compliance only; or
    (B) If the failed vehicle was tested for compliance with both 
exhaust and evaporative emission standards: The Administrator may 
select, in place of the failed vehicle, in accordance with the selection 
criteria employed in selecting the failed vehicle, a new emission data 
vehicle which will be tested for compliance with both exhaust and 
evaporative emission standards. If one vehicle cannot be selected in 
accordance with the selection criteria employed in selecting the failed 
vehicle, then two vehicles may be selected (i.e., one vehicle to satisfy 
the exhaust emission vehicle selection criteria and one vehicle to 
satisfy the evaporative emission vehicle selection criteria). The 
vehicle selected to satisfy the exhaust emission vehicle selection 
criteria will be tested for compliance with exhaust emission standards 
(or family emission limits, as appropriate) only. The vehicle selected 
to satisfy the evaporative emission vehicle selection criteria will be 
tested for compliance with both exhaust and evaporative emission 
standards; or
    (iii) Remove the vehicle configuration (or evaporative vehicle 
configuration, as applicable) which failed from the application and add 
a vehicle configuration(s) (or evaporative vehicle configuration(s), as 
applicable) not previously listed. The Administrator may require, if 
applicable, that the failed vehicle be modified to the new engine code 
(or evaporative emission code, as applicable) and demonstrate by testing 
that it meets applicable standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate) for which it was originally tested. In addition, the 
Administrator may select, in accordance with the vehicle selection 
criteria given in Sec. 86.094-24(b), a new emission data vehicle or 
vehicles. The vehicles selected to satisfy the exhaust emission vehicle 
selection criteria will be tested for compliance with exhaust emission 
standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) only. The vehicles 
selected to satisfy the evaporative emission vehicle selection criteria 
will be tested for compliance with both exhaust and evaporative emission 
standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate); or
    (iv) Correct a component or system malfunction and show that with a 
correctly functioning system or component the failed vehicle meets 
applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) for 
which it was originally tested. The Administrator may require a new 
emission data vehicle, of identical vehicle configuration (or 
evaporative vehicle configuration, as applicable) to the failed vehicle, 
to be operated and tested for compliance with the applicable standards 
(or family emission limits, as appropriate) for which the failed vehicle 
was originally tested.
    (5) For heavy-duty engines the manufacturer may, at his option, 
proceed with any of the following alternatives with respect to any 
engine family represented by a test engine (s) determined not in 
compliance with applicable standards (or family emission limit, as 
appropriate):
    (i) Request a hearing under Sec. 86.078-6; or
    (ii) Delete from the application for certification the engines 
represented by the failing test engine. (Engines so deleted may be 
included in a later request for certification under Sec. 86.079-32.) The 
Administrator may then select in place of each failing engine an 
alternate engine chosen in accordance with selection criteria employed 
in selecting the engine that failed; or
    (iii) Modify the test engine and demonstrate by testing that it 
meets applicable standards. Another engine which is in all material 
respect the same as the first engine, as modified, may then be operated 
and tested in accordance with applicable test procedures.
    (6) If the manufacturer does not request a hearing or present the 
required data under paragraphs (b) (4) or (5) of this section (as 
applicable) of this section, the Administrator will deny certification.
    (c)(1) Notwithstanding the fact that any certification vehicle(s) 
(or certification engine(s)) may comply with other provisions of this 
subpart, the Administrator may withhold or deny the issuance of a 
certificate of conformity (or suspend or revoke any such certificate 
which has been issued) with

[[Page 305]]

respect to any such vehicle(s) (or engine(s)) if:
    (i) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in his 
application for certification thereof;
    (ii) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which he 
submits pertaining thereto or otherwise circumvents the intent of the 
Act, or of this part with respect to such vehicle (or engine);
    (iii) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied access on the terms 
specified in Sec. 86.091-7(d) to any facility or portion thereof which 
contains any of the following:

    (B) Any components used or considered for use in its modification or 
buildup into a certification vehicle (or certification engine);
    (C) Any production vehicle (or production engine) which is or will 
be claimed by the manufacturer to be covered by the certificate;
    (D) Any step in the construction of a vehicle (or engine) described 
in paragraph (c)(iii)(C) of this section;
    (E) Any records, documents, reports, or histories required by this 
part to be kept concerning any of the above; or
    (iv) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied ``reasonable assistance'' 
(as defined in Sec. 86.091-7(d) in examining any of the items listed in 
paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) The sanctions of withholding, denying, revoking, or suspending 
of a certificate may be imposed for the reasons in paragraphs (c)(1) 
(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section only when the infraction is 
substantial.
    (3) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submits false or 
inaccurate information or knowingly renders inaccurate or invalid any 
test data or commits any other fraudulent acts and such acts contribute 
substantially to the Administrator's decision to issue a certificate of 
conformity, the Administrator may deem such certificate void ab initio.
    (4) In any case in which certification of a vehicle (or engine) is 
proposed to be withheld, denied, revoked, or suspended under paragraph 
(c)(1) (iii) or (iv) of this section, and in which the Administrator has 
presented to the manufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a 
violation of Sec. 86.091-7(d) in fact occurred, the manufacturer, if he 
wishes to contend that, even though the violation occurred, the vehicle 
(or engine) in question was not involved in the violation to a degree 
that would warrant withholding, denial, revocation, or suspension of 
certification under either paragraph (c)(1) (iii) or (iv) of this 
section, shall have the burden of establishing that contention to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator.
    (5) Any revocation or suspension of certification under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section shall:
    (i) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered 
an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 
hereof; and
    (ii) Extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce 
of vehicles (or engines) previously covered by the certification which 
are still in the hands of the manufacturer, except in cases of such 
fraud or other misconduct as makes the certification invalid ab initio.
    (6) The manufacturer may request in the form and manner specified in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section that any determination made by the 
Administrator under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to withhold or deny 
certification be reviewed in a hearing conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 86.078-6. If the Administrator finds, after a review of the request 
and supporting data, that the request raises a substantial factual 
issue, he will grant the request with respect to such issue.
    (d)(1) For light-duty vehicles. Notwithstanding the fact that any 
vehicle configuration or engine family may be covered by a valid 
outstanding certificate of conformity, the Administrator may suspend 
such outstanding certificate of conformity in whole or in part with 
respect to such vehicle configuration or engine family if:
    (i) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test 
order issued by the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 86.603; or
    (ii) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements 
of Sec. 86.603; or

[[Page 306]]

    (iii) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in 
any report or information provided pursuant to the requirements of 
Sec. 86.609; or
    (iv) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which he

activities related to entry and access as authorized in Sec. 86.606 of 
this part and in a warrant or court order presented to the manufacturer 
or the party in charge of a facility in question; or
    (vi) EPA Enforcement Officers are unable to conduct activities 
related to entry and access or to obtain ``reasonable assistance'' as 
authorized in Sec. 86.606 of this part because a manufacturer has 
located its facility in a foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits 
those activities; or
    (vii) The manufacturer refuses to or in fact does not comply with 
Sec. 86.604(a), Sec. 86.605, Sec. 86.607, Sec. 86.608, or Sec. 86.610.
    (2) The sanction of suspending a certificate may not be imposed for 
the reasons in paragraph (d)(1) (i), (ii), or (vii) of this section 
where the refusal is caused by conditions and circumstances outside the 
control of the manufacturer which render it impossible to comply with 
those requirements.
    (3) The sanction of suspending a certificate may be imposed for the 
reasons in paragraph (d)(1) (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section only 
when the infraction is substantial.
    (4) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submitted false or 
inaccurate information or knowingly rendered inaccurate any test data or 
committed any other fraudulent acts, and such acts contributed 
substantially to the Administrator's original decision not to suspend or 
revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part, the 
Administrator may deem such certificate void from the date of such 
fraudulent act.
    (5) In any case in which certification of a vehicle is proposed to 
be suspended under paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section and in which the 
Administrator has presented to the manufacturer involved reasonable 
evidence that a violation of Sec. 86.606 in fact occurred, if the 
manufacturer wishes to contend that, although the violation occurred, 
the vehicle configuration or engine family in question was not involved 
in the violation to a degree that would warrant suspension of 
certification under paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section, the 
manufacturer shall have the burden of establishing the contention to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator.
    (6) Any suspension of certification under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall:
    (i) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered 
an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.614; 
and
    (ii) Not apply to vehicles no longer in the hands of the 
manufacturer.
    (7) Any voiding of a certificate of conformity under paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section will be made only after the manufacturer 
concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in 
accordance with Sec. 86.614.
    (8) Any voiding of the certificate under Sec. 86.091-30(a)(10) will 
be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an 
opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.614.
    (e) For light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines. (1)

    (2) The sanction of suspending a certificate may not be imposed for 
the reasons in paragraph (e)(1) (i), (ii), or (vii) of this section 
where such refusal or denial is caused by conditions and circumstances 
outside the control of the manufacturer which renders it impossible to 
comply with those requirements. Such conditions and circumstances shall 
include, but are not limited to, any uncontrollable factors which result 
in the temporary unavailability of equipment and personnel needed to 
conduct the required tests, such as equipment breakdown or failure or 
illness of personnel, but shall not include failure of the manufacturers 
to adequately plan for and provide the equipment and personnel needed to 
conduct the tests. The manufacturer will bear the burden of establishing 
the presence of the conditions and circumstances required by this 
paragraph.
    (3) The sanction of suspending a certificate may be imposed for the 
reasons outlined in paragraph (e)(1) (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section 
only when the infraction is substantial.
    (4) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submitted false or

complying with all provisions of Secs. 86.094-9 and 86.709-94 both 
during and after model year production.
    (ii) Failure to meet the required implementation schedule sales 
percentages as specified in Secs. 86.094-9 and 86.709-94 will be 
considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the 
certificate(s) was issued and the individual vehicles sold in violation 
of the implementation schedule shall not be covered by the certificate.
    (iii) The manufacturer shall bear the burden of establishing to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the

or electronic simulation of such resulting in both an exhaust emission 
exceedance of 0.6 g/mi HC and an exhaust emission increase of 0.4 g/mi 
HC on a normal temperature (20 to 30  deg.C) emission certification 
test.
    (2) A misfire condition is induced resulting in an increase in 
emissions of greater than 0.4 g/mi HC or 3.4 g/mi CO or 1.0 g/mi 
NO<INF>X</INF> on a normal temperature (20 to 30  deg.C) emission 
certification test.
    (3) Any oxygen sensor is replaced with a deteriorated or defective 
oxygen sensor, or the operation of such a sensor is simulated, resulting 
in an increase in emissions of 0.2 g/mi HC or 1.7 g/mi CO or 0.5 g/mi 
NO<INF>X</INF> on a normal temperature (20 to 30  deg.C) emission 
certification test.
    (4) The electronic evaporative purge control device (if equipped) is 
disconnected or the operation of any emission-related powertrain 
component connected to a computer results in an increase in emissions of 
0.2 g/mi HC or 1.7 g/mi CO or 0.5 g/mi NO<INF>X</INF> on a normal

    (iii) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b)(1) 
and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedule of table A96-15 of 
this section for model years 1996, 1997, and 1998. For small volume 
manufacturers, the standards of Sec. 86.090-8(b), and the associated 
test procedures, continue to apply until model year 1999, when 100 
percent compliance with the standards of this section is required. This 
exemption does not apply to small volume engine families as defined in 
Sec. 86.092-14(b)(5).
    (iv) For the 1996 model year, manufacturers may satisfy the testing 
requirements for federal certification to the evaporative standards of 
paragraph (b) of this section, except the fuel dispensing spitback test, 
by presenting test results from the certification procedures defined by 
the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Evaporative 
Emissions Program (January 4, 1995). These requirements have been 
incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1).
    (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient 
atmosphere from any 1996 and later model year Otto-cycle, or methanol-or 
gaseous-fueled diesel light-duty vehicle. This requirement is optional 
for 1996 model year gaseous-fueled light-duty vehicles.
    (d)-(f) [Reserved]
    (g) Any 1994 and later model year light-duty vehicle that a 
manufacturer wishes to certify for sale shall meet the emission 
standards under both low- and high-altitude conditions as specified in 
Sec. 86.082-2, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this 
section. Vehicles shall meet emission standards under both low- and 
high-altitude conditions without manual adjustments or modifications. 
Any emission control device used to meet emission standards under high-
altitude conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher 
than 4,000 feet above sea level.
    (h) The manufacturer may exempt 1994 and later model year vehicles 
from compliance at high altitude with the emission standards set forth 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if the vehicles are not 
intended for sale at high altitude and if the requirements of paragraphs 
(h) (1) and (2) of this section are met.
    (1) A vehicle configuration shall only be considered eligible for 
exemption under paragraph (h) of this section if

[[Page 335]]

the requirements of either paragraph (h)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of 
this section are met.
    (i) Its design parameters (displacement-to-weight ratio (D/W) and 
engine speed-to-vehicle-speed ratio (N/V)) fall within the exempted 
range for that manufacturer for that year. The exempted range is 
determined according to the following procedure:
    (A) The manufacturer shall graphically display the D/W and N/V data 
of all vehicle configurations it will offer for the model year in 
question. The axis of the abscissa shall be D/W (where (D) is the engine 
displacement expressed in cubic centimeters and (W) is the equivalent 
vehicle test weight expressed in pounds), and the axis of the ordinate 
shall be N/V (where (N) is the crankshaft speed expressed in revolutions 
per minute and (V) is the vehicle speed expressed in miles per hour). At 
the manufacturer's option, either the 1:1 transmission gear ratio or the 
lowest numerical gear ratio available in the transmission will be used 
to determine N/V. The gear selection must be the same for all N/V data 
points on the manufacturer's graph. For each transmission/axle ratio 
combination, only the lowest N/V value shall be used in the graphical 
display.
    (B) The product line is then defined by the equation, N/V=C(D/
W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>, where the constant, C, is determined by the 
requirement that all the vehicle data points either fall on the line or 
lie to the upper right of the line as displayed on the graphs.
    (C) The exemption line is then defined by the equation, N/V=C(0.84 
D/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>, where the constant, C is the same as that found in 
paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (D) The exempted range includes all values of N/V and D/W which 
simultaneously fall to the lower left of the exemption line as drawn on 
the graph.
    (ii) Its design parameters fall within the alternate exempted range 
for that manufacturer that year. The alternate exempted range is 
determined by substituting rated horsepower (hp) for displacement (D) in 
the exemption procedure described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section 
and by using the product line N/V=C(hp/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>.
    (A) Rated horsepower shall be determined by using the Society of 
Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J 1349, June 1990, Engine Power Test 
Code--Spark Ignition and Compression Ignition--Net Power Rating. This 
incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal 
Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies 
may be obtained from SAE International, 400 Commonwealth Drive, 
Warrendale, PA, 15096-0001. Copies may be inspected at U.S. EPA, OAR, 
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, or at the Office of the Federal 
Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Any 
of the horsepower determinants within that test procedure may be used, 
as long as it is used consistently throughout the manufacturer's product 
line in any model year.
    (B) No exemptions will be allowed under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this 
section to any manufacturer that has exempted vehicle configurations as 
set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Its acceleration time (the time it takes a vehicle to 
accelerate from 0 miles per hour to a speed not less than 40 miles per 
hour and not greater than 50 miles per hour) under high-altitude 
conditions is greater than the largest acceleration time under low-
altitude conditions for that manufacturer for that year. The procedure 
to be followed in making this determination is:
    (A) The manufacturer shall list the vehicle configuration and 
acceleration time under low-altitude conditions of that vehicle 
configuration which has the highest acceleration time under low-altitude 
conditions of all the vehicle configurations it will offer for the model 
year in question. The manufacturer shall also submit a description of 
the methodology used to make this determination.
    (B) The manufacturer shall then list the vehicle configurations and 
acceleration times under high-altitude conditions of all those vehicle 
configurations which have higher acceleration times under high-altitude 
conditions than the highest acceleration time at low altitude identified 
in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.

[[Page 336]]

    (iv) In lieu of performing the test procedure of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section, its acceleration time can be 
estimated based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation, in 
accordance with good engineering practice, to meet the exemption 
criteria of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) A vehicle shall only be considered eligible for exemption under 
this paragraph if at least one configuration of its model type (and 
transmission configuration in the case of vehicles equipped with manual 
transmissions, excluding differences due to the presence of overdrive) 
is certified to meet emission standards under high-altitude conditions 
as specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) and paragraph (g) of this 
section. The Certificate of Conformity (the Certificate) covering any 
exempted configuration(s) will also apply to the corresponding non-
exempt configuration(s) required under this paragraph (h)(2). As a 
condition to the exemption, any suspension, revocation, voiding, or 
withdrawal of the Certificate as it applies to a non-exempt 
configuration for any reason will result in a suspension of the 
Certificate as it applies to the corresponding exempted configuration(s) 
of that model type, unless there is at least one other corresponding 
non-exempt configuration of the same model type still covered by the 
Certificate. The suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
exempted configuration(s) will be terminated when any one of the 
following occurs:
    (i) Another corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) receive(s) 
coverage under the Certificate; or
    (ii) Suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) is terminated; or
    (iii) The Agency's action(s), with respect to suspension, 
revocation, voiding, or withdrawal of the Certificate as it applies to 
the corresponding non-exempt configuration(s), is reversed.
    (3) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at a designated high-
altitude location that has been exempted as set forth in paragraph (h) 
of this section will be considered a violation of section 203(a)(1) of 
the Clean Air Act.
    (i)(1) The manufacturers may exempt 1996 and later model year 
vehicles from compliance at low altitude with the emission standards set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 86.090-8(b) if the 
vehicles:
    (i) Are not intended for sale at low altitude; and
    (ii) Are equipped with a unique, high-altitude axle ratio (rear-
wheel drive vehicles) or a unique, high-altitude drivetrain (front-wheel 
drive vehicles) with a higher N/V ratio than other configurations of 
that model type which are certified in compliance with the emission 
standards of paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 86.090-8(b) under 
low-altitude conditions.
    (2) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at low altitude that has 
been exempted as set forth in paragraph (i)(1) of this section will be 
considered a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act.
    (j) Any exempted light-duty vehicle that a manufacturer wishes to 
certify for sale under the provisions of Sec. 86.090-8 (h) or paragraph 
(i) of this section is subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this 
part.
    (k) Cold Temperature Carbon Monoxide (CO) Standards--Light-Duty 
Vehicles. Exhaust emissions from 1996 and later model year gasoline-
fueled light-duty vehicles shall not exceed the cold temperature CO 
standard of 10.0 grams per mile for an intermediate useful life of 
50,000 miles, as measured and calculated under the provisions set forth 
in subpart C of this part. This standard applies under both low and high 
altitude conditions.

Sec. 86.096-24  Test vehicles and engines.

    (a) General. This paragraph applies to the grouping of vehicles or 
engines into families.
    (1) The vehicles or engines covered by an application for 
certification will be divided into groupings of engines which are 
expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their 
useful life. Each group of engines with similar emission characteristics 
is defined as a separate engine family.
    (2) To be classed in the same engine family, engines must be 
identical in all the respects listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through 
(x) of this section.
    (i) The cylinder bore center-to-center dimensions.
    (ii) through (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) The cylinder block configuration (air-cooled or water-cooled: 
L-6, 90 deg., V-8, and so forth).
    (v) The location of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
    (vi) The method of air aspiration.
    (vii) The combustion cycle.
    (viii) Catalytic converter characteristics.
    (ix) Thermal reactor characteristics.
    (x) Type of air inlet cooler (for example, intercoolers and after-
coolers) for diesel heavy-duty engines.
    (3)(i) Engines identical in all the respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section may be further divided into different engine 
families if the Administrator determines that they may be expected to 
have different emission characteristics. This determination will be 
based upon a consideration of the features of each engine listed in 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i) (A) through (G) of this section.
    (A) The bore and stroke.
    (B) The surface-to-volume ratio of the nominally dimensioned 
cylinder at the top dead center positions.
    (C) The intake manifold induction port sizes and configuration.
    (D) The exhaust manifold port size and configuration.
    (E) The intake and exhaust valve sizes.
    (F) The fuel system.
    (G) The camshaft timing and ignition or injection timing 
characteristics.
    (ii) Light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines produced in different 
model years and distinguishable in the respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section are treated as belonging to a single engine 
family if the Administrator requires it, after determining that the 
engines may be expected to have similar emission deterioration 
characteristics.
    (4) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine 
families based upon the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of 
this section, the Administrator establishes families for those engines 
based upon those features most related to their emission 
characteristics. Engines that are eligible to be included in the same 
engine family based on the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) 
of this section may be further divided into different

[[Page 344]]

engine families if the manufacturer determines that they may be expected 
to have different emission characteristics. This determination will be 
based upon a consideration of the features of each engine listed in 
paragraphs (a)(4) (i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) The dimension from the center line of the crankshaft to the 
center line of the camshaft.
    (ii) The dimension from the center line of the crankshaft to the top 
of the cylinder block head face.
    (iii) The size of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
    (5) The gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks covered by an application for certification will be 
divided into groupings which are expected to have similar evaporative 
emission characteristics throughout their useful life. Each group of 
vehicles with similar evaporative emission characteristics must be 
defined as a separate evaporative emission family.
    (6) For gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks to be classed in the same evaporative emission family, 
vehicles must be similar with respect to the items listed in paragraphs 
(a)(6) (i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Type of vapor storage device (for example, canister, air 
cleaner, crankcase).
    (ii) Basic canister design.
    (iii) Fuel system.
    (7) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into 
evaporative emission families based on the criteria listed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the Administrator establishes families for those 
vehicles based upon the features most related to their evaporative 
emission characteristics.
    (8)(i) If the manufacturer elects to participate in the Production 
AMA Durability Program, the engine families covered by an application 
for certification must be grouped based upon similar engine design and 
emission control system characteristics. Each of these groups constitute 
a separate engine family group.
    (ii) To be classed in the same engine family group, engine families 
must contain engines identical in all of the respects listed in 
paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) The combustion cycle.
    (B) The cylinder block configuration (air-cooled or water-cooled: L-
6, V-8, rotary, etc.).
    (C) Displacement (engines of different displacement within 50 cubic 
inches or 15 percent of the largest displacement and contained within a 
multidisplacement engine family will be included in the same engine 
family group).
    (D) Catalytic converter usage and basic type (non-catalyst, 
oxidation catalyst only, three-way catalyst equipped).
    (9) Engine families identical in all respects listed in paragraph 
(a)(8) of this section may be further divided into different engine 
family groups if the Administrator determines that they are expected to 
have significantly different exhaust emission control system 
deterioration characteristics.
    (10) A manufacturer may request the Administrator to include in an 
engine family group engine families in addition to those grouped under 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. This request must be 
accompanied by information the manufacturer believes supports the 
inclusion of these additional engine families.
    (11) A manufacturer may combine into a single engine family group 
those light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck engine families which 
otherwise meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) (8) through (10) of 
this section.
    (12) Those vehicles covered by an application for certification 
which are equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled heavy-duty 
engines will be divided into groupings of vehicles on the basis of 
physical features which are expected to affect evaporative emissions. 
Each group of vehicles with similar features must be defined as a 
separate evaporative emission family.
    (13) For gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles to 
be classified in the same evaporative emission family, vehicles must be 
identical with respect to the items listed in paragraphs (a)(13) (i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) Method of fuel/air metering (that is, carburetion versus fuel 
injection).

[[Page 345]]

    (ii) Carburetor bowl fuel volume, within a 10 cc range.
    (14) For vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled 
heavy-duty engines to be classified in the same evaporative emission 
control system, vehicles must be identical with respect to the items 
listed in paragraphs (a)(14) (i) through (ix) of this section.
    (i) Method of vapor storage.
    (ii) Method of carburetor sealing.
    (iii) Method of air cleaner sealing.
    (iv) Vapor storage working capacity, within a 20g range.
    (v) Number of storage devices.
    (vi) Method of purging stored vapors.
    (vii) Method of venting the carburetor during both engine off and 
engine operation.
    (viii) Liquid fuel hose material.
    (ix) Vapor storage material.
    (15) Where vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled 
heavy-duty engines are types which cannot be divided into evaporative 
emission family-control system combinations based on the criteria listed 
above, the Administrator establishes evaporative emission family-control 
system combinations for those vehicles based on features most related to 
their evaporative emission characteristics.
    (b) Emission data--(1) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. 
This paragraph applies to light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck 
emission data vehicles.
    (i) Vehicles are chosen to be operated and tested for emission data 
based upon engine family groupings. Within each engine family, one test 
vehicle is selected. The Administrator selects as the test vehicle the 
vehicle with the heaviest equivalent test weight (including options) 
within the family. If more than one vehicle meets this criterion, then 
within that vehicle grouping, the Administrator selects, in the order 
listed, the highest road-load power, largest displacement, the 
transmission with the highest numerical final gear ratio (including 
overdrive), the highest numerical axle ratio offered in that engine 
family, and the maximum fuel flow calibration.
    (ii) The Administrator selects one additional test vehicle from 
within each engine family. The additional vehicle selected is the 
vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those vehicles 
remaining in the engine family. If all vehicles within the engine family 
are similar, the Administrator may waive the requirements of this 
paragraph.
    (iii) Within an engine family and exhaust emission control system, 
the manufacturer may alter any emission data vehicle (or other vehicles 
such as current or previous model year emission data vehicles, fuel 
economy data vehicles, and development vehicles provided they meet 
emission data vehicles' protocol) to represent more than one selection 
under paragraph (b)(1) (i), (ii), (iv), or (vii) of this section.
    (iv) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section do not represent each engine-system 
combination, then one vehicle of each engine-system combination not 
represented will be selected by the Administrator. The vehicle selected 
is the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those 
vehicles remaining in the engine family.
    (v) For high-altitude exhaust emission compliance for each engine 
family, the manufacturer must follow one of the procedures described in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(v) (A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) The manufacturer must select for testing under high-altitude 
conditions the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest emissions from 
the nonexempt vehicles selected in accordance with Sec. 86.096-24(b)(1) 
(ii), (iii), and (iv); or
    (B) In lieu of testing vehicles according to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) 
of this section, a manufacturer may provide a statement in its 
application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's 
engineering evaluation of such high-altitude emission testing as the 
manufacturer deems appropriate, all light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks not exempt under Sec. 86.090-8(h) or Sec. 86.094-9(h) comply with 
the emission standards at high altitude.
    (vi) If 90 percent or more of the engine family sales will be in 
California, a manufacturer may substitute emission data vehicles 
selected by the California Air Resources Board criteria for the 
selections specified in Sec. 86.096-24(b)(1) (i), (ii), and (iv).

[[Page 346]]

    (vii)(A) Vehicles of each evaporative emission family are divided 
into evaporative emission control systems.
    (B) The Administrator selects the vehicle expected to exhibit the 
highest evaporative emissions from within each evaporative family to be 
certified. This vehicle is selected from among the vehicles represented 
by the exhaust emission data selections for the engine family, unless 
evaporative testing has already been completed on the vehicle expected 
to exhibit the highest evaporative emissions for the evaporative family 
as part of another engine family's testing.
    (C) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii)(B) of this section do not represent each evaporative 
emission control system then the Administrator selects the highest 
expected evaporative emission vehicle from within the unrepresented 
evaporative system.
    (viii) For high-altitude evaporative emission compliance for each 
evaporative emission family, the manufacturer must follow one of the 
procedures listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(viii) (A) and (B) of this 
section.
    (A) The manufacturer will select for testing under high-altitude 
conditions the one nonexempt vehicle previously selected under paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii) (B) or (C) of this section which is expected to have the 
highest level of evaporative emissions when operated at high altitude; 
or
    (B) In lieu of testing vehicles according to Sec. 86.096-
24(b)(1)(viii)(A), a manufacturer may provide a statement in its 
application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's 
engineering evaluation of such high-altitude emission testing as the 
manufacturer deems appropriate, all light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks not exempt under Sec. 86.090-8(h) or Sec. 86.094-9(h) comply with 
the emission standards at high altitude.
    (ix) Vehicles selected under paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section 
may be used to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(A) of 
this section.
    (x) [Reserved]
    (xi) For cold temperature CO exhaust emission compliance for each 
engine family, the Administrator will select for testing the vehicle 
expected to emit the highest emissions from the vehicles selected in 
accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section. This vehicle is tested by the manufacturer in accordance with 
the test procedures in subpart C of this part or with alternative 
procedures requested by the manufacturer and approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (xii) For CST exhaust emission compliance for each engine family, 
the Administrator will select for testing one vehicle from among the 
vehicles selected in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iv) 
of this section. This vehicle is tested by the manufacturer in 
accordance with the test procedures set forth in subpart O of this part.
    (2) Otto-cycle heavy-duty emission data engines. This paragraph 
applies to Otto-cycle heavy-duty emission data engines.
    (i) through (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) The Administrator selects a maximum of two engines within each 
engine family based upon features indicating that they may have the 
highest emission levels of the engines in the engine family in 
accordance with the criteria described in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) (A) and 
(B) of this section.
    (A) The Administrator selects one emission data engine first based 
on the largest displacement within the engine family. Then from those 
within the largest displacement the Administrator selects, in the order 
listed, the engine with the highest fuel flow at the speed of maximum 
rated torque, with the most advanced spark timing, with no EGR or lowest 
EGR flow, and with no air pump or with the lowest actual flow air pump.
    (B) The Administrator selects one additional engine from within each 
engine family. The engine selected is the engine expected to exhibit the 
highest emissions of those engines remaining in the engine family. If 
all engines within the engine family are similar, the Administrator may 
waive the requirements of this paragraph.
    (iv) If the engines selected in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section do not represent each engine displacement-
exhaust emission control system combination, then the Administrator 
selects one engine of each engine

[[Page 347]]

displacement-exhaust emission control system combination not 
represented.
    (v) Within an engine family/displacement/control system combination, 
the manufacturer may alter any emission data engine (or other engine 
including current or previous model year emission data engines and 
development engines provided they meet the emission data engines' 
protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Diesel heavy-duty emission data engines. This paragraph applies 
to diesel-cycle heavy-duty emission data engines.
    (i) Engines will be chosen to be run for emission data based upon 
engine family groupings. Within each engine family, the requirements of 
paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section must be met.
    (ii) Engines of each engine family will be divided into groups based 
upon their exhaust emission control systems. One engine of each engine 
system combination must be run for smoke emission data and gaseous 
emission data. Either the complete gaseous emission test or the complete 
smoke test may be conducted first. Within each combination, the engine 
that features the highest fuel feed per stroke, primarily at the speed 
of maximum rated torque and secondarily at rated speed, will usually be 
selected. If there are military engines with higher fuel rates than 
other engines in the same engine system combinations, then one military 
engine is also selected. The engine with the highest fuel feed per 
stroke is usually the one selected.
    (iii) The Administrator may select a maximum of one additional 
engine within each engine-system combination based upon features 
indicating that it may have the highest emission levels of the engines 
of that combination. In selecting this engine, the Administrator will 
consider such features as the injection system, fuel system, compression 
ratio, rated speed, rated horsepower, peak torque speed, and peak 
torque.
    (iv) Within an engine family control system combination, the 
manufacturer may alter any emission data engine (or other engine 
including current or previous model year emission data engines and 
development engines provided they meet the emission data engines' 
protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraphs (b)(3) 
(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (c) Durability data--(1) Light-duty vehicle durability data 
vehicles. This paragraph applies to light-duty vehicle durability data 
vehicles.
    (i) A durability data vehicle is selected by the Administrator to 
represent each engine-system combination. The vehicle selected must be 
of the engine displacement with the largest projected sales volume of 
vehicles with that control-system combination in that engine family and 
is designated by the Administrator as to transmission type, fuel system, 
inertia weight class, and test weight.
    (ii) A manufacturer may elect to operate and test additional 
vehicles to represent any engine-system combination. The additional 
vehicles must be of the same engine displacement, transmission type, 
fuel system, and inertia weight class as the vehicle selected for that 
engine-system combination in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section. Notice of an intent to operate and test 
additional vehicles must be given to the Administrator no later than 30 
days following notification of the test fleet selection.
    (2) Light-duty trucks. This paragraph applies to vehicles, engines, 
subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust emission 
deterioration factors for light-duty trucks.
    (i) The manufacturer must select the vehicles, engines, subsystems, 
or components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether 
vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components are used, they must be 
selected so that their emission deterioration characteristics may be 
expected to represent those of in-use vehicles, based on good 
engineering judgment.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Heavy-duty engines. This paragraph applies to engines, 
subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust emission 
deterioration factors for heavy-duty engines.

[[Page 348]]

    (i) The manufacturer must select the engines, subsystems, or 
components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration 
factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether 
engines, subsystems, or components are used, they must be selected so 
that their emission deterioration characteristics may be expected to 
represent those of in-use engines, based on good engineering judgment.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (d) For purposes of testing under Sec. 86.094-26 (a)(9) or (b)(11), 
the Administrator may require additional emission data vehicles (or 
emission data engines) and durability data vehicles (light-duty vehicles 
only) identical in all material respects to vehicles (or engines) 
selected in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
provided that the number of vehicles (or engines) selected may not 
increase the size of either the emission data fleet or the durability 
data fleet by more than 20 percent or one vehicle (or engine), whichever 
is greater.
    (e)(1) [Reserved]
    (2) Any manufacturer may request to certify engine families with 
combined total sales of fewer than 10,000 light-duty vehicles, light-
duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines utilizing the 
procedures contained in Sec. 86.094-14 for emission data vehicle 
selection and determination of deterioration factors. The deterioration 
factors are applied only to entire engine families.
    (f) Carryover and carryacross of durability and emission data. In 
lieu of testing an emission data or durability data vehicle (or engine) 
selected under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and submitting data 
therefore, a manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the 
Administrator, submit exhaust emission data and/or evaporative emission 
data, as applicable on a similar vehicle (or engine) for which 
certification has previously been obtained or for which all applicable 
data required under Sec. 86.096-23 has previously been submitted.
    (g) This paragraph applies to light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks, but does not apply to the production vehicles selected under 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (1)(i) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option), the full 
estimated weight of that item must be included in the curb weight 
computation for each vehicle available with that item in that carline, 
within that engine-system combination.
    (ii) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of the carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option), no weight for 
that item will be added in computing the curb weight for any vehicle in 
that carline, within that engine-system combination, unless that item is 
standard equipment on the vehicle.
    (iii) In the case of mutually exclusive options, only the weight of 
the heavier option will be added in computing the curb weight.
    (iv) Optional equipment weighing less than three pounds per item 
need not be considered.
    (2)(i) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can 
reasonably be expected to influence emissions, then such items must 
actually be installed (unless excluded under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of 
this section) on all emission data and durability data vehicles of that 
carline, within that engine-system combination, on which the items are 
intended to be offered in production. Items that can reasonably be 
expected to influence emissions are: air conditioning, power steering, 
power brakes, and other items determined by the Administrator.
    (ii) If the manufacturer determines by test data or engineering 
evaluation that the actual installation of the optional equipment 
required by paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section does not affect the 
emissions or fuel economy values, the optional equipment need not be 
installed on the test vehicle.
    (iii) The weight of the options must be included in the design curb 
weight

[[Page 349]]

and must also be represented in the weight of the test vehicles.
    (iv) The engineering evaluation, including any test data, used to 
support the deletion of optional equipment from test vehicles, must be 
maintained by the manufacturer and be made available to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (3) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of a carline, 
within an engine-system combination, will be equipped with an item 
(whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can 
reasonably be expected to influence emissions, that item may not be 
installed on any emission data vehicle or durability data vehicle of 
that carline, within that engine-system combination, unless that item is 
standard equipment on that vehicle or specifically required by the 
Administrator.
    (h) Production AMA Durability Program durability data vehicles. This 
paragraph applies to light-duty vehicle durability data vehicles 
selected under the Production AMA Durability Program described in 
Sec. 86.094-13.
    (1) In order to update the durability data to be used to determine a 
deterioration factor for each engine family group, the Administrator 
will select durability data vehicles from the manufacturer's production 
line. Production vehicles will be selected from each model year's 
production for those vehicles certified using the Production AMA 
Durability Program procedures.
    (i) The Administrator selects the production durability data vehicle 
designs from the designs that the manufacturer offers for sale. For each 
model year and for each engine family group, the Administrator may 
select production durability data vehicle designs of equal number to the 
number of engine families within the engine family group, up to a 
maximum of three vehicles.
    (ii) The production durability data vehicles representing the 
designs selected in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section are randomly 
selected from the manufacturer's production. The Administrator makes 
these random selections unless the manufacturer (with prior approval of 
the Administrator) elects to make the random selections.
    (iii) The manufacturer may select additional production durability 
data vehicle designs from within the engine family group. The production 
durability data vehicles representing these designs must be randomly 
selected from the manufacturer's production in accordance with paragraph 
(h)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) For each production durability data vehicle selected under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the manufacturer must provide to the 
Administrator (before the vehicle is tested or begins service 
accumulation) the vehicle identification number. Before the vehicle 
begins service accumulation the manufacturer must also provide the 
Administrator with a description of the durability data vehicle as 
specified by the Administrator.
    (v) In lieu of testing a production durability data vehicle selected 
under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and submitting data therefrom, a 
manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the Administrator, 
submit exhaust emission data from a production vehicle of the same 
configuration for which all applicable data has previously been 
submitted.
    (2) If, within an existing engine family group, a manufacturer 
requests to certify vehicles of a new design, engine family, emission 
control system, or with any other durability-related design difference, 
the Administrator determines if the existing engine family group 
deterioration factor is appropriate for the new design. If the 
Administrator cannot make this determination or deems the deterioration 
factor not appropriate, the Administrator selects preproduction 
durability data vehicles under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section. If vehicles are then certified using the new design, the 
Administrator may select production vehicles with the new design under 
the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) If a manufacturer requests to certify vehicles of a new design 
that the Administrator determines are a new engine family group, the 
Administrator selects preproduction durability data vehicles under the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. If vehicles are then 
certified using the new design, the

[[Page 350]]

Administrator may select production vehicles of that design under the 
provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

    (B)(1) Vehicles subject to the standards of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) 
of this section shall be all actual U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles of 
the applicable model year by a manufacturer.
    (2) A manufacturer can not use one set of engine families to meet 
its intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its full 
useful life standards. The same families which are used to meet the 
intermediate useful life standards will be required without deviation to 
meet the corresponding full useful life standards.
    (iii) Exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide from 1997 and later model 
year light-duty trucks shall not exceed 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow 
at curb idle at a useful life of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever 
first occurs (for Otto-cycle and methanol-natural gas- and liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled diesel-cycle light-duty trucks only).
    (iv) CST emissions from gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle light-duty trucks 
measured and calculated in accordance with subpart O of this part may 
not exceed the standards listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) (A) and (B) of 
this section.
    (A) Hydrocarbons: 100 ppm as hexane.
    (B) Carbon monoxide: 0.5%.
    (2) The standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section refer to the exhaust emitted over a driving schedule as 
set forth in subpart B of this part and measured and calculated in 
accordance with those procedures. The test weight basis for light light-
duty trucks, for the purposes of determining equivalent test

[[Page 355]]

weight as prescribed in Sec. 86.129-94, shall be loaded vehicle weight. 
The test weight basis for heavy light-duty trucks, for the purposes of 
determining equivalent test weight as prescribed in Sec. 86.129-94, 
shall be adjusted loaded vehicle weight. The standard set forth in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section refers to the exhaust emitted at 
curb idle and measured and calculated in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in subpart P of this part.
    (3) The standards set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section 
refer to the exhaust emitted during the CST as set forth in subpart O of 
this part and measured and calculated in accordance with those 
provisions.
    (b) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.096-9.
    (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient 
atmosphere from any 1997 and later model year light-duty truck.
    (d) through (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Any model year 1997 and later light-duty truck that a 
manufacturer wishes to certify for sale shall meet the emission 
standards under both low- and high-altitude conditions as specified in 
Sec. 86.082-2, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this 
section. Vehicles shall meet emission standards under both low- and 
high-altitude conditions without manual adjustments or modifications. 
Any emission control device used to meet emission standards under high-
altitude conditions shall initially actuate (automatically) no higher 
than 4,000 feet above sea level.
    (h) The manufacturer may exempt 1997 and later model year light-duty 
trucks from compliance at high altitude with the emission standards set 
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the vehicles are not 
intended for sale at high altitude and if the requirements of paragraphs 
(h) (1) and (2) of this section are met.
    (1) A vehicle configuration shall only be considered eligible for 
exemption under paragraph (h) of this section if the requirements of any 
of paragraphs (h)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section are met.
    (i) Its design parameters (displacement-to-weight ratio (D/W) and 
engine speed-to-vehicle-speed ratio (N/V)) fall within the exempted 
range for that manufacturer for that year. The exempted range is 
determined according to the following procedure:
    (A) The manufacturer shall graphically display the D/W and N/V data 
of all vehicle configurations it will offer for the model year in 
question. The axis of the abscissa shall be D/W (where (D) is the engine 
displacement expressed in cubic centimeters and (W) is the gross vehicle 
weight (GVW) expressed in pounds), and the axis of the ordinate shall be 
N/V (where (N) is the crankshaft speed expressed in revolutions per 
minute and (V) is the vehicle speed expressed in miles per hour). At the 
manufacturer's option, either the 1:1 transmission gear ratio or the 
lowest numerical gear ratio available in the transmission will be used 
to determine N/V. The gear selection must be the same for all N/V data 
points on the manufacturer's graph. For each transmission/axle ratio 
combination, only the lowest N/V value shall be used in the graphical 
display.
    (B) The product line is then defined by the equation, N/V=C(D/
W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP> where the constant, C, is determined by the 
requirement that all the vehicle data points either fall on the line or 
lie to the upper right of the line as displayed on the graphs.
    (C) The exemption line is then defined by the equation, N/V=C(0.84 
D/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP> where the constant, C, is the same as that found in 
paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (D) The exempted range includes all values of N/V and D/W which 
simultaneously fall to the lower left of the exemption line as drawn on 
the graph.
    (ii) Its design parameters fall within the alternate exempted range 
for that manufacturer that year. The alternate exempted range is 
determined by substituting rated horsepower (hp) for displacement (D) in 
the exemption procedure described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section 
and by using the product line N/V=C(hp/W)<SUP>-0.9</SUP>.
    (A) Rated horsepower shall be determined by using the Society of 
Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J 1349 (copies may be obtained from 
SAE, 400 Commonwealth Dr., Warrendale, PA 15096), or any subsequent 
version of that test procedure. Any of the horsepower determinants 
within that test

[[Page 356]]

procedure may be used, as long as it is used consistently throughout the 
manufacturer's product line in any model year.
    (B) No exemptions will be allowed under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this 
section to any manufacturer that has exempted vehicle configurations as 
set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Its acceleration time (the time it takes a vehicle to 
accelerate from 0 to a speed not less than 40 miles per hour and not 
greater than 50 miles per hour) under high-altitude conditions is 
greater than the largest acceleration time under low-altitude conditions 
for that manufacturer for that year. The procedure to be followed in 
making this determination is:
    (A) The manufacturer shall list the vehicle configuration and 
acceleration time under low-altitude conditions of that vehicle 
configuration which has the highest acceleration time under low-altitude 
conditions of all the vehicle configurations it will offer for the model 
year in question. The manufacturer shall also submit a description of 
the methodology used to make this determination.
    (B) The manufacturer shall then list the vehicle configurations and 
acceleration times under high-altitude conditions of all those vehicles 
configurations which have higher acceleration times under high-altitude 
conditions than the highest acceleration time at low altitude identified 
in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (iv) In lieu of performing the test procedure of paragraph 
(h)(1)(iii) of this section, its acceleration time can be estimated 
based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation, in accordance with 
good engineering practice, to meet the exemption criteria of paragraph 
(h)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) A vehicle shall only be considered eligible for exemption under 
this paragraph if at least one configuration of its model type (and 
transmission configuration in the case of vehicles equipped with manual 
transmissions, excluding differences due to the presence of overdrive) 
is certified to meet emission standards under high-altitude conditions 
as specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section. The 
Certificate of Conformity (the Certificate) covering any exempted 
configuration(s) will also apply to the corresponding non-exempt 
configuration(s) required under this subparagraph. As a condition to the 
exemption, any suspension, revocation, voiding, or withdrawal of the 
Certificate as it applies to a non-exempt configuration for any reason 
will result in a suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
corresponding exempted configuration(s) of that model type, unless there 
is at least one other corresponding non-exempt configuration of the same 
model type still covered by the Certificate. The suspension of the 
Certificate as it applies to the exempted configuration(s) will be 
terminated when any one of the following occurs:
    (i) Another corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) receive(s) 
coverage under the Certificate; or
    (ii) Suspension of the Certificate as it applies to the 
corresponding non-exempt configuration(s) is terminated; or
    (iii) The Agency's action(s), with respect to suspension, 
revocation, voiding or withdrawal of the Certificate as it applies to 
the corresponding non-exempt configuration(s), is reversed.
    (3) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at a designated high-
altitude location that has been exempted as set forth in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section will be considered a violation of section 
203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act.
    (i)(1) The manufacturers may exempt 1997 and later model year light-
duty trucks from compliance at low altitude with the emission standards 
set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if the vehicles:
    (i) Are not intended for sale at low altitude; and
    (ii) Are equipped with a unique, high-altitude axle ratio (rear-
wheel drive vehicles) or a unique, high-altitude drivetrain (front-wheel 
drive vehicles) with a higher N/V ratio than other configurations of 
that model type which are certified in compliance with the emission 
standards of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section under low-altitude 
conditions.
    (2) The sale of a vehicle for principal use at low altitude that has 
been exempted as set forth in paragraph (i)(1)

[[Page 357]]

of this section will be considered a violation of section 203(a)(1) of 
the Clean Air Act.
    (j) Any light-duty truck that a manufacturer wishes to certify for 
sale under the provisions of paragraphs (h) or (i) of this section is 
subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this part.
    (k)(1) Cold Temperature Carbon Monoxide (CO) Standards--Light light-
duty trucks. Exhaust emissions from 1997 and later model year light 
light-duty trucks with a loaded vehicle weight of 3,750 lbs or less 
shall not exceed the cold temperature CO standard of 10.0 grams per mile 
and light light-duty trucks with a loaded vehicle weight of greater than 
3,750 lbs shall not exceed a cold temperature CO standard of 12.5 grams 
per mile, both for an intermediate useful life of 50,000 miles and as 
measured and calculated under the provisions set forth in subpart C of 
this part. This standard applies under both low and high altitude 
conditions.
    (2) Heavy light-duty trucks. Exhaust emissions from 1997 and later 
model year heavy light-duty trucks shall not exceed the cold temperature 
CO standard of 12.5 grams per mile for an intermediate useful life of 
50,000 miles, as measured and calculated under the provisions set forth 
in subpart C of this part. This standard applies under both low and high 
altitude conditions.

<R05>
Sec. 86.098-15  NO<INF>X</INF> and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines.

    Section 86.098-15 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.094-15. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.094-15 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.098-15, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.094-15.''
    (a) through (b) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.094-15.
    (c)(1) For each participating engine family, NO<INF>X</INF> and 
particulate emission credits (positive or negative) are to be calculated 
according to one of the following equations and rounded, in accordance 
with ASTM E29-93a, to the nearest one-tenth of a Megagram (MG). 
Consistent units are to be used throughout the equation.
    (i) For determining credit need for all engine families and credit 
availability for engine families generating credits for averaging 
programs only:

Emission credits = (Std-FEL)  x  (CF)  x  (UL)  x  (Production)  x  
    (10<SUP>-6</SUP>)

    (ii) For determining credit availability for engine families 
generating credits for trading or banking programs:

Emission credits = (Std-FEL)  x  (CF)  x  (UL)  x  (Production)  x  
    (10<SUP>-6</SUP>)  x  (Discount)

    (iii) For purposes of the equations in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) 
of this section:


[[Page 366]]


Std = the current and applicable heavy-duty engine NO<INF>X</INF> or 
particulate emission standard in grams per brake horsepower hour or 
grams per Megajoule.
FEL = the NO<INF>X</INF> or particulate family emission limit for the 
engine family in grams per brake horsepower hour or grams per Megajoule.
CF = a transient cycle conversion factor in BHP-hr/mi or MJ/mi, as given 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
UL = the useful life, or alternative life as described in paragraph (f) 
of Sec. 86.094-21, for the given engine family in miles.
Production = the number of engines produced for U.S. sales within the 
given engine family during the model year. Quarterly production 
projections are used for initial certification. Actual production is 
used for end-of-year compliance determination.
Discount = a one-time discount applied to all credits to be banked or 
traded within the model year generated. The discount applied here is 
0.8. Banked credits traded in a subsequent model year will not be 
subject to an additional discount. Banked credits used in a subsequent 
model year's averaging program will not have the discount restored.

    (2)(i) The transient cycle conversion factor is the total 
(integrated) cycle brake horsepower-hour or Megajoules, divided by the 
equivalent mileage of the applicable transient cycle. For Otto-cycle 
heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3 miles. For diesel 
heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.5 miles.
    (ii) When more than one configuration is chosen by EPA to be tested 
in the certification of an engine family (as described in Sec. 86.085-
24), the conversion factor used is to be based upon a production 
weighted average value of the configurations in an engine family to 
calculate the conversion factor.
    (d) through (i) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.094-15.
    (j) Optional program for early banking. Provisions set forth in 
paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section apply except as specifically 
stated otherwise in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (1) To be eligible for the optional program described in paragraph 
(j) of this section, the following must apply:
    (i) Credits are generated from diesel cycle heavy-duty engines.
    (ii) During certification, the manufacturer shall declare its intent 
to include specific engine families in the program described in this 
paragraph (j). Separate declarations are required for each program and 
no engine families may be included in both programs in the same model 
year.
    (2) Credit generation and use. (i) Credits shall only be generated 
by 1998 and later model year engine families.
    (ii) Credits may only be used for 2004 and later model year heavy-
duty diesel engines. When used with 2004 and later model year engines, 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits may be used to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC 
standard, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 86.004-11(a)(1)(i)(D).
    (iii) If a manufacturer chooses to use credits generated under 
paragraph (j) of this section prior to model year 2004, the averaging, 
trading, and banking of such credits shall be governed by the program 
provided in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section and shall be 
subject to all discounting, credit life limits and all other provisions 
contained therein. In the case where the manufacturer can demonstrate 
that the credits were discounted under the program provided in paragraph 
(j) of this section, that discount may be accounted for in the 
calculation of credits described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Program flexibilities. (i) NO<INF>X</INF> and PM credits that 
are banked until model year 2004 under this paragraph (j) may be used in 
2004 or any model year thereafter without being forfeited due to credit 
age. This supersedes the requirement in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (ii) There are no regional category restraints for averaging, 
trading, and banking of credits generated under the program described in 
paragraph (j) of this section. This supersedes the regional category 
provisions described in the opening text of paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section.
    (iii) Credit discounting. (A) For NO<INF>X</INF> and PM credits 
generated under this paragraph (j) from engine families with 
NO<INF>X</INF> certification levels greater than 3.5 grams per brake 
horsepower-hour for oxides of nitrogen, a Discount value of 0.9 shall be 
used in place of 0.8 in the credit availability equation in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (B) For NO<INF>X</INF> and PM credits generated under this paragraph 
(j) from

[[Page 367]]

engine families with NOx certification levels less than or equal to 3.5 
grams per brake horsepower-hour for oxides of nitrogen, a Discount value 
of 1.0 shall be used in place of 0.8 in the credit availability equation 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (iv) Credit apportionment. At the manufacturers option, credits 
generated under the provisions described in this section may be sold to 
or otherwise provided to another party for use in programs other than 
the averaging, trading and banking program described in this section.
    (A) The manufacturer shall pre-identify two emission levels per 
engine family for the purposes of credit apportionment. One emission 
level shall be the FEL and the other shall be the level of the standard 
that the engine family is required to certify to under Sec. 86.098-11. 
For each engine family, the manufacturer may report engine sales in two 
categories, ``ABT-only credits'' and ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits''.
    (1) For engine sales reported as ``ABT-only credits'', the credits 
generated must be used solely in the ABT program described in this 
section.
    (2) The engine manufacturer may declare a portion of engine sales 
``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' and this portion of the credits 
generated between the standard and the FEL, based on the calculation in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, would belong to another party. For 
ABT, the manufacturer may not generate any credits for the engine sales 
reported as ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits''. Engines reported as 
``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' shall comply with the FEL and the 
requirements of the ABT program in all other respects.
    (B) Only manufacturer-owned credits reported as ``ABT-only credits'' 
shall be used in the averaging, trading, and banking provisions 
described in this section.
    (C) Credits shall not be double-counted. Credits used in the ABT 
program may not be provided to an engine purchaser for use in another 
program.
    (D) Manufacturers shall determine and state the number of engines 
sold as ``ABT-only credits'' and ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' in 
the end-of-model year reports required under Sec. 86.098-23.

using fuels/fuel systems inherently low in refueling emissions are not 
required to conduct testing to demonstrate compliance with the refueling 
emission standards set forth in Sec. 86.098-8: Provided, that--
    (i) This provision is only available for petroleum diesel fuel. It 
is only available if the Reid Vapor Pressure of in-use diesel fuel is 
equal to or less than 1 psi (7 kPa) and for diesel vehicles whose fuel 
tank temperatures do not exceed 130  deg.F (54  deg.C); and
    (ii) To certify using this provision the manufacturer must attest to 
the following evaluation: ``Due to the low vapor pressure of diesel fuel 
and the vehicle tank temperatures, hydrocarbon vapor concentrations are 
low and the vehicle meets the 0.20 grams/gallon refueling emission 
standard without a control system.''
    (2) The certification required in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this 
section must be provided in writing and must apply for the full useful 
life of the vehicle.

compliance and to prevent noncompliance with the refueling emission 
standard.
    (4) Vehicles certified to the refueling emission standard under this 
provision shall not be counted in the sales percentage compliance 
determinations for the 1988, 1989 and subsequent model years.
    (h) Fixed liquid level gauge waiver. Liquefied petroleum gas-fueled 
vehicles which contain fixed liquid level gauges or other gauges or 
valves which can be opened to release fuel or fuel vapor during 
refueling, and which are being tested for refueling emissions, are not 
required to be tested with such gauges or valves open, as outlined in 
Sec. 86.157-98(d)(2), provided the manufacturer can demonstrate, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator, that such gauges or valves would not 
be opened during refueling in-use due to inaccessibility or other design 
features that would prevent or make it very unlikely that such gauges or 
valves could be opened.

accordance with those procedures.
    (3) Evaporative emissions (total of non-oxygenated hydrocarbons plus 
methanol) from heavy-duty vehicles equipped with methanol-fueled diesel 
engines shall not exceed the following standards. The standards apply

    (iii)(A) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 
26,000 lbs, the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
refer to a composite sample of evaporative emissions collected under the 
conditions and measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
subpart M of this part. For certification vehicles only, manufacturers 
may conduct testing to quantify a level of nonfuel background emissions 
for an individual test vehicle. Such a demonstration must include a 
description of the source(s) of emissions and an estimated decay rate. 
The demonstrated level of nonfuel background emissions may be subtracted 
from emission test results from certification vehicles if approved in 
advance by the Administrator.

[[Page 386]]

    (B) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 
26,000 lbs., the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section refer to the manufacturer's engineering design evaluation using 
good engineering practice (a statement of which is required in

    (iv) All fuel vapor generated during in-use operations shall be 
routed exclusively to the evaporative control system (e.g., either 
canister or engine purge). The only exception to this requirement shall 
be for emergencies.
    (4) Evaporative emissions from 1999 and later model year heavy-duty 
vehicles equipped with natural gas-fueled or liquefied petroleum gas-
fueled heavy-duty engines shall not exceed the following standards. The 
standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles.
    (i) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 14,000 
pounds for the full three-diurnal test sequence described in 
Sec. 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.0 grams per test.
    (ii) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than

    (iii)(A) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 
26,000 pounds, the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section refer to a composite sample of evaporative emissions collected 
under the conditions set forth in subpart M of this part and measured in 
accordance with those procedures.
    (B) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating greater than 
26,000 pounds, the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and 
(b)(4)(ii) of this section refer to the manufacturer's engineering 
design evaluation using good engineering practice (a statement of which

<R05>
Sec. 86.099-17  Emission control diagnostic system for 1999 and later light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.

    (a) All light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks shall be equipped 
with an on-board diagnostic (OBD) system capable of monitoring, for each 
vehicle's useful life, all emission-related powertrain systems or 
components. All systems and components required to be monitored by these 
regulations shall be evaluated periodically, but no less frequently than 
once per Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule as defined in Appendix I, 
paragraph (a), of this part, or similar trip as approved by the 
Administrator.
    (b) Malfunction descriptions. The OBD system shall detect and 
identify malfunctions in all monitored emission-related powertrain 
systems or components according to the following malfunction definitions 
as measured and calculated in accordance with test procedures set forth 
in subpart B of this part, excluding those test procedures described in 
Sec. 86.158-00. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to 
diesel cycle light-duty vehicles or diesel cycle light-duty trucks, 
except where the catalyst is needed for NMHC control. Paragraphs (b)(2), 
(b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section do not apply to diesel cycle light-
duty vehicles or diesel cycle light-duty trucks.
    (1) Catalyst deterioration or malfunction before it results in an 
increase in NMHC emissions 1.5 times the NMHC standard, as compared to 
the NMHC emission level measured using a representative 4000 mile 
catalyst system.

[[Page 387]]

    (2) Engine misfire resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 
times the applicable standard for NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF>; and any 
misfire capable of damaging the catalytic converter.
    (3) Oxygen sensor deterioration or malfunction resulting in exhaust 
emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard for NMHC, CO or 
NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (4) Any vapor leak in the evaporative and/or refueling system 
(excluding the tubing and connections between the purge valve and the 
intake manifold) greater than or equal in magnitude to a leak caused by 
a 0.040 inch diameter orifice; any absence of evaporative purge air flow 
from the complete evaporative emission control system. On vehicles with 
fuel tank capacity greater than 25 gallons, the Administrator may, 
following a request from the manufacturer, revise the size of the 
orifice to the smallest orifice feasible, based on test data, if the 
most reliable monitoring method available cannot reliably detect a 
system leak equal to a 0.040 inch diameter orifice.
    (5) Any deterioration or malfunction occurring in a powertrain 
system or component directly intended to control emissions, including 
but not necessarily limited to, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) 
system, if equipped, the secondary air system, if equipped, and the fuel 
control system, singularly resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 
times the applicable emission standard for NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF> 
For vehicles equipped with a secondary air system, a functional check, 
as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, may satisfy the 
requirements of this paragraph provided the manufacturer can demonstrate 
that deterioration of the flow distribution system is unlikely. This 
demonstration is subject to Administrator approval and, if the 
demonstration and associated functional check are approved, the 
diagnostic system shall indicate a malfunction when some degree of 
secondary airflow is not detectable in the exhaust system during the 
check. For vehicles equipped with positive crankcase ventilation (PCV), 
monitoring of the PCV system is not necessary provided the manufacturer 
can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the PCV system 
is unlikely to fail.
    (6) Any other deterioration or malfunction occurring in an 
electronic emission-related powertrain system or component not otherwise 
described above that either provides input to or receives commands from 
the on-board computer and has a measurable impact on emissions; 
monitoring of components required by this paragraph shall be satisfied 
by employing electrical circuit continuity checks and rationality checks 
for computer input components (input values within manufacturer 
specified ranges), and functionality checks for computer output 
components (proper functional response to computer commands) except that 
the Administrator may waive such a rationality or functionality check 
where the manufacturer has demonstrated infeasibility; malfunctions are 
defined as a failure of the system or component to meet the electrical 
circuit continuity checks or the rationality or functionality checks.
    (7) Oxygen sensor or any other component deterioration or 
malfunction which renders that sensor or component incapable of 
performing its function as part of the OBD system shall be detected and 
identified on vehicles so equipped.
    (8) Alternatively, for model years 1999 and 2000, engine families 
may comply with the malfunction descriptions of Sec. 86.098-17(a) and 
(b) in lieu of the malfunction descriptions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section. This alternative is not applicable after the 2000 model 
year.
    (c) Malfunction indicator light. The OBD system shall incorporate a 
malfunction indicator light (MIL) readily visible to the vehicle 
operator. When illuminated, it shall display ``Check Engine,'' ``Service 
Engine Soon,'' a universally recognizable engine symbol, or a similar 
phrase or symbol approved by the Administrator. A vehicle shall not be 
equipped with more than one general purpose malfunction indicator light 
for emission-related problems; separate specific purpose warning lights 
(e.g. brake system, fasten seat belt, oil pressure, etc.) are permitted. 
The use of red for the OBD-related malfunction indicator light is 
prohibited.
    (d) MIL illumination. The MIL shall illuminate and remain 
illuminated when

[[Page 388]]

any of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section are 
detected and verified, or whenever the engine control enters a default 
or secondary mode of operation considered abnormal for the given engine 
operating conditions. The MIL shall blink once per second under any 
period of operation during which engine misfire is occurring and 
catalyst damage is imminent. If such misfire is detected again during 
the following driving cycle (i.e., operation consisting of, at a 
minimum, engine start-up and engine shut-off) or the next driving cycle 
in which similar conditions are encountered, the MIL shall maintain a 
steady illumination when the misfire is not occurring and shall remain 
illuminated until the MIL extinguishing criteria of this section are 
satisfied. The MIL shall also illuminate when the vehicle's ignition is 
in the ``key-on'' position before engine starting or cranking and 
extinguish after engine starting if no malfunction has previously been 
detected. If a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction has previously 
been detected, the MIL may be extinguished if the malfunction does not 
reoccur during three subsequent sequential trips during which similar 
conditions are encountered (engine speed is within 375 rpm, engine load 
is within 20 percent, and the engine's warm-up status is the same as 
that under which the malfunction was first detected), and no new 
malfunctions have been detected. If any malfunction other than a fuel 
system or engine misfire malfunction has been detected, the MIL may be 
extinguished if the malfunction does not reoccur during three subsequent 
sequential trips during which the monitoring system responsible for 
illuminating the MIL functions without detecting the malfunction, and no 
new malfunctions have been detected. Upon Administrator approval, 
statistical MIL illumination protocols may be employed, provided they 
result in comparable timeliness in detecting a malfunction and 
evaluating system performance, i.e., three to six driving cycles would 
be considered acceptable.
    (e) Storing of computer codes. The emission control diagnostic 
system shall record and store in computer memory diagnostic trouble 
codes and diagnostic readiness codes indicating the status of the 
emission control system. These codes shall be available through the 
standardized data link connector per SAE J1979 specifications 
incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (1) A diagnostic trouble code shall be stored for any detected and 
verified malfunction causing MIL illumination. The stored diagnostic 
trouble code shall identify the malfunctioning system or component as 
uniquely as possible. At the manufacturer's discretion, a diagnostic 
trouble code may be stored for conditions not causing MIL illumination. 
Regardless, a separate code should be stored indicating the expected MIL 
illumination status (i.e., MIL commanded ``ON,'' MIL commanded ``OFF'').
    (2) For a single misfiring cylinder, the diagnostic trouble code(s) 
shall uniquely identify the cylinder, unless the manufacturer submits 
data and/or engineering evaluations which adequately demonstrate that 
the misfiring cylinder cannot be reliably identified under certain 
operating conditions. The diagnostic trouble code shall identify 
multiple misfiring cylinder conditions; under multiple misfire 
conditions, the misfiring cylinders need not be uniquely identified if a 
distinct multiple misfire diagnostic trouble code is stored.
    (3) The diagnostic system may erase a diagnostic trouble code if the 
same code is not re-registered in at least 40 engine warm-up cycles, and 
the malfunction indicator light is not illuminated for that code.
    (4) Separate status codes, or readiness codes, shall be stored in 
computer memory to identify correctly functioning emission control 
systems and those emission control systems which require further vehicle 
operation to complete proper diagnostic evaluation. A readiness code 
need not be stored for those monitors that can be considered 
continuously operating monitors (e.g., misfire monitor, fuel system 
monitor, etc.). Readiness codes should never be set to ``not ready'' 
status upon key-on or key-off; intentional setting of readiness codes to 
``not ready'' status via service procedures must apply to all

[[Page 389]]

such codes, rather than applying to individual codes. Subject to 
Administrator approval, if monitoring is disabled for a multiple number 
of driving cycles (i.e., more than one) due to the continued presence of 
extreme operating conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures below 40 
deg.F, or altitudes above 8000 feet), readiness for the subject 
monitoring system may be set to ``ready'' status without monitoring 
having been completed. Administrator approval shall be based on the 
conditions for monitoring system disablement, and the number of driving 
cycles specified without completion of monitoring before readiness is 
indicated.
    (f) Available diagnostic data. (1) Upon determination of the first 
malfunction of any component or system, ``freeze frame'' engine 
conditions present at the time shall be stored in computer memory. 
Should a subsequent fuel system or misfire malfunction occur, any 
previously stored freeze frame conditions shall be replaced by the fuel 
system or misfire conditions (whichever occurs first). Stored engine 
conditions shall include, but are not limited to: engine speed, open or 
closed loop operation, fuel system commands, coolant temperature, 
calculated load value, fuel pressure, vehicle speed, air flow rate, and 
intake manifold pressure if the information needed to determine these 
conditions is available to the computer. For freeze frame storage, the 
manufacturer shall include the most appropriate set of conditions to 
facilitate effective repairs. If the diagnostic trouble code causing the 
conditions to be stored is erased in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section, the stored engine conditions may also be erased.
    (2) The following data in addition to the required freeze frame 
information shall be made available on demand through the serial port on 
the standardized data link connector, if the information is available to 
the on-board computer or can be determined using information available 
to the on-board computer: Diagnostic trouble codes, engine coolant 
temperature, fuel control system status (closed loop, open loop, other), 
fuel trim, ignition timing advance, intake air temperature, manifold air 
pressure, air flow rate, engine RPM, throttle position sensor output 
value, secondary air status (upstream, downstream, or atmosphere), 
calculated load value, vehicle speed, and fuel pressure. The signals 
shall be provided in standard units based on SAE specifications 
incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section. Actual 
signals shall be clearly identified separately from default value or 
limp home signals.
    (3) For all emission control systems for which specific on-board 
evaluation tests are conducted (catalyst, oxygen sensor, etc.), the 
results of the most recent test performed by the vehicle, and the limits 
to which the system is compared shall be available through the 
standardized data link connector per SAE J1979 specifications 
incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (4) Access to the data required to be made available under this 
section shall be unrestricted and shall not require any access codes or 
devices that are only available from the manufacturer.
    (g) The emission control diagnostic system is not required to 
evaluate systems or components during malfunction conditions if such 
evaluation would result in a risk to safety or failure of systems or 
components. Additionally, the diagnostic system is not required to 
evaluate systems or components during operation of a power take-off unit 
such as a dump bed, snow plow blade, or aerial bucket, etc.
    (h) Incorporation by reference materials. The emission control 
diagnostic system shall provide for standardized access and conform with 
the following Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards and/or the 
following International Standards Organization (ISO) standards. The 
following documents are incorporated by reference. This incorporation by 
reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be 
inspected at Docket No. A-90-35 at EPA's Air docket (LE-131), room 1500 
M, 1st Floor, Waterside Mall, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, or at the 
Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 
700, Washington, DC.

Warrendale, PA 15096-0001.
    (i) SAE J1850 July 1995, ``Class B Data Communication Network 
Interface,'' shall be used as the on-board to off-board communications 
protocol. All emission related messages sent to the scan tool over a 
J1850 data link shall use the Cyclic Redundancy Check and the three byte 
header, and shall not use inter-byte separation or checksums.

    (ii) [Reserved]
    (i) Deficiencies and alternate fueled vehicles. Upon application by 
the manufacturer, the Administrator may accept an OBD system as 
compliant even though specific requirements are not fully met. Such 
compliances without meeting specific requirements, or deficiencies, will 
be granted only if compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable 
considering such factors as, but not limited to, technical feasibility 
of the given monitor, lead time and production cycles including phase-in 
or phase-out of engines or vehicle designs and programmed upgrades of 
computers, and if any unmet requirements are not carried over from the 
previous model year except where unreasonable hardware or software 
modifications would be necessary to correct the non-compliance, and the 
manufacturer has demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward 
compliance as determined by the Administrator. Furthermore, EPA will not 
accept any deficiency requests that include the complete lack of a major 
diagnostic monitor (``major'' diagnostic monitors being those for the 
catalyst, oxygen sensor, engine misfire, and evaporative leaks), with 
the possible exception of the special provisions for alternate fueled 
vehicles. For alternate fueled vehicles (e.g., natural gas, liquefied 
petroleum gas, methanol, ethanol), beginning with the model year for 
which alternate fuel emission standards are applicable and extending 
through the 2004 model year, manufacturers may request the Administrator 
to waive specific monitoring requirements of this section for which 
monitoring may not be reliable with respect to the use of the alternate 
fuel. At a minimum, alternate fuel vehicles shall be equipped with an 
OBD system meeting OBD requirements to the extent feasible as approved 
by the Administrator.
    (j) Demonstration of compliance with California OBD II requirements 
(Title 13 California Code Sec. 1968.1), as modified pursuant to 
California Mail Out 97-24 (December 9, 1997), shall satisfy the 
requirements of this section, except that compliance with Title 13 
California Code Secs. 1968.1(b)(4.2.2), pertaining to evaporative leak 
detection, and 1968.1(d), pertaining to tampering protection, are not

Sec. 86.106-90  Equipment required; overview.

    (a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emissions tests on 
petroleum-fueled, and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks, and for evaporative emission tests on gasoline-fueled and 
methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items 
of equipment are not necessary for a particular test, e.g., evaporative 
enclosure when testing diesel vehicles. Alternate sampling systems may 
be used if shown to yield equivalent results, and if approved in advance 
by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications are as 
follows:
    (1) Evaporative emission tests, gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled 
vehicles. The evaporative emission test is closely related to and 
connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested for 
evaporative emissions must be tested for exhaust emissions. Further, 
unless the evaporative emission test is waived by the Administrator 
under Sec. 86.090-26, all gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles 
must undergo both tests. (Diesel vehicles are excluded from the 
evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary 
equipment.
    (2) Exhaust emission tests. All vehicles subject to this subpart are 
tested for exhaust emissions. The exhaust from Otto-cycle vehicles is 
tested for gaseous emissions only, using the CVS concept (Sec. 86.109). 
The exhaust from diesel vehicles is tested for both gaseous and 
particulate emissions. Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicle testing also 
utilizes the CVS concept of measuring emissions, but requires that a 
PDP-CVS or CFV with heat exchanger be used, and that it be connected to 
a dilution tunnel in order to sample particulate emissions 
(Sec. 86.110). The exhaust

[[Page 394]]

from methanol-fueled diesel vehicles is tested for both gaseous and 
particulate emissions using the CVS concept (either PDP CVS or CFV as 
specified in Sec. 86.109 or PDP-CVS or CFV with heat exchanger as 
specified in Sec. 86.110 may be used) and is connected to a dilution 
tunnel to sample particulate emissions (Sec. 86.110) (This equipment may 
be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, however, particulates 
are not measured). All gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles are 
either tested for evaporative emissions or undergo a diurnal heat build. 
Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from this requirement. 
Equipment necessary and specifications appear in Secs. 86.108 through 
86.114.
    (3) Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. Fuel 
specifications for exhaust and evaporative emissions testing and for 
mileage accumulation for petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles 
are specified in Sec. 86.113. Analytical gases are specified in 
Sec. 86.114. The EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) for use

tests. (Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the 
evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary 
equipment.
    (2) Exhaust emission tests. All vehicles subject to this subpart are 
subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions 
using the CVS concept (Sec. 86.109), except where exemptions or waivers 
are expressly provided in subpart A of these regulations. Vehicles 
subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under 
subpart A are exempted from testing for methane emissions (except 
natural gas-fueled vehicles). Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 
0'' standards are waived from testing for particulates. For vehicles 
waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions, use of 
a dilution tunnel is not required (Sec. 86.109). The CVS must be 
connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate emission sampling is 
required (Sec. 86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle 
vehicle testing requires that a PDP-CVS or CFV with heat exchanger be 
used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle 
vehicles; however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that 
are waived from the requirement). All gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled, 
natural gas-fueled and liquified petroleum gas-fueled vehicles are 
either tested for evaporative emissions or undergo a diurnal heat build. 
Petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles are excluded from this 
requirement. Equipment necessary and specifications appear in 
Secs. 86.108 through 86.114.
    (3) Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. Fuel

methods may be used if shown to yield equivalent or superior results, 
and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and 
specifications are as follows:
    (1) Evaporative emission tests, gasoline-fueled vehicles. The 
evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the 
exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested for evaporative emissions 
must undergo testing according to the test sequences described in 
Sec. 86.130-96; however, the Administrator may omit measurement of 
exhaust emissions to test for evaporative emissions. The Administrator 
may truncate a test after any valid emission measurement without 
affecting the validity of the test. Further, unless the evaporative 
emission test is waived by the Administrator under Sec. 86.090-26 or 
Sec. 86.1810, as applicable, all vehicles must undergo both tests. 
(Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative 
emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary equipment.
    (2) Exhaust emission tests. All vehicles subject to this subpart are 
subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions 
using the CVS concept (see Sec. 86.109), except where exemptions or 
waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of this part. Vehicles 
subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under 
subpart A of this part are exempted from testing for methane emissions. 
Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards are waived from 
testing for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for 
measuring particulate emissions, use of a dilution tunnel is not 
required (see Sec. 86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution 
tunnel if particulate emission sampling is required (see Sec. 86.110). 
Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires 
that a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment 
may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles; however, 
particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the 
requirement). All vehicles equipped with evaporative canisters are 
preconditioned by loading the canisters with hydrocarbon vapors. 
Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from this requirement.
    (3) Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. Fuel 
specifications for exhaust and evaporative emissions testing and for 
mileage accumulation are specified in Sec. 86.113. Analytical gases are

Sec. 86.107-90  Sampling and analytical system; evaporative emissions.

    (a) Component description (evaporative emissions sampling system). 
The following components will be used in evaporative emissions sampling 
systems for testing under this subpart.
    (1) Evaporative emission measurement enclosure. The enclosure shall 
be readily sealable, rectangular in shape, with space for personnel 
access to all sides of the vehicle. When sealed, the enclosure shall be 
gas tight in accordance with Sec. 86.117. Interior surfaces must be 
impermeable and non-reactive to hydrocarbons and to methanol (if the 
enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles). One surface should be 
of flexible, impermeable and non-reactive material to allow for minor 
volume changes, resulting from temperature changes. Wall design should 
promote

[[Page 396]]

maximum dissipation of heat, and if artificial cooling is used, interior 
surface temperatures shall not be less than 68  deg.F (20  deg.C).
    (2) Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol analyzers. (i) For 
gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles a hydrocarbon analyzer utilizing 
the hydrogen flame ionization principle (FID) shall be used to monitor 
the atmosphere within the enclosure (a heated FID 
(HFID)(235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113<plus-minus>8  deg.C)) is 
recommended for methanol-fueled vehicles). Instrument bypass flow may be 
returned to the enclosure. The FID shall have a response time to 90 
percent of final reading of less than 1.5 seconds, and be capable of 
meeting performance requirements expressed as a function of Cstd: where 
Cstd is the specific enclosure hydrocarbon level, in ppm, corresponding 
to the evaporative emission standard:
    (A) Stability of the analyzer shall be better than 0.01 Cstd ppm at 
zero and span over a 15-minute period on all ranges used.
    (B) Repeatability of the analyzer, expressed as one standard 
deviation, shall be better than 0.005 Cstd ppm on all ranges used.
    (ii) For methanol-fueled vehicles, a methanol sampling and analyzing 
system is required in addition to the FID analyzer. The methanol 
sampling equipment shall consist of impingers for collecting the 
methanol sample and appropriate equipment for drawing the sample through 
the impingers. The analytical equipment shall consist of a gas 
chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. (NOTE: For 1990 
through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles, a HFID calibrated on 
methanol may be used in place of the HFID, calibrated on propane plus 
the methanol impingers and associated analytical equipment).
    (iii) The methanol sampling system shall be designed such that, if a 
test vehicle emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol (based on 
all applicable standards) during any phase of the test, the measured 
concentration in the primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a 
concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the GC 
analyzer, and such that the primary impinger collects at least 90 
percent of the analyte in the samples. The remaining analyte shall be 
collected by the secondary impinger. This requirement does not apply to 
dilution air samples, since they do not require secondary impingers, or 
to samples in which the concentrations approach the limit of detection. 
The provisions of this paragraph apply to the design of sampling 
systems, not to individual tests.
    (3) Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol data recording 
system. (i) The electrical output of the FID used for measuring 
hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbons plus methanol as appropriate) shall be 
recorded at least at the initiation and termination of each diurnal or 
hot soak. The recording may be by means of a strip chart potentiometric 
recorder, by use of an on-line computer system or other suitable means. 
In any case, the recording system must have operational characteristics 
(signal to noise ratio, speed of response, etc.) equivalent to or better 
than those of the signal source being recorded, and must provide a 
permanent record of results. The record shall show a positive indication 
of the initiation and completion of each diurnal or hot soak along with 
the time elapsed between initiation and completion of each soak.
    (ii) For the methanol sample, permanent records shall be made of the 
following: the volumes of deionized water introduced into each impinger, 
the rate and time of sample collection, the volumes of each sample 
introduced into the gas chromatograph, the flow rate of carrier gas 
through the column, the column temperature, and the chromatogram of the 
analyzed sample.
    (4) Tank fuel heating system. The tank fuel heating system shall 
consist of a heat source and a temperature controller. A typical heat 
source is a 2000 W heating pad. Other sources may be used as required by 
circumstances. The temperature controller may be manual, such as a 
variable voltage transformer, or may be automated. The heating system 
must not cause hot spots on the tank wetted surface which could cause 
local overheating of the fuel. Heat must not be applied to the vapor in 
the tank above the liquid fuel. The temperature controller must be 
capable of controlling the fuel tank temperature

    C = T<INF>o</INF> + (2/9)t.

Where:
F = Temperature in  deg.F.
C = Temperature in  deg.C.
t = Time since start of test in minutes.
T<INF>o</INF> = initial temperature in  deg.F (or in  deg.C for SI 
          units).

    (5) Temperature recording system. Strip chart recorder(s) or 
automatic data processor shall be used to record enclosure ambient and 
vehicle fuel tank temperature during the evaporative emissions test. The 
temperature recorder or data processor shall record each temperature at 
least once every minute. The recording system shall be capable of 
resolving time to <plus-minus>15s and capable of resolving temperature 
to <plus-minus>0.75  deg.F (<plus-minus>0.42  deg.C). The temperature 
recording system (recorder and sensor) shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>3  deg.F (<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C). The recorder (data 
processor) shall have a time accuracy of <plus-minus>15s and a precision 
of <plus-minus>15s. Two ambient temperature sensors, connected to 
provide one average output, shall be located in the enclosure. These 
sensors shall be located at the approximate vertical centerline of each 
side wall extending 4 inches (nominally) into the enclosure at a height 
of 3<plus-minus>0.5 ft (0.9<plus-minus>0.2m). The vehicle fuel tank 
temperature sensor shall be located in the fuel tank so as to measure 
the temperature of the prescribed test fuel at the approximate mid-
volume of the fuel. Manufacturers shall arrange that vehicles furnished 
for testing at Federal certification facilities be equipped with iron-
constantan Type J thermocouples for measurement of fuel tank 
temperature.
    (6) Purge blower. One or more portable or fixed blowers shall be 
used to purge the enclosure. The blowers shall have sufficient flow 
capacity to reduce the enclosure hydrocarbon and/or methanol 
concentration from the test level to the ambient level between tests. 
Actual flow capacity will depend upon the time available between tests.
    (7) Mixing blower. One or more small blowers or fans with a total 
capacity of 200 to 1000 cfm shall be used to mix the contents of the 
enclosure during evaporative emission testing. No portion of the air 
stream shall be directed toward the vehicle. Maintenance of uniform 
concentrations throughout the enclosure is important to the accuracy of 
the test.

<R05>
Sec. 86.107-96  Sampling and analytical systems; evaporative emissions.

    (a) Testing enclosures--(1) Diurnal emission test. The enclosure 
shall be readily sealable, rectangular in shape, with space for 
personnel access to all sides of the vehicle. When sealed, the enclosure 
shall be gas tight in accordance with Sec. 86.117-96. Interior surfaces 
must be impermeable and nonreactive to hydrocarbons (and to methanol, if 
the enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles). The temperature 
conditioning system shall be capable of controlling the internal 
enclosure air temperature to follow the prescribed temperature versus 
time cycle as specified in Sec. 86.133-96 and appendix II of this part, 
within an instantaneous tolerance of <plus-minus>3.0  deg.F of the 
nominal temperature versus time profile throughout the test, and an 
average tolerance of 2.0  deg.F over the duration of the test (where the 
average is calculated using the absolute value of each measured 
deviation). The control system shall be tuned to provide a smooth 
temperature pattern that has a minimum of overshoot, hunting, and 
instability about the desired long-term ambient temperature profile. 
Interior surface temperatures shall not be less than 40  deg.F at any 
time during the diurnal emission test. To accommodate the volume changes 
due to enclosure temperature changes, either a variable-volume or fixed-
volume enclosure may be used for diurnal emission testing:
    (i) Variable-volume enclosure. The variable-volume enclosure expands 
and contracts in response to the temperature change of the air mass in 
the enclosure. Two potential means of accommodating the internal volume 
changes are movable panel(s), or a bellows design, in which impermeable 
bag(s) inside the enclosure expand and contract in response to internal 
pressure changes by exchanging air from

[[Page 398]]

outside the enclosure. Any design for volume accommodation must maintain 
the integrity of the enclosure as specified in Sec. 86.117-96 over the 
specified temperature range. Any method of volume accommodation shall 
limit the differential between the enclosure internal pressure and the 
barometric pressure to a maximum value of <plus-minus>2.0 inches of 
water. The enclosure shall be capable of latching to a fixed volume. A 
variable-volume enclosure must be capable of accommodating a 
<plus-minus>7 percent change from its ``nominal volume'' (see 
Sec. 86.117-96(b)), accounting for temperature and barometric pressure 
variation during testing.
    (ii) Fixed-volume enclosure. The fixed-volume enclosure shall be 
constructed with rigid panels that maintain a fixed enclosure volume, 
and meet the following requirements.
    (A) The enclosure shall be equipped with a mechanism to maintain a 
fixed internal air volume. This may be accomplished either by 
withdrawing air at a constant rate and providing makeup air as needed, 
or by reversing the flow of air into and out of the enclosure in 
response to rising or falling temperatures. If inlet air is added 
continuously throughout the test, it should be filtered with activated 
carbon to provide a relatively low and constant hydrocarbon level. Any 
method of volume accommodation shall maintain the differential between 
the enclosure internal pressure and the barometric pressure to a maximum 
value of <plus-minus>2.0 inches of water.
    (B) The equipment shall be capable of measuring the mass of 
hydrocarbon and methanol (if the enclosure is used for methanol-fueled 
vehicles) in the inlet and outlet flow streams with a resolution of 0.01 
gram per hour. A bag sampling system may be used to collect a 
proportional sample of the air withdrawn from and admitted to the 
enclosure. Alternatively, the inlet and outlet flow streams may be 
continuously analyzed using an on-line FID analyzer and integrated with 
the flow measurements to provide a continuous record of the mass 
hydrocarbon and methanol removal.
    (2) Running loss test. The enclosure shall be readily sealable, 
rectangular in shape, with space for personnel access to all sides of 
the vehicle. When sealed, the enclosure shall be gas tight in accordance 
with Sec. 86.117-96. The enclosure may be equipped with a personnel 
door, provided that the enclosure can still meet the requirements of 
Sec. 86.117-96 with the door installed. Interior surfaces must be 
impermeable and nonreactive to hydrocarbons and to methanol (if the 
enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles). Interior surface 
temperatures shall not be less than 40  deg.F. If a running loss 
enclosure meets all the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, it may be used as a diurnal evaporative emission enclosure. The 
enclosure must contain a dynamometer that meets the requirements of 
Sec. 86.108. Provisions shall be made to remove exhaust gases from the 
enclosure. During the running loss test, ambient temperatures must be 
maintained at 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on 
average). An air or oxygen cylinder with an attached self-contained 
breathing apparatus may be provided for the vehicle operator. The air 
required for vehicle operation shall be provided by one of the following 
methods:
    (i) The running loss enclosure may be equipped to supply air to the 
vehicle, at a temperature of 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F, from sources 
outside of the running loss enclosure directly into the operating 
engine's air intake system. Supplemental air requirements (e.g., for an 
air pump) shall be supplied by drawing air from the engine intake 
source.
    (ii) If it is shown to yield equivalent or superior results, the 
running loss enclosure may be designed with an air makeup system that 
brings outside air into the enclosure to accommodate the aspiration 
needs of the engine and any auxiliary devices. The makeup air shall be 
monitored to establish the background hydrocarbon levels (or hydrocarbon 
and methanol, levels, if applicable) of the makeup air. A filter may be 
used to provide dry air with a stable concentration of background 
hydrocarbon. The makeup-air vent shall be readily sealable for 
calibration of the enclosure and other purposes. For calculation of 
running loss emissions, it may be assumed that the hydrocarbon and 
methanol concentration in the air consumed by the vehicle is the same as

[[Page 399]]

that of the rest of the air in the enclosure.
    (3) Hot soak test. The hot soak test may be conducted by holding the 
vehicle in an enclosure that meets the requirements for either diurnal 
emission or running loss tests. The enclosure shall be configured to 
provide an internal enclosure ambient temperature of 95<plus-minus>10 
deg.F for the first 5 minutes, and 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on average) for the remainder of the hot soak 
test.
    (i) If the hot soak test is conducted in the same enclosure as the 
immediately preceding running loss test, interior surface temperatures 
shall not be below 70  deg.F for the last 55 minutes of the hot soak 
test.
    (ii) If the hot soak test is not conducted in the same enclosure as 
the immediately preceding running loss test, interior surface 
temperatures shall not be below 70  deg.F for the duration of the hot 
soak test.
    (b) Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol analyzers. (1) For 
gasoline fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and 
methanol-fueled vehicles a hydrocarbon analyzer utilizing the hydrogen 
flame ionization principle (FID) shall be used to monitor the atmosphere 
within the enclosure (a heated FID (HFID)(235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F 
(113<plus-minus>8  deg.C)) is recommended for methanol-fueled vehicles). 
For natural gas-fueled vehicles, the FID may be calibrated using 
methane, or if calibrated using propane the FID response to methane 
shall be determined and applied to the FID hydrocarbon reading. Provided 
evaporative emission results are not effected, a probe may be used to 
detect or verify hydrocarbon sources during a running loss test. 
Instrument bypass flow may be returned to the enclosure. The FID shall 
have a response time to 90 percent of final reading of less than 1.5 
seconds.
    (2) For methanol-fueled vehicles, a methanol sampling and analyzing 
system is required in addition to the FID analyzer. The methanol 
sampling equipment shall consist of impingers for collecting the 
methanol sample and appropriate equipment for drawing the sample through 
the impingers. The analytical equipment shall consist of a gas 
chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector.
    (3) The methanol sampling system shall be designed such that, if a 
test vehicle emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol (based on 
all applicable standards) during any phase of the test, the measured 
concentration in the primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a 
concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the GC 
analyzer, and such that the primary impinger collects at least 90 
percent of the analyte in the samples. The remaining analyte shall be 
collected by the secondary impinger. This requirement does not apply to 
dilution air samples, since they do not require secondary impingers, or 
to samples in which the concentrations approach the limit of detection. 
The provisions of this paragraph apply to the design of sampling 
systems, not to individual tests.
    (c) Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol data recording 
system. (1) The electrical output of the FID used for measuring 
hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbons plus methanol, as appropriate) shall be 
recorded at least at the initiation and termination of each running loss 
and hot soak test, and at least at the initiation and termination of the 
enclosure sampling period(s) for the diurnal emission test, as described 
in Sec. 86.133. The recording may be taken by means of a strip chart 
potentiometric recorder, by use of an on-line computer system or other 
suitable means. In any case, the recording system must have operational 
characteristics (signal-to-noise ratio, speed of response, etc.) 
equivalent to or better than those of the signal source being recorded, 
and must provide a permanent record of results. The record shall show a 
positive indication of the initiation and completion of each hot soak, 
running loss, or diurnal emission test (including initiation and 
completion of sampling period(s)), along with the time elapsed during 
each soak.
    (2) For the methanol sample, permanent records shall be made of the 
following: the volumes of deionized water introduced into each impinger, 
the rate and time of sample collection, the volumes of each sample 
introduced into the gas chromatograph, the flow rate of carrier gas 
through the column, the

[[Page 400]]

column temperature, and the chromatogram of the analyzed sample.
    (d) Fuel temperature control system. Fuel temperatures of the test 
vehicle shall be controlled, as specified in Sec. 86.134(g)(1)(xv), with 
the following combination of fans. The control system shall be tuned and 
operated to provide a smooth and continuous fuel temperature profile 
that is representative of the on-road temperature profile. The running 
loss test configuration should be designed to avoid heating or cooling 
the fuel tank's vapor space in a way that would cause vapor temperature 
behavior to be unrepresentative of the vehicle's on-road profile.
    (1) A vehicle cooling fan shall discharge air to the front of the 
vehicle. The fan shall be a road-speed modulated fan that is controlled 
to a discharge velocity that follows the dynamometer roll speed, at 
least up to speeds of 30 mph, throughout the driving cycle. If a warning 
light or gauge indicates that the vehicle's engine coolant has 
overheated, subsequent test runs on the vehicle must include a vehicle 
cooling fan that follows the dynamometer roll speed at all speeds 
throughout the test cycle. The fan may direct airflow to both the 
vehicle radiator air inlet(s) and the vehicle underbody.
    (2) An additional fan may be used to discharge airflow from the 
front of the vehicle directly to the vehicle underbody to control fuel 
temperatures. Such a fan shall provide a total discharge airflow not to 
exceed 8,000 cfm.
    (3) Additional fans may be used to route heating or cooling air 
directly at the bottom of the vehicle's fuel tank. The air supplied to 
the tank shall be between 85 deg. and 160  deg.F, with a total discharge 
airflow not to exceed 4,000 cfm. For exceptional circumstances, 
manufacturers may direct up to 6,000 cfm at the bottom of the fuel tank 
with the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (4) Direct fuel heating may be needed for canister preconditioning, 
as specified in Sec. 86.132(j)(2). Also, under exceptional circumstances 
in which airflow alone is insufficient to control fuel temperatures 
during the running loss test, direct fuel tank heating may be used (see 
Sec. 86.134-96(g)(1)(xv)). The heating system must not cause hot spots 
on the tank wetted surface that could cause local overheating of the 
fuel. Heat must not be applied directly to the tank's vapor space, nor 
to the liquid-vapor interface.
    (e) Temperature recording system. A strip chart potentiometric 
recorder, an on-line computer system, or other suitable means shall be 
used to record enclosure ambient temperature during all evaporative 
emission test segments, as well as vehicle fuel tank temperature during 
the running loss test. The recording system shall record each 
temperature at least once every minute. The recording system shall be 
capable of resolving time to <plus-minus>15 s and capable of resolving 
temperature to <plus-minus>0.75  deg.F (<plus-minus>0.42  deg.C). The 
temperature recording system (recorder and sensor) shall have an 
accuracy of <plus-minus>3  deg.F (<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C). The recorder 
(data processor) shall have a time accuracy of <plus-minus>15 s and a 
precision of <plus-minus>15 s. Enclosures shall be equipped with two 
ambient temperature sensors, connected to provide one average output, 
located 3 feet above the floor at the approximate mid-length of each 
side wall of the enclosure and within 3 to 12 inches of each side wall. 
For diurnal emission testing, an additional temperature sensor shall be 
located underneath the vehicle to provide a temperature measurement 
representative of the air temperature under the fuel tank. For running 
loss testing, an ambient temperature sensor shall be located at the 
inlet to the fan that provides engine cooling. Manufacturers shall 
arrange that vehicles furnished for testing at federal certification 
facilities be equipped with temperature sensors for measurement of fuel 
tank temperatures. Vehicles shall be equipped with two temperature 
sensors installed to provide an average liquid fuel temperature. The 
temperature sensors shall be placed to measure the temperature at the 
mid-volume of the liquid fuel at a fill level of 40 percent of nominal 
tank capacity. An additional temperature sensor may be placed to measure 
vapor temperatures approximately at the mid-volume of the vapor space, 
though measurement of vapor temperatures is optional during the running 
loss test. In-tank temperature

[[Page 401]]

sensors are not required for the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence 
specified in Sec. 86.130-96.
    (f) Pressure recording system. A strip chart potentiometric 
recorder, an on-line computer system, or other suitable means, shall be 
used to record the enclosure gage pressure for any testing in an 
enclosure, as well as the vehicle's fuel tank pressure during the 
running loss test and the outdoor driving procedure specified in 
Sec. 86.129-94(d). Fuel tank pressure measurement and recording 
equipment are optional during the running loss test. The recording 
system shall record each pressure at least once every minute. The 
recording system shall be capable of resolving time to <plus-minus>15 s 
and capable of resolving pressure to <plus-minus>0.1 inches of water. 
The pressure recording system (recorder and sensor) shall have an 
accuracy of <plus-minus>1.0 inch of water. The recorder (data processor) 
shall have a time accuracy of <plus-minus>15 s and a precision of 
<plus-minus>15 s. The pressure transducer shall be installed to measure 
the pressure in the vapor space of the fuel tank.
    (g) Purge blower. One or more portable or fixed blowers shall be 
used to purge the enclosure. The blowers shall have sufficient flow 
capacity to reduce the enclosure hydrocarbon and/or methanol 
concentration from the test level to the ambient level between tests. 
Actual flow capacity will depend upon the time available between tests.
    (h) Mixing blower. Blowers or fans shall be used to mix the 
enclosure contents during evaporative emission testing. The inlets and 
outlets of the air circulation blower(s) shall be configured to provide 
a well dispersed air circulation pattern that produces effective 
internal mixing and avoids significant temperature or hydrocarbon 
stratification. Maintenance of uniform concentrations throughout the 
enclosure is important to the accuracy of testing.
    (1) Diurnal emission test. Blowers or fans shall have a capacity of 
0.8<plus-minus>0.2 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume 
for mixing in the enclosure. Additional fans may be used to maintain a 
minimum wind speed of 5 mph (8 km/h) under the fuel tank of the test 
vehicle.
    (2) Running loss test. Blowers or fans shall have a total capacity 
of at least 1.0 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume.
    (3) Hot soak test. Blowers or fans must have a capacity of 
0.8<plus-minus>0.2 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume. 
Circulated air shall not be aimed directly at the vehicle.
    (i) Point-source running loss measurement facility. Some system 
requirements pertain specifically to running loss testing by the point-
source method, in which emissions from potential sources are collected 
and routed to a sampling system. Emissions are sampled with the same 
equipment and techniques as for exhaust emission measurement. The test 
environment must contain a dynamometer that meets the requirements of 
Sec. 86.108. During the running loss test, ambient temperatures must be 
maintained at 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on 
average). An air or oxygen cylinder with an attached self-contained 
breathing apparatus may be provided for the vehicle operator.
    (1) The running loss vapor vent collection system shall be 
configured to collect all running loss emissions from each of the 
discrete point sources that function as vehicle fuel system vapor vents, 
and transport the collected vapor emissions to a CFV- or PDP-based 
dilution and measurement system. The collection system shall consist of 
a collector at each vehicle vapor vent, lengths of heated sample line 
connecting each collector to the inlet of the heated sample pump, and 
lengths of heated sample line connecting the outlet of the heated sample 
pump to the inlet of the running loss fuel vapor sampling system. Up to 
3 feet of unheated line connecting each of the vapor collectors to the 
heated sample lines shall be allowed. Each heated sample pump and its 
associated sample lines shall be maintained at a temperature between 175 
 deg.F and 200  deg.F to prevent condensation of fuel vapor in the 
sample lines. The heated sample pump(s) and its associated flow controls 
shall be configured and operated to draw a flow of ambient air into each 
collector at a flow rate of at least 0.67 cfm. The flow controls on each 
heated sampling system shall include an indicating flow meter that 
provides an

[[Page 402]]

alarm output to the data recording system if the flow rate drops below 
0.67 cfm by more than 5 percent. The collector inlet for each discrete 
vapor vent shall be placed in proximity to the vent as necessary to 
capture any fuel vapor emissions without significantly affecting flow or 
pressure of the normal action of the vent. The collector inlets shall be 
designed to interface with the configuration and orientation of each 
specific vapor vent. For vapor vents that terminate in a tube or hose 
barb, a short length of tubing of an inside diameter larger throughout 
its length than the inside diameter of the vent outlet may be used to 
extend the vent into the mouth of the collector. For those vapor vent 
designs that are not compatible with such collector configurations, the 
vehicle manufacturer shall supply a collector that is configured to 
interface with the vapor vent design and that terminates in a fitting 
that is capable of capturing all vapor emitted from the vent. The 
Administrator may test for running losses by the point-source method 
without heating sample lines or pumps.
    (2) The running loss fuel vapor sampling system shall be a CFV- or 
PDP-based dilution and measurement system that further dilutes the 
running loss fuel vapors collected by the vapor vent collection 
system(s) with ambient air, collects continuously proportional samples 
of the diluted running loss vapors and dilution air in sample bags, and 
measures the total dilute flow through the sampling system over each 
test interval. In practice, the system shall be configured and operated 
in a manner that is directly analogous to an exhaust emissions constant 
volume sampling system, except that the input flow to the system is the 
flow from the running loss vapor vent collection system(s) instead of 
vehicle exhaust flow. The system shall be configured and operated to 
meet the following requirements:
    (i) The running loss fuel vapor sampling system shall be designed to 
measure the true mass of fuel vapor emissions collected by the running 
loss vapor vent collection system from the specified fuel vapor vents. 
The total volume of the mixture of running loss emissions and dilution 
air shall be measured and a continuously proportioned sample of volume 
shall be collected for analysis. Mass emissions shall be determined from 
the sample concentration and total flow over the test period.
    (ii) The PDP-CVS shall consist of a dilution air filter and mixing 
assembly, heat exchanger, positive-displacement pump, sampling system, 
and associated valves, pressure and temperature sensors. The PDP-CVS 
shall conform to the following requirements:
    (A) The gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately 
ahead of the positive-displacement pump, shall be within <plus-minus>10 
deg.F of the designed operating temperature at the start of the test. 
The gas mixture temperature variation from its value at the start of the 
test shall be limited to <plus-minus>10  deg.F during the entire test. 
The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>2  deg.F.
    (B) The pressure gauges shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>1.6 inches of water (<plus-minus>0.4 kPa).
    (C) The flow capacity of the CVS shall not exceed 350 cfm.
    (D) Sample collection bags for dilution air and running loss fuel 
vapor samples shall be sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow.
    (iii) The CFV sample system shall consist of a dilution air filter 
and mixing assembly, a sampling venturi, a critical flow venturi, a 
sampling system and assorted valves, and pressure and temperature 
sensors. The CFV sample system shall conform to the following 
requirements:
    (A) The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus>2  deg.F and a response time of 0.100 seconds 
of 62.5 percent of a temperature change (as measured in hot silicone 
oil).
    (B) The pressure measuring system shall have an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus>1.6 inches of water (0.4 kPa).
    (C) The flow capacity of the CVS shall not exceed 350 cfm.
    (D) Sample collection bags for dilution air and running loss fuel 
vapor samples shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample 
flow.
    (3) An on-line computer system or strip-chart recorder shall be used 
to

[[Page 403]]

record the following additional parameters during the running loss test 
sequence:
    (i) CFV (if used) inlet temperature and pressure.
    (ii) PDP (if used) inlet temperature, pressure, and differential 
pressure.

    (a)(1) through (a)(3) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.107-96.
    (a)(4) Refueling emissions test. The requirements detailed in 
Sec. 86.107-90 (a)(1) shall apply. Alternatively, an enclosure meeting 
the specifications detailed in Sec. 86.107-96 (a)(1), (2), or (3) may be 
used if approved in advance by the Administrator. In addition, the 
enclosure shall have one or more access ports leading to flexible, 
automatic sealing boots, in the wall(s) of the enclosure. The function 
of the access port(s) and boots shall be to allow fueling of the test 
vehicle from a fuel nozzle and hose located outside of the enclosure, 
with only the spout of the nozzle passing through the automatic sealing 
opening of the boot during fueling. There shall be no loss in the gas 
tightness of the enclosure at the opening of the boot either when the 
nozzle is inserted or when the nozzle is not inserted.
    (b) through (d) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.107-96.
    (e) Temperature recording system--(1) For all emission testing. A 
strip chart potentiometric recorder, an on-line computer system, or 
other suitable means shall be used to record enclosure ambient 
temperature during all evaporative emission test segments, as well as 
vehicle fuel tank temperature during the running loss test. The 
recording system shall record each temperature at least once every 
minute. The recording system shall be capable of resolving time to 
<plus-minus>15 s and capable of resolving temperature to 
<plus-minus>0.75  deg.F (<plus-minus>0.42  deg.C). The temperature 
recording system (recorder and sensor) shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>3  deg.F (<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C). The recorder (data 
processor) shall have a time accuracy of <plus-minus>15 s and a 
precision of <plus-minus>15 s. Enclosures shall be equipped with two 
ambient temperature sensors, connected to provide one average output, 
located 3 feet above the floor at the approximate mid-length of each 
side wall of the enclosure and within 3 to 12 inches of each side wall. 
For diurnal emission testing, an additional temperature sensor shall be 
located underneath the vehicle to provide a temperature measurement 
representative of the temperature of the air under the fuel tank. For 
running loss testing, an ambient temperature sensor shall be located at 
the inlet to the fan that provides engine cooling. Manufacturers shall 
arrange that vehicles furnished for testing at federal certification 
facilities be equipped with temperature sensors for measurement of fuel 
tank temperature. Vehicles shall be equipped with 2 temperature sensors 
installed to provide an average liquid fuel temperature. The temperature 
sensors shall be placed to measure the temperature at the mid-volume of 
the liquid fuel at a fill level of 40 percent of nominal tank capacity. 
An additional temperature sensor may be placed to measure vapor 
temperatures approximately at the mid-volume of the vapor space, though 
measurement of vapor temperatures is optional during the running loss 
test. In-tank temperature sensors are not required for the supplemental 
two-diurnal test sequence specified in Sec. 86.130-96 or for the 
refueling test specified in Sec. 86.151-98.
    (2) Refueling emission testing only. In addition to the enclosure 
ambient temperature recording system described in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section, strip chart recorder(s) or automatic data processor shall 
be used to record vehicle soak area ambient temperature and dispensed 
fuel temperature at the nozzle during the test. The temperature

Sec. 86.108-00  Dynamometer.

    (a) The dynamometer shall simulate the road load force and inertia 
specified for the vehicle being tested, and shall determine the distance 
traveled during each phase of the test procedure.
    (b) Two types of dynamometer roll configurations are currently 
approved by the Administrator:
    (1) A small twin-roll dynamometer that has a nominal roll diameter 
of 8.65 inches and a nominal roll spacing of 17 inches; and
    (2)(i) An electric dynamometer that has a single roll with a nominal 
diameter of 48 inches (1.20 to 1.25 meters).
    (ii)(A) The dynamometer must be capable of dynamically controlling 
inertia load during the US06 test cycle as a function of a vehicle 
throttle position signal if a manufacturer desires using the following 
test option. Any time the duration of throttle operation greater than or 
equal to 85% of wide open throttle (WOT) is greater than or equal to 
eight seconds, the test inertia load may be adjusted during any of five 
EPA specified acceleration events by an amount of load that will 
eliminate additional throttle operation greater than or equal to 85% of 
WOT.
    (B)(1) The specific US06 schedule accelerations time periods where 
inertia load adjustments may be applied are:
    (i) 49 through 69 seconds;
    (ii) 83 through 97 seconds;
    (iii) 135 through 165 seconds;
    (iv) 315 through 335 seconds; and
    (v) 568 through 583 seconds.
    (2) During these five time intervals when inertia load adjustment is 
occurring, inertia load adjustment is discontinued when throttle 
operation is less than 85% of WOT or at the end of the specified time 
interval.
    (C) Each type of generic application for implementing this concept 
must receive the Administrator's approval before a manufacturer may use 
these inertia adjustments for official US06 schedule certification 
tests.
    (c) Other dynamometer configurations may be used for testing if it 
can be demonstrated that the simulated road load power and inertia are 
equivalent, and if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (d) An electric dynamometer meeting the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, or a dynamometer approved as equivalent under 
paragraph (c) of this section, must be used for all types of emission 
testing in the following situations.

Sec. 86.109-90  Exhaust gas sampling system; Otto-cycle vehicles.

    (a)(1) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in 
the exhaust of either Otto-cycle light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks. In the CVS concept of measuring mass emissions, two conditions 
must be satisfied: the total volume of the mixture of exhaust and 
dilution air must be measured, and a continuously proportioned volume of 
sample must be collected for analysis. Mass emissions are determined 
from the sample concentration and total flow over the test period.
    (2) Vehicle tailpipe to CVS Duct. For methanol-fueled vehicles, 
cooling of the exhaust gases in the duct connecting the vehicle tailpipe 
to the CVS shall be minimized. This may be accomplished by:
    (i) Using a duct of unrestricted length maintained at 
235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C), heating 
and possible cooling capabilities are required; or
    (ii) Using a short duct (up to 12 feet long) constructed of smooth 
wall pipe with a minimum of flexible sections, maintained at 
235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C) prior to 
the test and during the 10 minute hot soak segment and uninsulated 
during the test (insulation may remain in place and/or heating may occur 
during testing provided maximum temperature is not exceeded); or
    (iii) Using smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no 
required heating.
    (iv) Omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution 
function at the vehicle tailpipe exit.
    (3) Positive displacement pump. The Positive Displacement Pump-
Constant Volume Sampler (PDP-CVS), Figure B90-1 satisfies the first 
condition by metering at a constant temperature and pressure through the 
pump. The total volume is measured by counting the revolutions made by 
the calibrated positive displacement pump. The proportional samples for 
the bag sample, and for methanol-fueled vehicles, the methanol sample 
(Figure B90-2) and the formaldehyde sample (Figure B90-3), are achieved 
by sampling at a constant flow rate. For methanol-fueled vehicles, the 
sample lines for the methanol and formaldehyde samples are heated to 
235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C).
    Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles, 
methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be omitted provided the bag 
sample (hydrocarbons and methanol) is analyzed using a HFID calibrated 
with methanol.

    (4) Critical flow venturi. The operation of the Critical Flow 
Venturi--Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-CVS) sample system, Figure B90-4, 
is based upon the principles of fluid dynamics associated with critical 
flow. Proportional sampling throughout temperature excursions is 
maintained by use of small

[[Page 409]]

CFVs in the sample lines (for methanol-fueled vehicles, one line 
supplies sample for the bag sample, another line supplies sample for the 
methanol sample, and a third line supplies sample for the formaldehyde 
sample.) The methanol and formaldehyde sample lines are heated to 
235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C) with care 
being taken to ensure that the CFVs of the sample probes are not heated 
since heating of the CFVs would cause loss of proportionality. The 
variable mixture flow rate is maintained at sonic velocity, is inversely 
proportional to the square root of the gas temperature, and is computed 
continuously. Since the pressure and temperature are the same at all 
venturi inlets, the sample volume is proportional to the total volume.
    Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles, 
methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be omitted provided the bag 
sample (hydrocarbons and methanol) is analyzed using a HFID calibrated 
with methanol.

    (5) Other systems. Other sampling systems may be used if shown to 
yield equivalent results, and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (b) Component description, PDP-CVS. The PDP-CVS, Figure B90-1, 
consists of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, heat exchanger, 
positive displacement pump, sampling systems (see Figure B90-2 for 
methanol sampling system and Figure B90-3 for formaldehyde sampling 
system) sampling lines which are heated to 235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F 
(113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C) in the case of the methanol-fueled 
vehicles (heating of the sample lines may be omitted, provided the 
methanol and formaldehyde sample collection systems are close coupled to

[[Page 411]]

the probes thereby preventing loss of sample due to cooling and 
resulting condensation in the sample lines), and associated valves, 
pressure and temperature sensors. The PDP-CVS shall conform to the 
following requirements:
    (1) Static pressure variations at the tailpipe(s) of the vehicle 
shall remain within <plus-minus>5 inches of water (1.2 kPa) of the 
static pressure variations measured during a dynamometer driving cycle 
with no connection to the tailpipe(s). (Sampling systems capable of 
maintaining the static pressure to within <plus-minus>1 inch of water 
(0.25 kPa) will be used by the Administrator if a written request 
substantiates the need for this closer tolerance.)
    (2) The gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately 
ahead of the positive displacement pump, shall be within <plus-minus>10 
deg.F (<plus-minus>5.6  deg.C) of the designed operating temperature at 
the start of the test. The gas mixture temperature variation from its 
value at the start of the test shall be limited to <plus-minus>10  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>5.6  deg.C) during the entire test. The temperature 
measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus>2 
deg.F (1.1  deg.C).
    (3) The pressure gauges shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>1.6 inches of water (0.4 kPa).
    (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to eliminate 
water condensation in the system. (300 to 350 cfm (0.142 to 0.165 
m<SUP>3</SUP>/s) is sufficient for most petroleum-fueled vehicles. 
Higher flow rates are required for methanol fueled vehicles. Procedures 
for determining CVS flow rates are detailed in``Calculation of Emissions 
and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-83-009.)
    (5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples 
shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow. A single 
dilution air sample, covering the total test period, may be collected 
for determination of formaldehyde background (methanol-fueled vehicles).
    (6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde 
sample collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to 
collect samples of adequate size for analysis without significant impact 
on the volume of dilute exhaust passing through the PDP.
    (c) Component description, CFV-CVS. The CFV-CVS sample system, 
Figure B90-4, consists of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, a 
cyclone particulate separator, unheated sampling venturies for the bag 
samples, and for the methanol and formaldehyde samples from methanol-
fueled vehicles, samples lines heated to 235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F 
(113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C) for the methanol and formaldehyde samples 
from methanol fueled vehicles (heating of the sample lines may be 
omitted provided, the methanol and formaldehyde sample collection 
systems are close coupled to the probes thereby preventing loss of 
sample due to cooling and resulting condensation in the sample lines), a 
critical flow venturi, and assorted valves, and pressure and temperature 
sensors. The CFV sample system shall conform to the following 
requirements:
    (1) Static pressure variations at the tailpipe(s) of the vehicle 
shall remain within <plus-minus>5 inches of water (1.2 kPa) of the 
static pressure variations measured during a dynamometer driving cycle 
with no connection to the tailpipe(s). (Sampling systems capable of 
maintaining the static pressure to within <plus-minus>1 inch of water 
(0.25 kPa) will be used by the Administrator if a written request 
substantiates the need for this closer tolerance.)
    (2) The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus>2  deg.F (1.1  deg.C) and a response time of 
0.100 seconds to 62.5 percent of a temperature change (as measured in 
hot silicone oil).
    (3) The pressure measuring system shall have an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus>1.6 inches of water (0.4 kPa).
    (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to virtually 
eliminate water condensation in the system (300 to 350 cfm (0.142 to 
0.165 m<SUP>3</SUP>/s) is sufficient for most petroleum-fueled 
vehicles). Higher flow rates are required with methanol-fueled vehicles. 
Procedures for determining CVS flow rates are detailed in``Calculation 
of Emission and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-
83-009.
    (5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples 
shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow. A single 
dilution air sample covering the total test period may be

[[Page 412]]

collected for determination of formaldehyde background for methanol-
fueled vehicles.
    (6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde 
sample collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to 
collect samples of adequate size for analysis without significant impact 
on the volume of dilute exhaust passing through the CFV-CVS.

Sec. 86.109-94  Exhaust gas sampling system; Otto-cycle vehicles not requiring particulate emission measurements.

    (a)(1) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in 
the exhaust of either Otto-cycle light-duty vehicles or light-duty 
trucks which are waived from requirements for the measurement of 
particulate emissions. In the CVS concept of measuring mass emissions, 
two conditions must be satisfied: the total volume of the mixture of 
exhaust and dilution air must be measured, and a continuously 
proportioned volume of sample must be collected for analysis. Mass 
emissions are determined from the sample concentration and total flow 
over the test period.
    (2) Vehicle tailpipe to CVS Duct. For methanol-fueled vehicles, 
cooling of the exhaust gases in the duct connecting the vehicle tailpipe 
to the CVS shall be minimized. This may be accomplished by:
    (i) Using a duct of unrestricted length maintained at a temperature 
above the maximum dew point of the exhaust, but below 250  deg.F (121 
deg.C); heating and possibly cooling capabilities are required; or
    (ii) Using a short duct (up to 12 feet long) constructed of smooth 
wall pipe with a minimum of flexible sections, maintained at a 
temperature above the maximum dew point of the exhaust, but below 250 
deg.F (121  deg.C), prior to the test and during the 10 minute hot soak 
segment and uninsulated during the test (insulation may remain in place 
and/or heating may occur during testing provided maximum temperature is 
not exceeded); or
    (iii) Using smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no 
required heating. A maximum of two short flexible connectors are allowed 
under this option; or
    (iv) Omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution 
function at the vehicle tailpipe exit.
    (3) Positive displacement pump. The Positive Displacement Pump-
Constant Volume Sampler (PDP-CVS), Figure B94-1 satisfies the first 
condition by metering at a constant temperature and pressure through the 
pump. The total volume is measured by counting the revolutions made by 
the calibrated positive displacement pump. The proportional samples for 
the bag sample, and for methanol-fueled vehicles, the methanol sample 
(Figure B94-2) and the formaldehyde sample (Figure B94-3), are achieved 
by sampling at a constant flow rate. For methanol-fueled vehicles, the 
sample lines for the methanol and formaldehyde samples are heated to 
prevent condensation. The temperature of the sample lines shall be more 
than 5  deg.F (3  deg.C) above the maximum dew point of the sample, but 
below 250  deg.F (121  deg.C). (Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year 
methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be 
omitted provided the bag sample (hydrocarbons and methanol) is analyzed 
using a HFID calibrated with methanol.)

    (5) Electronic flow control. The Critical Flow Venturi-Electronic 
Flow Control-Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-EFC-CVS) system is identical 
to the CFV-CVS system described in paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) of this 
section, except that it maintains proportional sampling for methanol and 
formaldehyde by measuring the CVS flow rate, and electronically 
controlling sample flow rates. For methanol-fueled vehicles, the samples 
lines for the methanol and formaldehyde samples are heated to prevent 
condensation. The temperature of the sample lines shall be more than 5 
deg.F (3  deg.C) above the maximum dew

    (6) Other systems. Other sampling systems may be used if shown to 
yield equivalent or superior results, and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (b) Component description, PDP-CVS. The PDP-CVS, Figure B94-1, 
consists of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, heat exchanger, 
positive displacement pump, sampling systems (see Figure B94-2 for 
methanol sampling system and Figure B94-3 for formaldehyde sampling 
system) sampling lines which are heated to a temperature that is more 
than 5  deg.F (3  deg.C) above the maximum dew point of the sample, but 
below 250  deg.F (121  deg.C) in the case of the methanol-fueled 
vehicles (heating of the sample lines may be omitted, provided the 
methanol and formaldehyde sample collection systems are close coupled to 
the probes thereby preventing loss of sample due to cooling and 
resulting condensation in the sample lines), and associated valves, 
pressure and temperature sensors. The PDP-CVS shall conform to the 
following requirements:
    (1) Static pressure variations at the tailpipe(s) of the vehicle 
shall remain within <plus-minus>5 inches of water (1.2 kPa) of the 
static pressure variations measured during a dynamometer driving cycle 
with no connection to the tailpipe(s). (Sampling systems capable of 
maintaining the static pressure to within <plus-minus>1 inch of water 
(0.25 kPa) will be used by the Administrator if a written request

    (2) The gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately 
ahead of the positive displacement pump, shall be within <plus-minus>10 
deg.F (<plus-minus>5.6  deg.C) of the designed operating temperature at 
the start of the test. The gas mixture temperature variation from its 
value at the start of the test shall be limited to <plus-minus>10  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>5.6  deg.C) during the entire test. The temperature 
measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus>2 
deg.F (1.1  deg.C).
    (3) The pressure gauges shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>1.6 inches of water (0.4 kPa).
    (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to completely 
eliminate water condensation in the dilution and sampling systems. (300 
to 350 cfm (0.142 to 0.165 m<SUP>3</SUP>/s) is sufficient for most 
petroleum-fueled vehicles. Higher flow rates are required for methanol-
fueled vehicles and may be required for natural gas-fueled and liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Procedures for determining CVS flow rates 
are detailed in ``Calculation of Emissions and Fuel Economy When Using 
Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-83-009.) (Copies may be obtained from 
U.S. Department of Commerce, NTIS, Springfield, Virginia 22161; order 
<plus-minus> PB 84104702.) Dehumidifying the dilution air before 
entering the CVS is allowed. Hearing the dilution air is also allowed, 
provided:
    (i) The air (or air plus exhaust gas) temperature does not exceed 
250  deg.F.
    (ii) Calculation of the CVS flow rate necessary to prevent water 
condensation is based on the lowest temperature encountered in the CVS 
prior to sampling. (It is recommended that the CVS system be insulated 
when heated dilution air is used.)
    (iii) The dilution ratio is sufficiently high to prevent 
condensation in bag samples as they cool to room temperature.
    (5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples 
shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow. A single 
dilution air sample, covering the total test period, may be collected 
for the determination of methanol and formaldehyde background (methanol-
fueled vehicles).
    (6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde 
sample collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to 
collect samples of adequate size for analysis without significant impact 
on the volume of dilute exhaust passing through the PDP. The systems 
shall also comply with the following requirements that apply to the 
design of the systems, not to individual tests.
    (i) The methanol system shall be designed such that, if a test 
vehicle emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol (based on all 
applicable standards) during the first phase of the test, the measured 
concentration in the primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a 
concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the

[[Page 419]]

GC analyzer. Sampling systems for all phases shall be identical.
    (ii) The formaldehyde system shall be designed such that, if a test 
vehicle emitted formaldehyde at a rate equal to twenty percent of the 
maximum allowable level of NMHCE (i.e., 0.05 g/mi for a 0.25 g/mi NMHCE 
standard), or the maximum formaldehyde level allowed by a specific 
formaldehyde standard, whichever is less, during the first phase of the 
test, the concentration of formaldehyde in the DNPH solution of the 
primary impinger, or solution resulting from the extraction of the DNPH 
cartridge, shall exceed either 2.5 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 
times the limit of detection for the HPLC analyzer. Sampling systems for 
all phases shall be identical.
    (iii) The methanol and formaldehyde impinger systems shall be 
designed such that the primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of 
the analyte in the samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by 
the secondary impinger. This requirement does not apply to dilution air 
samples, since they do not require secondary impingers, or to samples in 
which the concentrations approach the limit of detection.
    (c) Component description, CFV-CVS. The CFV-CVS sample system, 
Figure B94-4, consists of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, a 
cyclone particulate separator, unheated sampling venturies for the bag 
samples, and for the methanol and formaldehyde samples from methanol-
fueled vehicles, samples lines heated to a temperature that is more than 
5  deg.F (3  deg.C) above the maximum dew point of the sample, but below 
250  deg.F (121  deg.C) for the methanol and formaldehyde samples from 
methanol fueled vehicles (heating of the sample lines may be omitted 
provided, the methanol and formaldehyde sample collection systems are 
close coupled to the probes thereby preventing loss of sample due to 
cooling and resulting condensation in the sample lines), a critical flow 
venturi, and assorted valves, and pressure and temperature sensors. The 
CFV sample system shall conform to the following requirements:
    (1) Static pressure variations at the tailpipe(s) of the vehicle 
shall remain within <plus-minus>5 inches of water (1.2 kPa) of the 
static pressure variations measured during a dynamometer driving cycle 
with no connection to the tailpipe(s). (Sampling systems capable of 
maintaining the static pressure to within <plus-minus>1 inch of water 
(0.25 kPa) will be used by the Administrator if a written request 
substantiates the need for this closer tolerance.)
    (2) The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus>2  deg.F (1.1  deg.C) and a response time of 
0.100 seconds to 62.5 percent of a temperature change (as measured in 
hot silicone oil).
    (3) The pressure measuring system shall have an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus>1.6 inches of water (0.4 kPa).
    (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to completely 
eliminate water condensation in the dilution and sampling systems. (300 
to 350 cfm (0.142 to 0.165 m<SUP>3</SUP>/s) is sufficient for most 
petroleum-fueled vehicles. Higher flow rates are required for methanol-
fueled vehicles and may be required for natural gas-fueled and liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Procedures for determining CVS flow rates 
are detailed in ``Calculation of Emissions and Fuel Economy When Using 
Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-83-009.) Dehumidifying the dilution air 
before entering the CVS is allowed. Heating the dilution air is also 
allowed, provided:
    (i) The air (or air plus exhaust gas) temperature does not exceed 
250  deg.F (121  deg.C).
    (ii) Calculation of the CVS flow rate necessary to prevent water 
condensation is based on the lowest temperature encountered in the CVS 
prior to sampling. (It is recommended that the CVS system be insulated 
when heated dilution air is used.)
    (iii) The dilution ratio is sufficiently high to prevent 
condensation in bag samples as they cool to room temperature.
    (5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples 
shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow. A single 
dilution air sample, covering the total test period, may be collected 
for the determination of methanol and formaldehyde background (methanol-
fueled vehicles).
    (6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde 
sample

[[Page 420]]

collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to collect 
samples of adequate size for analysis without significant impact on the 
volume of dilute exhaust passing through the CVS. The systems shall also 
comply with the following requirements that apply to the design of the 
systems, not to individual tests.
    (i) The methanol system shall be designed such that, if a test 
vehicle emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol (based on all 
applicable standards) during the first phase of the test, the measured 
concentration in the primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a 
concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the GC 
analyzer. Sampling systems for all phases shall be identical.
    (ii) The formaldehyde system shall be designed such that, if a test 
vehicle emitted formaldehyde at a rate equal to twenty percent of the 
maximum allowable level of NMHCE (i.e., 0.05 g/mi for a 0.25 g/mi NMHCE 
standard), or the maximum formaldehyde level allowed by a specific 
formaldehyde standard, whichever is less, during the first phase of the 
test, the concentration of formaldehyde in the DNPH solution of the 
primary impinger, or solution resulting from the extraction of the DNPH 
cartridge, shall exceed either 2.5 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 
times the limit of detection for the HPLC analyzer. Sampling systems for 
all phases shall be identical.
    (iii) The methanol and formaldehyde systems shall be designed such 
that the primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in 
the samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary 
impinger. This requirement does not apply to dilution air samples, since 
they do not require secondary impingers, or to samples in which the 
concentrations approach the limit of detection.
    (d) Component description, CFV-EFC-CVS. The CVS sample system is 
identical to the system described in paragraph (c) of this section, plus 
includes a means of electronically measuring the CVS flow rate, and 
electronic mass flow controllers for the methanol and formaldehyde 
sample lines. The EFC sample system shall conform to all of the 
requirements listed in paragraph (c), except that the methanol and 
formaldehyde samples must both be drawn from a static probe. It also 
must comply with the following additional requirements:
    (1) The ratio of the CVS mass flow rate to the sample mass flow rate 
shall not deviate from the design ratio by more than <plus-minus>5 
percent. (The volumetric sample flow rate shall be varied inversely with 
the square root of the bulk stream temperature.)
    (2) Flow meters to totalize sample volumes for methanol and/or 
formaldehyde samples shall meet the accuracy specifications of 
Sec. 86.120. Total sample volumes may be obtained from the flow 
controllers, provided that the controllers meet the accuracy 
specifications of Sec. 86.120.

Sec. 86.110-90  Exhaust gas sampling system; diesel vehicles.

    (a) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of both gaseous and 
particulate emissions in the exhaust of either diesel light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks. This system utilizes the CVS concept 
(described in Sec. 86.109) of measuring mass emissions. The mass of 
gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total 
flow over the test period. The mass of particulate emissions is 
determined from a proportional mass sample collected on a filter and 
from the total flow over the test period. General requirements are as 
follows:
    (1) This sampling system requires the use of a PDP-CVS or a CFV 
sample system with heat exchanger connected to a dilution tunnel. Figure 
B90-5 is a schematic drawing of the PDP system. Figure B90-6 is a 
schematic drawing of the CFV system (methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles 
may be tested using this test equipment.)

    (2) Bag, HFID, and particulate sampling capabilities as shown in 
Figure B90-5 (or Figure B90-6) are required to provide both gaseous and 
particulate emissions sampling capabilities from a single system.

[[Page 423]]

    (3) Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles require a heated flame 
ionization detector (HFID) (375 deg.<plus-minus>20  deg.F 
(191 deg.<plus-minus>11  deg.C)) sample for hydrocarbon analysis. The 
HFID sample must be taken directly from the diluted exhaust stream 
through a heated probe in the dilution tunnel.
    (4) Methanol-fueled vehicles require the use of a heated flame 
ionization detector (HFID) (235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F 
(113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C)) for hydrocarbon analysis. With an HFID, 
the hydrocarbon analysis can be made on the bag sample and the methanol 
and formaldehyde analyses are performed on the samples collected for 
these purposes (Figures B90-2 and B90-3). NOTE: For 1990 through 1994 
model year methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde sampling 
may be omitted provided the bag sample is analyzed using a HFID 
calibrated with methanol.
    (5) Methanol-fueled vehicles require either:
    (i) A tailpipe to dilution tunnel duct of unrestricted length 
maintained at 235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 deg.<plus-minus>8 
deg.C) through heating and cooling as required; or
    (ii) Using short duct (up to 12 feet long) constructed of smooth 
wall pipe with a minimum of flexible sections maintained at 
235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 deg.<plus-minus>  deg.C) prior to the 
test and during breaks in testing (insulation may remain in place and/or 
heating may occur during testing provided maximum temperature is not 
exceeded); or
    (iii) Using a smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no 
required heating, or
    (iv) Omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution 
function at the vehicle tailpipe exit.
    (6) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, 
exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional 
components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches 
may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the 
functions of the component systems.
    (7) Other sampling systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent 
results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.

    (13) It is intended that the total hydrocarbon probe be free from

calculations are based on the combined net weights of the back-up test 
filter and the primary test filter.
    (2) The particulate filter must have a minimum 47 mm diameter (37 mm

also acceptable. (Larger diameter filters may be desirable in order to 
reduce the pressure drop across the filter when testing vehicles which 
produce large amounts of particulate.)
    (3) The recommended minimum loading on the primary 47 mm filter is 
0.5 milligrams. Equivalent loadings (i.e., mass/stain area) are 
recommended for larger filters.
    (4) Fluorocarbon coated glass fiber filters or fluorocarbon-based 
(membrane) filters are required for particulate collection.

Sec. 86.110-94  Exhaust gas sampling system; diesel-cycle vehicles, and Otto-cycle vehicles requiring particulate emissions measurements.

    Section 86.110-94 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.110-90. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.110-90 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.110-94, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.110-90.'' Where a corresponding paragraph of 
Sec. 86.110-90 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement 
``[Reserved].''
    (a) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of both gaseous and 
particulate emissions in the exhaust of either diesel-cycle or Otto-
cycle light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. This system utilizes 
the CVS concept (described in Sec. 86.109) of measuring mass emissions. 
The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample 
concentration and total flow over the test period. The mass of 
particulate emissions is determined from a proportional mass sample 
collected on a filter and from the total flow over the test period. 
General requirements are as follows:
    (1) This sampling system requires the use of a PDP-CVS, CFV-CVS (or 
a CFV-EFC-CVS), sample system with heat exchanger connected to a 
dilution tunnel. The heat exchanger is not required for the CFV-CVS or 
EFC-CFV-CVS if electronic flow controllers are used to maintain 
proportionality for the particulate sample. Figure B94-5 is a schematic 
drawing of the PDP system. Figure B94-6 is a schematic drawing of the 
CFV-CVS system. (Methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles may be tested using 
this test equipment, without measuring particulate emissions.)

    (2) Bag, continuous HFID (required for petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle 
and optional for methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles), and particulate sampling 
capabilities as shown in Figure B94-5 (or Figure B94-6) are required to 
provide both gaseous and particulate emissions sampling capabilities 
from a single system.
    (3) Petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles require a heated flame 
ionization detector (HFID) (375  deg.<plus-minus>20  deg.F (191 
deg.<plus-minus>11  deg.C)) sample for total hydrocarbon (THC) analysis. 
The HFID sample must

[[Page 430]]

be taken directly from the diluted exhaust stream through a heated probe 
in the dilution tunnel.
    (4) Methanol-fueled vehicles require the use of a heated flame 
ionization detector (HFID) (235  deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 
deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C)) for hydrocarbon analysis. With an HFID, the 
hydrocarbon analysis can be made on the bag sample and the methanol and 
formaldehyde analyses are performed on the samples collected for these 
purposes (Figures B94-2 and B94-3).
    Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles, 
methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be omitted provided the bag 
sample is analyzed using a HFID calibrated with methanol.
    (5) For methanol-fueled vehicles, the vehicle tailpipe-to-dilution 
tunnel connection shall be made by:
    (i) A tailpipe to dilution tunnel duct of unrestricted length 
maintained at a temperature above the dew point of the mixture, but 
below 250  deg.F (121  deg.C) through heating and cooling as required; 
or
    (ii) Using a short duct (up to 12 feet long) constructed of smooth 
wall pipe with a minimum of flexible sections maintained at a 
temperature above the dew point of the mixture, but below 250  deg.F 
(121  deg.C) prior to the test and during breaks in testing (insulation 
may remain in place and or heating may occur during the testing provided 
the maximum temperature is not exceeded); or
    (iii) Using smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no 
required heating. A maximum of two short flexible connectors are allowed 
under this option; or
    (iv) By omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution 
function at the vehicle tailpipe exit.
    (6) For natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel

analysis.
    (7) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, 
exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional 
components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches

Sec. 86.111-90  Exhaust gas analytical system.

    (a) Schematic drawings. Figure B90-7 is a schematic drawing of the 
exhaust gas analytical system for analysis of hydrocarbons (HC) 
(hydrocarbons plus methanol in the case of methanol-fueled vehicles), 
carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>), and oxides of 
nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>). The schematic diagram of the hydrocarbon 
analysis train for diesel vehicles (and for hydrocarbons plus methanol 
for methanol-fueled diesel vehicles if continuous HFID analysis is 
employed) is shown as part of Figure B90-5 (or Figure B90-6). Since 
various configurations can produce accurate results, exact conformance 
with either drawing is not required. Additional components such as 
instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and switches may be used to 
provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the 
component systems.

    (b) Major component description. The exhaust gas analytical system 
for HC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF>, Figure B90-7, consists 
of a flame ionization detector (FID) (heated, 235 deg.<plus-minus>15 
deg.F (113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C) for methanol-fueled vehicles) for 
the determination of hydrocarbons, non-dispersive infrared analyzers 
(NDIR) for the determination of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and a 
chemiluminescence analyzer (CL) for the determination of oxides of 
nitrogen. A heated flame ionization detector (HFID) is used for the 
continuous determination of hydrocarbons from petroleum-fueled diesel 
vehicles (may also be used with methanol-fueled diesel vehicles), Figure 
B90-5 (or B90-6).

[[Page 436]]

The analytical system for methanol consists of a gas chromatograph (GC) 
equipped with a flame ionization detector. The analysis for formaldehyde 
is performed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of 2,4-
dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatives using ultraviolet (UV) 
detection. The exhaust gas analytical system shall conform to the 
following requirements:
    (1) The CL requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in the sample 
be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of analyzers 
may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (2) The carbon monoxide (CO) NDIR analyzer may require a sample 
conditioning column containing CaSO<INF>4</INF>, or indicating silica 
gel to remove water vapor and containing ascarite to remove carbon 
dioxide from the CO analysis stream.
    (i) If CO instruments which are essentially free of CO<INF>2</INF> 
and water vapor interference are used, the use of the conditioning 
column may be deleted, see Secs. 86.122 and 86.144.
    (ii) A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of 
CO<INF>2</INF> and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture 
of 3 percent CO<INF>2</INF> in N<INF>2</INF> which has been bubbled 
through water at room temperature produces an equivalent CO response, as 
measured on the most sensitive CO range, which is less than l percent of 
full scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or less 
than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale, see Sec. 86.122.
    (3) For petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles (and if selected, for 
methanol-fueled diesel vehicles) a continuous hydrocarbon sample shall 
be measured using a heated analyzer train as shown in Figure B90-5 (or 
B90-6). The train shall include a heated probe, a heated continuous 
sampling line, a heated particulate filter and a heated hydrocarbon 
instrument (HFID) complete with heated pump, filter and flow control 
system.
    (i) The response time of this instrument shall be less than 1.5 
seconds for 90 percent of full scale response.
    (ii) The continuous HC sample system may use an ``overflow'' zero 
and span system; see Sec. 86.140-82(b)(4). In this type of system 
(figures B82-3A and B82-4A), zero or span gas is introduced into the 
heated sample line at a flow rate that exceeds the sample flow rate to 
the HFID. The excess gas overflows the sample probe into the dilution 
tunnel. This method assures that the reference gas enters HFID in the 
same concentration as the injected reference gas and at the same rate as 
the sample exhaust gas. In addition to zero and span checks, it may also 
be used to calibrate the HC analyzer per Sec. 86.121-82(b). The overflow 
gas flow rate into the sample line shall be greater than 125 percent of 
the HFID flow rate with the CVS blower operating. A lower flow rate may 
be used if it has been experimentally shown to produce equivalent 
results and current dccumentation is maintained. The overflow gases 
shall enter the heated sample line as close as practicable to the 
outside surface of the dilution tunnel.
    (iii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC 
sample probe, line or system, unless a common sample pump is used of all 
analyzers and the single sample line system design reflects good 
engineering practice.
    (iv) Sample transport time from sampling point to inlet of 
instrument shall be less than 4 seconds.
    (v) For petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles, the sample line and filter 
shall be heated to maintain a sample gas temperature of 
375 deg.<plus-minus>10  deg.F (191 deg.<plus-minus>6  deg.C) before the 
filter and before the HFID.
    (vi) For methanol-fueled diesel vehicles, the sample line and filter 
shall be heated to maintain a sample gas temperature of 
235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C) before the 
filter and before the HFID.
    (c) Other analyzers and equipment. Other types of analyzers and 
equipment may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.

Figure B94-7, consists of a flame ionization detector (FID) (heated, 235 
 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113  deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C) for methanol-
fueled vehicles) for the determination of THC, a methane analyzer

(NDIR) for the determination of CO and CO<INF>2</INF> and a

A heated flame ionization detector (HFID) is used for the continuous 
determination of THC from petroleum-fueled diesel-

cycle vehicles (may also be used with methanol-fueled diesel-cycle 
vehicles), Figure B94-5 (or B94-6). The analytical system for methanol 
consists of a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization 
detector. The analysis for formaldehyde is performed using high pressure 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) 
derivatives using ultraviolet (UV) detection. The exhaust gas analytical 
system shall conform to the following requirements:
    (1) The CL requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in the sample 
be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of analyzers 
may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in

    (2) The carbon monoxide (CO) NDIR analyzer may require a sample 
conditioning column containing CaSO<INF>4</INF>, or indicating silica 
gel to remove water vapor, and containing ascarite to remove carbon 
dioxide from the CO analysis stream.
    (i) If CO instruments which are essentially free of CO<INF>2</INF> 
and water vapor interference are used, the use of the conditioning 
column may be deleted, see Secs. 86.122 and 86.144.
    (ii) A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of 
CO<INF>2</INF> and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture 
of 3 percent CO<INF>2</INF> in N<INF>2</INF> which has been bubbled 
through water at room temperature produces an equivalent CO response, as 
measured on the most sensitive CO range, which is less than l percent of 
full scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or less 
than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale, see Sec. 86.122.
    (3) For petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles (and if selected, for 
methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled 
diesel vehicles) a continuous hydrocarbon sample shall be measured using 
a heated analyzer train as shown in Figure B90-5 (or B90-6). The train 
shall include a heated probe, a heated continuous sampling line, a

complete with heated pump, filter and flow control system.
    (i) The response time of this instrument shall be less than 1.5 
seconds for 90 percent of full scale response.
    (ii) The continuous THC sample system may use an ``overflow'' zero 
and span system; see Sec. 86.140-82(b)(4). In this type of system 
(figures B82-3A and B82-4A), zero or span gas is introduced into the 
heated sample line at a flow rate that exceeds the sample flow rate to 
the HFID. The excess gas overflows the sample probe into the dilution 
tunnel. This method assures that the reference gas enters HFID in the 
same concentration as the injected reference gas and at the same rate as 
the sample exhaust gas. In addition to zero and span checks, it may also 
be used to calibrate the THC analyzer per Sec. 86.121-82(b). The 
overflow gas flow rate into the sample line shall be greater than 125 
percent of the HFID flow rate with the CVS blower operating. A lower 
flow rate may be used if it has been experimentally shown to produce 
equivalent results and current documentation is maintained. The overflow 
gases shall enter the heated sample line as close as practicable to the 
outside surface of the dilution tunnel.
    (iii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous THC 
sample probe, line, or system, unless a common sample pump is used of

Sec. 86.112-91  Weighing chamber (or room) and microgram balance specifications.

    (a) Ambient conditions--(1) Temperature. The temperature of the 
chamber in which the particulate filters are conditioned and weighed 
shall be maintained to within <plus-minus>10  deg.F (6  deg.C) of a set 
point between 68  deg.F (20  deg.C) and 86  deg.F (30  deg.C) during all 
filter conditioning and filter weighing. A continuous recording of the 
temperature is required.
    (2) Humidity. The relative humidity of the chamber in which the 
particulate filters are conditioned and weighed shall be maintained to 
within <plus-minus>10 percent of a set point between 30 and 70 percent 
during all filter conditioning and filter weighing. A continuous 
recording of the temperature is required.
    (3) The environment shall be free from any ambient contaminants 
(such as dust) that would settle on the particulate filters during their 
stabilization.
    (4) It is required that two unused reference filters remain in the 
weighing room at all times in covered (to reduce dust contamination) but 
unsealed (to permit humidity exchange) petri dishes. These reference 
filters shall be placed in the same general area as the sample filters. 
These reference filters shall be weighed within 4 hours of, but 
preferably just prior to, the pre- and post-test sample filter 
weighings.
    (5) If the weight of either of the reference filters changes between 
pre- and post-test sample filter weighings by more than <plus-minus>2.0 
percent of the test average primary filter loading (recommended minimum 
of 0.5 milligrams) or <plus-minus>0.010 milligrams, whichever is 
greater, then the post-test sample filter weights are invalid. However, 
the post-test weighing procedure can be repeated to obtain valid weights 
within the time limits as specified in Sec. 86.139.
    (6) The reference filters shall be changed at least once per month, 
but never between pre- and post-test weighings of a given sample filter. 
The reference filters shall be the same size and material as the sample 
filters.
    (b) Microgram balance specifications. The microgram balance used to 
determine the weights of all filters shall have a precision (standard 
deviation) and a readability of one microgram.
    (c) Other procedures and equipment. Other procedures and equipment 
may be used if shown to yield equivalent or superior results and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.

    (3)(i) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, unleaded 
gasoline representative of commercial gasoline that will be generally 
available through retail outlets must be used in service accumulation. 
For model years 2004 and later, and unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator, this gasoline must have a minimum sulfur content of 15 
ppm. Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, where the vehicle 
is to be used for evaporative emission durability demonstration, such 
fuel must contain ethanol as required by Sec. 86.1824-01(a)(2)(iii). 
Leaded gasoline must not be used in service accumulation.
    (ii) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the octane 
rating of the gasoline used must be no higher than 1.0 Retail octane 
number above the lowest octane rating that meets the fuel grade the 
manufacturer will recommend to the ultimate purchaser for the relevant 
production vehicles. If the manufacturer recommends a Retail octane 
number rather than a fuel grade, then the octane rating of the service 
accumulation gasoline can be no higher than 1.0 Retail octane number 
above the recommended Retail octane number. The service accumulation 
gasoline must also have a minimum sensitivity of 7.5 octane numbers, 
where sensitivity is defined as the Research octane number minus the 
Motor octane number.
    (iii) The Reid Vapor Pressure of the gasoline used must be 
characteristic of the motor fuel used during the season in which the 
service accumulation takes place.
    (4) The specification range of the gasoline to be used under this 
paragraph (a) must be reported in accordance with Secs. 86.094-21(b)(3) 
and 86.1844-01.

Sec. 86.115-78  EPA urban dynamometer driving schedule.

    (a) The EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule and the EPA New York 
City Cycle are listed in appendix I of this part. The driving schedules 
are defined by a smooth trace drawn through the specified speed vs. time 
relationships. They each consist of a distinct nonrepetitive series of 
idle, acceleration, cruise, and deceleration modes of various time 
sequences and rates.
    (b) The driver should attempt to follow the target schedule as 
closely as possible. The speed tolerance at any given time for these 
schedules, or for a driver's aid chart approved by the Administrator, 
are as follows:
    (1) The upper limit is 2 mph (3.2 km/h) higher than the highest 
point on the trace within 1 second of the given time.
    (2) The lower limit is 2 mph (3.2 km/h) lower than the lowest point 
on the trace within 1 second of the given time.
    (3)(i) Speed variations greater than the tolerances (such as may 
occur during gear changes or braking spikes) are acceptable, provided 
they occur for less than 2 seconds on any occasion and are clearly 
documented as to the time and speed at that point of the driving 
schedule.
    (ii) When conducted to meet the requirements of Sec. 86.129-94 or 
Sec. 86.153-98(d), up to three additional occurrences of speed 
variations greater than the tolerance are acceptable, provided they 
occur for less than 15 seconds on any occasion, and are clearly 
documented as to the time and speed at that point of the driving 
schedule.
    (4) Speeds lower than those prescribed are acceptable, provided the 
vehicle is operated at maximum available power during such occurrences.
    (5) When conducted to meet the requirements of Sec. 86.129-94, 
Sec. 86.132-96, Sec. 86.146-96, or Sec. 86.153-98(d), the speed 
tolerance shall be as specified above, except that the upper and lower 
limits shall be 4 mph (6.4 km/h).
    (c) Figures B78-4(a) and B78-4(b) show the range of acceptable speed 
tolerances for typical points. Figure B78-4(a) is typical of portions of 
the speed curve which are increasing or decreasing throughout the 2-
second time interval. Figure B78-4(b) is typical of portions of the 
speed curve which include a maximum or minimum value.

Sec. 86.117-90  Evaporative emission enclosure calibrations.

    The calibration of the evaporative emission enclosure consists of 
three parts: Initial and periodic determination of enclosure background 
emissions (hydrocarbons and methanol); initial determination of 
enclosure internal volume; and periodic hydrocarbon and methanol 
retention check and calibration. Methanol measurements may be omitted 
when methanol-fueled vehicles will not be tested in the evaporative 
enclosure.
    (a) Initial and periodic determination of enclosure background 
emissions. Prior to its introduction into service, annually thereafter, 
and after any repair which can affect the enclosure background 
emissions, the enclosure shall be checked to determine that it does not 
contain materials which will themselves emit hydrocarbons or methanol.* 
Proceed as follows:
    *Note: When methanol as well as hydrocarbons are present in the 
evaporative enclosure, the HFID hydrocarbon concentration measurement 
includes the partial response of the HFID to methanol plus the 
hydrocarbons. Determination of the HFID response to methanol, 
Sec. 86.121, prior to its being placed in service is required for the 
determination of hydrocarbons.
    (1) Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.
    (2) Purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon 
reading is obtained.
    (3) Turn on the mixing blower (if not already on).
    (4) Seal enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, 
background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure. These are the 
initial readings C<INF>HCi</INF>, C<INF>CH3OHi</INF>, and 
P<INF>Bi</INF>, T<INF>i</INF>, for the enclosure background 
determination.
    (5) Allow the enclosure to stand undisturbed without sampling for 
four hours.
    (6) Measure the hydrocarbon concentration on the same FID and the 
methanol level. These are the final concentrations, C<INF>HCf</INF> and 
C<INF>CH3OHf</INF>. Also measure final temperature and barometric 
pressure.
    (7) Calculate the mass change of methanol, hydrocarbons, and 
hydrocarbons plus methanol in the enclosure according to the equations 
in paragraph (d) of this section. The enclosure background emissions 
(hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.4g for the 4 
hours.
    (b) Initial determination of enclosure internal volume. Prior to its 
introduction into service the enclosure internal volume shall be 
determined by the following procedure:
    (1) Carefully measure the internal length, width and height of the 
enclosure, accounting for irregularities (such as braces) and calculate 
the internal volume.
    (2) Perform an enclosure calibration check according to paragraphs 
(c) (1) through (7) of this section.
    (3) If the calculated mass does not agree within 2 percent of the 
injected propane mass, then corrective action is required.
    (c) Hydrocarbon and methanol (organic gas) retention check and 
calibration. The hydrocarbon and methanol (if the enclosure is used for 
methanol-fueled vehicles) retention check provides a check upon the 
calculated volume and also measures the leak rate. Prior to its 
introduction into service and at least monthly thereafter (the methanol 
check can be performed less frequently, provided it is performed at 
least twice annually) the enclosure leak rate shall be determined as 
follows:
    (1) Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.

[[Page 455]]

    (2) Purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon 
reading is obtained.
    (3) Turn on the mixing blower (if not already on).
    (4) Seal enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, 
background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure. These are the 
initial readings C<INF>HCi</INF>, C<INF>CH3OHi</INF>, T<INF>i</INF> and 
P<INF>Bi</INF> for the enclosure calibration.
    (5) Inject into the enclosure a known quantity of pure propane (4g 
is a convenient quantity) and a known quantity of pure methanol (4g is a 
convenient quantity) in gaseous form; i.e., at a temperature of at least 
150-155  deg.F (65-68  deg.C). The propane and methanol may be measured 
by volume flow or by mass measurement. The method used to measure the 
propane and methanol shall have an accuracy of <plus-minus>0.5 percent 
of the measured value (less accurate methods may be used with the 
advanced approval of the Administrator). The methanol and propane tests 
do not need to be conducted simultaneously.
    (6) After a minimum of 5 minutes of mixing, analyze the enclosure 
atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content, also record temperature 
and pressure. These measurements are the final readings for the 
enclosure calibration as well as the initial readings for the retention 
check.
    (7) To verify the enclosure calibration, calculate the mass of 
propane and the mass of methanol using the measurements taken in steps 
(4) and (6) (see paragraph (d) of this section). This quantity must be 
within <plus-minus>2 percent of that measured in step 5 above. (For 
1991-1995 calendar years, the difference may exceed <plus-minus>2 
percent for methanol, provided it does not exceed <plus-minus>8 percent 
for 1991 testing and <plus-minus>6 percent for 1992-1995 testing.)
    (8) Allow the enclosure to remain sealed for a minimum of 4 hours, 
analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content; 
record temperature and barometric pressure. These are the final readings 
for the hydrocarbon and methanol retention check.
    (9) Calculate, using the equations in paragraph (d) of this section 
and the readings taken in step (8), the hydrocarbon and methanol mass. 
It may not differ by more than <plus-minus>4 percent of the value in 
step (6). (For 1991-1995 calendar years, the difference may exceed 
<plus-minus>4 percent for methanol, provided it does not exceed 
<plus-minus>8 percent for 1991 testing and <plus-minus>6 percent for 
1992-1995 testing.)
    (d) Calculations. (1) The calculation of net methanol and 
hydrocarbon mass change is used to determine enclosure background and 
leak rate. It is also used to check the enclosure volume measurements. 
The methanol mass change is calculated from the initial and final 
methanol samples, temperature and pressure according to the following

Sec. 86.117-96  Evaporative emission enclosure calibrations.

    The calibration of evaporative emission enclosures consists of three 
parts: initial and periodic determination of enclosure background 
emissions (hydrocarbons and methanol); initial determination of 
enclosure internal volume; and periodic hydrocarbon and methanol 
retention check and calibration. Methanol measurements may be omitted if 
methanol-fueled vehicles will not be tested in the evaporative 
enclosure. Alternate calibration methods may be used if shown to yield 
equivalent or superior results, and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator; specifically, more extreme temperatures may be used for 
determining calibration without affecting the validity of test results.
    (a) Initial and periodic determination of enclosure background 
emissions. Prior to its introduction into service, annually thereafter, 
and after any repair that can affect the enclosure background emissions, 
the enclosure shall be checked to determine that it does not contain 
materials that will themselves emit hydrocarbons or methanol. When 
methanol as well as hydrocarbons are present in the evaporative 
enclosure, the HFID hydrocarbon concentration measurement includes the 
partial response of the HFID to methanol plus the hydrocarbons. 
Determination of the HFID response to methanol, Sec. 86.121, prior to 
its being placed in service is required for the determination of 
hydrocarbons. Proceed as follows:
    (1) Prepare the enclosure. (i) Variable-volume enclosures may be 
operated in either latched or unlatched volume configuration, as 
described in

[[Page 457]]

paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Ambient temperatures shall be 
maintained at 96<plus-minus>3  deg.F throughout the 4-hour period.
    (ii) Fixed-volume enclosures may be operated with inlet and outlet 
flow streams either closed or open; if inlet and outlet flow streams are 
open, the air flowing into and out of the enclosure must be monitored in 
accordance with Sec. 86.107-96(a)(1)(ii)(B). Ambient temperatures shall 
be maintained at 96<plus-minus>3  deg.F throughout the 4-hour period.
    (iii) For running loss enclosures ambient temperatures shall be 
maintained at 95<plus-minus>3  deg.F throughout the 4-hour period. For 
running loss enclosures designed with a vent for makeup air, the 
enclosure shall be operated with the vent closed.
    (2) The enclosure may be sealed and the mixing fan operated for a 
period of up to 12 hours before the 4-hour background sampling period 
begins.
    (3) Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.
    (4) Prior to the background determination, purge the enclosure until 
a stable background hydrocarbon reading is obtained.
    (5) Turn on the mixing blower (if not already on).
    (6) Seal enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, 
background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure.
    These are the initial readings C<INF>HCi</INF>, 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, and P<INF>Bi</INF>, T<INF>i</INF> for the 
enclosure background determination.
    (7) Allow the enclosure to stand undisturbed for four hours.
    (8) Measure the hydrocarbon concentration on the same FID and the 
methanol level. These are the final concentrations, C<INF>HCf</INF> and 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHf</INF>. Also measure final temperature and 
barometric pressure.
    (9) Calculate the mass change of methanol, hydrocarbons, and 
hydrocarbons plus methanol in the enclosure according to the equations 
in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (i) Diurnal enclosures. The enclosure background emissions 
(hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.05g for the 4 
hours.
    (ii) Running loss enclosures. The enclosure background emissions 
(hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.2 grams for the 
4 hours.
    (b) Initial determination of enclosure internal volume. Prior to its 
introduction into service the enclosure internal volume shall be 
determined by the following procedure:
    (1) Carefully measure the internal length, width and height of the 
enclosure, accounting for irregularities (such as braces) and calculate 
the internal volume. For variable-volume enclosures, latch the enclosure 
to a fixed volume when the enclosure is held at a constant temperature; 
this nominal volume shall be repeatable within <plus-minus>0.5 percent 
of the reported value.
    (2)-(3) [Reserved]
    (c) Hydrocarbon and methanol (organic gas) retention check and 
calibration. The hydrocarbon and methanol (if the enclosure is used for 
methanol-fueled vehicles) retention check provides a check upon the 
calculated volume and also measures the leak rate. The enclosure leak 
rate shall be determined prior to its introduction into service, 
following any modifications or repairs to the enclosure that may affect 
the integrity of the enclosure, and at least monthly thereafter. (The 
methanol check can be performed less frequently, provided it is 
performed at least twice annually.) If six consecutive monthly retention 
checks are successfully completed without corrective action, the 
enclosure leak rate may be determined quarterly thereafter as long as no 
corrective action is required.
    (1) An enclosure to be used for the diurnal emission test (see 
Sec. 86.133-96) shall be calibrated according to the following 
procedure. Calibration for hydrocarbon and methanol may be conducted 
simultaneously or in sequential test runs.
    (i) Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.
    (ii) Purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon 
reading is obtained.
    (iii) Turn on the mixing blowers (if not already on).
    (iv) [Reserved]
    (v) Turn on the ambient temperature control system (if not already 
on) and adjust it for an initial temperature of

[[Page 458]]

96  deg.F (36  deg.C). On variable-volume enclosures, latch the 
enclosure to the appropriate volume position for the set temperature. On 
fixed-volume enclosures close the outlet and inlet flow streams.
    (vi) When the enclosure stabilizes at 96<plus-minus>3  deg.F 
(36<plus-minus>2  deg.C), seal the enclosure and measure background 
hydrocarbon concentration, background methanol, temperature, and 
barometric pressure. These are the initial readings C<INF>HCi</INF>, 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, T<INF>i</INF>, and P<INF>Bi</INF> for the 
enclosure calibration.
    (vii) Inject into the enclosure 2 to 6 grams of pure methanol at a 
temperature of at least 150  deg.F (65  deg.C) and/or 2 to 6 grams of 
pure propane. The injected quantity may be measured by volume flow or by 
mass measurement. The method used to measure the quantity of methanol 
and propane shall have an accuracy of <plus-minus>0.2 percent of the 
measured value (less accurate methods may be used with the advance 
approval of the Administrator).
    (viii) After a minimum of 5 minutes of mixing, analyze the enclosure 
atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content, also record temperature 
and pressure. These measurements are the final readings for the 
enclosure calibration as well as the initial readings for the retention 
check.
    (ix) To verify the enclosure calibration, calculate the mass of 
propane and the mass of methanol using the measurements taken in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(vi) and (viii) of this section. See paragraph (d) of 
this section. This quantity must be within <plus-minus>2 percent of that 
measured in paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section. (For 1991-1995 
calendar years, the difference may exceed <plus-minus>2 percent for 
methanol, provided it does not exceed <plus-minus>6 percent.)
    (x) For variable-volume enclosures, unlatch the enclosure from the 
nominal volume configuration. For fixed-volume enclosures, open the 
outlet and inlet flow streams.
    (xi) Start cycling the ambient temperature from 96  deg.F to 72 
deg.F and back to 96  deg.F over a 24-hour period, according to the 
profile specified in Sec. 86.133-96 and appendix II of this part, within 
15 minutes of sealing the enclosure.
    (xii) At the completion of the 24-hour cycling period, analyze the 
enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content; determine the 
net withdrawn methanol (in the case of diurnal emission testing with 
fixed volume enclosures); record temperature and barometric pressure. 
These are the final readings for the hydrocarbon and methanol retention 
check. The final hydrocarbon and methanol mass, calculated in paragraph 
(d) of this section, shall be within three percent of that determined in 
paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section. (For 1991-1995 calendar years, 
the difference may exceed <plus-minus>3 percent for methanol, provided 
it does not exceed <plus-minus>6 percent.)
    (2) An enclosure to be used for the running loss test (see 
Sec. 86.134-96) shall meet the calibration and retention requirements of 
Sec. 86.117-90(c).
    (3) Enclosures calibrated according to the procedures specified in 
either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section may be used for hot 
soak testing (see Sec. 86.138).
    (d) Calculations. (1) The calculation of net methanol and 
hydrocarbon mass change is used to determine enclosure background and 
leak rate. It is also used to check the enclosure volume measurements. 
The methanol mass change is calculated from the initial and final 
methanol samples, the net withdrawn methanol (in the case of diurnal 
emission testing with fixed-volume enclosures), and initial and final 
temperature and pressure according to the following equation:

may be used:

    (e) Calibration of equipment for point-source testing of running 
losses. For the point-source method, the running loss fuel vapor 
sampling system shall be calibrated as a CVS system, as specified in 
Sec. 86.119, with the additional specification that the vapor sampling 
system verification be conducted as follows:
    (1) The following ``gravimetric'' technique can be used to verify 
that the vapor sampling system and analytical instruments can accurately 
measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. If the 
vapor sampling system will be used only in the testing of petroleum-
fueled engines, the system verification may be performed using propane. 
If the vapor sampling system will be used with methanol-fueled vehicles 
as well as petroleum-fueled vehicles, the system verification 
performance check must include a methanol check in addition to the 
propane check. (Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow 
metering using critical flow orifice devices.)
    (i) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane 
gas. Obtain another small cylinder that has been charged with pure 
methanol if the system will be used for methanol-fueled vehicle testing. 
Since this cylinder will be heated to 150-155  deg.F, care must be taken 
to ensure that the liquid volume of methanol placed in the cylinder does 
not exceed approximately one-half of the total volume of the cylinder.
    (ii) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 
grams.
    (iii) Operate the vapor sampling system in the normal manner and 
release a known quantity of pure propane into the most frequently used 
fuel vapor collector during the sampling period (approximately 5 
minutes).
    (iv) Continue to operate the vapor sampling system in the normal 
manner and release a known quantity of pure methanol into the system 
during the sampling period (approximately 5 minutes).
    (v) The calculations of Sec. 86.144 are performed in the normal way, 
except in the case of propane. The density of propane (17.30 g/
ft<SUP>3</SUP>/carbon atom (0.6109 kg/m<SUP>3</SUP>/carbon atom)) is 
used in place of the density of exhaust hydrocarbons. In the case of 
methanol, the density of 37.71 g/ft<SUP>3</SUP> (1.332 kg/m<SUP>3</SUP>) 
is used.
    (vi) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the vapor sampling 
system measured mass and then divided by the gravimetric mass to 
determine the percent accuracy of the system.
    (vii) The cause for any discrepancy greater than <plus-minus>2 
percent must be found and corrected.
    (2) This procedure shall be conducted in the point-source running 
loss test environment with the collector installed in a vehicle in the 
normal test configuration. The fuel of the test vehicle shall either be 
diesel, or it shall be kept under 100  deg.F (38  deg.C). Two to six 
grams of pure propane and two to six grams of pure methanol shall be 
injected into the collector while the vehicle is operated over one Urban 
Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), as described in Sec. 86.115 and 
appendix I of this part. The propane and methanol injections shall be 
conducted at the ambient temperature of 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(35<plus-minus>3  deg.C).

Sec. 86.118-78  Dynamometer calibration.

    (a) The dynamometer shall be calibrated at least once each month or 
performance verified at least once each week and then calibrated as 
required. The calibration shall consist of the manufacturer's 
recommended calibration procedure plus a determination of the 
dynamometer frictional power absorption at 50.0 mph (80.5 km/h). One 
method for determining dynamometer frictional power absorption at 50.0 
mph

[[Page 461]]

(80.5 km/h) is described below, other methods may be used if shown to 
yield equivalent results. The measured absorbed road power includes the 
dynamometer friction as well as the power absorbed by the power 
absorption unit. The dynamometer is driven above the test speed range. 
The device used to drive the dynamometer is then disengaged from the 
dynamometer and the roll(s) is (are) allowed to coast down. The kinetic 
energy of the system is dissipated by the dynamometer. This method 
neglects the variations in roll bearing friction due to the drive axle 
weight of the vehicle. The inertia of the free (rear) roll may be 
neglected in the case of dynamometers with paired rolls.
    (1) Devise a method to determine the speed of the drive roll if it 
is not already measured. A fifth wheel, revolution pickup, or other 
suitable means may be used.
    (2) Place a vehicle on the dynamometer or devise another method of 
driving the dynamometer.
    (3) Engage the inertial flywheel or other inertial simulation system 
for the most common vehicle mass category for which the dynamometer is 
used. In addition other vehicle mass categories may be calibrated, if 
desired.
    (4) Drive the dynamometer up to 50.0 mph (80.5 km/h).
    (5) Record indicated road power.
    (6) Drive the dynamometer up to 60.0 mph (96.9 km/h).
    (7) Disengage the device used to drive the dynamometer.
    (8) Record the time for the dynamometer drive roll to coastdown from 
55.0 mph (88.5 km/h) to 45 mph (72.4 km/h).
    (9) Adjust the power absorption unit to a different level.
    (10) Repeat steps (4) to (9) above sufficient times to cover the 
range of road power used.
    (11) Calculate absorbed road power (HP<INF>d</INF>). See paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (12) Plot indicated road load power at 50 mph (80.5 km/h) versus 
road load power at 50 mph (80.5 km/h) as shown in Figure B78-5.

[[Page 462]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.156

    (b) The performance check consists of conducting a dynamometer 
coastdown at one or more inertia-horsepower settings and comparing the 
coastdown time to that recorded during the last calibration. If the 
coastdown times differ by more than 1 s, a new calibration is required.
    (c) Calculations. The road load power actually absorbed by the 
dynamometer is calculated from the following equation:

HP<INF>d</INF> = (1/2) (W/32.2) (V<SUP>2</SUP><INF>1</INF> - 
    V<SUP>2</SUP><INF>2</INF>)/(550t)

where:
HP<INF>d</INF> = Power, horsepower (kilowatts)
W = Equivalent inertia, 1b (kg)
V<INF>1</INF> = Initial Velocity, ft/s (m/s) (55 mph = 88.5 km/h = 80.67 
ft/s = 24.58 m/s)
V<INF>2</INF> = Final Velocity, ft/s (m/s) (45 mph = 72.4 km/h = 66 ft/s 
= 20.11 m/s)
t = elapsed time for rolls to coast from 55 mph to 45 mph (88.5 to 72.4 
m/h)

    (Expressions in parentheses are for SI units.) When the coastdown is 
from 55 to 45 mph (88.5 to 72.4 km/h) the above equation reduces to:

HP<INF>d</INF> = 0.06073 (W/t)


for SI units,

HP<INF>d</INF> = 0.09984 (W/t)

Sec. 86.119-90  CVS calibration.

    The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor 
valve. Measurements of various parameters are made and related to flow 
through the unit. Procedures used by EPA for both PDP and CFV are 
outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used 
if approved in advance by the Administrator. After the calibration curve 
has been obtained,

[[Page 463]]

verification of the entire system can be performed by injecting a known 
mass of gas into the system and comparing the mass indicated by the 
system to the true mass injected. An indicated error does not 
necessarily mean that the calibration is wrong, since other factors can 
influence the accuracy of the system, e.g., analyzer calibration. A 
verification procedure is found in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (a) PDP calibrations. (1) The following calibration procedure 
outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various 
parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the CVS 
pump. All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured 
with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series 
with the pump. The calculated flow rate ft\3\/min (at pump inlet 
absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a 
correlation function which is the value on a specific combination of 
pump parameters. The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the 
correlation function is then determined. In the event that a CVS has a 
multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range used must be 
performed.
    (2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the 
absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the 
flow rate at each point. Three conditions must be maintained to assure 
the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve. First, the pump 
pressures should be measured at taps on the pump rather than at the 
external piping on the pump inlet and outlet. Pressure taps that are 
mounted at the top center and bottom center of the pump drive headplate 
are exposed to the actual pump cavity pressures, and therefore reflect 
the absolute pressure differentials. Secondly, temperature stability 
must be maintained during the calibration. The laminar flowmeter is 
sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations which cause the data points 
to be scattered. Gradual changes (<plus-minus>2  deg.F (1.1  deg.C)) in 
temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of 
several minutes. Finally, all connections between the flowmeter and the 
CVS pump must be absolutely void of any leakage.
    (3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same 
pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the 
calibration equation.
    (4) Connect a system as shown in Figure B90-8. Although particular 
types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent 
results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the 
system indicated, the following data with given accuracy are required:

    (5) After the system has been connected as shown in Figure B90-8, 
set the variable restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS 
pump for 20 minutes. Record the calibration data.
    (6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an 
increment of pump inlet depression (about 4 in. H<INF>2</INF>O (1.0 kPa) 
that will yield a minimum of six data points for the total calibration. 
Allow the system to stabilize for 3 minutes and repeat the data 
acquisition.
    (7) Data analysis:
    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s</INF>, at each test point is 
calculated in standard cubic feet per minute from the flowmeter data 
using the manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, 
V<INF>o</INF>, in cubic feet per revolution at absolute pump inlet 
temperature and pressure:


[[Page 465]]


V<INF>o</INF> = (Q<INF>s</INF>/n)  x  (T<INF>p</INF>/528)  x  (29.92/
P<INF>p</INF>)

Where:
(A) V<INF>o</INF> = Pump flow ft\3\/rev (m\3\/rev) at T<INF>p</INF>, 
P<INF>p</INF>.
(B) Q<INF>s</INF> = Meter air flow rate in standard cubic feet per 
minute, standard conditions are 68  deg.F, 29.92 in. Hg (20  deg.C, 
101.3 kPa).
(C) n = Pump speed in revolutions per minute.
(D)(1) T<INF>p</INF> = Pump inlet temperature,  deg.R( deg.K) = PTI + 
460.
    (2) For SI units, T<INF>p</INF> = PTI + 273.
(E)(l) P<INF>p</INF> = Absolute pump inlet pressure, in. Hg. (kPa) = 
P<INF>B</INF> - PPI (SP.GR./13.57).
(2) For SI units, P<INF>p</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> - PPI.

Where:
(F) P<INF>B</INF> = barometric pressure, in. Hg. (kPa).
(G) PPI = Pump inlet depression, in. fluid (kPa).
(H) SP.GR. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid relative to water.
    (iii) The correlation function at each test point is then calculated 
from the calibration data:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.021


Where:
(A) X<INF>o</INF> = correlation function.
(B) <greek-D> P<INF>p</INF> = the pressure differential from pump inlet 
to pump outlet, in. Hg (kPa) = P<INF>e</INF> - P<INF>p</INF>.
(C)(1) P<INF>e</INF> = Absolute pump outlet pressure, in Hg, (kPa) = 
<INF>PB</INF> + PPO (SP.GR./13.57).

(2) For SI units, P<INF>e</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> + PPO.

Where:
(D) PPO = Pressure head at pump outlet, in. fluid (kPa).
(iv) A linear least squares fit is performed to generate the calibration 
equations which have the forms:
V<INF>o</INF> = D<INF>o</INF> - M(X<INF>o</INF>)
n = A - B(<greek-D> P<INF>p</INF>)

D<INF>o</INF>, M, A, and B are the slope-intercept constants describing 
lines.
    (8) A CVS system that has multiple speeds should be calibrated on 
each speed used. The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be 
approximately parallel and the intercept values, D<INF>o</INF>, will 
increase as the pump flow range decreases.
    (9) If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated 
values from the equation will be within <plus-minus>0.50 percent of the 
measured value of V<INF>o</INF>. Values of M will vary from one pump to 
another, but values of D<INF>o</INF> for pumps of the same make, model, 
and range should agree within <plus-minus>3 percent of each other. 
Particulate influx from use will cause the pump slip to decrease as 
reflected by lower values for M. Calibrations should be performed at 
pump start-up and after major maintenance to assure the stability of the 
pump slip rate. Analysis of mass injection data will also reflect pump 
slip stability.
    (b) CFV calibration. (1) Calibration of the CFV is based upon the 
flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow is a function of inlet 
pressure and temperature:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.022


Where:

(i) Q<INF>s</INF>=Flow.
(ii) K<INF>v</INF>=Calibration coefficient.
(iii) P=Absolute pressure.
(iv) T=Absolute temperature.

The calibration procedure described below establishes the value of the 
calibration coefficient at measured values of pressure, temperature and 
air flow.
    (2) The manufacturer's recommended procedure shall be followed for 
calibrating electronic portions of the CFV.
    (3) Measurements necessary for flow calibration are as follows:

    (4) Set up equipment as shown in Figure B90-9 and check for leaks. 
Any leaks between the flow measuring device and the critical flow 
venturi will seriously affect the accuracy of the calibration.

    (5) Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the 
blower, and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all 
instruments.
    (6) Vary the flow restrictor and make at least 8 readings across the 
critical flow range of the venturi.
    (7) Data analysis: The data recorded during the calibration are to 
be used in the following calculations:
    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s</INF>, at each test point is 
calculated in standard cubic feet per minute from the flow meter data 
using the manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test 
point:

[[Page 468]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.023


Where:
(A) Q<INF>s</INF> = Flow rate in standard cubic feet per minute, 
standard conditions are 68  deg.F 29.92 in. Hg (20  deg.C, 101.3 kPa).
(B) T<INF>v</INF> = Temperature at venturi inlet,  deg.R( deg.K).
(C)(1) P<INF>v</INF> = Pressure at venturi inlet, mm Hg (kPa) = 
P<INF>B</INF> - PPI (SP.GR./13.57).
(2) For SI units, P<INF>v</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> - PPI.

Where:
(D) PPI = Venturi inlet pressure depression, in. fluid (kPa).
(E) SP.GR. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid, relative to water.
    (iii) Plot K<INF>v</INF> as a function of venturi inlet pressure. 
For sonic flow K<INF>v</INF> will have a relatively constant value. As 
pressure decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and 
K<INF>v</INF> decreases. See Figure B90-10.

    (iv) For a minimum of 8 points in the critical region calculate an 
average K<INF>v</INF> and the standard deviation.
    (v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average 
K<INF>v</INF> take corrective action.
    (8) Calculation of a parameter for monitoring sonic flow in the CFV 
during exhaust emissions tests:
    (i) Option 1. (A) CFV pressure ratio. Based upon the calibration 
data selected to meet the criteria for paragraphs (d)(7) (iv) and (v) of 
this section, in which K<INF>v</INF> is constant, select the data values 
associated with the calibration point with the lowest absolute venturi

inlet pressure. With this set of calibration data, calculated the 
following CFV pressure ratio limit, Pr<INF>ratio-lim</INF>:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18FE00.022



Where:

P<INF>in-cal</INF> = Venturi inlet pressure (PPI in absolute pressure 
units), and

P<INF>out-cal</INF> = Venturi outlet pressure (PPO in absolute pressure 
units), measured at the exit of the venturi diffuser outlet.

    (B) The venturi pressure ratio (Pr<INF>ratio-i</INF>) during all 
emissions tests must be less than, or equal to, the calibration pressure 
ratio limit (Pr<INF>ratio-lim</INF>) derived from the CFV calibration 
data, such that:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18FE00.023



Where:
P<INF>in-i</INF> and P<INF>out-i</INF> are the venturi inlet and outlet 
    pressures, in absolute pressure units, at each i-th interval during 
    the emissions test.

    (ii) Option 2. Other methods: With prior Administrator approval, any 
other method may be used that assure that the venturi operates at sonic 
conditions during emissions tests, provided the method is based upon 
sound engineering principles.
    (c) CVS System Verification. The following ``gravimetric'' technique 
can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can 
accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. 
If the CVS and analytical system will be used only in the testing of 
petroleum-fueled engines, the system verification may be performed using 
either propane or carbon monoxide. If the CVS and analytical system will 
be used with methanol-fueled vehicles as well as petroleum-fueled 
vehicles, system verification performance check must include a methanol 
check in addition to either the propane or carbon monoxide check. 
(Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using 
critical flow orifice devices.)
    (1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane 
or carbon monoxide gas (CAUTION--carbon monoxide is poisonous).
    (2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.
    (3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of 
pure propane or carbon monoxide into the system during the sampling 
period (approximately 5 minutes).
    (4) Following completion of step (3) in this paragraph (c) (if 
methanol injection is required), continue to operate the CVS in the 
normal manner and release a known quantity of pure methanol (in gaseous 
form) into the system during the sampling period (approximately five 
minutes). This step does not need to be performed with each 
verification, provided that it is performed at least twice annually.
    (5) The calculations of Sec. 86.144 are performed in the normal way, 
except in the case of propane. The density of propane (17.30 g/ft\3\/
carbon atom (0.6109 kg/m\3\/carbon atom)) is used in place of the 
density of exhaust hydrocarbons. In the case of carbon monoxide, the 
density of 32.97 g/ft\3\ (1.164 kg/m\3\) is used. In the case of 
methanol, the density of 37.71 g/ft\3\ (1.332 kg/m\3\) is used.
    (6) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass 
and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent 
accuracy of the system.
    (7) The cause for any discrepancy greater than <plus-minus>2 percent 
must be found and corrected. (For 1991-1995 calendar years, 
discrepancies greater than <plus-minus>2 percent are allowed for the 
methanol test, provided that they do not exceed <plus-minus>8 percent 
for 1991 testing or <plus-minus>6 percent for 1992-1995 testing.)

Sec. 86.120-82  Gas meter or flow instrumentation calibration, particulate measurement.

    Sampling for particulate emissions requires the use of gas meters or 
flow instrumentation to measure flow through the particulate filters. 
The

[[Page 471]]

meters or instrumentation shall receive initial and periodic 
calibrations as follows:
    (a) Install a standard air flow measurement device upstream of the 
gas meter or instrument being calibrated. This standard device shall 
measure air flow at standard conditions with an accuracy of 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent. Standard conditions are defined as 68 
deg.F (20  deg.C) and 29.92 in. Hg (101.3 kPa). A critical flow orifice, 
a bellmouth, or a laminar flow element is recommended as the standard 
device.
    (b) Flow air through the calibration system at the sample flow rate 
used for particulate testing and at the backpressure which occurs during 
the sample test.
    (c) When the temperature and pressure in the system have stabilized, 
measure the gas meter or instrument indicated volume over a time period 
of at least 5 minutes and until a flow volume of at least 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent accuracy can be determined by the 
standard device. Record the stabilized air temperature and pressure 
upstream of the gas meter or instrument being calibrated and as required 
for the standard device.
    (d) Calculate air flow at standard conditions as measured by both 
the standard device and the gas meter or instrument being calibrated.
    (e) Repeat the procedures of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section using flow rates which are 10 percent above the nominal sampling 
flow rate and 10 percent below the nominal sampling flow rate.
    (f) If the air flow at standard conditions measured by the gas meter 
or instrument being calibrated differs by more than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent from the standard measurement at any of 
the three measured flow rates, then a correction shall be made by either 
of the following two methods:
    (1) Mechanically adjust the gas meter or instrument so that it 
agrees within 1 percent of the standard measurement at the three 
specified flow rates, or
    (2) Develop a continuous best fit calibration curve for the gas 
meter (as a function of the standard device flow measurement) from the 
three calibration points that represents the data to within 1 percent at 
all points to determine corrected flow.
    (g) Other systems. A bell prover may be used to calibrate the gas 
meter if the procedure outlined in ANSI B109.1-1973 is used. Prior 
approval by the Administrator is not required to use the bell prover.

Sec. 86.120-94  Gas meter or flow instrumentation calibration; particulate, methanol and formaldehyde measurement.

    (a) Sampling for particulate, methanol and formaldehyde emissions 
requires the use of gas meters or flow instrumentation to determine flow 
through the particulate filters, methanol impingers and formaldehyde 
impingers. These instruments shall receive initial and periodic 
calibrations as follows:
    (1)(i) Install a calibration device in series with the instrument. A 
critical flow orifice, a bellmouth nozzle, a laminar flow element or an 
NBS traceable flow calibration device is required as the standard 
device.
    (ii) The flow system should be checked for leaks between the 
calibration and sampling meters, including any pumps that may be part of 
the system, using good engineering practice.
    (2) Flow air through the calibration system at the sample flow rate 
used for particulate, methanol, and formaldehyde testing and at the 
backpressure which occurs during the test.
    (3) When the temperature and pressure in the system have stabilized, 
measure the indicated gas volume over a time period of at least five 
minutes or until a gas volume of at least <plus-minus>1 percent accuracy 
can be determined by the standard device. Record the stabilized air 
temperature and pressure upstream of the instrument and as required for

    (4) Calculate air flow at standard conditions as measured by both 
the standard device and the instrument(s). (Standard conditions are 
defined as 68  deg.F (20  deg.C) and 29.92 in Hg (101.3 kPa).)
    (5) Repeat the procedures of paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this 
section using at least two flow rates which bracket the typical 
operating range.
    (6) If the air flow at standard conditions measured by the 
instrument differs by <plus-minus>1.0 percent of the maximum

[[Page 472]]

operating range or <plus-minus>2.0 percent of the point (whichever is 
smaller), then a correction shall be made by either of the following two 
methods:
    (i) Mechanically adjust the instrument so that it agrees with the 
calibration measurement at the specified flow rates using the criteria 
of paragraph (a)(6) of this section; or
    (ii) Develop a continuous best fit calibration curve for the 
instrument (as a function of the calibration device flow measurement) 
from the calibration points to determine corrected flow. The points on 
the calibration curve relative to the calibration device measurements 
must be within <plus-minus>1.0 percent of the maximum operating range of 
<plus-minus>2.0 percent of the point (whichever is smaller).
    (b) Other systems. A bell prover may be used to calibrate the 
instrument if the procedure outlined in ANSI B109.1-1973 is used. Prior 
approval by the Administrator is not required to use the bell prover.

Sec. 86.121-82  Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.

    The hydrocarbon analyzers shall receive the following initial and 
periodic calibration. The HFID shall be operated at a temperature of 
375<plus-minus>10  deg.F (191<plus-minus>6  deg.C).
    (a) Initial and periodic optimization of FID and HFID response. 
Prior to its introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, 
the FID and HFID hydrocarbon analyzers shall be adjusted for optimum 
hydrocarbon response. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may 
be used, if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions or good engineering 
practice for instrument startup and basic operating adjustment using the 
appropriate fuel and zero-grade air.
    (2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce into the 
analyzer a propane in air mixture with a propane concentration equal to 
approximately 90 percent of the most common operating range.
    (3) One of the following is required for FID or HFID optimization:
    (i) For all FIDs and HFIDs, the procedures specified by the 
applicable FID or HFID manufacturer.
    (ii) For Beckman 400 FIDs only, implementation of the 
recommendations outlined in Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) paper 
No. 770141, ``Optimization of Flame Ionization Detector for 
Determination of Hydrocarbons in Diluted Automobile Exhaust;'' author, 
Glenn D. Reschke.
    (iii) For HFIDs only, the following peaking procedure. (A) With the 
fuel and air flow rates set at the manufacturer's recommendations, 
determine the analyzer response from the difference between the span-gas 
response and the zero gas response. Incrementally adjust the fuel flow 
above and below the manufacturer's specification. Record the span and 
zero response at these fuel flows. A plot of the difference between the 
span and zero response versus the fuel flow will be similar to the one 
shown in Fig. B87-11. Adjust the fuel-flow rate to the highest setting 
that produces the maximum analyzer response.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.158

    (B) To determine the optimum air flow, use the fuel flow setting 
determined in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section and vary air 
flow.
    (iv) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in advance by 
the Administrator.
    (4) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, record them 
for future reference.
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter the FID or HFID hydrocarbon analyzers 
shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges. Use the same 
flow rate as when analyzing samples.

[[Page 473]]

    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with propane in 
air calibration gases having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 
75, and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if the 
deviation from a least squares best-fit straight line is 2 percent or 
less of the value at each data point, concentration values may be 
calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the 
deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear 
equation which represents the data to within 2 percent of each test 
point shall be used to determine concentration.

Sec. 86.121-90  Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.

    The hydrocarbon analyzers shall receive the following initial and 
periodic calibration. The HFID used with petroleum-fueled diesel 
vehicles shall be operated at a temperature of 375  deg.F<plus-minus>10 
deg.F (191  deg.<plus-minus>6  deg.C). The HFID used with methanol-
fueled vehicles shall be operated at 235  deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F 
(113<plus-minus>8  deg.C).
    (a) Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to 
its introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, the FID 
and HFID hydrocarbon analyzers shall be adjusted for optimum hydrocarbon 
response. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions or good engineering 
practice for instrument startup and basic operating adjustment using the 
appropriate FID fuel and zero-grade air.
    (2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce into the 
analyzer a propane (methane as appropriate) in air mixture (methanol in 
air mixture for methanol-fueled vehicles when optional methanol 
calibrated HFID procedure is used during the 1994 model year) with a 
propane (or methane or methanol as appropriate) concentration equal to 
approximately 90 percent of the most common operating range.
    (3) One of the following is required for FID or HFID optimization:
    (i) For all FIDs and HFIDs, the procedures specified by the 
applicable FID or HFID manufacturer.
    (ii) For Beckman 400 FIDs only, implementation of the 
recommendations outlined in Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) paper 
No. 770141, ``Optimization of Flame Ionization Detector for 
Determination of Hydrocarbons in Diluted Automobile Exhaust''; author, 
Glenn D. Reschke.
    (iii) For HFIDs only, the following peaking procedure. (A) With the 
fuel and air flow rates set in the manufacturer's recommendations, 
determine the analyzer response from the difference between the span-gas 
response and the zero gas response. Incrementally adjust the fuel flow 
above and below the manufacturer's specification. Record the span and 
zero response at these fuel flows. A plot of the difference between the 
span and zero response versus the fuel flow will be similar to the one 
shown in Fig. B87-11. Adjust the fuel-flow rate to the highest setting 
that produces the maximum analyzer response.
    (B) To determine the optimum air flow, use the fuel flow setting 
determined in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section and vary air 
flow.
    (iv) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in advance by 
the Administrator.
    (4) To determine the optimum air flow, use the FID fuel flow setting 
determined above and vary air flow.
    (5) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, record them 
for future reference.
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter the FID or HFID hydrocarbon analyzers 
shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges, and, if 
testing methanol vehicles under the procedure described in Sec. 86.107-
90(a)(2)(ii) or Sec. 86.110-90(a)(4), the methanol response factor shall 
be determined (paragraph (c) of this section). Use the same flow rate as 
when analyzing sample.
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air.

[[Page 474]]

    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with propane in 
air calibration gases (either methanol or methane in air as appropriate) 
having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 percent of 
that range. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least 
squares best-fit straight line is two percent or less of the value at 
each data point, concentration values may be calculated by use of a 
single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two 
percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents 
the data to within two percent of each test point shall be used to 
determine concentration.
    (c) FID response factor to methanol. When the FID analyzer is to be 
used for the analysis of hydrocarbon samples containing methanol, the 
methanol response factor of the analyzer shall be established. The 
methanol response factor shall be determined at several concentrations 
in the range of concentrations in the exhaust sample, using either bag 
samples or gas bottles meeting the requirements of Sec. 86.114.
    (1) The bag sample of methanol for analysis in the FID, if used, 
shall be prepared using the apparatus shown in Figure B90-11. A known 
volume of methanol is injected, using a microliter syringe, into the 
heated mixing zone (250  deg.F (121  deg.C)) of the apparatus. The 
methanol is vaporized and swept into the sample bag with a known volume 
of zero grade air measured by a gas flow meter meeting the performance 
requirements of Sec. 86.120.

    (d) FID response factor to methane. When the FID analyzer is to be 
used for the analysis of natural gas-fueled vehicle hydrocarbon samples, 
the methane response factor of the analyzer shall be established. To 
determine the total hydrocarbon FID response to methane, known methane 
in air concentrations traceable to the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) shall be analyzed by the FID. Several methane 
concentrations shall be analyzed by the FID in the range of 
concentrations in the exhaust sample. The total hydrocarbon FID response 
to methane is calculated as follows:
r<INF>CH4</INF>=FIDppm/SAMppm

Sec. 86.122-78  Carbon monoxide analyzer calibration.

    The NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer shall receive the following 
initial and periodic calibrations:
    (a) Initial and periodic interference check. Prior to its 
introduction into service and annually thereafter the NDIR carbon 
monoxide analyzer shall be checked for response to water vapor and 
CO<INF>2:
    </INF>(1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument 
startup and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance on 
the most sensitive range to be used.
    (2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Bubble a mixture of 3 percent CO<INF>2</INF> in N<INF>2</INF> 
through water at room temperature and record analyzer response.
    (4) An analyzer response of more than 1 percent of full scale for 
ranges above 300 ppm full scale or of more than 3 ppm on ranges below 
300 ppm full scale will require corrective action. (Use of conditioning 
columns is one form of corrective action which may be taken.)
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer shall 
be calibrated.
    (1) Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with carbon 
monoxide in N<INF>2</INF> calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of that range. 
Additional calibration points may be generated. For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is 2 percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration 
values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that 
range. If the deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, the best-fit 
non-linear equation which represents the data to within 2 percent of 
each test point shall be used to determine concentration.

    The chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer shall receive the 
following initial and periodic calibration.
    (a) Prior to introduction into service and at least monthly 
thereafter the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer must be 
checked for NO<INF>2</INF> to NO converter efficiency. Figure B78-9 is a 
reference for paragraphs (a) (1) through (11) of this section.
    (1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup 
and

operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Connect the outlet of the NO<INF>X</INF> generator to the sample 
inlet of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer which has been set to the most 
common operating range.
    (4) Introduce into the NO<INF>X</INF> generator analyzer-system an 
NO in nitrogen (N<INF>2</INF>) mixture with an NO concentration equal to 
approximately 80 percent of the most common operating range. The 
NO<INF>2</INF> content of the gas mixture shall be less than 5 percent 
of the NO concentration.
    (5) With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO mode, record the 
concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.160


[[Page 478]]


    (6) Turn on the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O<INF>2</INF> (or air) 
supply and adjust the O<INF>2</INF> (or air) flow rate so that the NO 
indicated by the analyzer is about 10 percent less than indicated in 
step (5). Record the concentration of NO in this NO + O<INF>2</INF> 
mixture.
    (7) Switch the NO<INF>X</INF> generator to the generation mode and 
adjust the generation rate so that the NO measured on the analyzer is 20 
percent of that measured in step (5). There must be at least 10 percent 
unreacted NO at this point. Record the concentration of residual NO.
    (8) Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
mode and measure total NO<INF>X</INF>. Record this value.
    (9) Switch off the NO<INF>X</INF> generation but maintain gas flow 
through the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the 
NO<INF>X</INF> in the NO + O<INF>2</INF> mixture. Record this value.
    (10) Turn off the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O<INF>2</INF> (or air) 
supply. The analyzer will now indicate the NO<INF>X</INF> in the 
original NO in N<INF>2</INF> mixture. This value should be no more than 
5 percent above the value indicated in step (4).
    (11) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<INF>X</INF> converted by 
substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:

Percent Efficiency = [1 + (a-b)/(c-d)]  x  100

where:
a = concentration obtained in step (8).
b = concentration obtained in step (9).
c = concentration obtained in step (6).
d = concentration obtained in step (7).


If converter efficiency is not greater than 90 percent corrective action 
will be required.
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen 
analyzer shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges. Use 
the same flow rate as when analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with NO in N2 
calibration gases having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 
and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if the 
deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 percent or 
less of the value at each data point, concentration values may be 
calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the 
deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear 
equation which represents the data to within 2 percent of each test 
point shall be used to determine concentration.
    (c) When testing methanol-fueled vehicles, it may be necessary to 
clean the analyzer frequently to prevent interference with 
NO<INF>X</INF> measurements (see EPA/600/S3-88/040).

Sec. 86.127-00  Test procedures; overview.

    Applicability. The procedures described in this and subsequent 
sections are used to determine the conformity of vehicles with the 
standards set forth in subpart A or S of this part (as applicable) for 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Except where noted, the 
procedures of paragraphs (a) through (b) of this section, Sec. 86.127-96 
(c) and (d), and the contents of Secs. 86.135-94, 86.136-90, 86.137-96, 
86.140-94, 86.142-90, and 86.144-94 are applicable for determining 
emission results for vehicle exhaust emission systems designed to comply 
with the FTP emission standards, or the FTP emission element required 
for determining compliance with composite SFTP standards. Paragraphs (f) 
and (g) of this section discuss the additional test elements of 
aggressive driving (US06) and air conditioning (SC03) that comprise the 
exhaust emission components of the SFTP. Section 86.127-96(e) discusses 
fuel spitback emissions and paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section are 
applicable to all vehicle emission test procedures. Section 86.127-00 
includes text that specifies requirements that differ from Sec. 86.127-
96. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.127-96 is identical and applicable to 
Sec. 86.127-00, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding 
paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.127-
96.''
    (a) The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling, 
parking, and operating test conditions. Vehicles are tested for any or 
all of the following emissions:
    (1) Gaseous exhaust THC, CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, CO<INF>2</INF> (for 
petroleum-fueled and gaseous- fueled vehicles), plus CH<INF>3</INF>OH 
and HCHO for methanol-fueled vehicles, plus CH<INF>4</INF> (for vehicles 
subject to the NMHC and NMHCE standards).
    (2) Particulates.
    (3) Evaporative HC (for gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and 
gaseous-fueled vehicles) and CH<INF>3</INF>OH (for methanol-fueled 
vehicles). The evaporative testing portion of the procedure occurs after 
the exhaust emission test; however, exhaust emissions need not be 
sampled to complete a test for evaporative emissions.
    (4) Fuel spitback (this test is not required for gaseous-fueled 
vehicles).
    (b) The FTP Otto-cycle exhaust emission test is designed to 
determine gaseous THC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, 
NO<INF>X</INF>, and particulate mass emissions from gasoline-fueled, 
methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles as well as 
methanol and formaldehyde from methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, 
while simulating an average trip in an urban area of 11 miles (18 
kilometers). The test consists of engine start-ups and vehicle operation 
on a chassis dynamometer through a specified driving schedule (see 
paragraph (a), EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, of appendix I to 
this part). A proportional part of the diluted exhaust is collected 
continuously for subsequent analysis,

[[Page 480]]

using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler or critical flow 
venturi sampler.
    (c) through (e) ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.127-96.''
    (f) The element of the SFTP for exhaust emissions related to 
aggressive driving (US06) is designed to determine gaseous THC, NMHC, 
CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from 
gasoline-fueled or diesel-fueled vehicles (see Sec. 86.158-00 
Supplemental test procedures; overview, and Sec. 86.159-00 Exhaust 
emission test procedures for US06 emissions). The test cycle simulates 
urban driving speeds and accelerations that are not represented by the 
FTP Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule simulated trips discussed in 
paragraph (b) of this section. The test consists of vehicle operation on 
a chassis dynamometer through a specified driving cycle (see paragraph 
(g), US06 Dynamometer Driving Schedule, of appendix I to this part). A 
proportional part of the diluted exhaust is collected continuously for 
subsequent analysis, using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler 
or critical flow venturi sampler.
    (g)(1) The element of the SFTP related to the increased exhaust 
emissions caused by air conditioning operation (SC03) is designed to 
determine gaseous THC, NMHC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from gasoline-fueled or diesel fueled vehicles 
related to air conditioning use (see Sec. 86.158-00 Supplemental federal 
test procedures; overview and Sec. 86.160-00 Exhaust emission test 
procedure for SC03 emissions). The test cycle simulates urban driving 
behavior with the air conditioner operating. The test consists of engine 
startups and vehicle operation on a chassis dynamometer through 
specified driving cycles (see paragraph (h), SC03 Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule, of appendix I to this part). A proportional part of the 
diluted exhaust is collected continuously for subsequent analysis, using 
a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi 
sampler. The testing sequence includes an approved preconditioning 
cycle, a 10 minute soak with the engine turned off, and the SC03 cycle 
with measured exhaust emissions.
    (2) The SC03 air conditioning test is conducted with the air 
conditioner operating at specified settings and the ambient test 
conditions of:
    (i) Air temperature of 95  deg.F;
    (ii) 100 grains of water/pound of dry air (approximately 40 percent 
relative humidity);
    (iii) Simulated solar heat intensity of 850 W/m \2\ (see 
Sec. 86.161-00(d)); and
    (iv) air flow directed at the vehicle that will provide 
representative air conditioner system condenser cooling at all vehicle 
speeds (see Sec. 86.161-00(e)).
    (3) Manufacturers have the option of simulating air conditioning 
operation during testing at other ambient test conditions provided they 
can demonstrate that the vehicle tail pipe exhaust emissions are 
representative of the emissions that would result from the SC03 cycle 
test procedure and the ambient conditions of paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section. The Administrator has approved two optional air conditioning 
test simulation procedures AC1 and AC2 (see Sec. 86.162-00) for only the 
model years of 2000 through 2002. If a manufacturer desires to conduct 
simulation SC03 testing for model year 2003 and beyond, the simulation 
test procedure must be approved in advance by the Administrator (see 
Secs. 86.162-00 and 86.163-00).
    (h) Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all 
emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motor 
vehicle shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. 
Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be 
authorized in accordance with Sec. 86.098-25 or Sec. 86.1834-01 as 
applicable.
    (i) Background concentrations are measured for all species for which 
emissions measurements are made. For exhaust testing, this requires 
sampling and analysis of the dilution air. For evaporative testing, this 
requires measuring initial concentrations. (When testing methanol-fueled 
vehicles, manufacturers may choose not to measure background

Sec. 86.127-90  Test procedures; overview.

    The procedures described in this and subsequent sections are used to 
determine the conformity of vehicles with the standards set forth in 
subpart A for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.
    (a) The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling, 
parking and operating conditions. Vehicles are tested for any or all of 
the following emissions:
    (1) Gaseous exhaust HC, CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, CO<INF>2</INF> (for 
petroleum-fueled vehicles), plus CH<INF>3</INF>OH and HCHO for methanol-
fueled vehicles (measurement of CH<INF>3</INF>OH and HCHO may be omitted 
for 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles provided a 
HFID calibrated on methanol is used for measuring HC plus 
CH<INF>3</INF>OH).
    (2) Particulates (diesel vehicles).
    (3) Evaporative HC (for gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled 
vehicles) and CH<INF>3</INF>OH (for methanol-fueled vehicles). A 
separate CH<INF>3</INF>OH measurement may be omitted for 1990 through 
1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles provided a HFID calibrated on 
methanol is used for measuring HC plus CH<INF>3</INF>OH.
    The evaporative portion of the test procedure occurs before and 
after the exhaust emission test, and in some cases, during the exhaust 
emission test.
    (b) The Otto-cycle exhaust emission test is designed to determine 
gaseous hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of 
nitrogen mass emissions from gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled 
vehicles as well as methanol and formaldehyde from methanol-fueled Otto-
cycle vehicles while simulating an average trip in an urban area of 7.5 
miles (12.1 kilometers). The test consists of engine startups and 
vehicle operation on a chassis dynamometer, through a specified driving 
schedule. A proportional part of the diluted exhaust is collected 
continuously for subsequent analysis, using a constant volume (variable 
dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi sampler.
    (c) The diesel exhaust emission test is designed to determine 
particulate and gaseous mass emissions during a test similar to the test 
in Sec. 86.127(b). For petroleum-fueled vehicles, diluted exhaust is 
continuously analyzed for total hydrocarbons using a heated sample line 
and analyzer. The other gaseous emissions, CO, CO<INF>2</INF> and 
NO<INF>X</INF> are collected continuously for analysis as in 
Sec. 86.127(b). For methanol-fueled vehicles, hydrocarbons, methanol, 
formaldehyde, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF> are collected 
continuously for analysis as in Sec. 86.127(b). Hydrocarbons, methanol 
and formaldehyde are collected using heated sample lines, and a heated 
FID is used for hydrocarbons analyses. Simultaneous with the gaseous 
exhaust collection and analysis, particulates from a proportional part 
of the diluted exhaust are collected continuously on a filter. The mass 
of particulate is determined by the procedure described in Sec. 86.139. 
This testing requires a dilution tunnel as well as the constant volume 
sampler.
    (d) The evaporative emission test (gasoline-fueled vehicles and 
methanol-fueled vehicles) is designed to determine hydrocarbon and 
methanol evaporative emissions as a consequence of diurnal temperature 
fluctuation, urban driving, and hot soaks during parking. It is 
associated with a series of events representative of a motor vehicle's 
operation, which result in hydrocarbon and/or methanol vapor losses. The 
test procedure is designed to measure:
    (1) Diurnal breathing losses resulting from daily temperature 
changes, measured by the enclosure technique;
    (2) Running losses from suspected sources (if indicated by 
engineering analysis or vehicle inspection) resulting from a simulated 
trip on a chassis dynamometer, measured by carbon traps; and
    (3) Hot soak losses, which result when the vehicle is parked and the 
hot engine is turned off, measured by the enclosure technique.
    (e) Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all 
emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motor 
vehicle shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. 
Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be 
authorized in accordance with Sec. 86.088-25.

Sec. 86.127-94  Test procedures; overview.

    The procedures described in this and subsequent sections are used to 
determine the conformity of vehicles with the standards set forth in 
subpart A of this part for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.
    (a) The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling, 
parking, and operating conditions. Vehicles are tested for any or all of 
the following emissions:
    (1) Gaseous exhaust THC, CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, CO<INF>2</INF> (for 
petroleum-fueled vehicles), plus CH<INF>3</INF>OH and HCHO for methanol-
fueled vehicles, plus CH<INF>4</INF> (for vehicles subject to the NMHC 
and NMHCE standards). (Measurement of CH<INF>3</INF>OH and HCHO may be 
omitted for 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles 
provided a HFID calibrated on methanol is used for measuring THC plus 
CH<INF>3</INF>OH.)
    (2) Particulates.
    (3) Evaporative HC (for gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled 
vehicles) and CH<INF>3</INF>OH (for methanol-fueled vehicles). A 
separate CH<INF>3</INF>OH measurement may be omitted for 1990 through 
1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles provided a HFID calibrated on 
methanol is used for measuring HC plus CH<INF>3</INF>OH.
    (b) The Otto-cycle exhaust emission test is designed to determine 
gaseous THC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF>, and 
particulate mass emissions from gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled 
Otto-cycle vehicles as well as methanol and formaldehyde from methanol-

CO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF>) are collected continuously for 
analysis as in Sec. 86.127(b). For methanol-fueled vehicles, THC, 
methanol, formaldehyde, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and 
NO<INF>X</INF> are collected continuously for analysis as in 
Sec. 86.127(b). THC, methanol, and formaldehyde are collected using 
heated sample lines, and a heated FID is used for THC analyses. 
Simultaneous with the gaseous exhaust collection and analysis, 
particulates from a proportional part of the diluted exhaust are 
collected continuously on a filter. The mass of particulate is 
determined by the procedure described in Sec. 86.139. This testing 
requires a dilution tunnel as well as the constant volume sampler.

    (3) Hot soak losses, which result when the vehicle is parked and the 
hot engine is turned off, measured by the enclosure technique.
    (e) Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all 
emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motor 
vehicle shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. 
Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be 
authorized in accordance with Sec. 86.090-25.
    (f) Background concentrations are measured for all species for which 
emissions measurements are made. For exhaust testing, this requires 
sampling and analysis of the dilution air. For evaporative testing, this 
requires measuring initial concentrations.

(When testing methanol-fueled vehicles, manufacturers may choose not to 
measure background concentrations of methanol and/or formaldehyde, and 
then assume that the concentrations are zero during calculations.)

Sec. 86.127-96  Test procedures; overview.

    The procedures described in this and subsequent sections are used to 
determine the conformity of vehicles with the standards set forth in 
subpart A of this part for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.
    (a) The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling, 
parking, and operating conditions. Vehicles are tested for any or all of 
the following emissions:
    (1) Gaseous exhaust THC, CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, CO<INF>2</INF> (for 
petroleum-fueled and gaseous-fueled vehicles), plus CH<INF>3</INF>OH and 
HCHO for methanol-fueled vehicles, plus CH<INF>4</INF> (for vehicles 
subject to the NMHC and NMHCE standards).
    (2) Particulates.
    (3) Evaporative HC (for gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and 
gaseous-fueled vehicles) and CH<INF>3</INF>OH (for methanol-fueled 
vehicles). The evaporative testing portion of the procedure occurs after 
the exhaust emission test; however, exhaust emissions need not be 
sampled to complete a test for evaporative emissions.
    (4) Fuel spitback (this test is not required for gaseous-fueled 
vehicles).
    (b) The Otto-cycle exhaust emission test is designed to determine 
gaseous THC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF>, and 
particulate mass emissions from gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and 
gaseous-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles as well as methanol and formaldehyde 
from methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, while simulating an average 
trip in an urban area of 11 miles (18 kilometers). The test consists of 
engine start-ups and vehicle operation on a chassis dynamometer through 
a specified driving schedule. A proportional part of the diluted exhaust 
is collected continuously for subsequent analysis, using a constant 
volume (variable dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi sampler.
    (c) The diesel-cycle exhaust emission test is designed to determine 
particulate and gaseous mass emissions during a test similar to the test 
in Sec. 86.127(b). For petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles, diluted 
exhaust is continuously analyzed for THC using a heated sample line and 
analyzer; the other gaseous emissions (CH<INF>4</INF>, CO, 
CO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF>) are collected continuously for 
analysis as in Sec. 86.127(b). For methanol-fueled vehicles, THC, 
methanol, formaldehyde, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and 
NO<INF>X</INF> are collected continuously for analysis as in 
Sec. 86.127(b). THC, methanol, and formaldehyde are collected using 
heated sample lines, and a heated FID is used for THC analyses. 
Simultaneous with the gaseous exhaust collection and analysis, 
particulates from a proportional part of the diluted exhaust are 
collected continuously on a filter. The mass of particulate is 
determined by the procedure described in Sec. 86.139. This testing 
requires a dilution tunnel as well as the constant volume sampler.
    (d) The evaporative emission test (gasoline-fueled vehicles, 
methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled vehicles) is designed to determine 
hydrocarbon and methanol evaporative emissions as a consequence of 
diurnal temperature fluctuation, urban driving and hot soaks following 
drives. It is associated with a series of events that a vehicle may 
experience and that may result in hydrocarbon and/or methanol vapor 
losses. The test procedure is designed to measure:
    (1) Diurnal emissions resulting from daily temperature changes (as 
well as relatively constant resting losses), measured by the enclosure 
technique (see Sec. 86.133);
    (2) Running losses resulting from a simulated trip performed on a 
chassis dynamometer, measured by the enclosure or point-source technique 
(see Sec. 86.134; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled 
vehicles); and
    (3) Hot soak emissions, which result when the vehicle is parked and 
the hot engine is turned off, measured by the enclosure technique (see 
Sec. 86.138).
    (e) Fuel spitback emissions occur when a vehicle's fuel fill neck 
cannot accommodate dispensing rates. The vehicle test for spitback 
consists of a short drive followed immediately by a complete refueling 
event. This test is

[[Page 484]]

not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.
    (f) Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all 
emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motor 
vehicle shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. 
Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be 
authorized in accordance with Sec. 86.090-25.
    (g) Background concentrations are measured for all species for which 
emissions measurements are made. For exhaust testing, this requires 
sampling and analysis of the dilution air. For evaporative testing, this 
requires measuring initial concentrations. (When testing methanol-fueled 
vehicles, manufacturers may choose not to measure background 
concentrations of methanol and/or formaldehyde, and then assume that the 
concentrations are zero during calculations.)

    Section 86.128-00 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.128-79. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.128-79 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.128-00, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.128-79.''
    (a) through (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.128-79.
    (d) The vehicle shall be driven with appropriate accelerator pedal 
movement necessary to achieve the speed versus time relationship 
prescribed by the driving schedule. Both smoothing of speed variations 
and excessive accelerator pedal perturbations are to be avoided.
    (e) through (h) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.128-79.

<R05>
Sec. 86.128-79  Transmissions.

    (a) All test conditions, except as noted, shall be run according to 
the manufacturer's recommendations to the ultimate purchaser, Provided, 
That: Such recommendations are representative of what may reasonably be 
expected to be followed by the ultimate purchaser under in-use 
conditions.
    (b) Vehicles equipped with free wheeling or overdrive, except as 
noted, shall be tested with these features operated according to the 
manufacturer's recommendations to the ultimate purchaser.
    (c) Idle modes less than one minute in length shall be run with 
automatic transmissions in ``Drive'' and the wheels braked; manual 
transmissions shall be in gear with the clutch disengaged, except for 
the first idle mode (see Secs. 86.134, 86.136, and 86.137). The first 
idle mode and idle modes longer than one minute in length may be run 
with automatic transmissions in ``Neutral;'' manual transmissions may be 
in ``Neutral'' with the clutch engaged (clutch may be disengaged for 
engine start-up). If an automatic transmission is in ``Neutral'' during 
an idle mode, it shall be placed in ``Drive'' with the wheels braked at 
least 5 seconds before the end of the idle mode. If a manual 
transmission is in ``Neutral'' during an idle mode, it shall be placed 
in gear with the clutch disengaged at least 5 seconds before the end of 
the idle mode.
    (d) The vehicle shall be driven with minimum accelerator pedal 
movement to maintain the desired speed.
    (e) Accelerations shall be driven smoothly following representative 
shift speeds and procedures. For manual transmissions, the operator 
shall release the accelerator pedal during each shift and accomplish the 
shift with minimum time. If the vehicle cannot accelerate at the 
specified rate, the vehicle shall be operated at maximum available power 
until the vehicle speed reaches the value prescribed for that time in 
the driving schedule.
    (f) The deceleration modes shall be run in gear using brakes or 
accelerator pedal as necessary to maintain the desired speed. Manual 
transmission vehicles shall have the clutch engaged and shall not change 
gears from the previous mode. For those modes which decelerate to zero, 
manual transmission clutches shall be depressed when the speed drops 
below 15 mph (24.1 km/h), when engine roughness is evident, or when 
engine stalling is imminent.

[[Page 485]]

    (g)(1) In the case of test vehicles equipped with manual 
transmissions, the transmission shall be shifted in accordance with 
procedures which are representative of shift patterns that may 
reasonably be expected to be followed by vehicles in use, in terms of 
such variables as vehicle speed or percent rated engine speed. At the 
Administrator's discretion, a test vehicle may also be shifted according 
to the shift procedures recommended by the manufacturer to the ultimate 
purchaser, if such procedures differ from those which are reasonably 
expected to be followed by vehicles in use.
    (2) A manufacturer may recommend to the ultimate purchaser shift 
procedures other than those used in testing by the EPA, Provided that: 
All shift procedures (including multiple shift speeds) which the 
manufacturer proposes to supply to the ultimate purchaser are provided 
to the Administrator as part of the manufacturer's application for 
certification, or as an amendment to such application, under 
Sec. 86.079-32, Sec. 86.079-33, Sec. 86.082-34, or Sec. 86.1844-01 as 
applicable.
    (h) Downshifting is allowed at the beginning of or during a power 
mode in accordance with the shift procedure determined in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section.

Sec. 86.129-00   Road load power, test weight, and inertia weight class determination.

    Applicability. Section 86.129-94 (a) applies to all vehicle testing. 
Section 86.129-80 (b) and (c) are applicable to vehicles from engine 
families which are not required to meet SFTP requirements, although a 
manufacturer may elect to use the requirements in paragraphs (e) and (f) 
of this section instead of Sec. 86.129-80 (b) and (c) on any vehicle. 
Section 86.129-94(d) which discusses fuel temperature profile, is 
applicable to evaporative emission running loss testing. Paragraphs (e) 
and (f) of this section are applicable to vehicles from engine families 
required to comply with SFTP requirements. Section 86.129-00 includes 
text that specifies requirements that differ from Sec. 86.129-80 or 
Sec. 86.129-94. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.129-80 or Sec. 86.129-94 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.129-00, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.129-80.'' or ``[Reserved]. For guidance see 
Sec. 86.129-94.''
    (a) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.129-94.
    (b) through (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.129-80.
    (d) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.129-94.
    (e)(1) For each test vehicle from an engine family required to 
comply with SFTP requirements, the manufacturer shall supply 
representative road load forces for the vehicle at speeds between 15 km/
hr (9.3 mph) and 115 km/hr (71.5 mph). The road load force shall 
represent vehicle operation on a smooth level road, during calm winds, 
with no precipitation, at an ambient temperature of 20  deg.C (68 
deg.F), and atmospheric pressure of 98.21 kPa. Road load force for low 
speed may be extrapolated. Manufacturers may, at their option, use road 
load forces meeting the objectives of paragraph (f) of this section for 
any vehicle.
    (2) The dynamometer's power absorption shall be set for each 
vehicle's emission test sequence such that the force imposed during 
dynamometer operation matches actual road load force at all speeds.
    (3) The 10 percent adjustment in road load power for air 
conditioning discussed in Sec. 86.129-80(b)(3), is not applicable when 
road load forces are determined for dynamometer testing using paragraphs 
(e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (f)(1) Required test dynamometer inertia weight class selections for 
the test elements of FTP, US06, and SC03 are determined by the test 
vehicles test weight basis and corresponding equivalent weight as listed 
in the tabular information of Sec. 86.129-94(a). With the exception of 
the fuel economy test weight information in footnote 4 to the table in 
Sec. 86.129-94(a), none of the other footnotes to the tabular listing 
apply to emission tests utilizing an approved single roll dynamometer or 
equivalent dynamometer configuration. All light-duty vehicles and light 
light-duty

[[Page 486]]

trucks are to be tested at the inertia weight class corresponding to 
their equivalent test weight.
    (i) For light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks, test weight 
basis is loaded vehicle weight, which is the vehicle weight plus 300 
pounds.
    (ii) For heavy light-duty trucks, the definition of test weight 
basis varies depending on the SFTP test element being tested.
    (A) For the aggressive driving cycle (US06), the test weight basis 
is the vehicle curb weight plus 300 pounds.
    (B) For the FTP and the air conditioning (SC03) element of the SFTP, 
the test weight is the average of the curb weight plus GVWR.
    (C) Regardless of other requirements in this section relating to the 
testing of HLDTs, for Tier 2 HLDTs, the test weight basis for FTP and 
SFTP testing (both US06 and SC03), if applicable, is the vehicle curb 
weight plus 300 pounds. For MDPVs certified to standards in bin 11 in 
Tables S04-1 and 2 in Sec. 86.1811-04, the test weight basis must be 
adjusted loaded vehicle weight (ALVW) as defined in this part.
    (2) Dynamic inertia load adjustments may be made to the test inertia 
weight during specific US06 acceleration events when wide open throttle 
operation is equal to or greater than eight (8) seconds (see 
Sec. 86.108-00). The dynamic inertia weight adjustment procedure must be 
approved in advance of conducting official US06 testing. The 
Administrator will perform confirmatory US06 testing using the same 
dynamometer inertia adjustment procedures as the manufacturer if:
    (i) The manufacturer submits a request to the Administrator; and
    (ii) The manufacturer provides the dynamometer hardware and/or 
software necessary for these adjustments to the Administrator.

\1\ For all light-duty trucks except vans, and for heavy duty vehicles
  optionally certified as light-duty trucks, the road load power
  (horsepower) at 50 mi/h shall be 0.58 times B (defined below) rounded
  to the nearest \1/2\ hp.
\2\ For vans, the road load power at 50 mi/h (horsepower) shall be 0.50
  times B (defined below) rounded to the nearest \1/2\ hp.
\3\ B is the basic vehicle frontal area (square foot) plus the
  additional frontal area (square foot) of mirrors and optional
  equipment exceeding 0.1 ft\2\ which are anticipated to be sold on more
  than 33 pct of the car line. Frontal area measurements shall be
  computed to the nearest 10th of a square foot using a method approved
  in advanced by the administrator.
\4\ Light-duty vehicles over 5,750 lb loaded vehicle weight shall be
  tested at a 5,500 lb equivalent test weight.

    (b) Power absorption unit adjustment--light-duty trucks. (1) The 
power absorption unit shall be adjusted to reproduce road load power at 
50 mph true speed. The indicated road load power setting shall take into 
account the dynamometer friction. The relationship between road load 
(absorbed) power and indicated road load power for a particular 
dynamometer shall be determined by the procedure outlined in Sec. 86.118 
or other suitable means.
    (2) The road load power listed in the table above shall be used or 
the vehicle manufacturer may determine the road load power by an 
alternate procedure requested by the manufacturer and approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (3) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a car line 
within an engine-system combination will be equipped with air 
conditioning per Sec. 86.080-24(g)(2), the road load power listed above 
or as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be increased 
by 10 percent, up to a maximum increase of 1.4 horsepower, for testing 
all test vehicies representing that car line within that engine-system 
combination if those vehicles are intended to be offered with air 
conditioning in production. The above increase for air conditioning 
shall be added prior to rounding off as instructed by notes 2 and 3 of 
the table.
    (c) Power absorption unit adjustment--light-duty vehicles. (1) The 
power absorption unit shall be adjusted to reproduce road load power at 
50 mph true speed. The dynamometer power absorption shall take into 
account the dynamometer friction, as discussed in Sec. 86.118.
    (2) The dynamometer road load setting is determined from the 
equivalent test weight, the reference frontal area, the body shape, the 
vehicle protuberances, and the tire type by the following equations.
    (i) For light-duty vehicles to be tested on a twin roll dynamometer.

                            Hp = aA + P + tW

where:

Hp = the dynamometer power absorber setting at 50 mph (horsepower).
A = the vehicle reference frontal area (ft\2\). The vehicle reference 
frontal area is defined as the area of the orthogonal projection of the 
vehicle; including tires and suspension components, but excluding 
vehicle protuberances, onto a plane perpendicular to both the 
longitudinal plane of the vehicle and the surface upon which the vehicle 
is positioned. Measurements of this area shall be computed to the 
nearest tenth of a square foot using a method approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
P = the protuberance power correction factor from table 1 of this 
paragraph (horsepower).
W = vehicle equivalent test weight (lbs) from the table in paragraph 
(a).
a = 0.43 for fastback-shaped vehicles; = 0.50 for all other light duty 
vehicles.
t = 0.0 for vehicles equipped with radial ply tires; = 3  x  
10<SUP>- 4</SUP> for all other vehicles.

    A vehicle is considered to have a fastback shape if the rearward 
projection of that portion of the rear surface (A<INF>b</INF>) which 
slopes at an angle of less than 20 degrees from the horizontal is at 
least 25 percent as large as the vehicle reference frontal area. In 
addition, this surface must be smooth, continuous, and free from any 
local transitions greater than four degrees. An example of a fastback 
shape is presented in Figure 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The protuberance frontal area, A<INF>p</INF>, is defined in a manner 
analogous to the definition of the vehicle reference frontal area, i.e., 
the total area of the orthogonal projections of the vehicle mirrors, 
hood ornaments, roof racks, and other protuberance onto a plane(s) 
perpendicular to both the longitudinal plane of the vehicle and the 
surface upon which the vehicle is positioned. A protuberance is defined 
as any fixture attached to the vehicle protruding more than 1 inch from 
the vehicle surface and having a projected area greater than 0.01 ft\2\ 
with the area calculated by a method approved in advance by the 
Administrator. Included in the total protuberance frontal area shall be 
all fixtures which occur as standard equipment. The area of any optional 
equipment shall also be included if it is expected that more than 33 
percent of the car line sold will be equipped with this option.

    (ii) The dynamometer power absorber setting for light-duty vehicles 
shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 horsepower.
    (iii) For light-duty vehicles to be tested on a single, large roll 
dynamometer.

           Hp = aA + P + (5.0  x  10 <SUP>- 4</SUP> + 0.33t)W

All symbols in the above equation are defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section. The rounding criteria of paragraph (c)(2)(i) also apply to 
this paragraph.

    (3) The road load power calculated above shall be used or the 
vehicle manufacturer may determine the road load power by an alternate 
procedure requested by the manufacturer and approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (4) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a car line 
within an engine-system combination will be equipped with air 
conditioning, per Sec. 86.080-24(g)(2), the road load power as 
determined in paragraph (c) (2) or (3) of this section shall be 
increased by 10 percent up to a maximum increment of 1.4 horsepower, for 
testing all test vehicles of that car line within that engine-system 
combination if those vehicles are intended to be offered with air 
conditioning in production. This power increment shall be added to the 
indicated dynamometer power absorption setting prior to rounding off 
this value.

\1\ For all light-duty trucks except vans, and for heavy-duty vehicles
  optionally certified as light-duty trucks, and for complete heavy-duty
  vehicles, the road load power (horsepower) at 50 mi/h shall be 0.58
  times B (defined in footnote 3 of this table) rounded to the nearest
  \1/2\ horsepower.
\2\ For vans, the road load power at 50 mi/h (horsepower) shall be 0.50
  times B (defined in footnote 3 of this table) rounded to the nearest

\3\ B is the basic vehicle frontal area (square foot) plus the
  additional frontal area (square foot) of mirrors and optional
  equipment exceeding 0.1 ft <SUP>2</SUP> which are anticipated to be sold on more
  than 33 percent of the car line. Frontal area measurements shall be
  computed to the nearest 10th of a square foot using a method approved
  in advance by the Administrator.
\4\ For model year 1994 and later heavy light-duty trucks not subject to
  the Tier 0 standards of Sec.  86.094-9, test weight basis is as
  follows: for emissions tests, the basis shall be adjusted loaded

  tests, the basis shall be loaded vehicle weight, as defined in Sec.
  86.082-2, or, at the manufacturer's option, adjusted loaded vehicle
  weight as defined in Sec.  86.094-2. For all other vehicles, test
  weight basis shall be loaded vehicle weight, as defined in Sec.
  86.082-2.
\5\ Light-duty vehicles over 5,750 lb. loaded vehicle weight shall be
  tested at a 5,500 lb. equivalent test weight.

    (b) through (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.129-80.
    (d) Fuel temperature profile--(1) General requirements. (i) To be 
tested for running losses, as specified in Sec. 86.134, a vehicle must 
have a fuel temperature profile. The following procedure is used to 
generate the fuel temperature profile, which serves as a target for 
controlling fuel temperatures during the running loss test. This profile 
represents the fuel temperature change that occurs during on-road 
driving. If a vehicle has more than one fuel tank, a profile shall be 
established for each tank. Manufacturers may also simultaneously 
generate a profile for vapor temperatures.
    (ii) If a manufacturer uses a vehicle model to develop a profile to 
represent multiple models, the vehicle model selected must have the 
greatest expected fuel temperature increase during driving of all those 
models it represents. Also, manufacturers must select test vehicles with 
any available vehicle options that increase fuel temperatures during 
driving (for example, any feature that limits underbody airflow).
    (iii) Manufacturers may conduct testing to develop fuel temperature 
profiles in a laboratory setting, subject to approval by the 
Administrator. The laboratory facility should simulate outdoor testing 
to reproduce fuel and vapor temperature behavior over the specified 
driving schedule. The design of the laboratory facility should include 
consideration of any parameters that may affect fuel temperatures, such 
as solar loading, pavement heat, and relative wind velocities around and 
underneath the test vehicle. Indoor testing to develop the fuel 
temperature profiles must be conducted with little or no vehicle-
specific adjustment of laboratory parameters. Manufacturers would need 
to maintain an ongoing demonstration of correlation between laboratory 
and outdoor measurement of fuel temperatures. Specifically, fuel

[[Page 490]]

temperatures and pressures from indoor driving should be at least as 
high as measured when driving outdoors according to the procedures 
described in this section.
    (iv) Small-volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.094-14(b)(1), 
may use an alternate method for generating fuel temperature profiles, 
subject to the approval of the Administrator.
    (v) The Administrator may conduct testing to establish any vehicle's 
temperature profiles or to verify compliance with fuel tank pressure 
requirements.
    (2) Vehicle instrumentation. (i) The vehicle must be equipped with 
temperature sensors and pressure transducers, as described in 
Sec. 86.107-96 (e) and (f), and a driver's aid, which shall be 
configured to provide the test driver with the desired vehicle speed vs. 
time trace and the actual vehicle speed.
    (ii) A computer, data logger, or strip chart data recorder shall 
record the following parameters at a minimum during the test run:
    (A) Desired speed;
    (B) Actual speed;
    (C) Instantaneous average liquid fuel temperature (T<INF>liq</INF>); 
and
    (D) Vapor space pressure (the Administrator may omit measurement of 
fuel tank pressure).
    (iii) The data recording system described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of 
this section shall be capable of resolving time to <plus-minus>1 s, 
capable of resolving temperature to <plus-minus>2  deg.F, capable of 
resolving pressure to <plus-minus>1.0 inch of water, and capable of 
resolving speed to <plus-minus>1 mph. The temperature and pressure 
signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 minute; speed signals 
shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 second.
    (3) Ambient conditions. The procedure shall be run under the 
following ambient conditions. Conditions should be representative of 
sunny summer days.
    (i) Starting ambient temperature (T<INF>amb,o</INF>) shall be at 
least 95  deg.F, steady or increasing (no more than 2  deg.F drop) 
during the procedure. Ambient temperature shall be measured and recorded 
in regular intervals of at least once every 5 minutes. Measure ambient 
temperature with the following requirements (based on Federal Standard 
for Siting Meteorological Sensors at Airports, FCM-S4-1987). The sensors 
shall be mounted 5<plus-minus>1 feet (1.5<plus-minus>0.3 meters) above 
ground level. The sensors shall be protected from radiation from the 
sun, sky, earth, and any other surrounding objects, but at the same time 
be adequately ventilated. The sensors shall be installed in such a 
position as to ensure that measurements are representative of the free 
air circulation in the locality and not influenced by artificial 
conditions such as large buildings, cooling towers, and expanses of 
concrete and tarmac. Keep any grass and vegetation within 100 feet (30 
meters) of the sensor clipped to a height of about 10 inches (25 
centimeters) or less.
    (ii) Wind conditions shall be calm to light with maximum wind speed 
of 15 mph. In the case of temporary gusting, wind speeds between 15 and 
25 mph may occur for up to 5 percent of the total driving time without 
invalidating the data collection. Wind speed shall be measured and 
recorded in regular intervals of at least once per minute. Measure wind 
speed with the following requirements (based on Federal Standard for 
Siting Meteorological Sensors at Airports, FCM-S4-1987). The site should 
be relatively level, but small gradual slopes are acceptable. The sensor 
shall be mounted 30 to 33 feet (9 to 10 meters) above the average ground 
height within a radius of 500 feet (150 meters). The sensor height shall 
not exceed 33 feet, except as necessary to be at least 15 feet (5 
meters) above the height of any obstruction (e.g. vegetation, buildings, 
etc.) within a 500 foot (150 meter) radius. An object is considered to 
be an obstruction if the included lateral angle from the sensor to the 
ends of the object is 10 degrees or more.
    (iii) Road surface temperature shall be at least 125  deg.F 
throughout the driving period. Pavement temperature shall be measured 
and recorded in regular intervals of at least once per minute. The track 
temperature may be measured with an embedded sensor, a portable 
temperature probe, or an infrared pyrometer that can provide an accuracy 
of <plus-minus>2  deg.F. Temperatures must be measured on a surface 
representative of the surface where the vehicle is driven.

[[Page 491]]

    (iv) Conditions shall be sunny or mostly sunny with a maximum cloud 
cover of 25 percent.
    (v) Reported cloud cover, wind speed, and ambient temperature should 
be consistent with that reported by the nearest weather station; the 
Administrator may request justification of any discrepancy.
    (4) Profile determination procedure. (i) Drain the fuel tank(s) and 
fill with test fuel to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-
2. The test fuel should meet the specifications of Sec. 86.113, except 
that fuel with a lower volatility may be used, subject to Administrator 
approval. Manufacturers using a lower volatility fuel must generate a 
vapor temperature profile for demonstrating compliance with the limit on 
fuel tank pressure during the running loss test (see Sec. 86.134-96).
    (ii) The vehicle shall be moved to the location where the data is to 
be collected. It may be driven a maximum distance of 5 miles and may 
also be transported by other means. The vehicle shall be stabilized by 
one of the following methods:
    (A) The vehicle shall be parked for a minimum of 12 hours in an open 
area on a surface that is representative of the test road, without any 
artificial heating or cooling of the fuel. The orientation of the front 
of the vehicle during parking (e.g., N, SW, etc.) shall be documented.
    (B) The vehicle may be soaked in a temperature-controlled 
environment to stabilize fuel temperatures. Before starting the drive, 
the vehicle shall be stabilized with fuel temperatures 95 <plus-minus>3 
deg.F for at least one hour. The fuel temperature may not exceed 98 
deg.F at any time before the beginning of the driving schedule, during 
which only whole-vehicle heating and cooling may be used to control fuel 
temperatures. If a manufacturer uses the provisions of paragraph 
(d)(7)(v) of this section to establish a lower initial fuel temperature 
for the running loss test, the fuel in the test vehicle may not be 
stabilized at a temperature higher than the newly established initial 
fuel temperature.
    (iii) Once the ambient conditions specified in paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section are met and the vehicle has been stabilized according to 
paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, the vehicle's engine may be 
started. The vehicle's air conditioning system (if so equipped) shall be 
set to the ``normal'' air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum 
discharge air temperature and high fan speed. Vehicles equipped with 
automatic temperature controlled air conditioning systems shall be set 
to operate in ``automatic'' temperature and fan modes with the system 
set at 72  deg.F.
    (iv) The vehicle may be operated at minimum throttle for a period up 
to 60 seconds prior to the start of the driving schedule, as necessary 
to move from the parking location onto the road surface. The driver's 
aid shall be started and the vehicle operated over the driving cycle 
specified in Sec. 86.134-96(b) with the transmission operated in the 
same manner as specified in Sec. 86.128-79. The data recording system 
shall provide a record of the required parameters over the entire period 
of driving.
    (5) Records required. In addition to the vehicle data recording, the 
following parameters shall be documented for the determination of the 
fuel temperature profile:
    (i) Date and time of vehicle fueling;
    (ii) Odometer reading at vehicle fueling;
    (iii) Date and time vehicle was parked, parking location and 
orientation;
    (iv) Odometer reading at parking;
    (v) Date and time engine was started;
    (vi) Time of initiation of first UDDS;
    (vii) Time of completion of the driving cycle;
    (viii) Ambient temperatures throughout the period of driving 
(T<INF>amb</INF>);
    (ix) Wind speed throughout the period of driving;
    (x) Track surface temperatures throughout the period of driving 
cycle (T<INF>sur</INF>);
    (xi) Percent cloud cover during the period of driving; and
    (xii) Ambient temperature, wind speed, and percent cloud cover 
reported by the nearest weather station for the time corresponding most 
closely to the period of driving.
    (6) Fuel tank pressure. Tank pressure shall not exceed 10 inches of 
water at any time during the temperature profile determination unless a 
pressurized

[[Page 492]]

system is used and the manufacturer demonstrates that vapor would not be 
vented to the atmosphere upon fuel cap removal.
    (7) Calculation of temperature profiles. (i) The traces from the 
driving schedule shall be verified to meet the speed tolerance 
requirements of Sec. 86.115. The following conditions shall be verified:
    (A) T<INF>amb,i</INF><gr-thn-eq>T<INF>amb,o</INF>-2  deg.F.

Where,
    (1) i=instantaneous measurement throughout the drive; and
    (2) o=initial measurement at the start of the specified driving 
schedule.
    (B) T<INF>amb,o</INF><gr-thn-eq>95  deg.F.
    (C) T<INF>sur,i</INF>-T<INF>amb,i</INF><gr-thn-eq>30  deg.F.
    (D) W<INF>max</INF><ls-thn-eq>15 mph.
    (ii) Failure to comply with any of these requirements shall result 
in invalidation of the data and require that the procedure be repeated, 
beginning with the fuel drain at paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
    (iii) If all these requirements are met, the following calculations 
shall be performed to determine a profile for liquid fuel temperatures 
and, if applicable, for vapor temperatures:
T<INF>i,profile</INF>=T<INF>i</INF>-T<INF>o</INF>.

Where:
    (A) Ti,<INF>profile</INF>=the series of temperatures that comprise 
the relative temperature profile.
    (B) T<INF>i</INF>=the series of observed liquid fuel or vapor 
temperatures during the drive.
    (C) T<INF>o</INF>=the liquid fuel or vapor temperature observed at 
the start of the specified driving schedule.
    (iv) The relative temperature profile consists of the set of 
temperatures at each 1-minute interval. If temperatures are sampled more 
frequently than once per minute, the temperature data points may 
represent a rolling average of temperatures sampled for up to one-minute 
intervals. If multiple valid test runs are conducted for any model, then 
all the collected data shall be used to calculate a composite profile, 
based on the average temperatures at each point. The absolute 
temperature profile is determined by adding 95  deg.F (35  deg.C) to 
each point of the relative profile. Other methodologies for developing 
corrected liquid fuel and vapor space temperature profiles may be used 
if demonstrated to yield equivalent results and approved in advance by 
the Administrator.
    (v) Manufacturers may use a lower initial fuel temperature for the 
running loss test, if approved in advance by the Administrator. To 
demonstrate the need for such an adjustment, manufacturers would be 
expected to determine the maximum fuel temperature experienced by a 
vehicle during an extended park or after driving one UDDS cycle when 
exposed to the ambient conditions described in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section. To use this provision, manufacturers would have to show maximum 
fuel temperatures no greater than 92  deg.F.

    (a)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. The test sequence 
shown in figure B96-10 shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle 
undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity 
with the standards set forth. The full three- diurnal sequence depicted 
in figure B96-10 tests vehicles for all sources of evaporative 
emissions. The supplemental two-diurnal test sequence is designed to 
verify that vehicles sufficiently purge their evaporative canisters 
during the exhaust emission test. Sections 86.132-96,

[[Page 495]]

86.133-96 and 86.138-96 describe the separate specifications of the 
supplemental two-diurnal test sequence.
    (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. The test sequence shown in figure B96-
10 shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes the 
procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the 
standards set forth, with the exception that the fuel drain and fill and 
precondition canister steps are not required for gaseous-fueled 
vehicles. In addition, the supplemental two-diurnal test and the running 
loss test are not required.
    (b) The vehicle test for fuel spitback during fuel dispensing is 
conducted as a stand-alone test (see Sec. 86.146). This test is not 
required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.
    (c) Ambient temperature levels encountered by the test vehicle shall 
be not less than 68  deg.F nor more than 86  deg.F, unless otherwise 
specified. If a different ambient temperature is specified for soaking 
the vehicle, the soak period may be interrupted once for up to 10 
minutes to transport the vehicle from one soak area to another, provided 
the ambient temperature experienced by the vehicle is never below 68 
deg.F. The temperatures monitored during testing must be representative 
of those experienced by the test vehicle.
    (d) The vehicle shall be approximately level during all phases of 
the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution.
    (e) If tests are invalidated after collection of emission data from 
previous test segments, the test may be repeated to collect only those 
data points needed to complete emission measurements. Compliance with 
emission standards may be determined by combining emission measurements 
from different test runs. If any emission measurements are repeated, the

Sec. 86.132-00  Vehicle preconditioning.

    Applicability. Section 86.132-96 (a) through (c)(1) and (d) through 
(m) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section are applicable to FTP and 
evaporative emission testing. Paragraphs (n) and (o) of this section are 
applicable to vehicles tested for the SFTP supplemental tests of 
aggressive driving (US06) and air conditioning (SC03). Section 86.132-00 
includes text that specifies requirements that differ from Sec. 86.132-
96. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.132-96 is identical and applicable to 
Sec. 86.132-00, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding 
paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.132-
96.''
    (a) through (c)(1) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.132-96.
    (c)(2)(i) Once a test vehicle has completed the refueling and 
vehicle soak steps specified in Sec. 86.132-96 (b) and (c)(1), these 
steps may be omitted in subsequent testing with the same vehicle and the 
same fuel specifications, provided the vehicle remains under laboratory 
ambient temperature conditions for at least 6 hours before starting the 
next test. In such cases, each subsequent test shall begin with the 
preconditioning drive specified in Sec. 86.132-96(c)(1). The test 
vehicle may not be used to set dynamometer horsepower.
    (ii) The SFTP test elements of aggressive driving (US06) and air 
conditioning (SC03) can be run immediately or up to 72 hours after the 
official FTP

and/or evaporative test sequence without refueling provided the vehicle 
has remained under laboratory ambient temperature conditions. If the 
time interval exceeds 72 hours or the vehicle leaves the ambient 
temperature conditions of the laboratory, the manufacturer must repeat 
the refueling operation.
    (d) through (m) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.132-96.
    (n) Aggressive Driving Test (US06) Preconditioning. (1) If the US06 
test follows the exhaust emission FTP or evaporative testing, the 
refueling step may be deleted and the vehicle may be preconditioned 
using the fuel remaining in the tank (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section). The test vehicle may be pushed or driven onto the test 
dynamometer. Acceptable cycles for preconditioning are as follows:
    (i) If the soak period since the last exhaust test element is less 
than or equal to two hours, preconditioning may consist of a 505, 866, 
highway, US06, or SC03 test cycles.
    (ii) If the soak period since the last exhaust test element is 
greater than two hours, preconditioning consists of one full Urban 
Dynamometer Driving Cycle. Manufacturers, at their option, may elect to 
use the preconditioning in paragraph (n)(1)(i) of this section when the 
soak period exceeds two hours.
    (iii) If a manufacturer has concerns about fuel effects on adaptive 
memory systems, a manufacturer may precondition a test vehicle on test 
fuel and the US06 cycle. Upon request from a manufacturer, the 
administrator will also perform the preconditioning with the US06 cycle.
    (iv) The preconditioning cycles for the US06 test schedule are 
conducted at the same ambient test conditions as the certification US06 
test.
    (2) Following the preconditioning specified in paragraphs (n)(1)(i), 
(ii), and (iii) of this section, the test vehicle is returned to idle 
for one to two minutes before the start of the official US06 test cycle.
    (o) Air Conditioning Test (SC03) Preconditioning. (1) If the SC03 
test follows the exhaust emission FTP or evaporative testing, the 
refueling step may be deleted and the vehicle may be preconditioned 
using the fuel remaining in the tank (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section). The test vehicle may be pushed or driven onto the test 
dynamometer. Acceptable cycles for preconditioning are as follows:
    (i) If the soak period since the last exhaust test element is less 
than or equal to two hours, preconditioning may consist of a 505, 866, 
or SC03 test cycles.
    (ii) If the soak period since the last exhaust test element is 
greater than two hours, preconditioning consists of one full Urban 
Dynamometer Driving Cycle. Manufacturers, at their option, may elect to 
use the preconditioning in paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section when the 
soak period exceeds two hours.
    (2) Following the preconditioning specified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i) 
and (ii) of this section, the test vehicle is turned off, the vehicle 
cooling fan(s) is turned off, and the vehicle is allowed to soak for 10 
minutes prior to the start of the official SC03 test cycle.
    (3) The preconditioning cycles for the SC03 air conditioning test 
and the 10 minute soak are conducted at the same ambient test conditions 
as the SC03 certification air conditioning test.

<R05>
Sec. 86.132-96  Vehicle preconditioning.

    (a) Fuel tank cap(s) of gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles shall 
be removed during any period that the vehicle is parked outdoors 
awaiting testing, to prevent unusual loading of the canisters. During 
this time care must be taken to prevent entry of water or other 
contaminants into the fuel tank. During storage in the test area while 
awaiting testing, the fuel tank cap(s) may be in place. The vehicle 
shall be moved into the test area and the following operations 
performed.
    (b)(1) Gasoline- and Methanol-Fueled Vehicles. Drain the fuel 
tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in Sec. 86.113, to the 
``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The fuel cap(s) shall be 
installed within one minute after refueling.
    (2) Gaseous-Fueled Vehicles. Vehicle fuel tanks to be filled with 
fuel that meets the specifications in Sec. 86.113. Fuel tanks shall be 
filled to a minimum of 75% of service pressure for natural gas-fueled

either by being driven or pushed, on a dynamometer and operated through 
one Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), specified in Sec. 86.115 
and appendix I of this part.
    (2) Once a test vehicle has completed the refueling and vehicle soak 
steps specified in paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, these 
steps may be omitted in subsequent testing with the same vehicle and the 
same fuel specifications, provided the vehicle remains under laboratory 
ambient temperature

[[Page 500]]

conditions for at least 6 hours before starting the next test. In such 
cases, each subsequent test shall begin with the preconditioning drive 
specified in this paragraph. The test vehicle may not be used to set 
dynamometer horsepower.
    (d) For unusual circumstances where the need for additional 
preconditioning is demonstrated by the manufacturer, such 
preconditioning may be allowed with the advance approval of the 
Administrator.
    (e) The Administrator may also choose to conduct or require to be 
conducted additional preconditioning to ensure that the evaporative 
emission control system is stabilized in the case of gasoline-fueled and 
methanol-fueled vehicles, or to ensure that the exhaust system is 
stabilized in the case of petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel 
vehicles. The preconditioning shall consist of one of the following:
    (1) For gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. (i) Additional 
preconditioning shall consist of no more than 50 miles of mileage 
accumulation under typical driving conditions, either on the road or on 
a dynamometer.
    (ii) In the case of repeat testing on a flexible-fueled vehicle, in 
which the test fuel is changed, the following preconditioning procedure 
shall be used. This additional preconditioning allows the vehicle to 
adapt to the new fuel before the next test run.
    (A) Purge the vehicle's evaporative canister for 60 minutes at 0.8 
cfm.
    (B) Drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with 3 gallons of the test fuel.
    (C) Start the vehicle and allow it to idle for 1 minute.
    (D) Drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with the new test fuel to the 
``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The average temperature 
of the dispensed fuel shall be less than 60  deg.F.
    (E) Conduct a heat build according to the procedure specified in 
Sec. 86.133-90.
    (F) The vehicle shall be placed, either by being driven or pushed, 
on a dynamometer and operated through one UDDS, specified in Sec. 86.115 
and appendix I of this part.
    (G) Following the dynamometer drive, the vehicle shall be turned off 
for 5 minutes, then restarted and allowed to idle for 1 minute. The 
vehicle shall then be turned off for 1 minute, and allowed to idle again 
for 1 minute.
    (H) After the vehicle is turned off the last time, it may be tested 
for evaporative and exhaust emissions, starting with paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (2) For petroleum-fueled diesel, methanol-fueled diesel, and 
gaseous-fueled vehicles. The preconditioning shall consist of either of 
the following:
    (i) An initial one hour minimum soak and, one, two, or three driving 
cycles of the UDDS, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, each 
followed by a soak of at least one hour with engine off, engine 
compartment cover closed and cooling fan off. The vehicle may be driven 
off the dynamometer following each UDDS for the soak period; or
    (ii) For abnormally treated vehicles, as defined in Sec. 86.085-2 or 
Sec. 86.1803-01 as applicable, two Highway Fuel Economy Driving 
Schedules, found in 40 CFR part 600, appendix I, run in immediate 
succession, with the road load power set at twice the value obtained 
from Sec. 86.129-80.
    (f)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. After completion of 
the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the 
dynamometer. The vehicle's fuel tank(s) shall be drained and then filled 
with test fuel, as specified in Sec. 86.113, to the ``tank fuel volume'' 
defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The vehicle shall be refueled within 1 hour 
after completion of the preconditioning drive. The fuel cap(s) shall be 
installed within 1 minute after refueling. The vehicle shall be parked 
within five minutes after refueling.
    (2) Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Within five minutes after 
completion after the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven 
off the dynamometer and parked.
    (3) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. After completion of the preconditioning 
drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the dynamometer. Vehicle fuel 
tanks shall be refilled with fuel that meets the specifications in 
Sec. 86.113. Fuel tanks shall be filled to a minimum of 75% of service 
pressure for natural gas-fueled vehicles or a minimum of 75% of 
available fill volume for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior 
draining of the fuel tanks is not called for if the fuel in

[[Page 501]]

the tanks already meets the specifications in Sec. 86.113. The vehicle 
shall be parked within five minutes after refueling, or, in the absence 
of refueling, within five minutes after completion of the 
preconditioning drive.
    (g) The vehicle shall be soaked for not less than 12 hours nor more 
than 36 hours between the end of the refueling event and the beginning 
of the cold start exhaust emission test.
    (h) During the soak period for the three-diurnal test sequence 
described in Sec. 86.130-96, evaporative canisters, if the vehicle is so 
equipped, shall be preconditioned according to the following procedure. 
For vehicles with multiple canisters in a series configuration, the set 
of canisters must be preconditioned as a unit. For vehicles with 
multiple canisters in a parallel configuration, each canister must be 
preconditioned separately. If production evaporative canisters are 
equipped with a functional service port designed for vapor load or purge 
steps, the service port shall be used during testing to precondition the 
canister. In addition, for model year 1998 and later vehicles equipped 
with refueling canisters, these canisters shall be preconditioned for 
the three-diurnal test sequence according to the procedure in paragraph 
(j)(1) of this section. If a vehicle is designed to actively control 
evaporative or refueling emissions without a canister, the manufacturer 
shall devise an appropriate preconditioning procedure, subject to the 
approval of the Administrator.
    (1)(i) Prepare the evaporative emission canister for the canister 
purging and loading operation. The canister shall not be removed from 
the vehicle, unless access to the canister in its normal location is so 
restricted that purging and loading can only reasonably be accomplished 
by removing the canister from the vehicle. Special care shall be taken 
during this step to avoid damage to the components and the integrity of 
the fuel system. A replacement canister may be temporarily installed 
during the soak period while the canister from the test vehicle is 
preconditioned.
    (ii) The canister purge shall be performed with ambient air of 
humidity controlled to 50<plus-minus>25 grains per pound of dry air. 
This may be accomplished by purging the canister in a room that is 
conditioned to this level of absolute humidity. The flow rate of the 
purge air shall be maintained at a nominal flow rate of 0.8 cfm and the 
duration shall be determined to provide a total purge volume flow 
through the canister equivalent to 300 canister bed volume exchanges. 
The bed volume is based on the volume of adsorbing material in the 
canister.
    (iii) The evaporative emission canister shall then be loaded by 
sending to the canister an amount of commercial grade butane vapors 
equivalent to 1.5 times its nominal working capacity. The canister shall 
be loaded with a mixture composed of 50 percent butane and 50 percent 
nitrogen by volume at a rate of 15<plus-minus>2 grams butane per hour. 
If the canister loading at that rate takes longer than 12 hours, a 
manufacturer may determine a new rate, based on completing the canister 
loading in no less than 12 hours. The new rate may be used for all 
subsequent canister loading according to paragraph (h) of this section. 
The time of initiation and completion of the canister loading shall be 
recorded.
    (iv) The determination of a canister's nominal working capacity 
shall be based on the average capacity of no less than five canisters 
that are in a stabilized condition.
    (A) For stabilization, each canister must be loaded no less than 10 
times and no more than 100 times to 2-gram breakthrough with a 50/50 
mixture by volume of butane and nitrogen, at a rate of 15 grams butane 
per hour. Each canister loading step must be preceded by canister 
purging with 300 canister bed volume exchanges at 0.8 cfm.
    (B) For determining working capacity, each canister must first be 
purged with 300 canister bed volume exchanges at 0.8 cfm. The working 
capacity of each canister shall be established by determining the mass 
of butane required to load the canister from the purged state so that it 
emits 2 grams of hydrocarbon vapor; the canister must be loaded with a 
50/50 mixture by volume of butane and nitrogen, at a rate of 15 grams 
butane per hour.
    (2) For methanol-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles, canister 
preconditioning shall be performed with a fuel

[[Page 502]]

vapor composition representative of that which the vehicle would 
generate with the fuel mixture used for the current test. Manufacturers 
shall develop a procedure to precondition the evaporative canister, if 
the vehicle is so equipped, for the different fuel. The procedure shall 
represent a canister loading equivalent to that specified in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section and shall be approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in 
Sec. 86.130-96, one of the following methods shall be used to 
precondition evaporative canisters during the soak period specified in 
paragraph (g) of this section. For vehicles with multiple canisters in a 
series configuration, the set of canisters must be preconditioned as a 
unit. For vehicles with multiple canisters in a parallel configuration, 
each canister must be preconditioned separately. In addition, for model 
year 1998 and later vehicles equipped with refueling canisters, these 
canisters shall be preconditioned for the supplemental two-diurnal test 
sequence according to the procedure in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. 
Canister emissions are measured to determine breakthrough. Breakthrough 
is here defined as the point at which the cumulative quantity of 
hydrocarbons emitted is equal to 2 grams.
    (1) Butane loading to breakthrough. The following procedure provides 
for emission measurement in an enclosure. Breakthrough may also be 
determined by measuring the weight gain of an auxiliary evaporative 
canister connected downstream of the vehicle's canister, in which case, 
the following references to the enclosure can be ignored. The auxiliary 
canister shall be well purged prior to loading. If production 
evaporative canisters are equipped with a functional service port 
designed for vapor load or purge steps, the service port shall be used 
during testing to precondition the canister.
    (i) Prepare the evaporative/refueling emission canister for the 
canister loading operation. The canister shall not be removed from the 
vehicle, unless access to the canister in its normal location is so 
restricted that purging and loading can only reasonably be accomplished 
by removing the canister from the vehicle. Special care shall be taken 
during this step to avoid damage to the components and the integrity of 
the fuel system. A replacement canister may be temporarily installed 
during the soak period while the canister from the test vehicle is 
preconditioned.
    (ii) The evaporative emission enclosure shall be purged for several 
minutes. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of 
methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the 
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides at 
least a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.
    (iii) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the canister loading procedure.
    (iv) If not already on, the evaporative enclosure mixing fan shall 
be turned on at this time.
    (v) Place the vehicle in a sealed enclosure and measure emissions 
with a FID.
    (vi)(A) For gasoline-fueled vehicles, load the canister with a 
mixture composed of 50 percent butane and 50 percent nitrogen by volume 
at a rate of 40 grams butane per hour.
    (B) For methanol-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles, canister 
preconditioning shall be performed with a fuel vapor composition 
representative of that which the vehicle would generate with the fuel 
mixture used for the current test. Manufacturers shall develop a 
procedure to precondition the evaporative canister, if the vehicle is so 
equipped, for the different fuel.
    (vii) As soon as the canister reaches breakthrough, the vapor source 
shall be shut off.
    (viii) Reconnect the evaporative/refueling emission canister and 
restore the vehicle to its normal operating condition.
    (2) Load with repeated diurnal heat builds to breakthrough. The 
following procedure provides for emission measurement in an enclosure. 
Breakthrough may also be determined by measuring the weight gain of an 
auxiliary evaporative canister connected downstream of the vehicle's 
canister, in which case,

[[Page 503]]

the following references to the enclosure can be ignored. The auxiliary 
canister shall be well purged with dry air prior to loading.
    (i) The evaporative emission enclosure shall be purged for several 
minutes. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of 
methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the 
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides at 
least a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.
    (ii) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the diurnal heat builds.
    (iii) If not already on, the evaporative enclosure mixing fan shall 
be turned on at this time.
    (iv) The fuel tank(s) of the prepared vehicle shall be drained and 
filled with test fuel, as specified in Sec. 86.113, to the ``tank fuel 
volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The average temperature of the 
dispensed fuel shall be 60<plus-minus>12  deg.F (16<plus-minus>7 
deg.C). The fuel tank cap(s) shall be installed within 1 minute after 
refueling.
    (v) Within one hour of being refueled, the vehicle shall be placed, 
with the engine shut off, in the evaporative emission enclosure. The 
fuel tank temperature sensor shall be connected to the temperature 
recording system. A heat source, specified in Sec. 86.107-90(a)(4), 
shall be properly positioned with respect to the fuel tank(s) and 
connected to the temperature controller.
    (vi) The temperature recording system shall be started.
    (vii) The fuel may be artificially heated to the starting diurnal 
temperature.
    (viii) When the fuel temperature reaches at least 69  deg.F (21 
deg.C), immediately: turn off purge blower (if not already off); close 
and seal enclosure doors; and initiate measurement of the hydrocarbon 
level in the enclosure.
    (ix) When the fuel temperature reaches 72<plus-minus>2  deg.F 
(22<plus-minus>1  deg.C), start the diurnal heat build.
    (x) The fuel shall be heated in such a way that its temperature 
change conforms to the following function to within <plus-minus>4  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>3  deg.C):

    F=T<INF>o</INF>+0.4t; or


for SI units,

    C=T<INF>o</INF>+(2/9)t.

Where,

F=fuel temperature,  deg.F;
C=fuel temperature,  deg.C;
t=time since beginning of test, minutes; and
T<INF>o</INF>=initial temperature in  deg.F (  deg.C for SI units).

    (xi) As soon as breakthrough occurs or when the fuel temperature 
reaches 96  deg.F (36  deg.C), whichever occurs first, the heat source 
shall be turned off, the enclosure doors shall be unsealed and opened, 
and the vehicle fuel tank cap(s) shall be removed. If breakthrough has 
not occurred by the time the fuel temperature reaches 96  deg.F (36 
deg.C), the heat source shall be removed from the vehicle, the vehicle 
shall be removed (with engine still off) from the evaporative emission 
enclosure and the entire procedure outlined in paragraph (j)(2) of this 
section shall be repeated until breakthrough occurs.
    (xii) After breakthrough occurs, the fuel tank(s) of the prepared 
vehicle shall be drained and filled with test fuel, as specified in 
Sec. 86.113, to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The 
fuel shall be stabilized to a temperature within 3  deg.F of the lab 
ambient before beginning the driving cycle for the exhaust emission 
test.
    (k) The Administrator may conduct the vehicle preparation and 
preconditioning for measurement of fuel economy or exhaust emissions 
according to the procedures specified in Secs. 86.132-90 and 86.133-90, 
in lieu of the procedures specified in this section.
    (l) Vehicles to be tested for exhaust emissions only shall be 
processed according to Secs. 86.135 through 86.137. Vehicles to be 
tested for evaporative emissions shall be processed in accordance with 
the procedures in Secs. 86.133 through 86.138, starting with 
Sec. 86.135.
    (m) Vehicles to be tested for evaporative emissions with the 
supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in Sec. 86.130-96, 
shall proceed according to Secs. 86.135 through 86.137, followed by the 
supplemental hot soak test (see

[[Page 504]]

Sec. 86.138-96(k)) and the supplemental diurnal emission test (see 
Sec. 86.133-96(p)).

Sec. 86.133-90  Diurnal breathing loss test.

    (a)(1) Following vehicle preparation and vehicle preconditioning 
procedures described in Secs. 86.131 and 86.132 the test vehicle shall 
be allowed to soak for a period of not less than 12 or more than 36 
hours prior to the exhaust emission test. The diurnal test shall start 
not less than 10 or more than 35 hours after the end of the 
preconditioning procedure. The start of the exhaust test shall follow 
the end of the diurnal test within one hour.
    (2) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles to be tested for 
exhaust emissions only shall undergo the diurnal heat build. Since no 
evaporative measurements are necessary, an evaporative enclosure is not 
required.
    (b) The evaporative emission enclosure shall be purged for several 
minutes immediately prior to the test.
    Note: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol 
or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the enclosure 
should be immediately purged. The concentration provides a 4:1 safety 
factor of hydrocarbons and methanol against the lean flammability limit.
    (c) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the test.
    (d) Impingers charged with known volumes of pure deionized water 
shall be placed in the methanol sampling system (methanol-fueled 
vehicles only).
    (e) If not already on, evaporative enclosure mixing fan shall be 
turned on at this time.
    (f) Immediately prior to the diurnal breathing loss test, the fuel 
tank(s) of the prepared vehicle shall be drained and recharged with the 
specified test fuel, Sec. 86.113, to the prescribed ``tank fuel 
volume,'' defined in Sec. 86.078-2. The temperature of the fuel prior to 
its delivery to the fuel tank shall be between 45 deg. and 60  deg.F 
(7.2  deg.C and 16  deg.C). The fuel tank cap(s) is not installed until 
the diurnal heat build begins.
    (g) The test vehicle, with the engine shut off, shall be moved into 
the evaporative emission enclosure, the test vehicle windows and luggage 
compartment(s) shall be opened, the fuel tank temperature sensor shall 
be connected to the temperature recording system, and, if required, the 
heat source shall be properly positioned with respect to the fuel 
tank(s) and/or connected to the temperature controller.
    (h) The temperature recording system shall be started.
    (i) The fuel may be artificially heated to the starting diurnal 
temperature.
    (j) When the fuel temperature recording system reaches at least 58 
deg.F (14  deg.C), immediately:
    (1) Install fuel tank cap(s).
    (2) Turn off purge blowers, if not already off at this time.
    (3) Close and seal enclosure doors.
    (k) When the fuel temperature recording system reaches 
60 deg.<plus-minus>2  deg.F (16 deg.<plus-minus>1.1  deg.C), 
immediately:
    (1) Analyze enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This 
is the initial (time = 0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCi</INF>, Sec. 86.143.
    (2) Simultaneously with initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis, 
initiate collection of the methanol sample by drawing a sample from the 
enclosure through the sampling system for four minutes. This is the 
initial methanol measurement from which methanol concentration 
C<INF>CH3OHi</INF> and mass are calculated. Remove impingers and replace 
with freshly charged clean impingers which will be used to collect the 
final methanol sample.
    (3) Start diurnal heat build and record time. This commences the 
60<plus-minus>2 minute test period.
    (l) The fuel shall be heated in such a way that its temperature 
change conforms to the following function to within <plus-minus>3  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>1.6  deg.C):
    (1) F = T<INF>o</INF> + 0.4t.
    (2) For SI units, C = T<INF>o</INF> + (2/9)t.

Where:
    (3) F = fuel temperature,  deg.F.
    (4) C = fuel temperature,  deg.C.
    (5) t = time since beginning of test, minutes.
    (6) T<INF>o</INF> = initial temperature.
    After 60<plus-minus>2 minutes of heating, the fuel temperature rise 
shall be 24 deg.<plus-minus>1  deg.F (13.4  deg.C<plus-minus>0.5 
deg.C).

[[Page 505]]

    (m) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the end of the diurnal test.
    (n) The end of the diurnal breathing loss test occurs 
60<plus-minus>2 minutes after the heat build begins, paragraph (j)(2). 
Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This is 
the final (time = 60 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCf</INF>, Sec. 86.143. The time (or elapsed time) of this 
analysis shall be recorded.
    (o) Simultaneously with the start of the hydrocarbon analysis, 
initiate collection of the methanol sample. Sample for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the final methanol sample.
    (p) Alternate method for methanol sampling. Since sample times of 
longer than four minutes may be necessary in order to collect an 
adequate and representative sample of methanol at the end of a test 
(when SHED concentrations are usually increasing rapidly), it may be 
necessary to rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and then 
bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow rate. 
The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flowing 
through the impingers should be minimized in order to prevent any 
losses. This alternative must be adopted if the four minute sample 
period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to 
allow accurate GC analysis.
    (q) Once the final methanol sample has been collected, the heat 
source shall be turned off and the enclosure doors unsealed and opened.
    (r) The heat source shall be moved away from the vehicle, if 
required, and/or disconnected from the temperature controller, the fuel 
tank temperature sensor shall be disconnected from the temperature 
recording system, the test vehicle windows and luggage compartments may 
be closed and the test vehicle, with the engine shut off, shall be 
removed from the evaporative emission enclosure.
    (s) For vehicles with multiple tanks, the largest tank shall be 
designated as the primary tank and shall be heated in accordance with 
the procedures described in paragraph (1) of this section. All other 
tanks shall be designated as auxiliary tanks and shall undergo a similar 
heat build such that the fuel temperature shall be within 3  deg.F (1.6 
deg.C) of the primary tank.

Sec. 86.133-96  Diurnal emission test.

    (a)(1) The diurnal emission test for gasoline-, methanol- and 
gaseous-fueled vehicles consists of three 24-hour test cycles following 
the hot soak test. Emissions are measured for each 24-hour cycle, with 
the highest emission level used to determine compliance with the 
standards specified in subpart A of this part. The Administrator may 
truncate a test after any 24-hour cycle without affecting the validity 
of the collected data. Sampling of emissions from the running loss and 
hot soak tests is not required as preparation for the diurnal emission 
test. The diurnal emission test may be conducted as part of either the 
three- diurnal test sequence or the supplemental two-diurnal test 
sequence, as described in Sec. 86.130-96.
    (2) For the full three-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal emission 
test outlined in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section follows the 
high-temperature hot soak test concluded in Sec. 86.138-96(j).
    (3) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal 
emission test outlined in paragraph (p) of this section follows the 
alternate hot soak test specified in Sec. 86.138-96(k). This test is not 
required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.
    (b) The test vehicle shall be soaked for not less than 6 hours nor 
more than 36 hours between the end of the hot soak test and the start of 
the diurnal emission test. For at least the last 6 hours of this period, 
the vehicle shall be soaked at 72 deg.<plus-minus>3  deg.F. The 
temperature tolerance may be waived for up to 10 minutes to allow 
purging of the enclosure or transporting the vehicle into the enclosure 
at the beginning of the diurnal emission test.
    (c) The test vehicle shall be exposed to ambient temperatures cycled 
according to the profile specified in Sec. 86.133 and appendix II of 
this part.
    (1) Temperatures measured with the underbody temperature sensor 
shall

[[Page 506]]

follow the profile with a maximum deviation of 3  deg.F at any time and 
an average temperature deviation not to exceed 2  deg.F, where the 
average deviation is calculated using the absolute value of each 
measured deviation. In addition, the temperature from the sidewall 
temperature sensors shall follow the profile with a maximum deviation of 
5  deg.F at any time.
    (2) Ambient temperatures shall be measured at least every minute. 
Temperature cycling shall begin when time=0 minutes, as specified in 
paragraph (i)(5) of this section.
    (d) The diurnal enclosure shall be purged for several minutes prior 
to the test. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, 
of methanol or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the 
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides at 
least a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.
    (e) The test vehicle, with the engine shut off and the test vehicle 
windows and luggage compartment(s) opened, shall be moved into the 
diurnal enclosure.
    (f)-(g) [Reserved]
    (h) Prior to sampling for emissions and throughout the period of 
cycled ambient temperatures, the mixing fan(s) shall circulate the air 
at a rate of 0.8<plus-minus>0.2 cfm per cubic foot of ambient volume. 
The mixing fan(s), plus any additional fans if needed, shall also 
maintain a minimum wind speed of 5 mph (8 km/hr) under the fuel tank of 
the test vehicle. The Administrator may adjust fan speed and location to 
ensure sufficient air circulation around the fuel tank. The wind speed 
requirement may be satisfied by consistently using a fan configuration 
that has been demonstrated to maintain a broad 5-mph air flow in the 
vicinity of the vehicle's fuel tank, subject to verification by the 
Administrator.
    (i) Emission sampling may begin as follows:
    (1) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the sampling.
    (2) Impingers charged with known volumes of pure deionized water 
shall be placed in the methanol sampling system (methanol-fueled 
vehicles only).
    (3) Turn off purge blowers (if not already off).
    (4) Close and seal enclosure doors (if not already closed and 
sealed).
    (5) Within 10 minutes of closing and sealing the doors, analyze 
enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This is the initial 
(time=0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCi</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.143. Hydrocarbon emissions may be sampled continuously during 
the test period.
    (6) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the initial methanol concentration, 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, required in Sec. 86.143. Record the time 
elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-minute sample period is 
inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to allow 
accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and 
then bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow 
rate. The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flow 
through the impingers should be minimized to prevent any losses. If the 
test is conducted in a fixed-volume enclosure that allows airflow into 
and out of the enclosure, the effect of makeup air dilution must be 
factored into the analysis.
    (j) If testing indicates that a vehicle design may result in fuel 
temperature responses during enclosure testing that are not 
representative of in-use summertime conditions, the Administrator may 
adjust air circulation and temperature during the test as needed to 
ensure that the test sufficiently duplicates the vehicle's in-use 
experience.
    (k) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the end of each emission sampling period.
    (l) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol collection 
system immediately prior to the end of each emission measurement, if 
applicable.
    (m) The end of the first, second, and third emission sampling period 
shall occur 1440<plus-minus>6, 2880<plus-minus>6, 4320<plus-minus>6 
minutes, respectively, after the beginning of the

[[Page 507]]

initial sampling, as specified in paragraph (i)(5) of this section.
    (1) At the end of each emission sampling period, analyze the 
enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This is the final 
hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCf</INF>, required in Sec. 86.143. The 
emission measurement at the end of each period becomes the initial 
hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCi</INF>, of the next emission 
sampling period.
    (2) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the final (time=1440 minutes) 
methanol concentration, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHf</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.143. Record the time elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-
minute sample period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient 
concentration to allow accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the 
methanol sample in a bag and then bubble the bag sample through the 
impingers at the specified flow rate. The time elapsed between 
collection of the bag sample and flow through the impingers should be 
minimized to prevent any losses. If the test is conducted in a fixed-
volume enclosure that allows airflow into and out of the enclosure, the 
effect of makeup air dilution must be factored into the analysis.
    (n) At the end of the temperature cycling period the enclosure doors 
shall be unsealed and opened, the test vehicle windows and luggage 
compartments may be closed and the test vehicle, with the engine shut 
off, shall be removed from the enclosure.
    (o) This completes the full three-diurnal evaporative emission test 
sequence described in Sec. 86.130-96.
    (p) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in 
Sec. 86.130-96, the following steps shall be performed in lieu of the 
steps described in paragraphs (b) through (n) of this section.
    (1) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the test vehicle 
shall be soaked for not less than 6 hours nor more than 36 hours between 
the end of the hot soak test described in Sec. 86.138-96(k), and the 
start of the two-diurnal emission test. For at least the last 6 hours of 
this period, the vehicle shall be soaked at 72<plus-minus>3  deg.F.
    (2) The vehicle shall be tested for diurnal emissions according to 
the procedures specified in paragraphs (c) through (n) of this section, 
except that the test includes only two 24-hour periods. Therefore the 
end of the first and second emission sampling periods shall occur 
1440<plus-minus>6 and 2880<plus-minus>6 minutes, respectively, after the 
initial sampling.
    (3) This completes the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence for 
evaporative emission measurement.

<R05>
Sec. 86.134-96  Running loss test.

    (a) Overview. Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles are to be 
tested for running loss emissions during simulated high-temperature 
urban driving; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. 
During operation, tank temperatures are controlled according to a 
prescribed profile to simulate in-use conditions. If the vehicle is 
determined to have exceeded the standard before the end of the running 
loss test, the test may be terminated without invalidating the data. The 
test can be run either in a sealed enclosure or with the point-source 
method, as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. Measurement of 
vapor temperature is optional during the running loss test; however, if 
testing by the Administrator shows that a vehicle has exceeded an 
emission standard without measurement of vapor temperatures, the 
manufacturer may, utilizing its own resources, conduct subsequent 
testing on that vehicle to determine if the exceedance is attributable 
to inadequate control of vapor temperatures.
    (b) Driving schedule. Conduct the running loss test by operating the 
test vehicle through one Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), a 2-
minute idle, two New York City Cycles, another 2-minute idle, another 
UDDS, then another 2-minute idle (see Sec. 86.115 and appendix I of this 
part). Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission 
in gear. Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial 
vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule. The transmission shall be

[[Page 508]]

operated according to the specifications of Sec. 86.128 during the 
driving cycles.
    (c) Dynamometer Operation. (1) The exhaust from the vehicle must be 
routed outside the test cell or enclosure. Exhaust gases may, but need 
not, be collected and sampled.
    (2) Provisions of Sec. 86.135-90(c) shall apply.
    (3) Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may not be 
performed at test point.
    (4) Provisions of Sec. 86.135-90 (e) and (f) shall apply.
    (5) If the dynamometer horsepower must be adjusted manually, it 
shall be set within 1 hour prior to the running loss test phase. The 
test vehicle shall not be used to make this adjustment. Dynamometers 
using automatic control of preselectable power settings may be set any 
time prior to the beginning of the emissions test.
    (6) Dynamometer roll or shaft revolutions shall be used to determine 
the actual driving distance for the running loss test, D<INF>RL</INF>, 
required in Sec. 86.143. The revolutions shall be measured on the same 
roll or shaft used for measuring the vehicle's speed.
    (7) Provisions of Sec. 86.135-90(i) shall apply.
    (8) The test run may be stopped if a warning light or gauge 
indicates that the vehicle's engine coolant has overheated.
    (d) Engine Starting and Restarting. (1) Provisions of Sec. 86.136-
90(a) shall apply.
    (2) If the vehicle does not start after the manufacturer's 
recommended cranking time (or 10 continuous seconds in the absence of a 
manufacturer's recommendation), cranking shall cease for the period 
recommended by the manufacturer (or 10 seconds in the absence of a 
manufacturer's recommendation). This may be repeated for up to three 
start attempts. If the vehicle does not start after three attempts, the 
reason for failure to start shall be determined. If failure to start is 
an operational error, the vehicle shall be rescheduled for testing, 
starting with the soak period immediately preceding the running loss 
test.
    (3) If failure to start is caused by a vehicle malfunction, 
corrective action of less than 30 minutes duration may be taken 
(according to Sec. 86.090-25), and the test continued, provided that the 
ambient conditions to which the vehicle is exposed are maintained at 
95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (35<plus-minus>3  deg.C). When the engine starts, 
the timing sequence of the driving schedule shall begin. If failure to 
start is caused by vehicle malfunction and the vehicle cannot be 
started, the test shall be voided, the vehicle removed from the 
dynamometer, and corrective action may be taken according to 
Sec. 86.090-25. The reason for the malfunction (if determined) and the 
corrective action taken shall be reported to the Administrator.
    (4) Provisions of Sec. 86.136-90(e) shall apply.
    (e) Pressure checks. No pressure checks of the evaporative system 
shall be allowed. Under no circumstances will any changes/repairs to the 
evaporative emissions control system be allowed.
    (f) Temperature stabilization. Immediately after the hot transient 
exhaust emission test, the vehicle shall be soaked in a temperature 
controlled area for a maximum of 6 hours until the fuel temperature is 
stabilized. The fuel may be heated or cooled to stabilize fuel 
temperatures, but the fuel heating rate must not exceed 5  deg.F in any 
1-hour interval during the soak period. A manufacturer may use a faster 
heating rate or a longer period for stabilizing fuel temperatures if the 
needed heating cannot be easily accomplished in the 6-hour period, 
subject to Administrator approval.
    (1) Fuel temperatures must be held at 95<plus-minus> 3  deg.F for at 
least one hour before the start of the running loss test.
    (2) If a vehicle's fuel temperature profile has an initial 
temperature lower than 95  deg.F, as described in Sec. 86.129-
94(d)(7)(v), the fuel in the test vehicle must be stabilized to within 3 
 deg.F of that temperature for at least one hour before the start of the 
running loss test.
    (g) Running loss test. The running loss test may be conducted either 
by the enclosure method, or by the point-source method.
    (1) Enclosure method. (i) The running loss enclosure shall be purged 
for several minutes immediately prior to the

[[Page 509]]

test. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of 
methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the 
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides at 
least a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.
    (ii) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the test.
    (iii) If not already on, the running loss enclosure mixing fan(s) 
shall be turned on at this time. Throughout the test, the mixing fan(s) 
shall circulate the air at a rate of at least 1.0 cfm per cubic foot of 
ambient volume.
    (iv) The test vehicle, with the engine off, shall be moved onto the 
dynamometer in the running loss enclosure. The vehicle engine 
compartment cover shall be unlatched, but closed as much as possible, 
allowing for the air intake equipment specified in paragraph (g)(1)(vii) 
of this section. The vehicle engine compartment cover may be closed if 
alternate routing is found for the air intake equipment. Any windows, 
doors, and luggage compartments shall be closed. A window may be opened 
to direct cooling air into the passenger compartment of the vehicle, if 
the vehicle is not equipped with its own air conditioning.
    (v) Fans shall be positioned as described in Secs. 86.107-96 (d) and 
(h).
    (vi) The vehicle air conditioning system (if so equipped) shall be 
set to the ``normal'' air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum 
discharge air temperature and high fan speed. Vehicles equipped with 
automatic temperature controlled air conditioning systems shall be set 
to operate in ``automatic'' temperature and fan modes with the system 
set at 72  deg.F.
    (vii) Connect the air intake equipment to the vehicle, if 
applicable. This connection shall be made to minimize leakage.
    (viii) The temperature and pressure recording systems shall be 
started. Measurement of vapor temperature is optional during the running 
loss test. If vapor temperature is not measured, fuel tank pressure need 
not be measured.
    (ix) Turn off purge blowers (if not already off).
    (x) The temperature of the liquid fuel shall be monitored and 
recorded at least every 15 seconds with the temperature recording system 
specified in Sec. 86.107-96(e).
    (xi) Close and seal the enclosure doors.
    (xii) When the ambient temperature is 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(35<plus-minus>3  deg.C) and the fuel has been stabilized according to 
paragraph (f) of this section, the running loss test may begin. Measure 
the initial ambient temperature and pressure.
    (A) Analyze enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This 
is the initial (time=0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCi</INF>, required in Sec. 86.143. Hydrocarbon emissions may be 
sampled continuously during the test period.
    (B) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the initial (time=0 minutes) 
methanol concentration, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.143. Record the time elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-
minute sample period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient 
concentration to allow accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the 
methanol sample in a bag and then bubble the bag sample through the 
impingers at the specified flow rate. The time elapsed between 
collection of the bag sample and flow through the impingers should be 
minimized to prevent any losses.
    (xiii) Start the engine and begin operation of the vehicle over the 
drive cycle specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (xiv) The ambient temperature shall be maintained at 95<plus-minus>5 
 deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on average) during the running loss test, 
measured at the inlet to the cooling fan in front of the vehicle; it 
shall be recorded at least every 60 seconds.
    (xv) The fuel temperature during the dynamometer drive shall be 
controlled to match the fuel tank temperature profile determined in 
Sec. 86.129. Measured fuel temperatures must be within <plus-minus>3 
deg.F of the target profile throughout the test run. Vapor temperatures, 
if measured, must be within <plus-minus>5  deg.F of the target profile 
during the first 4186 seconds of

[[Page 510]]

the running loss test, and within <plus-minus>3  deg.F for the remaining 
120 seconds of the test run. For any vehicle complying with the test 
standards, vapor temperatures may be higher than the specified 
tolerances without invalidating test results. For testing by the 
Administrator, vapor temperatures may be lower than the specified 
tolerances without invalidating test results. If the test vehicle has 
more than one fuel tank, the temperatures for both fuel tanks shall 
follow the target profiles determined in Sec. 86.129. The control system 
shall be tuned and operated to provide smooth and continuous tank 
temperature profiles that are representative of the on-road profiles.
    (xvi) Tank pressure shall not exceed 10 inches of water at any time 
during the running loss test unless a pressurized system is used and the 
manufacturer demonstrates that vapor would not be vented to the 
atmosphere upon fuel cap removal. A vehicle may exceed the pressure 
limit for temporary periods during the running loss test, up to 10 
percent of the total driving time, provided that the vehicle has 
demonstrated conformance with the pressure limit during the entire 
outdoor driving period specified in Sec. 86.129. Measurement of fuel 
tank pressures will be considered valid only if vapor temperatures are 
measured and controlled to the tolerances specified in paragraph 
(g)(1)(xv) of this section.
    (xvii) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior the end of the test.
    (xviii) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol 
collection system immediately prior to the end of the test, if 
applicable.
    (xix) The running loss test ends with the completion of the third 2-
minute idle period.
    (xx) At the end of the running loss test:
    (A) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. 
This is the final hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCf</INF>, required 
in Sec. 86.143.
    (B) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start prior to the end of the 
test and continue for 4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. The methanol sampling 
must be completed within 2 minutes after the end of the running loss 
test. This is the final methanol concentration, 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHf</INF>, required in Sec. 86.143. Record the time 
elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-minute sample period is 
inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to allow 
accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and 
then bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow 
rate. The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flow 
through the impingers should be minimized to prevent any losses.
    (C) Turn off all the fans specified in Sec. 86.107-96(d). Also, the 
time that the vehicle's engine compartment cover is open for removal of 
air intake equipment, if applicable, shall be minimized to avoid loss of 
heat from the engine compartment.
    (xxi) Turn off any CVS apparatus (if not already turned off).
    (2) Point-source method. (i) The test vehicle, with the engine off, 
shall be moved onto the dynamometer. The vehicle engine compartment 
cover and any windows, doors, and luggage compartments shall be closed.
    (ii) Fans shall be positioned as described in Secs. 86.135-90(b) and 
86.107-96(d).
    (iii) The running loss vapor vent collection system shall be 
properly positioned at the potential fuel vapor vents or leaks of the 
vehicle's fuel system. Typical vapor vents for current fuel systems are 
the ports of the evaporative emission canister and the pressure relief 
vent of the fuel tank (typically integrated into the fuel tank cap).
    (iv) The running loss vapor vent collection system may be connected 
to a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS bag collection system. Otherwise, running loss 
vapors shall be sampled continuously with analyzers meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 86.107-96(b).
    (v) Fans shall be positioned as described in Sec. 86.107-96(d).
    (vi) The vehicle air conditioning system (if so equipped) shall be 
set to the ``normal'' air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum 
discharge air

[[Page 511]]

temperature and high fan speed. Vehicles equipped with automatic 
temperature controlled air conditioning systems shall be set to operate 
in ``automatic'' temperature and fan modes with the system set at 72 
deg.F.
    (vii) The temperature and pressure recording systems shall be 
started. Measurement of vapor temperature is optional during the running 
loss test. If vapor temperature is not measured, fuel tank pressure need 
not be measured.
    (viii) The temperature of the liquid fuel shall be monitored and 
recorded at least every 15 seconds with the temperature recording system 
specified in Sec. 86.107-96(e).
    (ix) When the ambient temperature is 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(35<plus-minus>3  deg.C) and the fuel tank temperature is 
95<plus-minus>3  deg.F the running loss test may begin.
    (x) The ambient temperature shall be maintained at 95<plus-minus>5 
deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on average) during the running loss test, 
measured at the inlet to the cooling fan in front of the vehicle; it 
shall be recorded at least every 60 seconds.
    (xi) Fuel temperatures shall be controlled according to the 
specifications of paragraph (g)(1)(xv) of this section.
    (xii) The tank pressure requirements described in paragraph 
(g)(1)(xvi) of this section apply also to running loss testing by the 
point source method.
    (xiii) The running loss test ends with completion of the third 2-
minute idle period.
    (xiv) If emissions are collected in bags, the sample bags must be 
analyzed within 20 minutes of their respective sample collection phases, 
as described in Sec. 86.137-94(b)(15). The results of the analysis are 
used in Sec. 86.143 to calculate the mass of hydrocarbons emitted.
    (xv) At the end of the running loss test, turn off all the fans 
specified in Sec. 86.107-96(d).
    (h) Following the completion of the running loss drive, the vehicle 
may be tested for hot soak emissions as specified in Sec. 86.138-96.

Sec. 86.135-90 or Sec. 86.135-94 is identical and applicable to 
Sec. 86.135-00, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding 
paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.135-
90.'' or ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.135-94.''
    (a) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.135-94.
    (b) through (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.135-90.
    (d) Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may be 
performed at test point, provided an emission sample is not taken, for 
the purpose of finding the appropriate throttle action to maintain the 
proper speed-time relationship, or to permit sampling system adjustment. 
Both smoothing of speed variations and excessive accelerator pedal 
perturbations are to be avoided. When using two-roll dynamometers a 
truer speed-time trace may be obtained by minimizing the rocking of the 
vehicle in the rolls; the rocking of the vehicle changes the tire 
rolling radius on each roll. This rocking may be minimized by 
restraining the vehicle horizontally (or nearly so) by using a cable and 
winch.

Sec. 86.135-90  Dynamometer procedure.

    (a) Overview--(1) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle 
vehicles. The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ``cold'' start 
test after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak according to the 
provisions of Secs. 86.132 and 86.133, and a ``hot'' start test 
following the ``cold'' start test by 10 minutes. Engine startup (with 
all accessories turned off), operation over the UDDS and engine shutdown 
make a complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the 
first 505 seconds of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. 
The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air and a continuously 
proportional sample is collected for analysis during each phase. The 
composite samples collected in bags are analyzed for hydrocarbon, carbon 
monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. A parallel sample of 
the dilution air is similarly analyzed

[[Page 512]]

for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of 
nitrogen. Methanol and formaldehyde samples (exhaust and dilution air) 
are collected and analyzed for methanol-fueled vehicles (a single 
dilution air formaldehyde sample covering the total time of the test may 
be collected in place of three individual samples). Methanol and 
formaldehyde samples may be omitted for 1990 through 1994 model years 
when a FID calibrated on methanol is used.
    (2) Petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel vehicles. The 
dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ``cold'' start test after a 
minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak according to the provisions 
of Secs. 86.132 and 86.133, and a ``hot'' start test following the 
``cold'' start by 10 minutes. Engine startup (with all accessories 
turned off), operation over the UDDS, and engine shutdown make a 
complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the first 
505 seconds of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. The 
exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air in the dilution tunnel as 
shown in Figure B90-5 and Figure B90-6. Six particulate samples are 
collected on filters for weighing; the first sample plus back-up is 
collected during the first 505 seconds of the cold start test; the 
second sample plus back-up is collected during the remainder of the cold 
start test (including shutdown); the third sample plus back-up is 
collected during the hot start test. Continuous proportional samples of 
gaseous emissions are collected for analysis during each test phase. For 
petroleum-fueled vehicles, the composite samples collected in bags are 
analyzed for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. 
Hydrocarbons from petroleum-fueled vehicles are sampled and analyzed 
continuously according to the provisions of Sec. 86.110. Parallel 
samples of the dilution air are similarly analyzed for hydrocarbon, 
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. For methanol-
fueled vehicles, bag samples are collected and analyzed for 
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. 
Methanol and formaldehyde samples are taken for both exhaust emissions 
and dilution air (a single dilution air formaldehyde sample, covering 
the total test period may be collected). Methanol and formaldehyde 
samples may be omitted for 1990 through 1994 model years when an FID 
calibrated on methanol is used. Parallel bag samples of dilution air are 
analyzed for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides 
of nitrogen.
    (b) During dynamometer operation, a fixed speed cooling fan shall be 
positioned so as to direct cooling air to the vehicle in an appropriate 
manner with the engine compartment cover open. In the case of vehicles 
with front engine compartments, the fan shall be squarely positioned 
within 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) of the vehicle. In the case of 
vehicles with rear engine compartments (or if special designs make the 
above impractical), the cooling fan shall be placed in a position to 
provide sufficient air to maintain vehicle cooling. The fan capacity 
shall normally not exceed 5300 cfm (2.50 m\3\/s). If, however, the 
manufacturer can show that during field operation the vehicle receives 
additional cooling, and that such additional cooling is needed to 
provide a representative test, the fan capacity may be increased or 
additional fans used if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (c) The vehicle speed as measured from the dynamometer rolls shall 
be used. A speed vs. time recording, as evidence of dynamometer test 
validity, shall be supplied on request of the Administrator.
    (d) Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may be 
performed at test point, provided an emission sample is not taken, for 
the purpose of finding the minimum throttle action to maintain the 
proper speed-time relationship, or to permit sampling system adjustment.
    Note: When using two-roll dynamometers a truer speed-time trace may 
be obtained by minimizing the rocking of the vehicle in the rolls; the 
rocking of the vehicle changes the tire rolling radius on each roll. 
This rocking may be minimized by restraining the vehicle horizontally 
(or nearly so) by using a cable and winch.
    (e) The drive wheel tires may be inflated up to a gauge pressure of 
45 psi (310 kPa) in order to prevent tire damage. The drive wheel tire 
pressure shall be reported with the test results.

[[Page 513]]

    (f) lf the dynamometer has not been operated during the 2-hour 
period immediately preceding the test, it shall be warmed up for 15 
minutes by operating at 30 mph (48 kph) using a non-test vehicle or as 
recommended by the dynamometer manufacturer.
    (g) If the dynamometer horsepower must be adjusted manually, it 
shall be set within 1 hour prior to the exhaust emissions test phase. 
The test vehicle shall not be used to make this adjustment. Dynamometers 
using automatic control of preselectable power settings may be set 
anytime prior to the beginning of the emissions test.
    (h) The driving distance, as measured by counting the number of 
dynamometer roll or shaft revolutions, shall be determined for the 
transient cold start, stabilized cold start, and transient hot start 
phases of the test. The revolutions shall be measured on the same roll 
or shaft used for measuring the vehicle's speed.
    (i) Four-wheel drive vehicles will be tested in a two-wheel drive 
mode of operation. Full-time four-wheel drive vehicles will have one set 
of drive wheels temporarily disengaged by the vehicle manufacturer. 
Four-wheel drive vehicles which can be manually shifted to a two-wheel 
mode will be tested in the normal on-highway two-wheel drive mode of 
operation.

Sec. 86.135-94  Dynamometer procedure.

    Section 86.135-94 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.135-90. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.135-90 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.135-94, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.135-90.'' Where a corresponding paragraph of 
Sec. 86.135-90 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement 
``[Reserved].''
    (a) Overview. The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ``cold'' 
start test, after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak according 
to the provisions of Secs. 86.132 and 86.133, and a ``hot'' start test 
following the ``cold'' start by 10 minutes. Engine startup (with all 
accessories turned off), operation over the UDDS and engine shutdown 
make a complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the 
first 505 seconds of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. 
The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air in the dilution 
tunnel as shown in Figure B94-5 and Figure B94-6. A dilution tunnel is 
not required for testing vehicles waived from the requirement to measure 
particulates. Six particulate samples are collected on filters for 
weighing; the first sample plus backup is collected during the first 505 
seconds of the cold start test; the second sample plus backup is 
collected during the remainder of the cold start test (including 
shutdown); the third sample plus backup is collected during the hot 
start test. Continuous proportional samples of gaseous emissions are 
collected for analysis during each test phase. For gasoline-fueled, 
natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle 
vehicles, the composite samples collected in bags are analyzed for THC, 
CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF>. For petroleum-
fueled diesel-cycle vehicles (optional for natural gas-fueled, liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles), THC is 
sampled and analyzed continuously according to the provisions of 
Sec. 86.110. Parallel samples of the dilution air are similarly analyzed 
for THC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF>. For 
natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled 
vehicles, bag samples are collected and analyzed for THC (if not sampled 
continuously), CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF>. 
For methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde samples are 
taken for both exhaust emissions and dilution air (a single dilution air 
formaldehyde sample, covering the total test period may be collected). 
Parallel bag samples of dilution air are analyzed for THC, CO, 
CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF>. Methanol and 
formaldehyde samples may be omitted for 1990 through 1994 model years 
when a FID calibrated on methanol is used.
    (b) through (i) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.135-90.

<R05>
Sec. 86.136-90  Engine starting and restarting.

    (a) Otto-cycle vehicles. Paragraph (a) of this section applies to 
Otto-cycle vehicles.
    (1) The engine shall be started according to the manufacturer's 
recommended starting procedures in the owner's manual. The initial 20-
second idle period shall begin when the engine starts.
    (2) Choke operation: (i) Vehicles equipped with automatic chokes 
shall be operated according to the manufacturer's operating instructions 
in the owner's manual, including choke setting and ``kick-down'' from 
cold fast idle.
    (ii) Vehicles equipped with manual chokes shall be operated 
according to the manufacturer's operating instructions in the owner's 
manual.
    (3) The transmission shall be placed in gear 15 seconds after the 
engine is started. If necessary, braking may be employed to keep the 
drive wheels from turning.
    (4) The operator may use the choke, accelerator pedal, etc., where 
necessary to keep the engine running.
    (5) If the manufacturer's operating instructions in the owner's 
manual do not specify a warm engine starting procedure, the engine 
(automatic and manual-choke engines) shall be started by depressing the 
accelerator pedal about half way and cranking the engine until it 
starts.
    (b) Diesel vehicles. The engine shall be started according to the 
manufacturers recommended starting procedures in the owners manual. The 
initial 20-second idle period shall begin when the engine starts. The 
transmission shall be placed in gear 15 seconds after the engine is 
started. If necessary, braking may be employed to keep the drive wheels 
from turning.
    (c) If the vehicle does not start after the manufacturer's 
recommended cranking time (or 10 continuous seconds in the absence of a 
manufacturer's recommendation), cranking shall cease for the period 
recommended by the manufacturer (or 10 seconds in the absence of a 
manufacturer's recommendation). This may be repeated for up to three 
start attempts. If the vehicle does not start after three attempts, the 
reason for failure to start shall be determined. The gas flow measuring 
device on the constant volume sampler (usually a revolution counter) or 
CFV (and the hydrocarbon integrator and particulate sampling system when 
testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles and the particulate sampling 
system when testing methanol-fueled diesel vehicles, see Sec. 86.137) 
shall be turned off and the sampler selector valves, including the 
methanol sampler, placed in the ``standby'' position during this 
diagnostic period. In addition, either the CVS should be turned off, or 
the exhaust tube disconnected from the tailpipe during the diagnostic 
period. If failure to start is an operational error, the vehicle shall 
be rescheduled for testing from a cold start.
    (d) If the engine ``false starts'' the operator shall repeat the 
recommended starting procedure (such as resetting the choke, etc.).
    (e) Stalling: (1) If the engine stalls during an idle period, the 
engine shall be restarted immediately and the test continued. If the 
engine cannot be started soon enough to allow the vehicle to follow the 
next acceleration as prescribed, the driving schedule indicator shall be 
stopped. When the vehicle restarts, the driving schedule indicator shall 
be reactivated.
    (2) If the engine stalls during some operating mode other than idle, 
the driving schedule indicator shall be stopped, the vehicle shall then 
be restarted and accelerated to the speed required at that point in the 
driving schedule and the test continued. During acceleration to this 
point, shifting shall be performed in accordance with Sec. 86.128.
    (3) If the vehicle will not restart within one minute, the test 
shall be voided, the vehicle removed from the dynamometer, corrective 
action taken, and the vehicle rescheduled for test. The reason for the 
malfunction (if determined) and the corrective action taken shall be 
reported to the Administrator.

Sec. 86.137-90  Dynamometer test run, gaseous and particulate emissions.

    (a) General--(1) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle 
vehicles. The vehicle shall be allowed to stand with the engine turned 
off for a period of not less than 12 hours or more than 36 hours before 
the cold start exhaust emission test. The cold start exhaust test shall 
follow the diurnal breathing loss test by not more than one hour. The 
vehicle shall be stored prior to the emission test in such a manner that 
precipitation (e.g., rain or dew) does not occur on the vehicle. The 
complete dynamometer test consists of a cold start drive of 7.5 miles 
(12.1 km) and simulates a hot start drive of 7.5 miles (12.1 km). The 
vehicle is allowed to stand on the dynamometer during the 10 minute time 
period between the cold and hot start tests. The cold start test is 
divided into two periods. The first period, representing the cold start 
``transient'' phase, terminates at the end of the deceleration which is 
scheduled to occur at 505 seconds of the driving schedule. The second 
period, representing the ``stabilized'' phase, consists of the remainder 
of the driving schedule including engine shutdown. The hot start test, 
similarly, consists of two periods. The first period, representing the 
hot start ``transient'' phase, terminates at the same point in driving 
schedule as the first period of the cold start test. The second period 
of the hot start test, ``stabilized'' phase, is assumed to be identical 
to the second period of the cold start test. Therefore, the hot start 
test terminates after the first period (505 seconds) is run.
    (2) Petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel vehicles. The 
vehicle shall be allowed to stand with the engine turned off for a 
period of not less than 12 hours or more than 36 hours before the cold 
start exhaust emission test. The vehicle shall be stored prior to the 
emission test in such a manner that precipitation (e.g., rain or dew) 
does not occur on the vehicle. The complete dynamometer test consists of 
a cold start drive of 7.5 miles (12.1 km), and simulates a hot start 
drive of 7.5 miles (l2.1 km). The vehicle is allowed to stand on the 
dynamometer during the 10 minute time period between the cold and hot 
start tests. The cold start test is divided into two periods. The first 
period, representing the cold start ``transient'' phase, terminates at 
the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 505 seconds 
of the driving schedule. The second period, representing the 
``stabilized'' phase, consists of the remainder of the driving schedule 
including engine shutdown. The hot start test, similarly, consists of 
two periods. The first period, representing the start of the 
``transient'' phase, terminates at the same point in the driving 
schedule as the first period of the cold start test. The second period 
of the hot start test, ``stabilized'' phase, is assumed to be identical 
to the second period of the cold start test. Therefore, the hot start 
test terminates after the first period (505 seconds) is run.
    (b) The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (1) Place drive wheels of vehicle on dynamometer without starting 
engine.
    (2) Open the vehicle engine compartment cover and position the 
cooling fan.
    (3) For all vehicles, with the sample selector valves in the 
``standby'' position, connect evacuated sample collection bags to the 
dilute exhaust and dilution air sample collection systems.
    (4) For methanol-fueled vehicles, with the sample selector valves in 
the ``standby'' position, insert fresh sample collection impingers into 
the methanol sample collection system, the formaldehyde sample 
collection system and fresh impingers (or capsules for formaldehyde) 
into the dilution air sample collection systems for methanol and 
formaldehyde (may be omitted for 1990 through 1994 model years).
    (5) Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps (except the 
diesel particulate sample pump, if applicable), the temperature 
recorder, the vehicle cooling fan, and the heated hydrocarbon analysis 
recorder (diesels only). (The heat exchanger of the constant volume 
sampler, if used, petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon analyzer 
continuous sample line and filter, methanol-fueled vehicle hydrocarbon, 
methanol and formaldehyde sample lines, if applicable, should be 
preheated

[[Page 516]]

to their respective operating temperatures before the test begins.)
    (6) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set 
the gas flow measuring devices to zero.
    (i) For gaseous bag samples (except hydrocarbon samples), the 
minimum flow rate is 0.17 cfm (0.08 1/sec).
    (ii) For hydrocarbon samples, the minimum FID (or HFID in the case 
of diesel- and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles) flow rate is 0.066 
cfm (0.031 1/sec).
    (iii) For methanol samples, the minimum flow rate is 0.14 cfm (0.067 
1/sec).
    (iv) For formaldehyde samples, the minimum flow rate is 0.036 cfm 
(0.017 l/s) with capsule collector and 0.14 cfm (0.067 l/s) with 
impinger.
    Note: CFV sample flow rate is fixed by the venturi design.
    (7) Attach the exhaust tube to the vehicle tailpipe(s).
    (8) Carefully install a particulate sample filter into each of the 
filter holders for diesel vehicle tests. The filters must be handled 
only with forceps or tongs. Rough or abrasive filter handling will 
result in erroneous weight determination.
    (9) Start the gas flow measuring device, position the sample 
selector valves to direct the sample flow into the ``transient'' exhaust 
sample bag, the ``transient'' methanol exhaust sample, the ``transient'' 
formaldehyde exhaust sample, the ``transient'' dilution air sample bag, 
the ``transient'' methanol dilution air sample and the ``transient'' 
formaldehyde dilution air sample (turn on the petroleum-fueled diesel 
hydrocarbon analyzer system integrator, mark the recorder chart, start 
particulate sample pump No. 1, and record both gas meter or flow 
measurement instrument readings, if applicable), turn the key on, and 
start cranking the engine.
    (10) Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission 
in gear.
    (11) Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial 
vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule.
    (12) Operate the vehicle according to the Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule (Sec. 86.115).

    Note: During diesel vehicle testing, adjust the flow rate through 
the particulate sample probe to maintain a constant value within 
<plus-minus>5 percent of the set flow rate. Record the average 
temperature and pressure at the gas meter or flow instrument inlet. If 
the set flow rate cannot be maintained because of high particulate 
loading on the filter, the test shall be terminated. The test shall be 
rerun using a lower flow rate, or larger diameter filter, or both.

    (13) At the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 
505 seconds, simultaneously switch the sample flows from the 
``transient'' bags and samples to the ``stabilized'' bags and samples, 
switch off gas flow measuring device No. 1, switch off the No. 1 
petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon integrator and the No. 1 particulate 
sample pump, mark the petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon recorder 
chart, and close valves isolating particulate filter No. 1, if 
applicable, and start gas flow measuring device No. 2, and start the 
petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon integrator No. 2 and the No. 2 
particulate sample pump and open valves isolating particulate filter No. 
2, if applicable. Before the acceleration which is scheduled to occur at 
510 seconds, record the measured roll or shaft revolutions and reset the 
counter or switch to a second counter. As soon as possible transfer the 
``transient'' exhaust and dilution air samples to the analytical system 
and process the samples according to Sec. 86.140 obtaining a stabilized 
reading of the bag exhaust sample on all analyzers within 20 minutes of 
the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Obtain methanol and 
formaldehyde sample analyses, if applicable, within 24 hours of the end 
of the sample collection phase of the test.
    (14) Turn the engine off 2 seconds after the end of the last 
deceleration (at 1,369 seconds).
    (15) Five seconds after the engine stops running, simultaneously 
turn off gas flow measuring device No. 2 and if applicable, turn off the 
petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon integrator No. 2, mark the 
hydrocarbon recorder chart, turn off the No. 2 particulate sample pump 
and close the valves isolating particulate filter No. 2, and position 
the sample selector valves to the ``standby'' position (and open the 
valves isolating particulate filter No. 1, if applicable). Record the 
measured roll or shaft revolutions (both gas meter or flow measurement 
instrumentation readings), and re-set the counter. As

[[Page 517]]

soon as possible, transfer the ``stabilized'' exhaust and dilution air 
samples to the analytical system and process the samples according to 
Sec. 86.140, obtaining a stabilized reading of the exhaust bag sample on 
all analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection 
phase of the test. Obtain methanol and formaldehyde sample analyses, if 
applicable, within 24 hours of the end of the sample period. If 
applicable, carefully remove both pairs of particulate sample filters 
from their respective holders, and place each in a separate petri dish, 
and cover.
    (16) Immediately after the end of the sample period, turn off the 
cooling fan and close the engine compartment cover.
    (17) Turn off the CVS or disconnect the exhaust tube from the 
tailpipe(s) of the vehicle.
    (18) Repeat the steps in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(2) of this 
section for the hot start test, except only two evacuated sample bags, 
two methanol sample impingers, two formaldehyde sample impingers, and 
one pair of particulate sample filters, as appropriate, are required. 
The step in paragraph (b)(9) of this section shall begin between 9 and 
11 minutes after the end of the sample period for the cold start test.
    (19) At the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 
505 seconds, simultaneously turn off gas flow measuring device No. 1 
(and the petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon integrator No. 1, mark the 
petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon recorder chart and turn off the No. 
1 particulate sample pump, if applicable) and position the sample 
selector valve to the ``standby'' position. (Engine shutdown is not part 
of the hot start test sample period.) Record the measured roll or shaft 
revolutions (and the No. 1 gas meter reading or flow measurement 
instrument). (Carefully remove the third pair of particulate sample 
filters from its holder and place in a clean petri dish and cover, if 
applicable.)
    (20) As soon as possible, transfer the hot start ``transient'' 
exhaust and dilution air samples to the analytical system and process 
the samples according to Sec. 86.140, obtaining a stabilized reading of 
the exhaust bag sample on all analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of 
the sample collection phase of the test. Obtain methanol and 
formaldehyde sample analyses, if applicable, within 24 hours of the end 
of the sample period. (If it is not possible to perform analysis on the 
methanol and formaldehyde samples, within 24 hours, the samples should 
be stored in a dark cold (4-10  deg.C) environment until analysis. The 
samples should be analyzed within fourteen days.)
    (21) As soon as possible, and in no case longer than one hour after 
the end of the hot start phase of the test, transfer the six particulate 
filters to the weighing chamber for post-test conditioning, if 
applicable.
    (22) Disconnect the exhaust tube from the vehicle tailpipe(s) and 
drive the vehicle from dynamometer.
    (23) The CVS or CFV may be turned off, if desired.
    (24) Vehicles to be tested for evaporative emissions will proceed 
according to Sec. 86.138. For all others this completes the test 
sequence.

Sec. 86.137-94  Dynamometer test run, gaseous and particulate emissions.

    Section 86.137-94 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.137-90. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.137-90 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.137-94, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.137-90.'' Where a corresponding paragraph of 
Sec. 86.137-90 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement 
``[Reserved].''
    (a) General. The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a cold start 
test, after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak according to 
the provisions of Sec. 86.132, and a hot start test following the cold 
start test by 10 minutes. The vehicle shall be stored prior to the 
emission test in such a manner that precipitation (e.g., rain or dew) 
does not occur on the vehicle. The complete dynamometer test consists of 
a cold start drive of 7.5 miles (12.1 km) and simulates a hot start 
drive of 7.5 miles (12.1 km). The vehicle is allowed to stand on the 
dynamometer during the 10 minute time period between the

[[Page 518]]

cold and hot start tests. The cold start test is divided into two 
periods. The first period, representing the cold start ``transient'' 
phase, terminates at the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to 
occur at 505 seconds of the driving schedule. The second period, 
representing the ``stabilized'' phase, consists of the remainder of the 
driving schedule including engine shutdown. The hot start test, 
similarly, consists of two periods. The first period, representing the 
hot start ``transient'' phase, terminates at the same point in driving 
schedule as the first period of the cold start test. The second period 
of the hot start test, ``stabilized'' phase, is assumed to be identical 
to the second period of the cold start test. Therefore, the hot start 
test terminates after the first period (505 seconds) is run.
    (b) The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (1) Place drive wheels of vehicle on dynamometer without starting 
engine.
    (2) Open the vehicle engine compartment cover and position the 
cooling fan.
    (3) For all vehicles, with the sample selector valves in the 
``standby'' position, connect evacuated sample collection bags to the 
dilute exhaust and dilution air sample collection systems.
    (4) For methanol-fueled vehicles, with the sample selector valves in 
the ``standby'' position, insert fresh sample collection impingers into 
the methanol sample collection system, fresh impingers or a fresh 
cartridge into the formaldehyde sample collection system and fresh 
impingers (or a single cartridge for formaldehyde) into the dilution air 
sample collection systems for methanol and formaldehyde (background 
measurements of methanol and formaldehyde may be omitted and 
concentrations assumed to be zero for calculations in Sec. 86.144).
    (5) Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps (except the 
particulate sample pump, if applicable), the temperature recorder, the 
vehicle cooling fan, and the heated THC analysis recorder (diesel-cycle 
only). (The heat exchanger of the constant volume sampler, if used, 
petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle THC analyzer continuous sample line and 
filter, methanol-fueled vehicle THC, methanol and formaldehyde sample 
lines, if applicable, should be preheated to their respective operating 
temperatures before the test begins).
    (6) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set 
the gas flow measuring devices to zero.
    (i) For gaseous bag samples (except THC samples), the minimum flow 
rate is 0.17 cfm (0.08 1/sec).
    (ii) For THC samples, the minimum FID (or HFID in the case of 
diesel-cycle and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles) flow rate is 0.066 
cfm (0.031 1/sec).
    (iii) For methanol samples, the flow rates shall be set such that 
the system meets the design criteria of Sec. 86.109 and Sec. 86.110. For 
samples in which the concentration in the primary impinger exceeds 0.5 
mg/l, it is recommended that the mass of methanol collected in the 
secondary impinger not exceed ten percent of the total mass collected. 
For samples in which the concentration in the primary impinger does not 
exceed 0.5 mg/l, analysis of the secondary impingers is not necessary.
    (iv) For formaldehyde samples, the flow rates shall be set such that 
the system meets the design criteria of Sec. 86.109 and Sec. 86.110. For 
impinger samples in which the concentration of formaldehyde in the 
primary impinger exceeds 0.1 mg/l, it is recommended that the mass of 
formaldehyde collected in the secondary impinger not exceed ten percent 
of the total mass collected. For samples in which the concentration in 
the primary impinger does not exceed 0.1 mg/l, analysis of the secondary 
impingers is not necessary.
    (7) Attach the exhaust tube to the vehicle tailpipe(s).
    (8) Carefully install a particulate sample filter into each of the 
filter holders. The filters must be handled only with forceps or tongs. 
Rough or abrasive filter handling will result in erroneous weight 
determination.
    (9) Start the gas flow measuring device, position the sample 
selector valves to direct the sample flow into the ``transient'' exhaust 
sample bag, the ``transient'' methanol exhaust sample, the ``transient'' 
formaldehyde exhaust sample, the ``transient'' dilution

[[Page 519]]

air sample bag, the ``transient'' methanol dilution air sample and the 
``transient'' formaldehyde dilution air sample (turn on the petroleum-
fueled diesel-cycle THC analyzer system integrator, mark the recorder 
chart, start particulate sample pump No. 1, and record both gas meter or 
flow measurement instrument readings, if applicable), turn the key on, 
and start cranking the engine.
    (10) Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission 
in gear.
    (11) Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial 
vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule.
    (12) Operate the vehicle according to the Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule (Sec. 86.115).
    Note: During particulate testing, adjust the flow rate through the 
particulate sample probe to maintain a constant value within 
<plus-minus>5 percent of the set flow rate. Record the average 
temperature and pressure at the gas meter or flow instrument inlet. If 
the set flow rate cannot be maintained because of high particulate 
loading on the filter, the test shall be terminated. The test shall be 
rerun using a lower flow rate, or larger diameter filter, or both.
    (13) At the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 
505 seconds, simultaneously switch the sample flows from the 
``transient'' bags and samples to the ``stabilized'' bags and samples, 
switch off gas flow measuring device No. 1, switch off the No. 1 
petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon integrator and the No. 1 particulate 
sample pump, mark the petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon recorder 
chart, and close valves isolating particulate filter No. 1, if 
applicable, start gas flow measuring device No. 2, and start the 
petroleum-fueled diesel hydrocarbon integrator No. 2 and the No. 2 
particulate sample pump and open valves isolating particulate filter No. 
2, if applicable. Before the acceleration which is scheduled to occur at 
510 seconds, record the measured roll or shaft revolutions and reset the 
counter or switch to a second counter. As soon as possible transfer the 
``transient'' exhaust and dilution air samples to the analytical system 
and process the samples according to Sec. 86.140 obtaining a stabilized 
reading of the bag exhaust sample on all analyzers within 20 minutes of 
the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Obtain methanol and 
formaldehyde sample analyses, if applicable, within 24 hours of the end 
of the sample collection phase of the test.
    (14) Turn the engine off 2 seconds after the end of the last 
deceleration (at 1,369 seconds).
    (15) Five seconds after the engine stops running, simultaneously 
turn off gas flow measuring device No. 2 and if applicable, turn off the 
hydrocarbon integrator No. 2, mark the hydrocarbon recorder chart, turn 
off the No. 2 particulate sample pump and close the valves isolating 
particulate filter No. 2, and position the sample selector valves to the 
``standby'' position (and open the valves isolating particulate filter 
No. 1, if applicable). Record the measured roll or shaft revolutions 
(both gas meter or flow measurement instrumentation readings), and reset 
the counter. As soon as possible, transfer the ``stabilized'' exhaust 
and dilution air samples to the analytical system and process the 
samples according to Sec. 86.140, obtaining a stabilized reading of the 
exhaust bag sample on all analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of the 
sample collection phase of the test. Obtain methanol and formaldehyde 
sample analyses, if applicable, within 24 hours of the end of the sample 
period. (If it is not possible to perform analysis on the methanol and 
formaldehyde samples within 24 hours, the samples should be stored in a 
dark cold (4-10  deg.C) environment until analysis. The samples should 
be analyzed within fourteen days.) If applicable, carefully remove both 
pairs of particulate sample filters from their respective holders, and 
place each in a separate petri dish, and cover.

Sec. 86.138-90  Hot-soak test.

    The hot-soak evaporative emission test shall be conducted 
immediately following the hot transient exhaust emission test.
    (a) Prior to the completion of the hot-start transient exhaust 
emission sampling period, the evaporative emission enclosure shall be 
purged for several minutes.
    (b) The enclosure doors shall be closed and sealed within two 
minutes of engine shutdown and within seven minutes after the end of the 
exhaust emission test. The steps after the end of the driving cycle 
should be done as quickly as possible to minimize the time needed to 
start the hot soak test.
    (c) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol sample 
collection system immediately prior to the start of the test, if 
applicable.
    (d) If not already on, the evaporative enclosure mixing fan shall be 
turned on at this time.
    (e) Upon completion of the hot transient exhaust emission sampling 
period, the vehicle engine compartment cover shall be closed, the 
cooling fan shall be moved, the vehicle shall be disconnected from the 
dynamometer and exhaust sampling system, and then driven at minimum 
throttle to the vehicle entrance of the enclosure.
    (f) The vehicle's engine must be stopped before any part of the 
vehicle enters the enclosure. The vehicle may be pushed or coasted into 
the enclosure.
    (g) The test vehicle windows and luggage compartments shall be 
opened, if not already open.
    (h) The temperature recording system shall be started and the time 
of engine shut off shall be noted on the evaporative emission 
hydrocarbon recording system.
    (i) The enclosure doors shall be closed and sealed within two 
minutes of engine shutdown and within five minutes after the end of the 
exhaust emission test.
    (j) The 60<plus-minus>0.5 minute hot soak begins when the enclosure 
doors are sealed. The enclosure atmosphere shall be analyzed for 
hydrocarbon and recorded. This is initial (time = 0 minutes) hydrocarbon 
concentration, C<INF>HCi</INF>, for use in calculating evaporative 
losses, see Sec. 86.143. The ``zero'' time methanol sample shall be 
collected starting at the same time as the hydrocarbon analysis is 
started. Sampling should continue for four minutes.
    (k) The test vehicle shall be permitted to soak for a period of one 
hour in the enclosure.
    (l) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the end of the test.
    (m) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol collection 
system immediately prior to the end of the test, if applicable.
    (n) At the end of the 60<plus-minus>0.5 minute test period, again 
analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and methanol, as 
described in Sec. 86.l38-90(j), and record time. These analyses provide 
the final (time = 60 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCf</INF>, and the final methanol level for use in calculating 
evaporative losses, see Sec. 86.143. This operation completes the 
evaporative emission measurement procedure.
    (o) Alternate method for methanol sampling. Since sample times of 
longer than four minutes may be necessary in order to collect an 
adequate and representative sample of methanol at the end of a test 
(when SHED concentrations are usually increasing rapidly), it may be 
necessary to rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and then 
bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow rate. 
The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flowing 
through the impingers should be minimized in

[[Page 521]]

order to prevent any losses. This alternative must be adopted if the 
four minute sample period is inadequate to collect a sample of 
sufficient concentration to allow accurate GC analysis.

<R05>
Sec. 86.138-96  Hot soak test.

    (a)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. For gasoline- and 
methanol-fueled vehicles, the hot soak test shall be conducted 
immediately following the running loss test. However, sampling of 
emissions from the running loss test is not required as preparation for 
the hot soak test.
    (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. Since gaseous-fueled vehicles are not 
required to perform a running loss test, the hot soak test shall be 
conducted within seven minutes after completion of the hot start exhaust 
test.
    (b) The hot soak test may be conducted in the running loss enclosure 
as a continuation of that test or in a separate enclosure.
    (1) If the hot soak test is conducted in the running loss enclosure, 
the driver may exit the enclosure after the running loss test. If 
exiting, the driver should use the personnel door described in 
Sec. 86.107-96(a)(2), exiting as quickly as possible with a minimum 
disturbance to the system. The final hydrocarbon and methanol 
concentration for the running loss test, measured in Sec. 86.134-
96(g)(1)(xx), shall be the initial hydrocarbon and methanol 
concentration (time=0 minutes) C<INF>HCi</INF> and 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, for the hot soak test.
    (2) If the vehicle must be moved to a different enclosure, the 
following steps must be taken:
    (i) The enclosure for the hot soak test shall be purged for several 
minutes prior to completion of the running loss test. WARNING: If at any 
time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and 
hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the enclosure should be immediately 
purged. This concentration provides at least a 4:1 safety factor against 
the lean flammability limit.
    (ii) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the test.
    (iii) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol sample 
collection system immediately prior to the start of the test, if 
applicable.
    (iv) If not already on, the mixing fan(s) shall be turned on at this 
time. Throughout the hot soak test, the mixing fan(s) shall circulate 
the air at a rate of 0.8<plus-minus>0.2 cfm per cubic foot of the 
nominal enclosure volume.
    (v) Begin sampling as follows:
    (A) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. 
This is the initial (time = 0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCi</INF>, required in Sec. 86.143. Hydrocarbon emissions may be 
sampled continuously during the test period.
    (B) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the initial (time=0 minutes) 
methanol concentration, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.143. Record the time elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-
minute sample period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient 
concentration to allow accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the 
methanol sample in a bag and then bubble the bag sample through the 
impingers at the specified flow rate. The time elapsed between 
collection of the bag sample and flow through the impingers should be 
minimized to prevent any losses.
    (vi) The vehicle engine compartment cover shall be closed (if not 
already closed), the cooling fan shall be moved, the vehicle shall be 
disconnected from the dynamometer and any sampling system, and then 
driven at minimum throttle to the enclosure for the hot soak test. These 
steps should be done as quickly as possible to minimize the time needed 
to start the hot soak test.
    (vii) The vehicle's engine must be stopped before any part of the 
vehicle enters the enclosure.
    (viii) The vehicle shall enter the enclosure; the enclosure doors 
shall be closed and sealed within 2 minutes of

[[Page 522]]

engine shutdown and within seven minutes after the end of the running 
loss test.
    (ix) The test vehicle windows and any luggage compartments shall be 
opened (if not already open). The vehicle engine compartment cover shall 
be closed (if not already closed).
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) The temperature recording system shall be started and the time 
of engine shutoff shall be noted on the evaporative emission hydrocarbon 
data recording system.
    (e) For the first 5 minutes of the hot soak test, the ambient 
temperature shall be maintained at 95<plus-minus>10  deg.F. For the 
remainder of the hot soak test, the ambient temperature shall be 
maintained at 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on 
average).
    (f) The 60<plus-minus>0.5 minute hot soak begins when the enclosure 
doors are sealed (or when the running loss test ends, if the hot soak 
test is conducted in the running loss enclosure).
    (g) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the end of the test.
    (h) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol collection 
system immediately prior to the end of the test, if applicable.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) At the end of the 60<plus-minus>0.5 minute test period:
    (1) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. 
This is the final (time=60 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCf</INF>, required in Sec. 86.143.
    (2) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol and record, if 
applicable. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the final (time=60 minutes) methanol 
concentration, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHf</INF>, required in Sec. 86.143. 
Record the time elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-minute sample 
period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to 
allow accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag 
and then bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified 
flow rate. The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and 
flow through the impingers should be minimized to prevent any losses.
    (k) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence (see Sec. 86.130-
96), the hot soak test described in Sec. 86.138-90 shall be conducted 
immediately following the hot transient exhaust emission test. This test 
requires ambient temperatures between 68 deg. and 86  deg.F at all 
times. The equipment and calibration specifications of Secs. 86.107-90 
and 86.117-90 may apply for this testing. Enclosures meeting the 
requirements of Secs. 86.107-96 and 86.117-96 may also be used. This hot 
soak test is followed by two consecutive diurnal heat builds, described 
in Sec. 86.133-96(p).
    (l) If the vehicle is to be tested for diurnal emissions, follow the 
procedure outlined in Sec. 86.133-96.

Sec. 86.139-90  Particulate filter handling and weighing.

    (a) At least 8 hours, but not more than 56 hours before the test, 
place each filter in an open, but protected, petri dish and place in the 
weighing chamber which meets the humidity and temperature specifications 
of Sec. 86.112.
    (b) At the end of the 8 to 56 hour stabilization period, weigh the 
filter on a balance having a precision of one microgram. Record this 
weight. This reading is the tare weight.
    (c) The filter shall then be stored in a covered petri dish which 
shall remain in the weighing chamber until needed for testing.
    (d)(1) If the filter is not used within one hour of its removal from 
the weighing chamber, it shall be reweighed.
    (2) The one hour limit may be replaced by an eight-hour limit if one 
or both of the following conditions are met:
    (i) A stabilized filter is placed and kept in a sealed filter holder 
assembly with the ends plugged, or
    (ii) A stabilized filter is placed in a sealed filter holder 
assembly, which is then immediately placed in a sample line through 
which there is no flow.
    (e) After the test, and after the sample filter is returned to the 
weighing room, condition it for at least 1 hour

[[Page 523]]

but not more than 56 hours. Then weigh a second time. This latter 
reading is the gross weight of the filter. Record this weight.
    (f) The net weight (P<INF>e</INF>) is the gross weight minus the 
tare weight.
    Note: Should the sample on the filter contact the petri dish or any 
other surface, the test is void and must be rerun.

Sec. 86.140-82  Exhaust sample analysis.

    The following sequence of operations shall be performed in 
conjunction with each series of measurement Y:
    (a) For CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF> and gasoline HC:
    (1) Zero the analyzers and obtain a stable zero reading. Recheck 
after tests.
    (2) Introduce span gases and set instrument gains. In order to avoid 
errors, span and calibrate at the same flow rates used to analyze the 
test sample. Span gases should have concentrations equal to 75 to 100 
percent of full scale. If gain has shifted significantly on the 
analyzers, check the calibrations. Show actual concentrations on chart.
    (3) Check zeros; repeat the procedure in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) 
of this section if required.
    (4) Check flow rates and pressures.
    (5) Measure HC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> concentrations 
of samples.
    (6) Check zero and span points. If difference is greater than 2 
percent of full scale, repeat the procedure in paragraphs (a) (1) 
through (5) of this section.
    (b) For diesel HC:
    (1) Zero HFID analyzer and obtain a stable zero reading.
    (2) Introduce span gas and set instrument gains. Span gas should 
have concentration equal to 75 to 100 percent of full scale.
    (3) Check zero as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Introduction of zero and span gas into the analyzer can be 
accomplished by either of the following methods:
    (i) Close heated valve in HC sample (see Figures B82-3 or B82-4), 
and allow gases to enter HFID. Extreme care should be taken not to 
introduce gases under high pressure.
    (ii) Connect zero and span line directly to HC sample probe and 
introduce gases at a flow rate greater than 125 percent of the HFID flow 
rate with the CVS blower operating (see figures B82-3A or B82-4A). 
Excess flow must be allowed to exit probe inlet.

    Note: In order to minimize errors, HFID flow rate and pressure 
during zero and span (and background bag reading) must be exactly the 
same as that used during testing.
    (5) Continuously record (integrate electronically if desired) dilute 
hydrocarbon emissions levels during test. Background samples are 
collected in sample bags and analyzed as in paragraph (4)(i) or (4)(ii) 
of this section.
    (6) Check zero and span as in paragraph (b)(1) through (b)(4)(i) or

petroleum gas-fueled (if non-heated FID option is used) diesel vehicle 
HC:
    (1) Zero the analyzers and obtain a stable zero reading. Recheck 
after tests.

[[Page 527]]

    (2) Introduce span gases and set instrument gains. In order to avoid 
errors, span and calibrate at the same flow rates used to analyze the 
test sample. Span gases should have concentrations equal to 75 to 100 
percent of full scale. If gain has shifted significantly on the 
analyzers, check the calibrations. Show actual concentrations on chart.
    (3) Check zeroes; repeat the procedure in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) 
of this section if required.
    (4) Check flow rates and pressures.
    (5) Measure THC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and 
NO<INF>X</INF> concentrations of samples.
    (6) Check zero and span points. If difference is greater than 2 
percent of full scale, repeat the procedure in paragraphs (a) (1) 
through (5) of this section.
    (b) For petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum 
gas-fueled (if HFID is used) diesel vehicle HC:
    (1) Zero HFID analyzer and obtain a stable zero reading.
    (2) Introduce span gas and set instrument gains. Span gas should 
have concentration equal to 75 to 100 percent of full scale.
    (3) Check zero as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Introduction of zero and span gas into the analyzer can be 
accomplished by either of the following methods:
    (i) Close heated valve in THC sample (see Figures B94-5 or B94-6) 
and allow gases to enter HFID. Extreme care should be taken not to 
introduce gases under high pressure.
    (ii) Connect zero and span line directly to THC sample probe and 
introduce gases at a flow rate greater than 125 percent of the HFID flow 
rate with the CVS blower operating (see Figures B94-5 or B94-6). Excess 
flow must be allowed to exit probe inlet.
    Note: In order to minimize errors, HFID flow rate and pressure 
during zero and span (and background bag reading) must be exactly the 
same as that used during testing.
    (5) Continuously record (integrate electronically if desired) dilute 
THC emission levels during test. Background samples are collected in 
sample bags and analyzed as in paragraphs (b)(4) (i) or (ii) of this 
section.
    (6) Check zero and span as in paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this 
section. If difference is greater than 2 percent of full scale, void 
test and check for THC ``hangup'' or electronic drift in analyzer.
    (c) For CH<INF>3</INF>OH (methanol-fueled vehicles), introduce test 
samples into the gas chromatograph and measure the concentration. This 
concentration is C<INF>MS</INF> in the calculations.
    (d) For HCHO (methanol-fueled vehicles), introduce formaldehyde test 
samples into the high pressure liquid chromatograph and measure the 
concentration of formaldehyde as a dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative in 
acetonitrile. This concentration is C<INF>FS</INF> in the calculations.
    (e) For CH<INF>4</INF> analysis:
    (1) In the event that the procedure results in negative 
NMHC<INF>wm</INF> values (as may occur with high methane fractions), any 
negative NMHC<INF>wm</INF> value whose absolute value is less than 10 
percent of the NMHC standard shall be rounded to zero. Negative 
NMHC<INF>wm</INF> values whose absolute value is more than 10 percent of 
the NMHC standard shall require sample remeasurement. If the 10 percent 
criterion cannot be met after remeasurement, the test will be void.
    (2) Other sampling procedures may be used if shown to yield 
equivalent or superior results and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator.

Sec. 86.145-82  Calculations; particulate emissions.

    (a) The final reported test results for the mass particulate 
(M<INF>p</INF>) in grams/mile shall be computed as follows.
M<INF>p</INF> = 0.43(M<INF>p1</INF> + M<INF>p2</INF>)/(D<INF>ct</INF> + 
D<INF>s</INF>) + 0.57(M<INF>p3</INF> + M<INF>p2</INF>)/(D<INF>ht</INF> = 
D<INF>s</INF>)

where:
    (1) M<INF>p1</INF> = Mass of particulate determined from the 
``transient'' phase of the cold start test, in grams per test phase. 
(See Sec. 86.110-82(c)(1) for determination.)
    (2) M<INF>p2</INF> = Mass of particulate determined from the 
``stabilized'' phase of the cold start test, in grams per test phase. 
(See Sec. 86.110-82(c)(1) for determination.)
    (3) M<INF>p3</INF> = Mass of particulate determined from the 
``transient'' phase of the hot start test, in grams per test phase. (See

``stabilized'' phase of the cold start test, in miles.
    (6) D<INF>ht</INF> = The measured driving distance from the

    (b) The mass of particulate for each phase of testing is determined 
as follows:

where:
    (1) j = 1, 2 or 3 depending on which phase the mass of particulate 
is being determined for (i.e., the ``transient'' phase of the cold start 
test, the ``stabilized'' phase of the cold start test, or the 
``transient'' phase of the hot start test).
    (2) V<INF>mix</INF> = Total dilute exhaust volume in cubic meters

Hg (101.3 kPa). V<INF>mix</INF> is further defined in Sec. 86.144.
    (3) P<INF>e</INF> = mass of particulate per test on the exhaust 
filter(s), grams.
    (4) P<INF>b</INF> = mass of particulate on the ``background''

periodically to verify the low level.
    (ii) Any manufacturer may make the same assumption without prior EPA 
approval.
    (iii) If P<INF>b</INF> is assumed = 0, then no background correction 
is made. The equation for particulate mass emissions then reduces to:

Sec. 86.146-96  Fuel dispensing spitback procedure.

    (a) The vehicle is fueled at a rate of 10 gal/min to test for fuel 
spitback emissions. All liquid fuel spitback emissions that occur during 
the test are collected in a bag made of a material impermeable to 
hydrocarbons or methanol. The bag shall be designed and used so that 
liquid fuel does not spit back onto the vehicle body, adjacent floor, 
etc., and it must not impede the free flow of displaced gasoline vapor 
from the orifice of the filler pipe. The bag must be designed to permit 
passage of the dispensing nozzle through the bag. If the bag has been 
used for previous testing, sufficient time shall be allowed for the bag 
to dry out. The dispensing nozzle shall be a commercial model, not 
equipped with vapor recovery hardware.
    (b) Ambient temperature levels encountered by the test vehicle shall 
be not less than 68  deg.F nor more than 86  deg.F. The temperatures 
monitored during testing must be representative of those experienced by 
the test vehicle. The vehicle shall be approximately level during all 
phases of the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution.
    (c) Measure and record the mass of the bag to be used for collecting 
spitback emissions to the nearest 0.01 gram.
    (d) Drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in 
Sec. 86.113, to 10 percent of the reported nominal fuel tank capacity. 
The fuel cap(s) shall be installed immediately after refueling.
    (e) The vehicle shall be soaked at 80<plus-minus>6  deg.F 
(27<plus-minus>3  deg.C) for a minimum of six hours, then placed, either 
by being driven or pushed, on a dynamometer and operated through one 
Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (specified in Sec. 86.115 and 
appendix I of this part). The test vehicle may not be used to set 
dynamometer horsepower.

[[Page 547]]

    (f) Following the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be moved 
or driven at minimum throttle to the refueling area.
    (g) All areas in proximity to the vehicle fuel fill orifice and the 
dispenser nozzle itself shall be completely dry of liquid fuel.
    (h) The fuel filler neck shall be snugly fitted with the vented bag 
to capture any fuel emissions. The fuel nozzle shall be inserted through 
the bag into the filler neck of the test vehicle to its maximum 
penetration. The plane of the nozzle's handle shall be perpendicular to 
the floor of the laboratory.
    (i) The fueling procedure consists of dispensing fuel through a 
nozzle, interrupted by a series of automatic shutoffs. A minimum of 3 
seconds shall elapse between any automatic shutoff and subsequent 
resumption of dispensing. Dispensing may not be manually terminated, 
unless the test vehicle has already clearly failed the test. The vehicle 
shall be fueled according to the following procedure:
    (1) The fueling operation shall be started within 4 minutes after 
the vehicle is turned off and within 8 minutes after completion of the 
preconditioning drive. The average temperature of the dispensed fuel 
shall be 65<plus-minus>5  deg.F (18<plus-minus>3  deg.C).
    (2) The fuel shall be dispensed at a rate of 9.8<plus-minus>0.3 
gallons/minute (37.1<plus-minus>1.1 L/min) until the automatic shutoff 
is activated.
    (3) If the automatic shutoff is activated before the nozzle has 
dispensed an amount of fuel equal to 70 percent of the tank's nominal 
capacity, the dispensing may be resumed at a reduced rate. Repeat as 
necessary until the nozzle has dispensed an amount of fuel equal to at 
least 70 percent of the tank's nominal capacity.
    (4) Once the automatic shutoff is activated after the nozzle has 
dispensed an amount of fuel equal to 70 percent of the tank's nominal 
capacity, the fuel shall be dispensed at a rate of 5<plus-minus>1 
gallons/minute (19<plus-minus>4 <script-l>/min) for all subsequent 
dispensing. Dispensing shall be restarted two additional times.
    (5) If the nozzle has dispensed an amount of fuel less than 85 
percent of the tank's nominal capacity after the two additional 
dispensing restarts, dispensing shall be resumed, and shall continue 
through as many automatic shutoffs as necessary to achieve this level. 
This completes the fueling procedure.
    (j) Withdraw the nozzle from the vehicle and the bag, holding the 
tip of the nozzle upward to avoid any dripping into the bag.
    (k) Within 1 minute after completion of the fueling event, the bag 
shall be folded to minimize the vapor volume inside the bag. The bag 
shall be folded as quickly as possible to prevent evaporation of 
collected emissions.
    (l) Within 5 minutes after completion of the fueling event, the mass 
of the bag and its contents shall be measured and recorded (consistent 
with paragraph (c) of this section). The bag shall be weighed as quickly 
as possible to prevent evaporation of collected emissions.

    (a) The refueling emissions test procedure described in this and 
subsequent sections is used to determine the conformity of vehicles with 
the refueling emissions standards set forth in subpart A of this part 
for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The refueling emissions 
test procedure may be performed as an individual test or in combination 
with the evaporative and exhaust emissions test sequences of 
Sec. 86.130-96.
    (b) The refueling emissions test is designed to measure hydrocarbon 
emissions resulting from the generation or displacement of fuel tank 
vapor during vehicle refueling. The refueling emissions shall be 
measured by the enclosure technique.
    (c) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a 
new motor vehicle shall be functioning during all procedures in this 
subpart except:
    (1) In cases of component malfunction or failure; and
    (2) during certain specified fuel drain and fill operations, at 
which times the refueling emission control canister is disconnected. 
Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall

Sec. 86.152-98  Vehicle preparation; refueling test.

    (a) Provide additional fittings and adapters, as required, to 
accommodate a fuel drain at the lowest point possible in the tank(s) as 
installed on the vehicle. The canister shall not be removed from the 
vehicle, unless access to the canister in its normal location is so 
restricted that purging and loading can only reasonably be accomplished 
by removing the canister from the vehicle. Special care shall be taken 
during this step to avoid damage to the components and the integrity of 
the fuel system. A replacement canister may be temporarily installed 
during the soak period while the canister from the test vehicle is 
preconditioned.
    (b) Provide valving or other means to allow the venting of the 
refueling vapor line to the atmosphere rather than to the refueling 
emissions canister(s) when required by this test procedure.

[[Page 550]]

    (c) For preconditioning that involves loading the vapor collection 
canister(s) with butane, provide valving or other means as necessary to 
allow loading of the canister(s).

<R05>
Sec. 86.153-98  Vehicle and canister preconditioning; refueling test.

    (a) Vehicle and canister preconditioning. Vehicles and vapor storage 
canisters shall be preconditioned in accordance with the preconditioning 
procedures for the supplemental two-diurnal evaporative emissions test 
specified in Sec. 86.132-96 (a) through (j). For vehicles equipped with 
non-integrated refueling emission control systems, the canister must be 
loaded using the method involving butane loading to breakthrough (see 
Sec. 86.132-96(j)(1)).
    (b) Seal test. The Administrator may choose to omit certain canister 
load and purge steps, and replace them with a bench purge of the 
refueling canister(s), in order to verify the adequacy of refueling 
emission control system seals. Failure of this seal test shall 
constitute a failure of the refueling emission control test. For 
integrated systems, this bench purge may be performed after the exhaust 
testing in order to obtain exhaust emission test results. Non-integrated 
system seal testing shall be performed using paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    (1) Without the exhaust emission test. The Administrator may conduct 
the canister preconditioning by purging the canister(s) with at least 
1200 canister bed volumes of ambient air (with humidity controlled to 
50<plus-minus>25 grains of water vapor per pound of dry air) maintained 
at a nominal flow rate of 0.8 cfm directly following the preconditioning 
drive described in Sec. 86.132-96 (c) through (e). In this case, the 
canister loading procedures and the vehicle driving procedures described 
in Sec. 86.132-96 (f) through (j) and in paragraphs (c) through (d) of 
this section shall be omitted, and the 10 minute and 60 minute time 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to time after 
completion of the bench purge. In the case of multiple refueling 
canisters, each canister shall be purged separately.
    (2) With the exhaust emission test. The Administrator may conduct 
the canister preconditioning by purging the canister(s) directly after 
the exhaust test (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). The canister 
shall be purged with at least 1200 canister bed volumes of ambient air 
(with humidity controlled to 50<plus-minus>25 grains of water vapor per 
pound of dry air) maintained at a nominal flow rate of 0.8 cfm. In this 
case, the vehicle driving procedures described in paragraphs (c)(2) 
through (d) of this section shall be omitted, and the 10 minute and 60 
minute time requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to 
time after completion of the bench purge. In the case of multiple 
refueling canisters, each canister shall be purged separately.
    (c) Canister purging; integrated systems. (1) Vehicles to be tested 
for exhaust emissions only shall be processed according to Secs. 86.135-
94 through 86.137-96. Vehicles to be tested for refueling emissions 
shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in Secs. 86.135-94 
through 86.137-96, followed by the procedures outlined in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (2) To provide additional opportunity for canister purge, conduct 
additional driving on a dynamometer, within one hour of completion of 
the hot start exhaust test, by operating the test vehicle through one 
UDDS, a 2 minute idle, two NYCCs, another 2 minute idle, another UDDS, 
then another 2 minute idle (see Sec. 86.115-78 and appendix I of this 
part). Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission 
in gear. Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial 
vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule. The transmission shall be 
operated according to the specifications of Sec. 86.128-79 during the 
driving cycles. The vehicle's air conditioner (if so equipped) shall be 
turned off. Ambient temperature shall be controlled as specified in 
Sec. 86.151-98. It is not necessary to monitor and/or control in-tank 
fuel temperatures.
    (i) The fixed-speed fan specified in Sec. 86.135-94(b) may be used 
for engine cooling. If a fixed-speed fan is used, the vehicle's hood 
shall be opened.
    (ii) Alternatively, the roadspeed-modulated fan specified in 
Sec. 86.107-96(d)(1) may be used for engine cooling.

[[Page 551]]

If a road-speed modulated fan is used, the vehicle's hood shall be 
closed.
    (d) Canister purging; non-integrated systems. Within one hour of 
completion of canister loading to breakthrough, the fuel tank(s) shall 
be further filled to 95 percent of nominal tank capacity determined to 
the nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter) with the fuel 
specified in Sec. 86.113-94. During this fueling operation, the 
refueling emissions canister(s) shall be disconnected. Following 
completion of refueling, the refueling emissions canister(s) shall be 
reconnected. Special care shall be taken during this step to avoid 
damage to the components and the integrity of the fuel system. Vehicle 
driving to purge the refueling canister(s) shall be performed using 
either the chassis dynamometer procedure or the test track procedure, as 
described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. The 
Administrator may choose to shorten the vehicle driving for a partial 
refueling test as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For 
vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, the required volume of fuel 
shall be driven out of one tank, the second tank shall be selected as 
the fuel source, and the required volume of fuel shall be driven out of 
the second tank.
    (1) Chassis dynamometer procedure. (i) Vehicle driving on a chassis 
dynamometer shall consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85 
percent of fuel tank capacity has been consumed. Driving in testing 
performed by manufacturers may be terminated before 85 percent of the 
fuel tank capacity has been consumed, provided that driving is not 
terminated partway through a UDDS cycle. Driving in testing performed by 
the Administrator may be terminated after the same number of UDDS cycles 
as driven in the manufacturer's certification testing.
    (ii) Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, the 
number of UDDSs required to consume 85 percent of tank fuel capacity 
(total capacity of both tanks when the vehicle is equipped with dual 
fuel tanks) shall be determined from the fuel economy on the UDDS 
applicable to the test vehicle and from the number of gallons to the 
nearest 0.1 gallon (0.38 liter) that constitutes 85 percent of tank 
volume. If this ``fuel consumed point'' occurs partway through a UDDS 
cycle, the cycle shall be completed in its entirety.
    (iii) For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, fuel switching 
from the first tank to the second tank shall occur at the 10 percent 
volume of the first tank regardless of the point in the UDDS cycle at 
which this occurs.
    (iv) If necessary to accommodate work schedules, the engine may be 
turned off and the vehicle parked on the dynamometer. The vehicle may be 
parked off of the dynamometer to facilitate maintenance or repairs if 
required.
    (v) During the driving on the dynamometer, a cooling fan(s) shall be 
positioned as described in Sec. 86.135-94(b).
    (2) Test track procedure. (i) Vehicle driving on a test track shall 
consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85 percent of fuel tank 
capacity has been consumed. Driving performed by manufacturers may be 
terminated before 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity has been 
consumed, provided that driving is not terminated partway through a UDDS 
cycle. Driving performed by the Administrator may be terminated after 
the same number of UDDS cycles as driven in the manufacturer's 
certification testing.
    (ii) If the distance from the emission laboratory to the test track 
is less than 5 miles (8.05 km) the vehicle may be driven to the test 
track at a speed not to exceed 25 mph. If the distance is greater than 5 
miles (8.05 km) the vehicle shall be moved to the test track with the 
engine off.
    (iii) Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, the 
number of UDDSs required to consume 85 percent of tank fuel capacity 
(total capacity of both tanks when the vehicle is equipped with dual 
fuel tanks) shall be determined from the fuel economy on the UDDS 
applicable to the test vehicle and from the number of gallons to the 
nearest 0.1 gallon (0.38 liter) that constitutes 85 percent of tank 
volume. If this ``fuel consumed point'' occurs partway through a UDDS 
cycle, the cycle shall be completed in its entirety.
    (iv) The vehicle shall be driven at a speed not to exceed 25 mph 
from the

[[Page 552]]

test track to the laboratory provided the distance from the test track 
to the laboratory does not exceed 5 miles (8.05 km). If the distance 
from the test track to the emission laboratory is greater than 5 miles 
(8.05 km) the vehicle shall be moved from the test track with the engine 
off.
    (v) For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, fuel switching from 
the first tank to the second tank shall occur at the 10 percent volume 
of the first tank regardless of the point in the UDDS cycle at which 
this occurs.
    (vi) If necessary to accommodate work schedules, the engine may be 
turned off and the vehicle parked on the test track. The vehicle may be 
parked off of the test track to facilitate maintenance or repairs if 
required. If the vehicle is moved from the test track, it shall be 
returned to the track with the engine off when mileage accumulation is 
to be resumed.
    (3) Drive schedule for partial refueling test. The Administrator may 
conduct a partial refueling test involving a shortening of the drive 
procedures described in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section and a 
modified soak and refueling procedure as described in paragraph (e) of 
this section and Sec. 86.154-98(e)(7)(i). The drive shall be performed 
as described in paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section except that the 
drive shall be terminated when at least 10 percent but no more than 85 
percent of the fuel tank nominal capacity has been consumed and not 
partway through a UDDS cycle. The amount of fuel consumed in the drive 
shall be determined by multiplying the number of UDDSs driven by the 
mileage accumulated per UDDS and dividing by the fuel economy for the 
UDDS applicable to the test vehicle.
    (e) Vehicle cool down--(1) Partial refueling test. If the 
Administrator is conducting the non-integrated system partial refueling 
test, after the driving procedure specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, the vehicle shall be parked (without starting the engine) and 
soaked at 80<plus-minus>3  deg.F (27<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C) for a 
minimum of 1 hour and a maximum of 6 hours.
    (2) For all other refueling emission tests. Within 10 minutes of 
completion of refueling emissions canister stabilization (see paragraph 
(c) or (d) of this section), the refueling emissions canister(s) shall 
be disconnected. Within 60 minutes of completion of refueling emissions 
canister stabilization (see paragraph (c) or (d) of this section), the 
vehicle fuel tank(s) shall be drained, the fuel tank(s) fueled to 10 
percent of nominal tank capacity determined to the nearest one-tenth of 
a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter) with the specified fuel, and the vehicle 
parked (without starting the engine) and soaked at 80<plus-minus>3 
deg.F (27<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C) for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum 
of 24 hours.

Sec. 86.154-98  Measurement procedure; refueling test.

    (a) The refueling test measurement procedure described in this 
section immediately follows the vehicle and canister preconditioning 
described in Sec. 86.153-98.
    (b) The refueling emission enclosure shall be purged for several 
minutes immediately prior to the test. Warning: If at any time the 
concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and 
hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C, the enclosure should be immediately 
purged. This concentration provides a 4:1 safety factor against the lean 
flammability limit.
    (c)(1) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer, and additional 
analyzer, if needed, shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to 
the test.
    (2) For methanol-fueled vehicles only, impingers charged with known 
volumes of pure deionized water shall be placed in the methanol sampling 
system.
    (d) If not already on, the enclosure mixing fan and the spilled fuel 
mixing blower shall be turned on at this time.
    (e) The refueling emission measurement portion of the refueling test 
shall be performed as follows:
    (1) The line from the fuel tank(s) to the refueling emissions 
canister(s) shall be connected.
    (2) The test vehicle, with the engine shut off, shall be moved into 
the enclosure. The test vehicle windows and luggage compartment shall be 
opened if not already open.

[[Page 553]]

    (3) An electrical ground shall be attached to the vehicle. The 
vehicle fuel filler cap shall be removed and the enclosure door shall be 
closed and sealed within two minutes of cap removal. The FID (or HFID) 
trace shall be allowed to stabilize.
    (4) The dispensed fuel temperature recording system shall be 
started.
    (5)(i) Within 10 minutes of closing and sealing the doors, analyze 
enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This is the initial 
(time=0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCi</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.143-96.
    (ii) For methanol-fueled vehicles only, measure the initial 
concentration of methanol as described in Sec. 86.133-96(i)(6).
    (6) Within one minute of obtaining the initial FID (or HFID) 
reading, and methanol reading if applicable, the fuel nozzle shall be 
inserted into the filler neck of the test vehicle, to its maximum 
penetration, and the refueling operation shall be started. The plane of 
the nozzle's handle shall be approximately perpendicular to the floor of 
the laboratory. The fuel shall be dispensed at a temperature of 
67<plus-minus>1.5  deg.F (19.4<plus-minus>0.8  deg.C) and at a 
dispensing rate of 9.8<plus-minus>0.3 gal/min (37.1<plus-minus>1.1 
liter/min). In testing conducted by the Administrator, a lower 
dispensing rate (no lower than 4.0 gal/min (15.1 liter/min)) may be 
used.
    (7)(i) Partial refueling test. If the Administrator conducts the 
non-integrated system partial refueling test, the fuel flow shall 
continue until the amount of fuel pumped is equal to the fuel consumed 
during the driving, as determined in accordance with Sec. 86.153-
98(d)(3). The final volume of fuel dispensed must be within one-tenth of 
a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter) of the targeted amount. If automatic nozzle 
shut-off occurs prior to this point, the nozzle shall be reactivated 
within 15 seconds and fuel dispensing continued as needed. A minimum of 
3 seconds shall elapse between any automatic shutoff and subsequent 
resumption of dispensing.
    (ii) For all other refueling tests. The fuel flow shall continue 
until the refueling nozzle automatic shut-off is activated. The amount 
of fuel dispensed must be at least 85 percent of nominal fuel tank 
volume, determined to the nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon (0.38 
liter). If automatic nozzle shut-off occurs prior to this point, the 
nozzle shall be reactivated within 15 seconds and fuel dispensing 
continued as needed. A minimum of 3 seconds shall elapse between any 
automatic shutoff and subsequent resumption of dispensing. Dispensing 
may not be manually terminated, unless the test vehicle has already 
clearly failed the test.
    (8)(i) The final reading of the evaporative enclosure FID analyzer 
shall be taken 60<plus-minus>5 seconds following the final shut-off of 
fuel flow. This is the final hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCf</INF>, 
required in Sec. 86.143-96. The elapsed time, in minutes, between the 
initial and final FID (or HFID) readings shall be recorded.
    (ii) For methanol-fueled vehicles only. Measure the final 
concentration of methanol as described in Sec. 86.133-96(m)(2).
    (9) For vehicles equipped with more than one fuel tank, the 
procedures described in this section shall be performed for each fuel 
tank.

Sec. 86.158-00  Supplemental Federal Test Procedures; overview.

    The procedures described in Secs. 86.158-00, 86.159-00, 86.160-00, 
and 86.166-00 discuss the aggressive driving (US06) and air conditioning 
(SC03) elements of the Supplemental Federal Test Procedures (SFTP). 
These test procedures consist of two separable test elements: A sequence 
of vehicle operation that tests exhaust emissions with a driving 
schedule (US06) that tests exhaust emissions under high speeds and 
accelerations (aggressive driving); and a sequence of vehicle operation 
that tests exhaust emissions with a driving schedule (SC03) which 
includes the impacts of actual air conditioning operation. These test 
procedures (and the associated standards set forth in subpart A of this 
part) are applicable to light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.

[[Page 556]]

    (a) Vehicles are tested for the exhaust emissions of THC, CO, 
NO<INF>X</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and CO<INF>2</INF>. For diesel-cycle 
vehicles, THC is sampled and analyzed continuously according to the 
provisions of Sec. 86.110.
    (b) Each test procedure follows the vehicle preconditioning 
specified in Sec. 86.132-00.
    (c) US06 Test Cycle. The test procedure for emissions on the US06 
driving schedule (see Sec. 86.159-00) is designed to determine gaseous 
exhaust emissions from light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks while 
simulating high speed and acceleration on a chassis dynamometer 
(aggressive driving). The full test consists of preconditioning the 
engine to a hot stabilized condition, as specified in Sec. 86.132-00, 
and an engine idle period of 1 to 2 minutes, after which the vehicle is 
accelerated into the US06 cycle. A proportional part of the diluted 
exhaust is collected continuously for subsequent analysis, using a 
constant volume (variable dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi 
sampler.
    (d) SC03 Test Cycle. The test procedure for determining exhaust 
emissions with the air conditioner operating (see Sec. 86.160-00) is 
designed to determine gaseous exhaust emissions from light-duty vehicles 
and light-duty trucks while simulating an urban trip during ambient 
conditions of 95  deg.F, 100 grains of water/pound of dry air 
(approximately 40 percent relative humidity), and a solar heat load 
intensity of 850 W/m<SUP>2</SUP>. The full test consists of vehicle 
preconditioning (see Sec. 86.132-00 paragraphs (o) (1) and (2)), an 
engine key-off 10 minute soak, an engine start, and operation over the 
SC03 cycle. A proportional part of the diluted exhaust is collected 
continuously during the engine start and the SC03 driving cycle for 
subsequent analysis, using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler 
or critical flow venturi sampler.
    (e) The emission results from the aggressive driving test 
(Sec. 86.159-00), air conditioning test (Sec. 86.160-00), and a FTP test 
(Sec. 86.130-00 (a) through (d) and (f)) (conducted on a large single 
roll or equivalent dynamometer) are analyzed according to the 
calculation methodology in Sec. 86.164-00 and compared to the applicable 
SFTP emission standards in subpart A of this part (Secs. 86.108-00 and 
86.109-00).
    (f) These test procedures may be run in any sequence that maintains 
the applicable preconditioning elements specified in Sec. 86.132-00.

Sec. 86.159-00  Exhaust emission test procedures for US06 emissions.

    (a) Overview. The dynamometer operation consists of a single, 600 
second test on the US06 driving schedule, as described in appendix I, 
paragraph (g), of this part. The vehicle is preconditioned in accordance 
with Sec. 86.132-00, to bring it to a warmed-up stabilized condition. 
This preconditioning is followed by a 1 to 2 minute idle period that 
proceeds directly into the US06 driving schedule during which continuous 
proportional samples of gaseous emissions are collected for analysis. If 
engine stalling should occur during cycle operation, follow the 
provisions of Sec. 86.136-90 (engine starting and restarting). For 
gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the composite samples collected in 
bags are analyzed for THC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and 
NO<INF>X</INF>. For petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles, THC is 
sampled and analyzed continuously according to the provisions of 
Sec. 86.110. Parallel bag samples of dilution air are analyzed for THC, 
CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (b) Dynamometer activities. (1) All official US06 tests shall be run 
on a large single roll electric dynamometer, or an approved equivalent 
dynamometer configuration, that satisfies the requirements of 
Sec. 86.108-00.
    (2) Position (vehicle can be driven) the test vehicle on the 
dynamometer and restrain.
    (3) Required US06 schedule test dynamometer inertia weight class 
selections are determined by the test vehicles test weight basis and 
corresponding equivalent weight as listed in the tabular information of 
Sec. 86.129-94(a) and discussed in Sec. 86.129-00 (e) and (f).
    (4) Set the dynamometer test inertia weight and roadload horsepower 
requirements for the test vehicle (see Sec. 86.129-00 (e) and (f). The 
dynamometer's horsepower adjustment settings shall be set to match the 
force

[[Page 557]]

imposed during dynamometer operation with actual road load force at all 
speeds.
    (5) The vehicle speed as measured from the dynamometer rolls shall 
be used. A speed vs. time recording, as evidence of dynamometer test 
validity, shall be supplied on request of the Administrator.
    (6) The drive wheel tires may be inflated up to a gauge pressure of 
45 psi (310 kPa), or the manufacturer's recommended pressure if higher 
than 45 psi, in order to prevent tire damage. The drive wheel tire 
pressure shall be reported with the test results.
    (7) The driving distance, as measured by counting the number of 
dynamometer roll or shaft revolutions, shall be determined for the test.
    (8) Four-wheel drive vehicles will be tested in a two-wheel drive 
mode of operation. Full-time four-wheel drive vehicles will have one set 
of drive wheels temporarily disengaged by the vehicle manufacturer. 
Four-wheel drive vehicles which can be manually shifted to a two-wheel 
mode will be tested in the normal on-highway two-wheel drive mode of 
operation.
    (9) During dynamometer operation, a fixed speed cooling fan with a 
maximum discharge velocity of 15,000 cfm will be positioned so as to 
direct cooling air to the vehicle in an appropriate manner with the 
engine compartment cover open. In the case of vehicles with front engine 
compartments, the fan shall be positioned within 24 inches (61 
centimeters) of the vehicle. In the case of vehicles with rear engine 
compartments (or if special designs make the above impractical), the 
cooling fan(s) shall be placed in a position to provide sufficient air 
to maintain vehicle cooling. The Administrator may approve modified 
cooling configurations or additional cooling if necessary to 
satisfactorily perform the test. In approving requests for additional or 
modified cooling, the Administrator will consider such items as actual 
road cooling data and whether such additional cooling is needed to 
provide a representative test.
    (c) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to virtually 
eliminate water condensation in the system.
    (d) Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may be 
performed at test point, provided an emission sample is not taken, for 
the purpose of finding the appropriate throttle action to maintain the 
proper speed-time relationship, or to permit sampling system adjustment.
    (e) Perform the test bench sampling sequence outlined in 
Sec. 86.140-94 prior to or in conjunction with each series of exhaust 
emission measurements.
    (f) Test activities. (1) The US06 consists of a single test which is 
directly preceded by a vehicle preconditioning in accordance with 
Sec. 86.132-00. Following the vehicle preconditioning, the vehicle is 
idled for not less than one minute and not more than two minutes. The 
equivalent dynamometer mileage of the test is 8.0 miles (1.29 km).
    (2) The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (i) Immediately after completion of the preconditioning, idle the 
vehicle. The idle period is not to be less than one minute or not 
greater than two minutes.
    (ii) With the sample selector valves in the ``standby'' position, 
connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute exhaust and 
dilution air sample collection systems.
    (iii) Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps, the 
temperature recorder, the vehicle cooling fan, and the heated THC 
analysis recorder (diesel-cycle only). The heat exchanger of the 
constant volume sampler, if used, petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle THC 
analyzer continuous sample line should be preheated to their respective 
operating temperatures before the test begins.
    (iv) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set 
the gas flow measuring devices to zero.
    (A) For gaseous bag samples (except THC samples), the minimum flow 
rate is 0.17 cfm (0.08 liters/sec).
    (B) For THC samples, the minimum FID (or HFID in the case of diesel-
cycle vehicles) flow rate is 0.066 cfm (0.031 liters/sec).
    (C) CFV sample flow rate is fixed by the venturi design.
    (v) Attach the exhaust tube to the vehicle tailpipe(s).

[[Page 558]]

    (vi) Start the gas flow measuring device, position the sample 
selector valves to direct the sample flow into the exhaust sample bag, 
the dilution air sample bag, turn on the petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle 
THC analyzer system integrator, mark the recorder chart, and record both 
gas meter or flow measurement instrument readings, (if applicable).
    (vii) Place vehicle in gear after starting the gas flow measuring 
device, but prior to the first acceleration. Begin the first 
acceleration 5 seconds after starting the measuring device.
    (viii) Operate the vehicle according to the US06 driving schedule, 
as described in appendix I, paragraph (g), of this part. Manual 
transmission vehicles shall be shifted according to the manufacturer 
recommended shift schedule, subject to review and approval by the 
Administrator. For further guidance on transmissions see Sec. 86.128-00.
    (ix) Turn the engine off 2 seconds after the end of the last 
deceleration.
    (x) Five seconds after the engine stops running, simultaneously turn 
off gas flow measuring device No. 1 (and the petroleum-fueled diesel 
hydrocarbon integrator No. 1 and mark the petroleum-fueled diesel 
hydrocarbon recorder chart if applicable) and position the sample 
selector valves to the ``standby'' position. Record the measured roll or 
shaft revolutions and the No. 1 gas meter reading or flow measurement 
instrument.
    (xi) As soon as possible, transfer the exhaust and dilution air bag 
samples to the analytical system and process the samples according to 
Sec. 86.140-94 obtaining a stabilized reading of the bag exhaust sample 
on all analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection 
phase of the test.
    (xii) Immediately after the end of the sample period, turn off the 
cooling fan, close the engine compartment cover, disconnect the exhaust 
tube from the vehicle tailpipe(s), and drive the vehicle from 
dynamometer.
    (xiii) The CVS or CFV may be turned off, if desired.

Sec. 86.160-00  Exhaust emission test procedure for SC03 emissions.

    (a) Overview. The dynamometer operation consists of a single, 594 
second test on the SCO3 driving schedule, as described in appendix I, 
paragraph (h), of this part. The vehicle is preconditioned, in 
accordance with Sec. 86.132-00 of this subpart, to bring the vehicle to 
a warmed-up stabilized condition. This preconditioning is followed by a 
10 minute vehicle soak (engine off) that proceeds directly into the SC03 
driving schedule, during which continuous proportional samples of 
gaseous emissions are collected for analysis. The entire test, including 
the preconditioning driving, vehicle soak, and SC03 official test cycle, 
is either conducted in an environmental test facility or under test 
conditions that simulates testing in an environmental test cell (see 
Sec. 86.162-00 (a) for a discussion of simulation procedure approvals). 
The environmental test facility must be capable of providing the 
following nominal ambient test conditions of: 95  deg.F air temperature, 
100 grains of water/pound of dry air (approximately 40 percent relative 
humidity), a solar heat load intensity of 850 W/m<SUP>2</SUP>, and 
vehicle cooling air flow proportional to vehicle speed. Section 86.161-
00 discusses the minimum facility requirements and corresponding control 
tolerances for air conditioning ambient test conditions. The vehicle's 
air conditioner is operated or appropriately simulated for the duration 
of the test procedure (except for the vehicle 10 minute soak), including 
the preconditioning. For gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the 
composite samples collected in bags are analyzed for THC, CO, 
CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF>. For petroleum-fueled 
diesel-cycle vehicles, THC is sampled and analyzed continuously 
according to the provisions of Sec. 86.110. Parallel bag samples of 
dilution air are analyzed for THC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, 
and NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (b) Dynamometer activities. (1) All official air conditioning tests 
shall be run on a large single roll electric dynamometer or an 
equivalent dynamometer configuration that satisfies the requirements of 
Sec. 86.108-00.
    (2) Position (vehicle can be driven) the test vehicle on the 
dynamometer and restrain.

[[Page 559]]

    (3) Required SC03 schedule test dynamometer inertia weight class 
selections are determined by the test vehicles test weight basis and 
corresponding equivalent weight as listed in the tabular information of 
Sec. 86.129-00(a) and discussed in Sec. 86.129-00 (e) and (f).
    (4) Set the dynamometer test inertia weight and roadload horsepower 
requirements for the test vehicle (see Sec. 86.129-00 (e) and (f)). The 
dynamometer's horsepower adjustment settings shall be set such that the 
force imposed during dynamometer operation matches actual road load 
force at all speeds.
    (5) The vehicle speed as measured from the dynamometer rolls shall 
be used. A speed vs. time recording, as evidence of dynamometer test 
validity, shall be supplied at request of the Administrator.
    (6) The drive wheel tires may be inflated up to a gauge pressure of 
45 psi (310 kPa), or the manufacturer's recommended pressure if higher 
than 45 psi, in order to prevent tire damage. The drive wheel tire 
pressure shall be reported with the test results.
    (7) The driving distance, as measured by counting the number of 
dynamometer roll or shaft revolutions, shall be determined for the test.
    (8) Four-wheel drive vehicles will be tested in a two-wheel drive 
mode of operation. Full-time four-wheel drive vehicles will have one set 
of drive wheels temporarily disengaged by the vehicle manufacturer. 
Four-wheel drive vehicles which can be manually shifted to a two-wheel 
mode will be tested in the normal on-highway two-wheel drive mode of 
operation.
    (c) Vehicle and test activities for testing in a full environmental 
cell. The SFTP air conditioning test in an environmental test cell is 
composed of the following sequence of activities. Alternative procedures 
which appropriately simulate full environmental cell testing may be 
approved under the provisions of Secs. 86.162-00(a) and 86.163-00.
    (1) Drain and fill the vehicle's fuel tank to 40 percent capacity 
with test fuel. If a vehicle has gone through the drain and fuel 
sequence less than 72 hours previously and has remained under laboratory 
ambient temperature conditions, this drain and fill operation can be 
omitted (see Sec. 86.132-00(c)(2)(ii)).
    (2)(i) Position the variable speed cooling fan in front of the test 
vehicle with the vehicle's hood down. This air flow should provide 
representative cooling at the front of the test vehicle (air 
conditioning condenser and engine) during the SC03 driving schedule. See 
Sec. 86.161-00(e) for a discussion of cooling fan specifications.
    (ii) In the case of vehicles with rear engine compartments (or if 
this front location provides inadequate engine cooling), an additional 
cooling fan shall be placed in a position to provide sufficient air to 
maintain vehicle cooling. The fan capacity shall normally not exceed 
5300 cfm (2.50 m<SUP>3</SUP>/s). If, however, it can be demonstrated 
that during road operation the vehicle receives additional cooling, and 
that such additional cooling is needed to provide a representative test, 
the fan capacity may be increased or additional fans used if approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (3) Close all vehicle windows.
    (4) Connect the emission test sampling system to the vehicle's 
exhaust tail pipe(s).
    (5)(i) Set the environmental test cell ambient test conditions to 
the conditions defined in Sec. 86.161-00.
    (ii) Turn on the solar heating system.
    (iii) All vehicle test phases of preconditioning, soak, and the 
official SC03 test cycle are to be performed in this set of ambient test 
conditions.
    (6) Set the air conditioning system controls as follows:
    (i) A/C mode setting at Maximum.
    (ii) Airflow setting at Recirculate, if so equipped.
    (iii) Fan setting at Highest setting.
    (iv) A/C Temperature setting at full cool (for automatic systems set 
at 72  deg.F).
    (v) Air conditioning controls should be placed in the ``on'' 
position prior to vehicle starting so that the air conditioning system 
is active whenever the engine is running.
    (7) Start the vehicle (with air conditioning system on) and conduct 
a preconditioning cycle as discussed in Sec. 86.132-00(o)(1).
    (i) If engine stalling should occur during any air conditioning test 
cycle

[[Page 560]]

operation, follow the provisions of Sec. 86.136-90 (Engine starting and 
restarting).
    (ii) For manual transmission vehicles, the vehicle shall be shifted 
according the provisions of Sec. 86.128-00.
    (8) Following the preconditioning cycle, the test vehicle (and 
consequently the air conditioning system) and cooling fan(s) are turned 
off and the vehicle is allowed to soak in the ambient conditions of 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section for 10  1 minutes.
    (9) Start engine (with air conditioning system also running). 
Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place vehicle in gear.
    (10) Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial 
vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule.
    (11) Operate the vehicle according to the SC03 driving schedule, as 
described in appendix I, paragraph (h), of this part.
    (12) Turn the engine off 2 seconds after the end of the last 
deceleration.
    (d) Exhaust Emission Measurement Activities. The following 
activities are performed, when applicable, in order to meet the timing 
of the vehicle test and environmental facility activities.
    (1) Perform the test bench sampling calibration sequence outlined in 
Sec. 86.140-94 prior to or in conjunction with each series of exhaust 
emission measurements.
    (2) With the sample selector valves in the ``standby'' position, 
connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute exhaust and 
dilution air sample collection systems.
    (3) Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps, the 
temperature recorder, the vehicle cooling fan, and the heated THC 
analysis recorder (diesel-cycle only). The heat exchanger of the 
constant volume sampler, if used, petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle THC 
analyzer continuous sample line should be preheated to their respective 
operating temperatures before the test begins.
    (4) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set 
the gas flow measuring devices to zero.
    (i) For gaseous bag samples (except THC samples), the minimum flow 
rate is 0.17 cfm (0.08 liters/sec).
    (ii) For THC samples, the minimum FID (or HFID in the case of 
diesel-cycle vehicles) flow rate is 0.066 cfm (0.031 1/sec).
    (iii) CFV sample flow rate is fixed by the venturi design.
    (5) Attach the exhaust tube to the vehicle tailpipe(s).

THC analyzer system integrator, mark the recorder chart, and record both 
gas meter or flow measurement instrument readings, if applicable.
    (7) Start the engine (with air conditioning system also running). 
Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place vehicle in gear.
    (8) Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial 
vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule.
    (9) Operate the vehicle according to the SC03 driving schedule.
    (10) Turn the engine off 2 seconds after the end of the last 
deceleration.
    (11) Five seconds after the engine stops running, simultaneously 
turn off gas flow measuring device No. 1 (and the petroleum-fueled 
diesel hydrocarbon integrator No. 1 and mark the petroleum-fueled diesel 
hydrocarbon recorder chart if applicable) and position the sample 
selector valves to the ``standby'' position. Record the measured roll or 
shaft revolutions and the No. 1 gas meter reading or flow measurement 
instrument).
    (12) As soon as possible, transfer the exhaust and dilution air bag 
samples to the analytical system and process the samples according to 
Sec. 86.140 obtaining a stabilized reading of the bag exhaust sample on 
all analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection 
phase of the test.
    (13) Immediately after the end of the sample period, turn off the 
cooling fan, close the engine compartment cover, disconnect the exhaust 
tube from the vehicle tailpipe(s), and drive the vehicle from 
dynamometer.
    (14) The CVS or CFV may be turned off, if desired.
    (e) NO<INF>X</INF> humidity correction. Calculated NO<INF>X</INF>

Sec. 86.161-00   Air conditioning environmental test facility ambient requirements.

    The goal of an air conditioning test facility is to simulate the 
impact of an ambient heat load on the power requirements of the 
vehicle's air conditioning compressor while operating on a specific 
driving cycle. The environmental facility control elements that are 
discussed are ambient air temperature and humidity, minimum test cell 
size, solar heating, and vehicle frontal air flow.
    (a) Ambient air temperature. (1) Ambient air temperature is

<plus-minus> 5eg;F as an instantaneous measurement.
    (2) Air temperature is recorded continuously at a minimum of 30 
second intervals. Records of cell air temperatures and values of average 
test temperatures are maintained by the manufacturer for all 
certification related programs.
    (b) Ambient humidity. (1) Ambient humidity is controlled, within the 
test cell, during all phases of the air conditioning test sequence to an 
average of 100 <plus-minus> grains of water/pound of dry air.

radiant energy source that will satisfy the spectral distribution and 
uniformity definitions of this section.
    (3) Radiant energy specifications. (i) Simulated solar radiant 
energy intensity is determined as an average of the two points measured 
at:
    (A) Centerline of the test vehicle at the base of the windshield.

and van location defined as bottom of vertical window or where an 
optional window would be located).
    (ii) The radiant energy intensity set point is 850 <plus-minus>45 
watts/square meter.
    (iii) The definition of an acceptable spectral distribution is 
contained in the following table:

                 Definition of the Spectral Distribution

[[Page 562]]

time period; and every time major changes in the solar simulation 
hardware occur.
    (vi) The radiant energy intensity measurement instrument 
specifications (minimum) are:
    (A) Sensitivity of 9 microvolts per watt/square meter;
    (B) Response time of 1 second;
    (C) Linearity of <plus-minus>0.5 percent; and
    (D) Cosine of <plus-minus>1 percent from normalization 0-70 degree 
zenith angle.
    (e) Vehicle frontal air flow. The Administrator will approve frontal 
air flow based on ``blower in box'' technology as an acceptable 
simulation of environmental air flow cooling for the air conditioning 
compressor and engine, provided the following requirements are 
satisfied.
    (1) The minimum air flow nozzle discharge area must be equal or 
exceed the vehicle frontal inlet area. Optimum discharge area is 18 
square feet (4.25 x 4.25), however, other sizes can be used.
    (2) Air flow volumes must be proportional to vehicle speed. With the 
above optimum discharge size, the fan volume would vary from 0 cubic 
feet/minute (cfm) at 0 mph to approximately 95,000 cfm at 60 mph. If 
this fan is also the only source of cell air circulation or if fan 
operational mechanics make the 0 mph air flow requirement impractical, 
air flow of 2 mph or less will be allowed at 0 mph vehicle speed.
    (3) The fan air flow velocity vector perpendicular to the axial flow 
velocity vector shall be less than 10 percent of the mean velocity 
measured at fan speeds corresponding to vehicle speeds of 20 and 40 mph.

outlet at each point of a one foot grid over the entire discharge area.
    (ii) The uniformity of axial flow tolerance is 20 percent of the fan 
speeds corresponding to vehicle speeds of 20 and 40 mph.
    (5) The instrument used to verify the air velocity must have an 
accuracy of 2 percent of the measured air flow speed.
    (6) The fan discharge nozzle must be located 2 to 3 feet from the 
vehicle and 0 to 6 inches above the test cell floor during air 
conditioning testing. This applies to non-wind tunnel environmental test 
cells only.
    (7) The design specifications discussed in paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(e)(5) of this section must be verified by the manufacturer prior to 
conducting certification air conditioning tests.

Sec. 86.162-00  Approval of alternative air conditioning test simulations and descriptions of AC1 and AC2.

    The alternative air conditioning test procedures AC1 and AC2 are 
approved by the Administrator for all light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks only for the model years of 2000, 2001, and 2002. To obtain 
Administrator approval of other simulation test procedures a 
manufacturer must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section and meet the requirements of Sec. 86.163-00. Air conditioning 
tests AC1 and AC2 are simulations of the environmental test cell air 
conditioning test discussed in Sec. 86.160-00. AC1 simulates, in 
standard test cell ambient conditions and with the air conditioning off, 
the exhaust emission results of air conditioning operation in an 
environmental test cell by adding additional power requirements to 
roadload dynamometer requirements. AC2 simulates, in standard test cell 
ambient conditions and with the air conditioning controls in the heat 
position, the exhaust emission results of air conditioning operation in 
an environmental test cell by adding a heat load to the passenger 
compartment. The only differences between the test activities described 
in Sec. 86.160-00 and those for AC1 and AC2 occur as the result of how 
the effect of the environmental cell ambient test conditions, defined in 
Sec. 86.160-00(c)(5)(i), are simulated in a standard test cell nominal 
ambient conditions of 76  deg.F and 50 grains of water/pound of dry air. 
Paragraph (a) of this section discusses the procedure by which a 
manufacturer can obtain Administrator approval of other air conditioning 
test simulation procedures. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the 
AC1 test procedure and paragraph (c) of this section describes the AC2 
test procedure.

[[Page 563]]

    (a) Upon petition from a manufacturer or upon the Agency's own 
initiative, the Administrator will approve a simulation of the 
environmental cell for air conditioning test (SC03) described in 
Sec. 86.160-00 providing that the procedure can be run by the 
Administrator for SEA and in-use enforcement testing and providing that 
the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1)(2), and (3) of this section are 
satisfied.
    (1) In deciding whether approvals will be granted, the Administrator 
may consider data showing how well the simulation matches environmental 
cell test data for the range of vehicles to be covered by the simulation 
including items such as the tailpipe emissions, air conditioning 
compressor load, and fuel economy.
    (2) The Administrator has approved test procedures AC1 and AC2 for 
only the model years of 2000, 2001, and 2002.
    (3) Excluding the AC1 and AC2 procedures described in paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section for model years 2000, 2001, and 2002, for any 
simulation approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
manufacturer must agree to be subject to an ongoing yearly correlation 
spot check as described in Sec. 86.163-00.
    (4) Once a simulation is approved and used by a manufacturer for 
testing for a given vehicle, EPA agrees to use the simulation test 
procedure for all official testing conducted on that vehicle by the 
Agency for certification, SEA, and recall purposes, excluding spot check 
testing and vehicles which fail the spot check criteria as described in 
Sec. 86.163-00.
    (5) EPA will moniter the aggregate results of spot check testing and 
full environmental test cells. If EPA determines, based on such 
aggregate results, that any simulation (other than the AC1 and AC2 
procedures described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for the 
2000, 2001, and 2002 model years) is producing test results consistantly 
below those from a full environmental test cell, EPA may review its 
approval of the simulation.
    (b) AC1 test procedure. (1) Section 86.160-00(a) is applicable to 
the AC1 test procedure except for the discussion of the environmental 
test requirements. The AC1 test procedure simulates the effect of air 
conditioning operation in the environmental cell test conditions by 
adding the measured horsepower of the air conditioning system 
compressor, converted to an equivalent roadload component, to the normal 
dynamometer roadload horsepower.
    (2) Section 86.160-00(b) is applicable to the AC1 test procedure 
except that the dynamometer horsepower settings procedure of 
Sec. 86.160-00(b)(4) is expanded to include a horsepower increase 
adjustment.
    (i) The following describes one acceptable method of obtaining the 
required compressor horsepower and the corresponding roadload equivalent 
horsepower adjustment. Air compressor horsepower is measured during a 
SC03 air conditioning test cycle while operating in an environmental 
test cell as described in Sec. 86.160-00.
    (A) Install an air conditioning (A/C) compressor with a strain-
gauged input shaft that measures shaft torque in foot pounds. Other 
measurement techniques that produce data that can be shown will estimate 
A/C compressor horsepower are also acceptable.
    (B) Obtain the engine crankshaft to A/C compressor pulley diameter 
(D) ratio (ACPR) as:

ACPR=D(crankshaft pulley)/D(A/C pulley)

    (C) Record the following parameters, as a function of accumulated 
time (t), at least once per second from second 0 to second 600 while 
driving the SC03 cycle with the air conditioning system operating.
    (1) Engine revolutions/minute (ERPM<INF>t</INF>).
    (2) Compressor input torque in foot pounds (CT<INF>t</INF>).
    (D) For each second of data recorded from paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of 
this section, calculate compressor horsepower (CHP<INF>t</INF>) as:

CHP<INF>t</INF>=(CT<INF>t</INF>)(ERPM<INF>t</INF>)(ACPR)/5252

    (E) For each second of accumulated time and the data of paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) (B) and (D) of this section, determine a value of air 
conditioning compressor roadload force (ACRF<INF>t</INF>) that is 
equivalent to the air conditioning compressor force on the engine as:

ACRF<INF>t</INF>=(CHP<INF>t</INF>)(375)/V<INF>t</INF>.

where:


[[Page 564]]


V<INF>t</INF> equals vehicle SC03 cycle speed in miles per hour for each 
accumulated second of time, and 375 is a units constant to convert 
(ACRF<INF>t</INF>) to foot pounds of force.

    (F) Values of (ACRF<INF>t</INF>) at each second of time are added to 
the corresponding roadload dynamometer force requirements of 
Sec. 86.129-00(e) to obtain an approximation of the force generated by 
the vehicle engine during a SC03 test in an environmental test cell.
    (ii) The method by which the values of (ACRF<INF>t</INF>) additional 
dynamometer load is applied by the dynamometer to the vehicle tire 
surface will vary with dynamometer design and its force simulation 
capabilities. If the dynamometer has grade simulation capabilities, 
increasing load by simulating varying grades is one acceptable method of 
applying (ACRF<INF>t</INF>) values.
    (iii) For those calculated values of (ACRF<INF>t</INF>) which exceed 
the force capacity of the dynamometer being used for simulation test, 
replace the calculated values with the maximum road force capacity of 
the dynamometer. The Administrator would normally not expect 
(ACRF<INF>t</INF>) values to exceed dynamometer capability for time 
periods of more than a second.
    (iv) Values of (ACRF<INF>t</INF>) for application to AC1 testing 
should be an average of at least two runs unless the manufacturer can 
demonstrate to the Administrator that one run repeatability is 
acceptable.
    (v) Values of (ACRF<INF>t</INF>) for application to AC1 testing are 
to be obtained for each vehicle and engine family combination. If only 
one vehicle configuration is selected to represent an engine family, the 
selected configuration is the vehicle expected to produce the highest 
air conditioning load requirements. A manufacturer may petition the 
Administrator to reduce the number of (ACRF<INF>t</INF>) test vehicles 
for their product line, if they can show that the highest air 
conditioning loads are covered with a lesser number than one per family.
    (vi) Test results, calculations, and dynamometer setting values 
associated with making these roadload determinations are to be retained 
by the manufacturer as part of their certification records.
    (3) Perform the SC03 air conditioning test sequence as described in 
Sec. 86.160-00(c) with the following exceptions:
    (i) The variable speed cooling fan of Sec. 86.160-00(c)(2)(ii) is 
replaced with the fixed speed cooling fan requirements of Sec. 86.159-
00(b).
    (ii) The position of vehicle windows is optional.
    (iii) The nominal ambient air test conditions of Sec. 86.160-
00(b)(5)(i) (A) and (B) are replaced with 76  deg.F and 50 grains of 
water/pound of dry air and the solar heat load of Sec. 86.160-
00(b)(5)(i)(C) is omitted.
    (iv) The air conditioning system is not operated during the SC03 
test cycle. Operation of the air conditioning during preconditioning 
test cycles is optional.
    (4) Section 86.160-00(d) is applicable to the AC1 test procedure.
    (5) NO<INF>X</INF> humidity correction. Calculated NO<INF>X</INF> 
exhaust emissions from air conditioning tests conducted in a standard 
test cell at a nominal 50 grains of water/pound of dry air are corrected 
for humidity to 75 grains of water/pound of dry air (see the 
relationship of Sec. 86.144-94(c)(7)(iv)(B)).
    (c) AC2 test procedure. (1) section 86.160-00(a) is applicable the 
AC2 test procedure except for the discussion of the environmental test 
requirements. The AC2 test procedure simulates the effect of air 
conditioning operation in the environmental cell test conditions by 
adding heat from the vehicle's heating system to the interior of the 
passenger compartment.
    (2) Section 86.160-00(b) is applicable to the AC2 test procedure.
    (3) Section 86.160-00(c) is applicable except for the following:
    (i) Section 86.160-00(c)(3) is applicable except the drivers side 
front window is left open and all the others are closed.
    (ii) The nominal ambient air test conditions of Sec. 86.160-
00(b)(5)(i) (A) and (B) are replaced with 76  deg.F and 50 grains of 
water/pound of dry air and the solar heat load of Sec. 86.160-
00(b)(5)(i)(C) is omitted.
    (iii) The control position instruction of Sec. 86.160-00(c)(6)(iv) 
is replaced with set the A/C temperature control to the highest warm 
position (maximum for automatic systems).

[[Page 565]]

    (4) Section 86.160-00(d) is applicable to the AC2 test procedure.
    (5) NO<INF>x</INF> humidity correction. Calculated NO<INF>X</INF> 
exhaust emissions from air conditioning tests conducted in a standard 
test cell at a nominal 50 grains of water/pound of dry air are corrected 
for humidity to 75 grains of water/pound of dry air (see the 
relationship of Sec. 86.144-94(c)(7)(iv)(B)).

Sec. 86.162-03  Approval of alternative air conditioning test simulations.

    (a) Upon petition from a manufacturer or upon the Agency's own 
initiative, the Administrator will approve a simulation of the 
environmental cell for air conditioning test (SC03) described in 
Sec. 86.160-00 providing that the procedure can be run by the 
Administrator for SEA and in-use enforcement testing and providing that 
the following criteria are met:
    (1) In deciding whether approvals will be granted, the Administrator 
will consider data showing how well the simulation matches environmental 
cell test data for the range of vehicles to be covered by the simulation 
including items such as the tailpipe emissions, air conditioning 
compressor load, and fuel economy.
    (2) For any simulation approved under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the manufacturer must agree to be subject to an ongoing yearly 
correlation spot check as described in Sec. 86.163-00.
    (3) Once a simulation is approved and used by a manufacturer for

procedure for all official testing conducted on that vehicle by the 
Agency for certification, SEA, and recall purposes, excluding spot check 
testing and vehicles which fail the spot check criteria as described in 
Sec. 86.163-00.
    (4) EPA will moniter the aggregate results of spot check testing and 
full environmental test cells. If EPA determines, based on such 
aggregate results, that any simulation is producing test results 
consistantly below those from a full environmental test cell, EPA may 
review its approval of the simulation.

<R05>
Sec. 86.163-00  Spot check correlation procedures for vehicles tested using a simulation of the environmental test cell for air conditioning emission testing.

    This section is applicable for vehicles which are tested using a 
simulation of the environmental test cell approved under the provisions 
of Sec. 86.162-00(a).
    (a) The Administrator may select up to five emission data vehicles 
(one emission data vehicle for small volume manufacturers), including 
vehicles submitted for running change approval, each model year for any 
manufacturer undergoing the spot checking procedures of this section.
    (b) Testing conducted under this section (including testing 
performed in an environmental test cell) will be considered as official 
data as described in Sec. 86.091-29 and used in determining compliance 
with the standards. Such testing must comply with all applicable 
emission standards of subpart A of this part. Retests for the purpose of 
emission compliance will be allowed using the procedures described in 
Sec. 86.091-29.
    (c) Spot check procedures. (1) Subject to the limitations of 
paragraphs (a) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the Administrator may 
require that one or more of the test vehicles which use a simulation 
rather than actual testing in an environmental test cell for air 
conditioning emission testing be submitted at a place the Administrator 
will designate for air conditioning emission testing in an environmental 
test cell as described in Sec. 86.160-00. The Administrator may order 
this testing to be conducted at a manufacturer facility. All 
manufacturers which use a simulation instead of environmental cell 
testing must have access to an environment test cell meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 86.161-00 to perform this testing.
    (2) An air conditioning emission test will be performed as described 
in Sec. 86.162-00 in a full environmental test cell.
    (i) The results of the original simulation test and the full 
environmental test cell required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are 
compared. In order to pass the spot check, the test results must pass 
both the following two criteria:

[[Page 566]]

    (A) The NO<INF>X</INF> emission results of the simulation test must 
be at least 85% of the NO<INF>X</INF> emission results of the 
environmental chamber test.
    (B) The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95% 
of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.
    (ii) If either of two criteria of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section were not met, a retest is allowed. The manufacturer may elect to 
conduct either a retest of the simulation procedure or the environmental 
chamber testing. In order to pass the spot check, the test results must 
pass both the following two criteria using the retest test result.
    (A) The NO<INF>X</INF> emission results of the simulation test must 
be at least 85% of the NO<INF>X</INF> emission results of the 
environmental chamber test.
    (B) The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95% 
of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.
    (iii) If either of the two criteria of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section were not met, a second retest is allowed. The procedure not 
selected for the first retest must be used for the second retest, 
yielding two test results for each procedure. In order to pass the spot 
check, the test results must pass both the following two criteria using 
the average test result for each procedure:
    (A) The NO<INF>X</INF> emission results of the simulation test must 
be at least 85% of the NO<INF>X</INF> emission results of the 
environmental chamber test.
    (B) The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95% 
of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.
    (iv) If the spot check criteria have not passed after any of the 
initial test, the first retest, or the second retest the spot check is 
considered failed.
    (d) Consequences of failing a spot check. (1) If the emission 
results of the testing using the environmental test chamber passes all 
the applicable standards, those test results may be used to obtain a 
certificate of conformity.
    (2) The Administrator will allow up to 60 days for the manufacturer 
to supply additional data addressing the correlation of the simulation 
with a full environmental test cell.
    (i) If that data prove to the satisfaction of the Administrator that 
the simulation produces results that correlate sufficiently with the 
environmental test chamber, the Administrator may allow the continued 
use of the simulation.
    (ii) Otherwise, the Administrator will determine that the simulation 
fails to meet adequate correlation levels with full environmental 
testing. As a consequence of this finding, all future air conditioning 
emission testing on the population of vehicles represented by the 
failing-spot-check test vehicle (which may include past model year 
configurations) will be conducted using an environment chamber or a 
different (or corrected) approved simulation procedure.
    (iii) For each vehicle that fails a spot check, the Administrator 
may select up to two additional vehicles to test for the spot check that 
do not count against the five vehicle limit of paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (e) EPA will monitor the aggregate results of spot check testing and 
full environmental test cells. If EPA determines, based on such 
aggregate results, that any simulation (other than the AC1 and AC2 
procedures described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for the 
2000, 2001, and 2002 model years) is producing test results consistently 
below those from a full environmental test cell, EPA may review its 
approval of the simulation.

    (B) Y<INF>WSFTP</INF>(NO<INF>X</INF>)=results of paragraph (c)(1)(i) 
of this section for NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (2) When the test vehicle is not equipped with air conditioning, the 
relationship of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is:

Sec. 86.213-94  Fuel specifications.

    Gasoline having the following specifications will be used by the 
Administrator. Gasoline having the specifications set forth in the table 
in this section, or substantially equivalent specifications approved by 
the Administrator, may be used by the manufacturer except that the 
octane specification does not apply. In lieu of using gasoline having 
these specifications, the manufacturer may, for certification testing, 
use gasoline having the specifications specified in Sec. 86.113-90 
provided the cold CO emissions are not decreased. Documentation showing 
that cold CO emissions are not decreased shall be maintained by the 
manufacturer and shall be made available to the Administrator upon 
request.

    (b) A dynamometer which meets the specifications of Sec. 86.208-
94(a) shall be adjusted to simulate the operation of a vehicle on the 
road at 20  deg.F (-7  deg.C).

[[Page 571]]

Such adjustment may be based on a determination of the road load force 
profile at 20  deg.F (-7  deg.C). Alternatively, the adjustment may be 
based on a 10 percent decrease in the target coastdown time that is used 
for FTP testing.


<R05>
Sec. 86.230-94  Test sequence: general requirements.

    (a) Sequence steps. Figure C94-1 shows the steps encountered as the 
test vehicle undergoes the procedures subsequently described, to 
determine conformity with the standards set forth.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.167

    (b) Driving schedule. The Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) 
test procedure (see Sec. 86.115 and appendix I to this part) is used for 
vehicle preconditioning and testing.
    (c) Ambient temperature level. (1) Ambient temperature levels 
encountered by the test vehicle shall average 20  deg.F<plus-minus>5 
deg.F (-7  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C) and shall not be less than 10 
deg.F (-14  deg.C) nor more than

[[Page 573]]

30  deg.F (-1  deg.C) during vehicle preconditioning, except for 
preconditioning performed in accordance with Sec. 86.232(a)(7), and 
during all emission testing.
    (2) The ambient temperature reported shall be a simple average of 
the test cell temperatures measured at constant intervals no more than 
one minute apart. Before the driving cycle may begin, the test cell 
temperature shall be 20  deg.F<plus-minus>3  deg.F (-7 
deg.C<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C) when measured in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section. The temperature may not exceed 25  deg.F (-4 
deg.C) or fall below 15  deg.F (-9  deg.C) for more than three 
consecutive minutes during the test.
    (d) Vehicle positioning. The vehicle shall be approximately level 
during all phases of the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel 
distribution.
    (e) Engine compartment cooling. (1) Fixed speed air cooling of the 
engine compartment with the compartment cover open shall be utilized 
during testing that is conducted by the Administrator and, optionally 
for certification testing, by the manufacturer. If a separate movable 
fan is used, it shall be squarely positioned within 12 inches (30.5 
centimeters) of the front of vehicles with front engine compartments. In 
the case of vehicles with rear engine compartments (or if special 
designs make the normal front engine positioning impractical), the 
cooling fan shall be placed in a position to provide sufficient air to 
maintain vehicle cooling. The fan capacity shall normally not exceed 
5,300 cfm (2.50 cubic meters per second). If, however, the manufacturer 
showed (as provided in Sec. 86.135-94(b)) that additional cooling is 
necessary, the fan capacity may be increased or additional fans used if 
approved in advance by the Administrator. The cooling air temperature 
shall be measured at the inlet to the fan.
    (2) In lieu of using a separate fan, an air handling system that is 
integral with the test cell may be used provided comparable air movement 
is obtained. The cooling air temperature shall be measured in the center 
of a vertical plane that is located approximately 2 feet in front of the 
vehicle.
    (3) The manufacturer may use, for certification testing, alternative 
engine compartment cooling fans or systems, including those which 
provide a variable air flow, if the manufacturer has determined that 
comparable results are obtained.
    (f) Heater and defroster usage. The heater and defroster may be used 
at any temperature and fan settings.

    The provisions of Sec. 86.131-90 apply to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 86.232-94  Vehicle preconditioning.

    (a) The vehicle shall be moved to the test area and the following 
operations performed:
    (1) The fuel tank(s) shall be filled to approximately the prescribed 
``tank fuel volume'' with the test fuel specified Sec. 86.213. If the 
existing fuel in the fuel tank(s) does not meet the specifications 
contained in Sec. 86.213, the existing fuel must be drained prior to the 
fuel fill. The test fuel shall be at a temperature less than or equal to 
60  deg.F. For the operations in this paragraph (a)(1), the evaporative 
emission control system shall neither be abnormally purged nor 
abnormally loaded.
    (2) For operation on a 48-inch (1.22 metre) diameter single roll 
dynamometer, the drive wheel tires shall be inflated to the pressure 
recommended by the tire manufacturer. For operation on a twin-roll 
dynamometer, the drive wheel tires may be inflated to a gauge pressure 
of 40 psi (276 kPa). The drive wheel tire pressures shall be reported 
with the test results.
    (3) The fuel in the vehicle shall be stabilized at 20 
F deg.<plus-minus>10  deg.F (-7  deg.C<plus-minus>5.6  deg.C) prior to 
the start of the driving cycle except when vehicle peconditioning is 
performed in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (4) The vehicle shall be placed, either by being driven or pushed, 
on a dynamometer and operated through one UDDS cycle.
    (5) For those unusual circumstances where additional preconditioning 
is desired by the manufacturer, such preconditioning may be allowed with 
the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (6) The Administrator may also choose to conduct additional 
preconditioning. The additional preconditioning shall consist of one or 
more

[[Page 574]]

driving cycles of the UDDS, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section.
    (7) The manufacturer may, for certification testing, precondition 
vehicles at temperatures above 20  deg.F (-7  deg.C) and with 
temperature tolerances greater than those specified in Sec. 86.230(a) if 
the manufacturer has determined that such preconditioning does not 
decrease CO emissions during the testing specified in Sec. 86.237.
    (b) Within five minutes of completion of preconditioning, the 
vehicle shall be shut off. During this five minute period, the vehicle 
shall not experience ambient temperatures less than 10  deg.F (-12 
deg.C) nor more than 30  deg.F (-1  deg.C).
    (c) One of the following two methods shall be utilized to stabilize 
the vehicle before the emissions test:
    (1) Storing at cold temperatures. The vehicle shall be stored for 
not less than 12 hours nor for more than 36 hours prior to the cold 
start exhaust test. The ambient temperature (dry bulb) during this 
period shall be maintained at an average temperature of 20 
deg.F<plus-minus>5  deg.F (-7  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C) during each 
hour of this period and shall not be less than 10  deg.F (-12  deg.C) 
nor more than 30  deg.F (-1  deg.C). The ambient temperature reported 
shall be a simple average of the test cell temperature measured at 
constant intervals no more than one minute apart. In addition, the 
temperature may not exceed 25  deg.F (-4  deg.C) or fall below 15  deg.F 
(-9  deg.C) for more than three consecutive minutes.
    (2) Force-cooling or warming. (i) The vehicle shall be stored for no 
more than 36 hours prior to cooling or warming for the cold start 
exhaust test. The vehicle shall not be stored at ambient temperatures 
which exceed 86  deg.F (30  deg.C) during this period.
    (ii) Vehicle cooling may be accomplished by either force-cooling or 
force-warming the vehicle to the test temperature. If cooling is 
augmented by fans, the fans shall be placed in a vertical position for 
maximum drive train and engine cooling, not primarily oil pan cooling. 
Fans shall not be placed under the vehicle.
    (iii) The ambient temperature need only be stringently controlled 
after the vehicle has been cooled to 20  deg.F<plus-minus>3  deg.F (-7 
deg.C<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C), as determined by a representative bulk oil 
temperature. A representative bulk oil temperature is the temperature of 
the oil measured near the middle of the oil, not at the surface or at 
the bottom of the oil pan. If two or more diverse locations in the oil 
are monitored, they must all meet the temperature requirements.
    (iv) The vehicle must be stored for at least one hour after it has 
been cooled to 20  deg.F<plus-minus>3  deg.F (-7  deg.C<plus-minus>1.7 
deg.C) prior to the cold start exhaust test. The ambient temperature 
(dry bulb) during this period shall average 20  deg.F<plus-minus>5 
deg.F (-7  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C) and shall not be less than 10 
deg.F (-12  deg.C) nor more than 30  deg.F (-1  deg.C). In addition, the 
temperature may not exceed 25  deg.F (-4  deg.C) or fall below 15  deg.F 
(-9  deg.C) for more than three consecutive minutes.
    (d) If the vehicle is stabilized at 20  deg.F (-7  deg.C) in a 
separate area and is moved through a warm area to the test cell, the 
vehicle must be restabilized in the test cell for at least six times the 
period the vehicle is exposed to warmer temperatures. The ambient 
temperature (dry bulb) during this period shall average 20 
deg.F<plus-minus>5  deg.F (-7  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C) and shall 
not be less than 10  deg.F (-12  deg.C) nor more than 30  deg.F (-1 
deg.C). In addition, the temperature may not exceed 25  deg.F (-4

Sec. 86.235-94  Dynamometer procedure.

    (a) Overview. The emission sampling is completed over two test 
sequences, a ``cold'' start test after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 
36-hour soak according to the provisions of Sec. 86.232 and a ``hot'' 
start test following the ``cold'' start test by 10 minutes. Engine 
startup, operation over the UDDS, and engine shut-down make a complete 
cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds 
of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. The exhaust 
emissions are diluted with ambient air and a continuously proportional 
sample is collected for analysis during each phase. The composite 
samples collected in bags are analyzed for hydrocarbons, carbon

[[Page 575]]

monoxide, carbon dioxide, and, optionally, other pollutants. A parallel 
sample of the dilution air is similarly analyzed for carbon monoxide 
and, optionally, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen.
    (b) As long as an emission sample is not taken, practice runs over 
the prescribed driving schedule may be performed at test point for the 
purpose of finding the minimum throttle action to maintain the proper 
speed-time relationship or to permit sampling system adjustment.
    (c) Humidity should be set low enough to prevent condensation on the 
dynamometer rolls.
    (d) The dynamometer shall be warmed as recommended by the 
dynamometer manufacturer and using procedures or control methods that 
assure stability of the residual frictional horsepower.
    (e) The time between dynamometer warming and the start of the 
emission test shall be no longer than 10 minutes if the dynamometer 
bearings are not independently heated. If the dynamometer bearings are 
independently heated, the emission test shall begin no longer than 20 
minutes after dynamometer warming.
    (f) If the dynamometer horsepower must be adjusted manually, it 
shall be set within one hour prior to the exhaust emission test phase. 
The test vehicle shall not be used to make the adjustment. Dynamometers 
using automatic control of preselectable power settings may be set 
anytime prior to the beginning of the emission test.
    (g) The driving distance, as measured by counting the number of 
dynamometer roll or shaft revolutions, shall be determined for the 
transient cold start, stabilized cold start, and transient hot start 
phases of the test.
    (h) Four-wheel drive vehicles will be tested in a two-wheel drive 
mode of operation. Full-time four-wheel drive vehicles will have one set 
of drive wheels temporarily disengaged by the vehicle manufacturer. 
Four-wheel drive vehicles which can be manually shifted to a two-wheel 
drive mode will be tested in the normal on-highway two-wheel drive mode 
of operation.

Sec. 86.237-94  Dynamometer test run, gaseous emissions.

    (a) The complete dynamometer test consists of a cold start drive of 
approximately 7.5 miles (12.1 kilometers) and a hot start drive of 
approximately 3.6 miles (5.8 kilometers).
    (b) If the preconditioned vehicle is not already on the dynamometer, 
it shall be pushed into position.
    (c) The vehicle is allowed to stand on the dynamometer during the 
ten minute time period between the cold and hot start test. The cold 
start test is divided into two periods. The first period, representing 
the cold start ``transient'' phase, terminates at the end of the 
deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 505 seconds of the driving 
schedule. The second period, representing the ``stabilized'' phase, 
consists of the remainder of the driving schedule, including engine 
shutdown. The hot start test is identical to the first part or transient 
phase of the cold start test. Therefore, the hot start test terminates 
after the first period (505 seconds) is run.
    (d) The provisions of Sec. 86.137(b) apply to this subpart.

Sec. 86.308-79  Gas specifications.

    (a) Analyzer gases. (1) Calibration gases for the CO and CO<INF>2</INF> 
analyzers shall have zero grade nitrogen as a diluent. Combined CO and 
CO<INF>2</INF> span gases are permitted. Zero grade nitrogen shall be 
the diluent for CO and CO<INF>2</INF> span gases.
    (2) Calibration or span gases for the hydrocarbon analyzer shall be 
propane with zero-grade nitrogen as a diluent when testing gasoline-
fueled engines. For Diesel engine tests the diluent shall be zero-grade 
air.
    (3) Calibration or span gases for the NO<INF>X</INF> analyzer shall 
be NO named as NO<INF>X</INF> with a maximum NO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration of 5 percent of the nominal value. Zero-grade nitrogen 
shall be the diluent.
    (4) Zero-grade gases for hydrocarbon analyzers shall be nitrogen 
when testing gasoline-fueled engines and air when testing Diesel 
engines.
    (5) Zero-grade gases for the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and 
oxides of nitrogen analyzers shall be either zero-grade air or zero-
grade nitrogen.
    (6) The allowable zero grade gas (air or nitrogen) impurity 
concentrations shall not exceed 2 ppmC hydrocarbon, 10 ppm carbon 
monoxide, 400 ppm carbon dioxide and 1 ppm nitric oxide.
    (7) ``Zero-grade air'' includes artificial ``air'' consisting of a 
blend of nitrogen and oxygen with oxygen concentrations between 18 and 
21 mole percent.
    (b) Calibration gas. Calibration gas values are to be derived from 
NBS ``Standard Reference Materials'' (SRM's) or other gas standards 
approved by the Administrator. The uncertainty of the assigned 
calibration gas values shall not exceed 2.0 percent of the assigned 
value. The uncertainty is defined as the sum of the precision errors (at 
the 90 percent confidence level) and the bias errors. Precision and bias 
errors apply to both the equipment and the derivation procedures.
    (c) Span gas. Span gas values are to be derived from NBS ``Standard 
Reference Materials'' (SRM's) or other gas standards approved by the 
Administrator. The uncertainty of the assigned calibration gas values 
shall not exceed 3.0 percent of the assigned value. The uncertainty is 
defined as the sum of the precision errors (at the 90 percent confidence 
level) and the bias errors. Precision and bias errors apply to both the 
equipment and the derivation procedures.
    (d) Hydrocarbon analyzer fuel--(1) The fuel shall contain 
40<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent hydrogen.

[[Page 579]]

The balance shall be helium. The mixture shall contain less than 2 ppmC 
hydrocarbon.
    (2) Alternate pure hydrogen fuel. Some HFID's are designed to 
operate on pure hydrogen. Generally the HFID fuel is incompatible with 
good relative hydrocarbon response.
    (i) For Diesel engines this fuel is not recommended. However, this 
fuel may be used if the engine manufacturer demonstrates, on each basic 
combustion system (i.e., 4 cycle DI, 2 cycle DI, 4 cycle pre-cup, etc.) 
that an HFID using this fuel produces comparable results to an HFID 
using 40% H<INF>2</INF>/60% He fuel. These data must be submitted to and 
approved by the Administrator prior to testing. Pure H<INF>2</INF> fuel, 
that may be allowed for testing, must contain at least 99.0 percent 
hydrogen and contain less than 2 ppmC hydrocarbon.
    (ii) For gasoline-fueled engines, pure hydrogen fuel for the HFID is 
not allowed.
    (e) Hydrocarbon analyzer burner air. The concentration of oxygen 
must be within 1 mole percent of the oxygen concentration of the burner 
air used in the latest oxygen interference check (%O<INF>2</INF> I). If 
the difference in oxygen concentration is greater than 1 mole percent, 
then the oxygen interference must be checked and the analyzer adjusted 
if necessary, to meet the %O<INF>2</INF> I requirements. The burner air 
must contain less than 2 ppmC hydrocarbon.
    (f) Oxygen interference check gases shall contain propane with 350 
ppmC<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>75 ppmC hydrocarbon. The concentration value

Sec. 86.309-79  Sampling and analytical system; schematic drawing.

    (a) Any variation from the specifications in this subpart including 
performance specifications and emission detection methods may be used 
only with prior approval by the Administrator.
    (b) Schematic drawing. (1) An example of a sampling and analytical 
system which may be used for testing under this subpart is shown in 
Figure D79-1. All components or parts of components that are wetted by 
the sample or corrosive calibration gases shall be either chemically 
cleaned stainless steel or inert material, e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene 
resin. The use of ``gauge savers'' or ``protectors'' with nonreactive 
diaphragms to reduce dead volumes is permitted. The specific detection 
methods to be used for each exhaust component can be found in 
Sec. 86.316 for CO. Sec. 86.317 for HC, and Sec. 86.318 for 
NO<INF>X</INF>. Additional components such as instruments, valves, 
solenoids, pumps, switches, etc. may be employed to provide additional 
information and coordinate the functions of the component systems.
    (2) The following requirements must be incorporated in each system 
used for testing under this subpart.
    (i) All analyzers must obtain the sample to be analyzed from the 
same sample line.
    (ii) The sample transport system from the engine exhaust pipe to the 
HC analyzer and the NO<INF>X</INF> analyzer must be heated as is 
indicated in Figure D79-1.
    (iii) Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide measurements must be made 
on a dry basis. Specific requirements for the means of drying the sample 
can be found in Sec. 86.309 (b)(5) and Sec. 86.311(e).
    (iv) All NDIR analyzers must have a pressure gauge immediately 
downstream of the analyzer. The gauge tap must be within 2 inches of the 
analyzer exit port. Gauge specifications can be found in 
Sec. 86.309(b)(3).

[[Page 580]]

    (v) All bypass and analyzer flows exiting the analysis system must 
be measured. Capillary flows such as in HFID and CL analyzers are 
excluded. For each ND IR analyzer with a flow meter located upstream of 
the analyzer, an upstream pressure gauge must be used. The gauge tap 
must be within 2 inches of the analyzer entrance port.
    (vi) Calibration or span gases for the NO<INF>X</INF> measurement 
system must pass through the NO<INF>2</INF> to NO converter.
    (vii) The temperature of the NO<INF>2</INF> to NO converter must be 
displayed continuously.

    (ii) F2--Fine particulate filter.
    (iii) F3--Fine heated particulate filter.
    (iv) F4--Coarse heated particulate filter.
    (2) Flowmeters. (i) Flowmeters FL 1 and FL 2 indicate sample flow 
rates through the CO and CO<INF>2</INF> analyzers.
    (ii) Flowmeters FL 3, FL 4, FL 5, and FL 6 indicate bypass flow 
rates.
    (3) Gauges. Downstream gauges are required for any system used for 
testing under this subpart. Upstream gauges may be required under this 
subpart per Sec. 86.309(b)(2)(v).
    (i) Upstream gauges G1 and G2 measure the input to the CO and 
CO<INF>2</INF> analyzers.
    (ii) Downstream gauges G3 and G4 measure the exit pressure of the CO 
and CO<INF>2</INF> analyzers. If the normal operating range of the 
downstream gauges is less than 3 inches of water, then the downstream 
gauges must be capable of reading both pressure and vacuum.
    (4) Pressure gauges. (i) P1--bypass pressure.
    (ii) P2, P3, P4 and P5--sample or span pressure at inlet to flow 
control valves.
    (5) Water traps. Water traps WT1, and WT2 to remove water from the 
sample. A water trap performing the function of WT1 and meeting the 
specifications in Sec. 86.311(e) is required for any system used for 
testing under this subpart. Chemical dryers are not an acceptable method 
of removing the water. Water removal by condensation is acceptable. 
Means other than condensation may be used only with prior approval from 
the Administrator.
    (6) Regulators. (i) R1, R3, R4, and R6--linepressure regulators to 
control span pressure at inlet to flow control valves.

    (3) The sample line outside wall temperature must be maintained at 
the temperature specified in this paragraph. An exception is made for 
the first 4 feet of sample line from the exhaust duct. The upper 
temperature tolerance for this 4 foot section is waived and only the 
minimum temperature specification applies.
    (b) Sample probe. (1) The sample probe shall be a straight, closed 
end, stainless steel, multi-hole probe. The Inside Diameter (I.D.) shall 
not be greater than the I.D. of the sample line (=.010 in.). The wall 
thickness of the probe shall not be greater than .040 inch. The fitting 
that attaches the probe to the exhaust pipe shall be as small as 
practical in order to minimize heat loss from the probe.
    (2) There shall be a minimum of three holes in the probe. The 
spacing of the radial planes for each hole in the probe must be such 
that they cover approximately equal cross-sectional areas of the exhaust 
duct. The angular spacing of the holes must be approximately equal. The

Sec. 86.311-79  Miscellaneous equipment; specifications.

    (a) Chart recorders. (1) The minimum chart speed allowed is 3 inches 
per minute for gasoline-fueled engines and 0.5 inches per minute for 
Diesel engines.
    (2) When testing gasoline-fueled engines all chart recorders 
(analyzers, torque, rpm, etc.) shall be provided with Automatic markers 
which indicate one second intervals. Preprinted chart paper (one second 
intervals) may be used in lieu of the automatic markers provided the 
correct chart speed is used.
    (b) Accuracy of temperature measurements. (1) The following 
temperature measurements shall be accurate to within 1.2  deg.C:
    (i) Temperature measurements used in calculating the engine intake 
humidity:
    (ii) The temperature of the fuel in volume measuring flow rate 
devices;
    (iii) The temperature of the sample within the water trap(s).
    (2) All other temperature measurements shall be accurate within 2.5 
deg.C.
    (c) Intake air humidity and temperature measurements. (1) Humidity 
conditioned air supply. Air that has had its absolute humidity altered 
is considered humidity-conditioned air. For this type of intake air 
supply, the humidity measurements must be made within the intake air 
supply system, and after the humidity conditioning has taken place.
    (2) Nonconditioned air supply. Humidity measurements in non-
conditioned intake air supply systems must be made in the intake air 
stream entering the supply system. Alternatively, the humidity 
measurements can be measured within the intake air supply stream.
    (3) Engine intake air temperature measurement must be made within 48 
inches of the engine. The measurement location must be made either in 
the supply system or in the air stream entering the supply system.
    (d) Sample component surface temperature. For each component (pump, 
sample line section, filters, etc.) in the heated portion of the 
sampling system that has a separate source of power or heating element, 
use engineering judgment to locate the coolest portion of that component 
and monitor the temperature at that location. If several components are 
within an oven, then only the surface temperature of the component with 
the largest thermal mass and the oven temperature need be measured.
    (e) If water is removed by condensation, the sample gas temperature 
or sample dew point must be monitored either within the water trap or 
downstream. It may not exceed 7  deg.C (45  deg.F).

<R05>
Sec. 86.312-79  Dynamometer and engine equipment specifications.

    (a) Dynamometer. (1) The dynamometer test stand and other 
instruments for measurement of power output shall be accurate to within 
2 percent of point at all power settings above 10 percent of full-scale. 
Below 10 percent of full-scale the accuracy shall be within 5 percent of 
point. The dynamometer must be capable of performing the test cycle 
described in Sec. 86,335 or Sec. 86.336. Dynamometers used for testing 
gasoline-fueled engines must have sufficient motoring capability to meet 
the test requirements. A 60-tooth wheel in combination with a frequency 
counter shall be considered an absolute standard for engine speed.

[[Page 585]]

    (2) Dynamometer calibration weights. A minimum of 6 calibration 
weights for each range used are required. The weights must be equally 
spaced and traceable to within 0.5 percent of NBS weights. Laboratories 
located in foreign countries may certify calibration weights to local 
government bureau standards.
    (b) Engine cooling. Means of engine cooling which will maintain the 
engine operating temperatures (e.g., intake air, oil, water, etc.) at 
approximately the same temperature as specified by the manufacturer 
shall be used. Auxiliary fan(s) may be used to maintain engine cooling 
during operation on the dynamometer.
    (c) Exhaust system. (1) When testing gasoline-fueled engines:
    (i) A chassis-type exhaust system including muffler(s) shall be 
used. The exhaust system must have a single tail pipe. For engines 
designed for a dual exhaust system, a standard or specially fabricated 
``Y'' pipe may be used. The ``Y'' pipe may be located upstream of a 
single muffler or downstream of a single muffler or downstream of dual 
mufflers. The potential increase in backpressure due to the use of a 
single tail pipe instead of dual pipes may be compensated for by using 
larger than standard exhaust system components downstream of the ``Y'' 
pipe. For systems with the ``Y'' pipe upstream of the muffler, the 
backpressure at the exhaust manifold exit with the single exhaust system 
must be comparable to the standard dual exhaust system under the test 
conditions specified in Sec. 86.335.
    (ii) For all catalyst systems the distance from the exhaust manifold 
flange(s) to the catalyst shall be the same as in the vehicle 
configuration unless the manufacturer provides temperature data showing 
equivalent performance at another location.
    (iii) For catalyst systems, the probe shall be located in the single 
exhaust pipe and from 2 to 10 feet downstream of the catalyst(s) and at 
least 2 feet downstream of the ``Y'' intersection of any ``Y'' pipe (if 
used).
    (iv) For noncatalyst systems, the probe shall be located in the 
single exhaust pipe downstream of the muffler(s) and from 3 to 20 feet 
downstream from the exhaust manifold flange or turbocharger exit flange. 
The probe shall also be at least 2 feet downstream of the ``Y'' 
intersection of any ``Y'' pipe (if used).
    (v) For all exhaust systems, the probe shall be located at least 24 
inches from the end of the tail pipe. Additional exhaust pipe may be 
added to the tail pipe to meet the specification.
    (2) When testing Diesel engines, a noninsulated exhaust system 
extending 15<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 feet from the exhaust manifold, or 
the crossover junction in the case of Vee engines, shall be used. The 
exhaust back pressure must be within 0.2 inch Hg. of the upper limit at 
maximum rated horsepower, as established by the engine manufacturer in 
his sales and service literature for vehicle application. A conventional 
automotive muffler of a size and type commonly used with the engine 
being tested shall be employed in the exhaust system during smoke 
emission testing. The terminal 2 feet of the exhaust pipe shall be a 
circular cross section and be free of elbows and bends. The end of the 
pipe shall be cut off squarely. The terminal 2 feet of the exhaust pipe 
shall have a nominal inside diameter in accordance with the engine being 
tested, as specified below:

Administrator must be advised of the method used prior to testing.

[[Page 586]]

    (b) Corrections to the measured air mass-flow-rate shall be made 
when an engine system incorporates devices that add or subtract air mass 
(air injection, bleed air, etc.). The method used to determine the air 
mass from these devices shall be approved by the Administrator.
    (c) An engine air inlet system presenting an air inlet restriction 
within 1 inch of water of the upper limit for the engine operating 
condition which results in maximum air flow, as established by the

Sec. 86.314-79  Fuel flow measurement specifications.

    (a) The fuel flow rate measurement instrument must have a minimum 
accuracy of <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent of full-scale flow rate for 
each measurement range used. An exception for Diesel engines is allowed 
at the idle and 2-percent power points. For these modes, the minimum 
accuracy is <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent of full-scale flow rate for

fuel consumed must not be greater than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent of 
the measuring weight. An exception for Diesel engines is allowed at the 
idle and 2-percent power points. For these modes the error in the actual 
weight of the fuel consumed must not be greater than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent of the measuring weight.
    (3) If the mass of fuel consumed is measured electronically (load 
cell, load beam, etc.), the error in the actual weight of fuel consumed 
must not be greater than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent of the full-
scale value of the electronic device.
    (4) If the mass of fuel consumed is measured by volume flow and 
density, the error in the actual volume consumed must not be greater 
than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent of the full-scale value of the 
volume measuring device.
    (b) For the devices that have varying mass scales (electronic 
weight, volume, density, etc.), measurements may not be used for 
calculations if the measurement is less than 20 percent of full scale.
    (c) Option. Complete flow-rate measurement systems may be used below 
20 percent of full-scale measurement as long as the combination of mass 
and time measurements indicate a flow rate that has an error of less 
than 5 percent of the absolute flow rate.


<R05>

    (a) Analyzer response time. The analyzer must respond to an 
instantaneous step change at the entrance to the analyzer with a 
response equal to 95 percent of that step change in 6.0 seconds or less 
on all ranges used. The step change shall be at least 60 percent of 
full-scale chart deflection. For NO<INF>X</INF> analyzers using a water

<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent of full-scale concentration for each 
range used above 155 ppm (or ppm C), or <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent 
for each range used below 155 ppm (or ppm C). The precision is defined 
as 2.5 times the standard deviation(s) of 10 repetitive responses to a 
given calibration or span gas.
    (c) Noise. The analyzer peak-to-peak response to zero and 
calibration or span gases over any 10-second period shall not exceed 2 
percent of full/scale chart deflection on all ranges used.
    (d) Zero drift. The analyzer zero-response drift during a 1-hour 
period shall be less than 2 percent of full-scale chart deflection on 
the lowest range used. The zero-response is defined as the mean response 
including noise to a zero-gas during a 30-second time interval.
    (e) Span drift. The analyzer span drift during a 1-hour period shall 
be less

[[Page 587]]

than 2 percent of full-scale chart deflection on the lowest range used.

as a means of improving oxygen interference (%O<INF>2</INF> I). However, 
this procedure may be used if the engine manufacturer demonstrates on 
each basic combustion system (i.e., 4 cycle DI, 2 cycle DI, 4 cycle 
precup, etc.) that an HFID using this procedure produces comparable 
results to an HFID not using this procedure. These data must be 
submitted to the Administrator for his approval prior to testing.

    (1) Calibrate the NO<INF>X</INF> analyzer on the lowest range that 
will be used for testing.
    (2) Introduce a mixture of CO<INF>2</INF> calibration gas and 
NO<INF>X</INF> calibration gas to the CL analyzer. Dynamic blending may 
be used to provide this mixture. Dynamic blending may be accomplished by 
analyzing the CO<INF>2</INF> in the mixture. The change in the CO<INF>2</INF> 
value due to blending may then be used to determine the true 
concentration of the NO<INF>X</INF> in the mixture. The CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration of the mixture shall be approximately equal to the highest 
concentration experienced during testing. Record the response.
    (3) Recheck the calibration. If it has changed more than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent of full scale, recalibrate and repeat the 
quench check.
    (4) Prior to testing, the difference between the calculated 
NO<INF>X</INF> response and the response of NO<INF>X</INF> in the 
presence of CO<INF>2</INF> (step 2) must not be greater than 3.0 percent 
of full-scale. The calculated NO<INF>X</INF> response is based on the 
calibration performed in step (1).

Sec. 86.328-79  Leak checks.

    (a) Vacuum side leak check. (1) Any location within the analysis 
system where a vacuum leak could affect the test results must be 
checked.
    (2) The maximum allowable leakage rate on the vacuum side is 0.5 
percent of the in-use flow rate for the portion of the system being 
checked. the analyzer flows and bypass flows may be used to estimate the 
in-use flow rates.
    (3) The sample probe and the connection between the sample probe and 
valve V2 (Figure D79-1) may be excluded from the leak check.
    (b) Pressure side leak check. (1) The maximum allowable leakage rate 
on the pressure side in 5 percent of the in-use flow rate.
    (2) Option: If the flow rate for each flow meter is equal to or 
greater than the flow rate recorded in Sec. 86.329(b)(1)(ii), then a 
pressure side leak check is not required.


<R05>
Sec. 86.329-79  System response time; check procedure.

    (a) Check the system response time by the following procedure:
    (1) Stabilize the operating temperature of the sample line, sample 
pump, and heated filters.
    (2) Introduce an HC span gas into the sampling system at the sample 
probe or valve V2 at atmospheric pressure. Simultaneously, start the 
time measurement.
    (3) When the HC instrument response is 95 percent of the span gas 
concentration used, stop the time measurement.
    (4) If the elapsed time is more than 20.0 seconds, make necessary 
adjustments.
    (5) Repeat with the CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF> 
instruments and span gases.
    (b) Option. If the following parameters are determined, the initial 
system response time may be generally applied to future checks.
    (1) Analyzer and bypass flow rates. (i) Determine by experimentation 
the minimum analyzer and bypass flow rates individually and in 
combination that will produce a response time as close as possible to 
20.0 seconds per paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) Record the highest minimum flow rate for each flow meter as 
determined in step (i).

[[Page 590]]

    (2) Capillary flow analyzers. This procedure is applicable only to 
analyzers that have sample capillaries such as the HFID and CL 
analyzers. It is also assumed that the system has sample/span valves 
that perform the function of valves V9 and V13 in Figure D79-1.
    (i) Operate the analyzer(s) at the in-use capillary pressure.
    (ii) Adjust the bypass flow rate to the flow rate recorded in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) Measure and record the response time from the sample/span 
valve(s) per paragraph (a) of this section.
    (iv) The response time (step (iii)) can be determined by switching 
from the ``sample'' position to the ``span'' position of the sample/span 
valve and observing the analyzer response on a chart recorder. Normally, 
the ``sample'' position would select a ``room air'' sample and the 
``span'' position would select a span gas.
    (v) Adjust the bypass flow rate to the normal in-use value.
    (vi) Measure and record the response time from the sample/span 
valve(s) per paragraph (a) of this section.
    (vii) Determine the slowest response time (step (iii) or step (iv)) 
and add 2 seconds to it.


<R05>
Sec. 86.330-79  NDIR analyzer calibration.

    (a) Detector optimization. If necessary, follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for initial start-up and basic operating adjustments.
    (b) Calibration curve. Develop a calibration curve for each range 
used as follows:
    (1) Zero the analyzer.
    (2) Span the analyzer to give a response of approximately 90 percent 
of full-scale chart deflection.
    (3) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 
percent of full scale, repeat steps (1) and (2).
    (4) Record the response of calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of full-scale 
concentration.
    (5) Generate a calibration curve. The calibration curve shall be of 
fourth order or less, have five or fewer coefficients, and be of the 
form of equation (1) or (2). Include zero as a data point. Compensation 
for known impurities in the zero gas can be made to the zero-data point. 
The calibration curve must fit the data points within 2 percent of point 
or 1 percent of full scale, whichever is less.

where:

y = concentration
x = chart deflection

    (6) Option. A new calibration curve need not be generated if: (i) A 
calibration curve conforming to step (5) exists; (ii) The responses 
generated in step (4) are within 1 percent of full scale or 2 percent of 
point, whichever is less, of the responses predicted by the calibration 
curve for the gases used in step (4).
    (7) If multiple range analyzers are used, only the lowest range must 
meet the curve fit requirements below 15 percent of full scale.
    (c) If any range is within 2 percent of being linear a linear 
calibration may be used. To determine if this criterion is met:
    (1) Perform a linear least-square regression on the data generated. 
Use an equation of the form y = mx, where x is the actual chart 
deflection and y is the concentration.
    (2) Use the equation z = y/m to find the linear chart deflection (z) 
for each calibration gas concentration (y).
    (3) Determine the linearity (%L ) for each calibration gas by:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.080
    

[[Page 591]]


    (4) The linearity criterion is met if the %L is less than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent for each data point generated. For each 
emission test, a calibration curve of the form Y = mx is to be used. The 
slope (m) is defined for each range by the spanning process.

Sec. 86.331-79  Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.

    The following steps are followed in sequence to calibrate the 
hydrocarbon analyzer. It is suggested, but not required, that efforts be 
made to minimize relative response variations.
    (a) If necessary, follow manufacturer's instructions for instrument 
start-up and basic operating adjustments.
    (b) Set the oven temperature 5  deg.C hotter than the required 
sample-line temperature. Allow at least one-half hour after the oven has 
reached temperature for the system to equilibrate.
    (c) Initial fuel flow adjustment. With the fuel and air-flow rates 
set at the manufacturer's recommendations, introduce a 350 
ppmC<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>75 ppmC span gas to the detector. Determine the 
response at a given fuel flow from the difference between the span-gas 
response and the zero-gas response. Incrementally adjust the fuel flow 
above and below the manufacturer's specification. Record the span and 
zero response at these fuel flows. A plot of the difference between the 
span and zero response versus fuel flow will be similar to the one shown 
in Fig. D79-3.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.170


Adjust the fuel-flow rate to the rich side of the curve, as shown. This 
is initial flow-rate setting and may not be the final optimized flow 
rate.
    (d) Oxygen interference optimization. Choose a range where the 
oxygen interference check gases (see Sec. 86.308) will fall in the upper 
50 percent. Conduct this test with the oven temperature set as required. 
Oxygen interference check gas specifications are found in Sec. 86.308.
    (1) Zero the analyzer.
    (2) Span the analyzer with the zero-percent oxygen blend for 
gasoline-fueled engines. Diesel engine instruments shall be spanned with 
the 21-percent oxygen blend.
    (3) Recheck zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 percent 
of full scale repeat paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (4) Introduce the 5 percent and 10 percent oxygen interference check 
gases.
    (5) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent of full scale, repeat the test.
    (6) Calculate the percent of oxygen interference (%O<INF>2</INF>I) 
for each mixture in step (4).

[[Page 592]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.081

A = hydrocarbon concentration (ppmC) of the span gas used in step (2).
B = hydrocarbon concentration (ppmC) of the oxygen interference check 
gases used in step (4).

    (7) The percent of oxygen interference (%O<INF>2</INF>I) must be 
less than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.0 percent for all required oxygen 
interference check gases prior to testing.
    (8) If the oxygen interference is greater than the specifications, 
incrementally adjust the air flow above and below the manufacturer's 
specifications, repeating paragraphs (d) (1) through (7) of this section 
for each flow.
    (9) If the oxygen interference is greater than the specification 
after adjusting the air flow, vary the fuel flow and thereafter the 
sample flow, repeating paragraphs (d) (1) through (7) of this section 
for each new setting.
    (10) If the oxygen interference is still greater than the 
specifications, repair or replace the analyzer, FID fuel, or burner air 
prior to testing. Repeat this section with the repaired or replaced 
equipment or gases.
    (e) Linearity check. For each range used, check linearity as 
follows:
    (1) With the fuel flow, air flow and sample flow adjust to meet the 
oxygen interference specification, zero the analyzer.
    (2) Span the analyzer using a calibration gas that will provide a 
response of approximately 90 percent of full-scale concentration.
    (3) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 
percent of full scale, repeat steps (1) and (2).
    (4) Record the response of calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 percent of full-scale concentration. It 
is permitted to use additional concentrations.
    (5) Perform a linear least square regression on the data generated. 
Use an equation of the form y = mx, where x is the actual chart 
deflection and y is the concentration.
    (6) Use the equation z = y/m to find the linear chart deflection (z) 
for each calibration gas concentration (y).
    (7) Determine the linearity (%L) for each calibration gas by:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.082
    
    (8) The linearity criterion is met if the %L is less than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent for each data point generated. Below 40 
ppmC the linearity criterion may be expanded to <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4 
percent. For each emission test, a calibration curve of the form y = mx 
is to be used. The slope (m) is defined for each range by the spanning 
process.
    (9) If the %L for any point exceeds the specifications in step (8), 
the air, fuel, and sample-flow rates may be varied within the boundaries 
of the oxygen interference specifications.
    (10) If the %L for any data point still exceeds the specifications, 
repair or replace the analyzer, FID fuel, burner air, or calibration 
bottles prior to testing. Repeat the procedures of this section with the 
repaired or replaced equipment or gases.
    (f) Optimized flow rates. The fuel-flow rate, air-flow rate and 
sample-flow rate

[[Page 593]]

are defined as ``optimized'' at this point.

Sec. 86.332-79  Oxides of nitrogen analyzer calibration.

    (a) At least monthly during testing, perform a converter efficiency 
check as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Perform a monthly 
linearity check as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Converter-efficiency check. The apparatus described and 
illustrated in Figure D79-4 is to be used to determine the conversion 
efficiency of devices that convert NO<INF>2</INF> to NO. The following 
procedure is to be used in determining the values to be used in the 
equation below:
    (1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup 
and operation.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer.
    (3) Connect the outlet of the NO<INF>X</INF> generator (see Figure 
D79-4) to the sample inlet of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer which has 
been set to the most common operating range.
    (4) Introduce into the NO<INF>X</INF> generator-analyzer system a 
span gas with a NO concentration equal to approximately 80 percent of 
the most common operating range.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.171


[[Page 594]]


    (5) With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO Mode, record the 
concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.
    (6) Turn on the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O<INF>2</INF> (or air) 
supply and adjust the O<INF>2</INF> (or air) flow rate so that the NO 
indicated by the analyzer is about 10 percent less than indicated in 
step (5). Record the concentration of NO in this NO+O<INF>2</INF> 
mixture.
    (7) Switch the NO<INF>X</INF> generator to the generation mode and 
adjust the generation rate so that the NO measured on the analyzer is 20 
percent of that measured in step (5). There must be at least 10 percent 
unreacted NO at this point. Record the concentration of residual NO.
    (8) Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
mode and measure total NO<INF>X</INF>. Record this value.
    (9) Switch off the NO<INF>X</INF> generation, but maintain gas flow 
through the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the 
total NO<INF>X</INF> in the NO+O<INF>2</INF> mixture. Record this value.
    (10) Turn off the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O<INF>2</INF> (or air) 
supply. The analyzer will now indicate the total NO<INF>X</INF> in the 
original NO in N<INF>2</INF> mixture. This value should be no more than 
5 percent above the value indicated in step (4).
    (11) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<INF>X</INF> converter by 
substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:

Percent Efficiency=[1+(a-b)/(c-d)] x 100
where:
a=concentration obtained in step (8).
b=concentration obtained in step (9).
c=concentration obtained in step (6).
d=concentration obtained in step (7).


The efficiency of the converter shall be greater than 90 percent. 
Adjustment of the converter temperature may be necessary to maximize the 
efficiency. If the converter does not meet the conversion-efficiency 
specifications, repair or replace the unit prior to testing. Repeat the 
procedures of this section with the repaired or new converter.
    (c) Linearity check. For each range used, check linearity as 
follows:
    (1) With the operating parameters adjusted to meet the converter 
efficiency check and the quench checks, zero the analyzer.
    (2) Span the analyzer using a calibration gas that will give a 
response of approximately 90 percent of full-scale concentration.
    (3) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 
percent of full scale, repeat steps (1) and (2).
    (4) Record the response of calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations of 30, 60 and 90 percent of full-scale concentration. It 
is permitted to use additional concentrations.
    (5) Perform a linear least-square regression on the data generated. 
Use an equation of the form y=mx where x is the actual chart deflection 
and y is the concentration.
    (6) Use the equation z=y/m to find the linear chart deflection (z) 
for each calibration gas concentration (y).
    (7) Determine the linearity (%L) for each calibration gas by:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.083
    
    (8) The linearity criterion is met if the %L is less than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent of each data point generated. For each 
emission test, a calibration curve of the form y=mx is to be used. The 
slope (m) is defined for each range by the spanning process.
    (9) If the %L exceeds <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent for any data 
point generated, repair or replace the analyzer or calibration bottles 
prior to testing. Repeat the procedures of this section with the 
repaired or replaced equipment or gases.
    (10) Perform a converter-efficiency check (see paragraph (b) of this 
section).
    (11) The operating parameters are defined as ``optimized'' at this 
point.

    (b) Check the dynamometer torque measurement for each range used by 
the following:
    (1) Warm up the dynamometer following the equipment manufacturer's 
specifications.
    (2) Determine the dynamometer calibration moment arm. Equipment

Sec. 86.334-79  Test procedure overview.

    (a) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating 
conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases 
generated during engine operation are sampled for specific component 
analysis through the analytical train. The test is applicable to engines 
equipped with catalytic or direct-flame afterburners, induction system 
modifications, or other systems, or to uncontrolled engines.
    (b) The tests are designed to determine the brake-specific emissions 
of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. The gasoline-
fueled engine test consists of 1 warm-up cycle and 1 hot cycle. The 
Diesel engine test consists of 3 idle modes and 5 power modes at each of 
2 speeds which span the typical operating range of Diesel engines. These 
procedures require the determination of the concentration of each 
pollutant, the fuel flow and the power output during each mode. The 
measured values are weighted and used to calculate the grams of each 
pollutant emitted per brake-horsepower hour.
    (c)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions or is operated 
for service accumulation on an engine dynamometer, the complete engine 
shall be tested, with all emission control devices installed and 
functioning.
    (2) Evaporative emission controls need not be connected if data are 
provided to show that normal operating

[[Page 596]]

conditions are maintained in the engine induction system.
    (3) On air cooled engines, the fan shall be installed.
    (4) Additional accessories (e.g., oil cooler, alternators, air 
compressors, etc.) may be installed with advance approval by the 
Administrator.
    (d) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a 
new motor vehicle engine shall be functioning during all procedures in 
this subpart. In cases of component malfunction or failure, maintenance 
to correct component failure or malfunction shall be authorized in 
accordance with Sec. 86.079-25.

    (b) Except for idles, the engine dynamometer shall be operated at a 
constant speed of 2000 rpm<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>100 rpm. Speed 
deviations, not to exceed 200 rpm, will be allowed during the first 10 
seconds of each mode.
    (c) The times in-mode specified in paragraph (a) for the CT modes 
are <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 seconds. All other times in-mode are 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4 seconds.
    (d) The first 35 seconds of each 60 second engine power mode is 
allowed for engine-dynamometer stabilization. After this stabilization 
period the torque must be held at the specified value 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 percent until the exhaust gas analysis period. 
During the exhaust gas analysis period, the last 10 seconds of each 
nonclosed throttle mode the engine torque must be at the specified value 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent of the maximum torque observed. For 
example, mode 3 torque shall be held between 53 and 57 percent of 
maximum torque (55<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent) during the exhaust 
analysis period. Prior to the analysis period but excluding the first 35 
seconds of the mode, the torque shall be held between 50 and 60 percent 
of maximum torque (55%<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5%).
    (e) The idle operating mode shall be carried out at the 
manufacturer's recommended curb-idle engine speed. Arrive at the last 
idle mode by closing the throttle, braking the dynamometer to the engine 
idle speed, and unloading the dynamometer.
    (f) The CT operating mode shall be carried out at the same engine 
speed as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (g) If the Administrator determines that an engine shall be tested 
as an automatic transmission code engine, then a load shall be applied 
by the dynamometer during the idle modes (1 and 18) such that the engine 
speed is decreased from the recommended dynamometer-idle speed to the 
recommended curb-idle speed. The engine

[[Page 597]]

idle torque recorded for the calculations in Sec. 86.345 shall be zero.
    (h) If the operating conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section for modes 2 through 8, and 10 through 16 cannot be maintained, 
the Administrator may authorize deviations from the specified load 
conditions. Such deviations shall not exceed 5 percent of the maximum 
torque at the test speed. The minimum deviations, above and below the 
specified load, necessary for stable operation shall be determined by 
the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator prior to the test 
run. Emission tests shall be performed by operating the engine at the 
higher approved load setting during cycle 1 and at the lower approved 
load setting during cycle 2. The weighting factors shall be as specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (b) During each mode the specified speed shall be held to within 50 
rpm. Torque for each mode must be held at the specified value 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent of the maximum torque observed. For 
example, mode 4 torque shall be held between 48 and 52 percent of 
maximum torque (50 <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2%).
    (c) If the operating conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section for modes 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11 cannot be maintained, the 
Administrator may authorize deviations from the specified load 
conditions. Such deviations shall not exceed 10 percent of the maximum 
torque at the test speed. The minimum deviations, above and below the 
specified load, necessary for stable operation shall be determined by 
the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator prior to the test 
run. Emission tests shall be performed at each of the approved load 
settings, one above and one below the operating conditions specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The emission values obtained shall be 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 86.345 except that the weighting 
factor shall be 0.04.
    (d) If the Administrator determines that an engine shall be tested 
as an automatic transmission code engine, then a load shall be applied 
by the dynamometer during the idle modes (1, 7, and 13) such that the 
engine speed is decreased from the recommended dynamometer-idle speed to 
the recommended curb-idle speed. The engine-idle torque recorded for the 
calculations in Sec. 86.345 shall be zero.

Sec. 86.338-79  Exhaust measurement accuracy.

    (a) The analyzers must be operated between 15 percent and 100 
percent of full-scale chart deflection during the measurement of the 
emissions for each mode. The exceptions to the lower limit of this 
operating rule are:
    (1) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full-
scale if the full-scale value is 155 ppm (or ppm C) or less.
    (2) Option. For CO analysis the analyzer's response may be less than 
15 percent of full scale if the full-scale value is 5500 ppm or less.
    (3) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full 
scale if the emissions from the engine are erratic and the average 
chart-deflection value is greater than 15 percent of full scale.
    (4) For gasoline-fueled engines, the analyzer's response may be less 
than 15 percent of full scale during the initial part of the CT mode 
provided that average chart-deflection value is greater than 15 percent 
of full scale.
    (5) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full 
scale if the contribution of all modes read below the 15 percent level 
is less than 10 percent by mass of the final test results.
    (6) The HC analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full-
scale when transient emissions (spikes) can be reasonably expected to 
exceed 90 percent of full-scale. Higher analyzer ranges may be used 
provided that the precision and linearity of the analyzer at the level 
of the readings below 15 percent meets the specifications of the range 
that would be required if the transient emissions did not exist.

Sec. 86.339-79  Pre-test procedures.

    (a) Allow a minimum of 30 minutes warm-up in the stand-by or 
operating mode prior to spanning the analyzers.
    (b) Replace or clean the filter elements and then vacuum leak check 
the system, Sec. 86.328(a). A pressure leak check is also permitted per 
Sec. 86.328(b). Allow the heated sample line, filters, and pumps to 
reach operating temperature.
    (c) Perform the following system checks:
    (1) If a stainless steel NO<INF>2</INF> to NO converter is used, 
prior to gasoline-fueled engine tests, purge the converter with air 
(zero-grade air, room air, or O<INF>2</INF>) for a minimum of 30 
minutes. The converter must be at operational temperature while purging.
    (2) Check the sample-line temperature (see Sec. 86.310).
    (3) Check the system response time (see Sec. 86.329). System 
response time may be applied from the most recent check of response time 
if all of the following are met:
    (i) The flow rate for each flow meter is equal to or greater than 
the flow rate recorded in Sec. 86.329(b)(1)(ii).
    (ii) For analyzers with capillaries, the response time from the 
sample/span valve is measured using in-use pressures and bypass flows 
(see Sec. 86.329(b)(2)).
    (iii) The response time measured in step (ii) is equal to or less 
than the response time determined in Sec. 86.329(b)(2)(vii).
    (4) A hang-up check is permitted.
    (5) A converter-efficiency check is permitted. The check need not 
conform to Sec. 86.332(b). The test procedure may be aborted at this 
point in the procedure in order to repair the NO<INF>2</INF> to NO 
converter. If the test is aborted, the converter must pass the 
efficiency check described in Sec. 86.332(b) prior to starting the 
dynamometer test run.
    (d) Introduce the zero-grade gases at the same flow rates and 
pressures used

[[Page 600]]

to calibrate the analyzers and zero the analyzers on the lowest 
anticipated range that will be used during the test. Immediately prior 
to each test (segment, for Diesel engines), obtain a stable zero for 
each anticipated range that will be used during the test.
    (e) Introduce span gases to the instruments under the same flow 
conditions as were used for the zero gases. Adjust the instrument gains 
on the lowest range that will be used to give the desired value. Span 
gases should have a concentration greater than 70 percent of full scale 
for each range used. Immediately prior to each test and also prior to 
each segment of the Diesel test, record the response to the span gas and 
the span-gas concentration for each range that will be used during the 
test.
    (f) Check the zero responses. If they have changed more than 0.5 
percent of full scale, repeat paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (g) Check system flow rates and pressures. Note the values of gauges 
G3 and G4 for reference during the test.

    (1) The engine shall be started and operated at:
    (i) Zero load in accordance with the manufacturer's start-up and 
warm-up procedures for 1 minute <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>30 sec;
    (ii) A torque equivalent to 10<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3 percent of the 
most recent determination of maximum torque for 4 minutes 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>30 second at 2,000 rpm. This torque level may be 
exceeded if the choke and fast idle cam mechanism would normally result 
in a stabilized idle speed in excess of 2,000 rpm.
    (iii) A torque equivalent to 55<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 percent of the 
most recent determination of maximum torque for 35 minutes 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 minute at 2000 rpm;
    (iv) Option. If the engine has been operating on service 
accumulation for a minimum of 40 minutes, the service accumulation may 
be substituted for steps (i) through (iii).
    (2) If tested under the provisions of Sec. 86.079-29, check 
specifications as required. This check must be performed within 20 
minutes after completion of engine preconditioning;
    (3) Determine the maximum torque of the engine at 2000 rpm 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>100 rpm;
    (i) Operate the engine with the throttle fully opened for a maximum 
of three minutes. During the second minute of operation, record the high 
and low torque readings. The average of these two readings will be the 
maximum torque value at 2000 rpm.
    (ii) Calculate the torque corresponding to 10, 25, 55, and 90 
percent of the observed maximum torque value.
    (4) Determine the analyzer ranges required for each mode specified 
in Sec. 86.335 to meet the range specifications of Sec. 86.338. Prior to 
determining the range selection, the automatic dynamometer controller, 
if used, may be calibrated for the prevailing ambient conditions. The 
engine must not be operated for more than 30 minutes. Cycle 1, or cycles 
1 and 2, specified in Sec. 86.335, may be used for this purpose.
    (5) The engine shall be turned off and allowed to stand for at least 
1 hour, but not more than 2 hours, at an average ambient temperature of 
25  deg.C<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5  deg.C (77  deg.F<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 
deg.F).
    (d) The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (1) Maintain dynamometer test cell average ambient temperature at 25 
 deg.C<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5  deg.C (77  deg.F<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 
deg.F);
    (2) Observe pre-test procedures; Sec. 86.339;
    (3) Start cooling system;
    (4) Start engine and operate in accordance with manufacturer's 
start-up and warm-up procedures. The duration of the warm-up procedures 
shall be 5 minutes <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>30 seconds. Sample flow may 
begin during the warm-up;
    (5) Read and record all pre-test data specified in Sec. 86.337(c) 
during the 5 minute warm-up;
    (6) Release the choke idle-stop (if necessary) and return the engine 
throttle control to the curb-idle position, start sample flow and 
recorders if not

[[Page 601]]

already started, and begin test sequence of Sec. 86.335;
    (7) Should it be determined that the test must be rerun, then only 
the soak specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section need be performed 
prior to paragraph (d) of this section;
    (8) Perform the test cycle, Sec. 86.335, and continuously record 
exhaust gas concentrations;
    (9) Read and record all modal data specified in Sec. 86.337(d) 
during the test cycle;
    (10) The engine speed and load must be maintained within the 
requirements of Sec. 86.343;
    (11) If at any time during a test, the test equipment malfunctions 
or the specifications in paragraph (d)(10) of this section are not met, 
the test is void, and may be aborted. The test sequence may be restarted 
under the provisions of paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    (e) Exhaust gas measurements. (1) Measure HC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, 
and NO<INF>X</INF> volume concentration in the exhaust sample. Should 
the analyzer response exceed 100 percent of full scale or respond less 
than 15 percent of the full scale, the next higher or lower analyzer 
range shall be used per Sec. 86.338. For exceptions to the lower limit 
see Sec. 86.338. Should the fuel flow instrument read below 20 percent 
of the full-scale value, a flow measurement unit with a lower scale must 
be used unless the option in Sec. 86.314 is desired.
    (2) For each analyzer, each range that may be used during a test 
must have the zero and span responses recorded prior to the execution of 
that test. Only the range(s) used to measure the emissions during a test 
are required to have their zero and span recorded after the completion 
of the test.
    (3) If during an emission test the value of gauges downstream of the 
NDIR analyzer(s) (G3 or G4) differs by more than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 
inches of water from the pretest value, the test is void.

desired, but no allowance shall be made for increased emissions because 
of such conditions unless correction factors are developed and approved 
in advance by the Administrator.
    (c) The governor and fuel system shall have been adjusted to provide 
engine performance at the levels in the application for certification 
required under Sec. 86.079-21. These adjustments are only permitted 
under the provisions of Sec. 86.079-25.
    (d) The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (1) Install instrumentation and sample probes as required;
    (2) Observe pre-test procedure, Sec. 86.339;
    (3) Read and record the general test data as specified in 
Sec. 86.337(b);
    (4) Start cooling system;
    (5) Precondition the engine in the following manner:
    (i) Operate the engine at idle for 2 to 3 minutes;
    (ii) Operate the engine at approximately 50 percent power at the 
peak torque speed for 5 to 7 minutes;
    (iii) Operate the engine at rated speed and maximum horsepower for 
25 to 30 minutes;
    (iv) Option. It is permitted to precondition the engine at rated 
speed and maximum horsepower until the oil and water temperatures are 
stabilized. The temperatures are defined as stabilized if they are 
maintained within 2 percent of point for 2 minutes. The engine must be 
operated a minimum of 10 minutes for this option. This optional 
procedure may be substituted for step (iii);
    (v) Option. If the engine has been operating on service accumulation 
for a minimum of 40 minutes, the service accumulation may be substituted 
for steps (i) through (iii);

[[Page 602]]

    (vi) Longer preconditioning times may be used only if prior approval 
is obtained from the Administrator.
    (6) Within a total elapsed time of 10 minutes or less, determine by 
experimentation the maximum torque at the rated and intermediate speeds;
    (7) Calculate the torque corresponding to 2, 25, 50, 75, and 100 
percent of the maximum observed torque for the rated and intermediate 
speeds;
    (8) Read and record all pre-test data specified in Sec. 86.337(c);
    (9) Start the test cycle, Sec. 86.336, within 10 minutes, after 
determining test load using the torque values determined in paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section;
    (10) Read and record all modal data specified in Sec. 86.337(d) 
during the last 2 minutes of each mode;
    (11) Continuously record the analyzer's response to the exhaust gas 
during each test segment;
    (12) Test segments may be repeated;
    (13) If a delay of more than 20 minutes occurs between the end of 
one segment and the beginning of another segment the test is void. The 
test may be restarted at paragraph (d)(8) of this section. If the delay 
exceeds 4 hours, the test shall be restarted at paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section;
    (14) The engine speed and load must be maintained within the 
requirements of Sec. 86.336 during the last 2 minutes of each mode. If 
the requirement is not met for all modes during a test segment, that 
segment of the test is void. The test segment may be restarted beginning 
with paragraph (d)(8) of this section;
    (15) If at any time during a test segment, the test equipment 
malfunctions or the specifications in paragraph (d)(14) of this section 
are not met, the test segment is void, and may be aborted. The test 
segment may be restarted beginning with paragraph (d)(8) of this 
section;
    (16) Fuel flow and air flow during the idle or 2-percent load 
conditions may be determined just prior to or immediately following the 
dynamometer sequence, if longer times are required for accurate 
measurements.
    (e) Exhaust gas measurements. (1) Measure HC, CO, CO<INF>2,</INF> 
and NO<INF>X</INF> volume concentration in the exhaust sample. Should 
the analyzer response exceed 100 percent of full scale or respond less 
than 15 percent of full scale, the next higher or lower analyzer range 
shall be used per Sec. 86.338. For exceptions to the lower limit see 
Sec. 86.338. Should the fuel flow instrument read below 20 percent of 
full-scale value, a smaller flow measurement unit must be used unless 
the option in Sec. 86.314 is desired.
    (2) Each analyzer range that may be used during a test segment must 
have the zero and span responses recorded prior to the execution of that 
test segment. Only the range(s) used to measure the emissions during a 
test segment are required to have their zero and span recorded after the 
completion of the test segment.
    (3) It is permitted to change filter elements between test segments.
    (4) A leak check is permitted between test segments.
    (5) A hang-up check is permitted between test segments.
    (6) If, during the emission measurement portion of a test segment, 
the value of the gauges downstream of the NDIR analyzer(s) G3 or G4 
differs by more than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 inches of water from the 
pretest value, the test segment is void.

<R05>
Sec. 86.342-79  Post-test procedures.

    (a) Begin a hang-up check within 30 seconds of the completion of the 
last mode in the test. Use the following procedure:
    (1) Introduce a zero-grade gas or room air into the sample probe or 
valve V2 to check the ``hangup zero'' response. Simultaneously start a 
time measurement.
    (2) Select the lowest HC range used during the test;
    (3) The difference between the span-zero response and the hang-up 
zero response shall not be greater than 5.0 percent of full scale or 10 
ppmC whichever is greater, within:
    (i) 50 seconds for gasoline-fueled engine test, or
    (ii) 4 minutes for Diesel engine tests, or
    (b) Begin the analyzer span checks within 6 minutes after the 
completion of the last mode in the test. Record for

[[Page 603]]

each analyzer the zero and span response for each range used during the 
preceding test or test segment.
    (c) If during the test, the filter element(s) were replaced or 
cleaned, a vacuum check must be performed per Sec. 86.328 immediately 
after the span checks. If the vacuum side leak check does not meet the 
requirements of Sec. 86.328 the test is void.
    (d) Read and record the post-test data specified in Sec. 86.337(e).
    (e) For a valid test, the analyzer drift between the before-test and 
after-test (before-segment and after-segment for Diesels) span checks 
for each analyzer must meet the following requirements:
    (1) The span drift (defined as the change in the difference between 
the zero response and the span response) must not exceed 2.0 percent of 
full-scale chart deflection for each range used;
    (2) The zero response drift must not exceed 2.0 percent of full-
scale chart deflection for each range used above 155 ppm (or ppm C), or 
3 percent of full-scale chart deflection for each range below 155 ppm 
(or ppm C).

Sec. 86.343-79  Chart reading.

    (a) A computer or any other automatic data processing device(s) may 
be used as long as the system meets the requirements of this subpart.
    (b) Determine the location on the chart of the analyzer responses 
corresponding to the end of each mode.
    (c) For gasoline-fueled engines, determine whether the test cycle 
was run in accordance with Sec. 86.335 by observing either chart event 
marks, speed trace, torque trace, or concentration traces. The test will 
be invalidated if there is a deviation of more than:
    (1) 2 seconds from the specified time for each CT mode, and 4 
seconds for all other modes; or,
    (2) Two percent of maximum torque during the exhaust gas sampling 
period (last 10 seconds on each nonclosed throttle gasoline-fueled 
engine mode); or
    (3) 5 percent of maximum torque during the remainder of the mode, 
excluding the first 35 seconds of the mode; or
    (4) 200 rpm during the first 10 seconds of each mode, or 100 rpm 
during the remainder of each mode.
    (d) Determine chart deflections.
    (1) Locate the last 10 seconds of each gasoline-fueled engine mode 
except CT. Locate the last 50 seconds of each gasoline-fueled engine CT 
mode. For all Diesel engine modes locate the last 60 seconds.
    (2)(i) Divide the last 10 seconds or 60 seconds, whichever is 
applicable, into a minimum of 10 equally spaced increments. Determine 
the chart deflection of each increment for the CO<INF>2</INF>, CO, HC, 
and NO<INF>X</INF> analyzers.
    (ii) Option for Diesel engine modes. If the deviation from a 
straight line (other than instrument noise) during this 60 seconds is 
less than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 percent of full-scale, the average 
chart deflection may be determined by eye. The average value (one 
number) may then be used in lieu of the 10 values required by paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Other methods of determining the chart deflection of the 
analyzers may be used only with prior approval by the Administrator.
    (e) Determine CO<INF>2</INF>, CO, HC, and NO<INF>X</INF> 
concentrations for each mode.
    (1) If the option in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is 
employed, then those chart deflections for both linear and non-linear 
analyzers may be substituted for the average chart deflection in step 
(e)(2).
    (2) For linear instruments, average the chart deflections determined 
in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Determine the concentration for 
this average chart deflection using calibration data.
    (3) For non-linear instruments, calculate concentrations for each 
chart deflection determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Take 
the average of these concentrations for each mode.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph, calibration data includes 
calibration curves, linearity curves, span-gas responses, and zero-gas 
responses.

F<INF>9</INF> = - 1.4317(10) <SUP>- 21</SUP>

    (2) The table in Figure D79-5 may be used in lieu of equation (3).
    (e) The saturated vapor pressure of water at the dry-bulb 
temperature (P<INF>DB</INF>) is found (if required) by using dry-bulb 
absolute temperature ( deg.K) in equation (3).

of air pollution from new motorcycles. Test procedures are found in 
subpart F.
    (b) Several discrete concepts are addressed:
    (1) Requirements. Sections 86.407 to 86.415.
    (2) Application for certification. Sections 86.416 and 86.417.
    (3) Test fleet selection. Sections 86.418 to 86.423.

[[Page 611]]

    (4) Service accumulation, testing, maintenance, certification. 
Sections 86.424 to 86.439.
    (5) Administrative provisions. Sections 86.440 to 86.444.
    (c) The certification procedure to be followed depends upon the 
manufacturer's projected sales.
    (1) New motorcycles, produced by a manufacturer whose projected U.S. 
sales of motorcycles is 10,000 or more units (for the model year in 
which certification is sought) shall demonstrate compliance with all 
general standards and all specific emission requirements before they can 
be sold in the United States. The manufacturer is required to submit an 
application with sales data, product information, required maintenance, 
testing and service accumulation procedures. The Administrator will 
select vehicle(s) which will represent the manufacturer's product line. 
The manufacturer is required to construct these vehicles to be 
representative of actual production. Service is accumulated and emission 
tests performed with data submitted to the Administrator. The 
Administrator may run his own tests to confirm the manufacturer's 
results. The Administrator will review the data and either grant or deny 
certification. If the manufacturer wishes to make changes to a certified 
vehicle, or to produce a new vehicle, the Administrator must be 
notified. The Administrator may require testing to demonstrate continued 
compliance with emission standards. Each vehicle must be labeled with 
tune up specifications and the purchaser must be supplied with 
maintenance instructions. Also, information on production vehicles must 
be supplied to the Administrator.
    (2) New motorcycles produced by a manufacturer whose projected U.S. 
sales of motorcycles is less than 10,000 units (for the model year in 
which certification is sought) shall meet both the general standards and 
specific emission requirements described in Secs. 86.401 through 86.417, 
Sec. 86.425, Sec. 86.437, and Secs. 86.440 through 86.444 of this 
subpart before they can be sold in the United States. The manufacturer 
is required to submit an application containing a statement that his 
vehicles conform to the applicable emission standards. The manufacturer 
is required to retain in his records, but not submit with the 
application, valid emission test data which support his statement. The 
Administrator will review the application and either grant or deny 
certification. Each vehicle must be labeled with tune up specifications 
and the purchaser must be supplied with maintenance instructions. Also, 
information on production vehicles must be supplied to the 
Administrator.
    (d) Manufacturers who are considering an application should contact: 
Director, Vehicle Programs and Compliance Division, Environmental 
Protection Agency, 2565 Plymouth Rd., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105 and 
state whether he/she plans to certify for total sales of greater than or 
less than 10,000 vehicles for the applicable model year.

    (a)(1) Engine displacement shall be calculated using nominal engine 
values and rounded to the nearest whole cubic

[[Page 617]]

centimetre, in accordance with ASTM E 29-67.
    (2) For rotary engines, displacement means the maximum volume of a 
combustion chamber between two rotor tip seals minus the minimum volume 
of that combustion chamber between those two rotor tip seals times three 
times the number of rotors.

cc=(max. chamber volume - min. chamber volume)  x  3  x  no. of rotors

    (b) Motorcycles will be divided into classes based on engine 
displacement.
    (1) Class I--50 to 169 cc (3.1 to 10.4 cu. in.).
    (2) Class II--170 to 279 cc (10.4 to 17.1 cu. in.).
    (3) Class III--280 cc and over (17.1 cu. in. and over).
    (c) At the manufacturer's option, a vehicle described in an 
application for certification may be placed in a higher class (larger 
displacement). All procedures for the higher class must then be complied 
with, compliance with emission standards will be determined on the basis 
of engine displacement.


<R05>
Sec. 86.420-78  Engine families.

groupings whose engines are expected to have similar emission 
characteristics throughout their useful life. Each group of engines with 
similar emission characteristics shall be defined as a separate engine 
family.
    (b) Reciprocating families. To be classed in the same engine family, 
reciprocating engines must be identical in all of the following 
applicable respects:
    (1) The combustion cycle.
    (2) The cooling mechanism.
    (3) The cylinder configuration (inline, vee, opposed, bore spacings,

    (c) At the manufacturer's option, reciprocating engines identical in 
all the respects listed in paragraph (b) of this section may be further 
divided into different engine families if the Administrator determines 
that they may be expected to have different emission characteristics. 
This determination will be based upon a consideration of features such 
as:
    (1) The bore and stroke.
    (2) The combustion chamber configuration.
    (3) The intake and exhaust timing method of actuation (poppet valve, 
reed valve, rotary valve, etc.).
    (4) The intake and exhaust valve or port sizes, as applicable.
    (5) The fuel system.
    (6) The exhaust system.
    (d) Rotary families. To be classed in the same engine family, rotary 
combustion cycle engines must be identical in all of the following 
applicable respects:
    (1) The major axis of the epitrochoidal curve.
    (2) The minor axis of the epitrochoidal curve.
    (3) The generating radius of the epitrochoidal curve.
    (4) The cooling mechanism.
    (5) The number of rotors.
    (6) The engine displacement class, Sec. 86.419.
    (7) The method of air aspiration.
    (8) The number of catalytic converters, location, volume and 
composition.
    (9) The thermal reactor characteristics.
    (10) The number of carburetors.
    (11) The prechamber characteristics.
    (e) At the manufacturer's option, rotary combustion cycle engines 
identical in all the respects listed in paragraph (d) of this section, 
may be further divided into different engine families if the 
Administrator determines that they may be expected to have different 
emission characteristics. This determination will be based upon a 
consideration of features, such as:
    (1) The width of the rotor housing.
    (2) The type and location of intake port (side, peripheral, 
combination, etc.).
    (3) The number of spark plugs per rotor.

[[Page 618]]

    (4) The fuel system.
    (5) The exhaust system.
    (f) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine 
families based upon the criteria listed in paragraphs (b) and (d) of 
this section, the Administrator will establish families of those engines 
based upon the features most related to their emission characteristics.

which are identical to those selected by the Administrator. Written 
notice of a commitment to operate and test additional vehicles shall be 
given to the Administrator prior to the start of testing and not later 
than 30 days following notification of the test fleet selection. The 
results of tests performed by the manufacturer will be combined to 
determine deterioration factors. Each vehicle must meet applicable 
standards when tested by the Administrator and when those results are 
projected to the useful life.
    (d) In lieu of testing a test vehicle and submitting data therefore, 
a manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the 
Administrator, submit exhaust emission data on a similar vehicle for 
which certification has previously been obtained or for which all 
applicable data has previously been submitted.

the Administrator. Except with the advance approval of the 
Administrator, all vehicles will accumulate distance at a measured curb 
mass which is within 5 kg (11.0 lb) of the loaded vehicle mass specified 
by the Administrator.
    (b) During service accumulation, vehicles shall not be operated for 
more than 12 hours during an operating sequence. Engine shutdowns are 
permitted during the operating sequence, but the periods of shutdown are 
not included in the 12 hour total. Following each operating sequence, 
the vehicle shall soak, without operation, for a minimum of 8 hours. 
During soak periods, the vehicle shall be exposed to normal outside 
ambient temperatures and humidity conditions unless vehicle maintenance 
or servicing is being performed.

    (2) A zero kilometer emission test may be performed prior to the 
beginning of service accumulation.
    (b) All vehicles shall undergo at least four emission tests; one at 
the minimum test distance, one before and one after periodic 
maintenance, and one at the total test distance. If no maintenance is 
scheduled, then at least two tests will be performed, at equal 
intervals, between the minimum and total test distances. Additional 
tests may be performed; such tests must be at equal intervals and 
approved by the Administrator prior to starting service accumulation.
    (c) Where the Administrator agrees to a lesser distance for service 
accumulation, he may modify the maintenance provisions of this subpart.
    (d) All tests required by this subpart must be conducted at an 
accumulated distance within 250 kilometers (155 mi) of the nominal 
distance at each test point.
    (e)(1) If a manufacturer conducts multiple tests at any test point 
at which the data are intended to be used in the calculation of the 
deterioration factor, the number of tests must be the same at each point 
and may not exceed three valid tests unless the manufacturer chooses to 
average the test results.
    (2) If the manufacturer chooses to average the test results at a 
test point, he may conduct more tests than the minimum number of tests 
conducted at any other test point.
    The results of the multiple tests shall be averaged to create a 
single value which is the test point value used in the deterioration 
factor calculation specified in Sec. 86.432-78.
    (3) When using this option to generate data for a particular test 
point, the manufacturer must include in the average all valid test data 
generated at that test point.
    (4) The manufacturer shall follow the same procedure for all exhaust 
pollutants.
    (5) The test results obtained from the emission tests performed 
before and after maintenance affecting emissions shall not be averaged.
    (f) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the test 
vehicles be submitted to him, at such places as he may designate, for 
the purpose of conducting emissions tests. The Administrator may specify 
that he will conduct such testing at the manufacturer's facility, in 
which case instrumentation and equipment specified by the Administrator 
shall be made available by the manufacturer for test operations. Any 
testing conducted at a manufacturer's facility pursuant to this 
paragraph shall be scheduled by

[[Page 620]]

the manufacturer as promptly as possible.
    (g) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test vehicle, 
the results of that test, unless subsequently invalidated by the 
Administrator, shall comprise the data for the vehicle at that 
prescribed test point and the manufacturer's data for that prescribed 
test point shall not be used in determining compliance with emission 
standards.

    (c) A scheduled major engine tune-up shall be restricted to items 
listed below and shall be conducted in a manner consistent with service 
instructions and specifications provided by the manufacturer for use by 
customer service personnel. The following items may be inspected, 
replaced, cleaned, adjusted, and/or serviced as required: (1) Breaker 
points, timing, (2) idle speed and idle air/fuel mixture, (3) valve 
lash, (4) engine bolt torque, and (5) spark plugs.
    (d) The Administrator will specify the ignition timing, idle air 
fuel mixture and other fuel system adjustments to be used at each tune-
up. The settings selected will be those the Administrator deems 
appropriate within the physically available range.
    (e) Periodic change of engine and transmission oil, and change or 
service of oil, air, and fuel filters will be allowed at the same 
distance intervals that will be specified in the manufacturer's 
maintenance instructions.
    (f) Requests for authorization of periodic maintenance of emission 
control related components not specifically authorized to be maintained 
by this section, and for anticipated maintenance (see Sec. 86.428), must 
be made prior to the beginning of distance accumulation. The 
Administrator will approve the performance of such maintenance if the 
manufacturer makes a satisfactory showing that the maintenance will be 
performed on vehicles in use and that the maintenance is reasonable and 
necessary.
    (1) The EGR system may be serviced a maximum of two times during the 
durability service accumulation if failure of the EGR system activates 
an audible and/or visual signal approved by the Administrator which 
alerts the vehicle operator to the need for EGR system maintenance, or 
if the need for periodic maintenance of the EGR system is overtly 
signalled to the vehicle operator by an appropriate means, e.g., an 
indicator light or significantly reduced driveability performance.
    (2) The catalytic converter may be serviced only once during the 
durability service accumulation if failure of the catalytic converter 
activates an audible and/or visual signal approved by the Administrator 
which alerts the vehicle operator to the need for catalytic converter 
maintenance, or if the need for periodic maintenance of the catalytic 
converter is overtly signalled to the vehicle operator by an appropriate 
means, e.g., an indicator light or significantly reduced driveability 
performance.
    (g) Certain engine components may require maintenance which, by its 
nature, cannot be scheduled for periodic intervals, but which the 
manufacturer believes will be necessary. For example, piston and 
cylinder replacement caused by piston seizure which results in the 
vehicle being inoperative; or in the case of two-stroke engines, 
decarbonization, the need for which is

[[Page 621]]

signalled to the vehicle operator by significantly reduce driveability 
performance. Such maintenance is designated anticipated maintenance. 
Anticipated maintenance must be identified by the manufacturer and 
approved as being appropriate by the Administrator prior to the start of 
service accumulation. The approximate distance at which the need for 
anticipated maintenance may arise must be specified in the application 
for certification.
    (h) Complete emission tests (see subpart F) are required, unless 
waived by the Administrator, before and after any vehicle maintenance 
which may reasonably be expected to affect emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 86.429-78  Maintenance, unscheduled; test vehicles.

    (a) Any unscheduled engine, emission control system, or fuel system 
adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on 
vehicles shall be performed only with the advance approval of the 
Administrator.
    (1) In the case of unscheduled maintenance, such approval will be 
given if the Administrator:
    (i) Has made a preliminary determination that part failure or system 
malfunction, or the repair of such failure or malfunction, does not 
render the vehicle unrepresentative of vehicles in use, and does not 
require direct access to the combustion chamber, except for spark plug, 
fuel injection component, or removable prechamber removal or 
replacement; and
    (ii) Has made a determination that the need for maintenance or 
repairs is indicated by an overt indication of malfunction such as 
persistent misfire, vehicle stall, overheating, fluid leakage, loss of 
oil pressure, or charge indicator warning.
    (2) Emission measurements may not be used as a means of determining 
the need for unscheduled maintenance under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (b) Repairs to vehicle components of test vehicles, other than the 
engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be performed only 
as a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, or with the 
advance approval of the Administrator.
    (c) The Administrator shall be given the opportunity to verify the 
extent of an overt indication of part failure and/or vehicle malfunction 
(e.g., misfire, stall), or an activation of an audible and/or visual 
signal, prior to the performance of any maintenance to which such overt 
indication or signal is relevant under the provisions of this section.
    (d) Equipment, instruments, or tools may not be used to identify 
malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the 
same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools will be available at 
dealerships and other service outlets and
    (1) Are used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such 
components, and
    (2) Are used subsequent to the identification of a vehicle or engine 
malfunction, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for 
durability or emission data vehicles, or
    (3) Unless specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (e) If the Administrator determines that part failure or system 
malfunction occurrence and/or repair rendered the vehicle 
unrepresentative of vehicles in use, the vehicle shall not be used as a 
test vehicle.
    (f) Complete emission tests are required, unless waived by the 
Administrator, before and after any vehicle maintenance which may 
reasonably be expected to affect emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 86.430-78  Vehicle failure.

    Any test vehicle which incurs major mechanical failure necessitating 
disassembly of the engine shall not be used as a test vehicle. This 
prohibition does not apply to failures occurring after the completion of 
all required tests at the total test distance.

<R05>
Sec. 86.431-78  Data submission.

    (a) Data from all tests (including voided tests) performed by a 
manufacturer with total projected sales in excess of 10,000 vehicles 
shall be included in the application.
    (b) The manufacturer shall furnish to the Administrator explanation 
for voiding any test. The Administrator will determine if voiding the 
test was

[[Page 622]]

appropriate based upon the explanation given by the manufacturer. If the 
Administrator determines that voiding the test was not appropriate, the 
Administrator may require that the data from that test be used in the 
calculation of the deterioration factor for emissions.
    (c) When unscheduled or anticipated maintenance is performed, a 
complete record of all pertinent maintenance, including the malfunction 
diagnosis made, the corrective action taken, and the test data obtained 
shall be included in the application.
    (d) A complete record of all maintenance shall be supplied.

<R05>
Sec. 86.432-78  Deterioration factor.

    (a) Deterioration factors shall be developed for each test vehicle 
from the emission test results. A separate factor shall be developed for 
each pollutant. The applicable data to be used in calculating these 
factors are:
    (1) The results from all valid tests conducted by the manufacturer 
or Administrator at scheduled test intervals.
    (2) The results from tests conducted before and after scheduled 
maintenance unless specifically excluded by the Administrator.
    (3) The results from tests conducted before and after unscheduled 
maintenance, if approval of the maintenance by the Administrator was 
conditioned on the data being used in the deterioration factor 
calculation.
    (b) Emission results which are less than 0.10 g/km shall be 
considered to be 0.10 g/km for purposes of this section.
    (c) Test results for each pollutant shall be plotted as a function 
of the service accumulated at the start of the emission test, rounded to 
the nearest kilometre. These results shall be correlated to a straight 
line, fit by the method of least squares.
    (d) An exhaust emission deterioration factor will be calculated by 
dividing the predicted emissions at the useful life distance by the 
predicted emissions at the total test distance. Predicted emissions are 
obtained from the correlation developed in paragraph (c) of this 
section.

Factor = Predicted total distance emissions/Predicted total test 
          distance emissions


These interpolated and extrapolated values shall be carried out to four 
places to the right of the decimal point before dividing one by the 
other to determine the deterioration factor. The results shall be 
rounded to three places to the right of the decimal point in accordance 
with ASTM E 29-67.
    (e) Deterioration factors computed to be less than 1.000 shall be 
1.000.
    (f)(1) The manufacturer has the option of applying an outlier test 
point procedure to completed durability data within its certification 
testing program for a given model year.
    (2) The outlier procedure will be specified by the Administrator.
    (3) For any pollutant, durability-data test points that are 
identified as outliers shall not be included in the determination of 
deterioration factors if the manufacturer has elected this option.
    (4) The manufacturer shall specify to the Administrator, before the 
certification of the first engine family for that model year, if it 
intends to use the outlier procedure.
    (5) The manufacturer may not change procedures after the first 
engine family of the model year is certified.
    (6) Where the manufacturer chooses to apply the outlier procedure to 
a data set containing data which were averaged under Sec. 86.427-78(e), 
the outlier procedure shall be completed before averaging the data.

<R05>
Sec. 86.434-78  Testing by the Administrator.

    (a) At the conclusion of service accumulation, and after emission 
tests for deterioration, the Administrator may require confirmatory 
testing. The Administrator will designate where such testing shall be 
performed.
    (b) The manufacturer may request a retest. The results of the retest 
will be used to determine compliance.
    (c) If the emission results exceed the standard, certification will 
be denied.

<R05>
Sec. 86.435-78  Extrapolated emission values.

    (a) If the deterioration factor lines are below the standards 
between the minimum test distance and the useful life, or if all points 
used to generate the lines are below the standards, predicted useful 
life emissions shall be calculated. If not, the manufacturers may elect 
to withdraw the vehicle or accumulate additional service.
    (b) The emission test results of each pollutant obtained from the 
half life test will be multiplied by the appropriate deterioration 
factors to determine useful life emissions.
    (1) If the useful life emissions are below the standards, 
certification will be granted.
    (2) If any of the useful life emissions exceed the emission 
standards, the vehicle must (if not withdrawn) accumulate distance to 
the useful life.

<R05>
Sec. 86.436-78  Additional service accumulation.

    (a) Additional service up to the useful life will be accumulated 
under the same conditions as the initial service accumulation.
    (b) New deterioration lines will be generated using all applicable 
test points up to the useful life. The same procedures for determining 
the original deterioration lines will be used.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) To qualify for certification:
    (1) The full life emission test results must be below the standards, 
and
    (2) The deterioration line must be below the standard at the minimum 
test distance and the useful life, or all points used to generate the 
line, must be below the standard.
    (e) If the vehicle is unable to complete the total distance due to 
engine mechanical failure, certification will be granted if:
    (1) The mechanical failure was anticipated, Sec. 86.428, and
    (2) A new deterioration line calculated using the procedure 
described in Sec. 86.436-78(b) is below the standard at the minimum test 
distance and at the useful life, and,
    (3) The results of the half life emission tests, when adjusted by 
the new deterioration factors, are below the standards.

Sec. 86.441-78  Right of entry.

    (a) Any manufacturer who has applied for certification of a new 
motorcycle subject to certification tests under this subpart shall admit 
or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement Officer during operating 
hours on presentation of any credentials to any of the following:
    (1) Any facility where any such tests or any procedures or 
activities connected with such tests are or were performed.
    (2) Any facility where any new motorcycle which is being, was or is 
to be tested is present.
    (3) Any facility where any construction process or assembly process 
used in the modification or build-up of such a vehicle into a 
certification vehicle is taking place or has taken place.
    (4) Any facility where any record or other document relating to any 
of the above is located.
    (b) Upon admission to any facility referred to in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, any EPA Enforcement Officer shall be allowed:
    (1) To inspect and monitor any part or aspect of such procedures, 
activities, and testing facilities, including, but not limited to, 
monitoring vehicle preconditioning, emissions tests and service 
accumulation, maintenance, and vehicle soak and storage procedures; and 
to verify correlation or calibration of test equipment;
    (2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, designs, or 
other documents; and
    (3) To inspect and/or photograph any part or aspect of any such 
certification vehicle and any components to be used in the construction 
thereof.
    (c) In order to allow the Administrator to determine whether or not 
production motorcycles conform in all material respects to the design 
specifications which applied to those vehicles described in the 
application for

[[Page 627]]

certification for which a certificate of conformity has been issued and 
to standards prescribed under section 202 of the Act, any manufacturer 
shall admit any EPA Enforcement Officer on presentation of credentials 
to both:
    (1) Any facility where any document design, or procedure relating to 
the translation of the design and construction of engines and emission 
related components described in the application for certification or 
used for certification testing into production vehicles is located or 
carried on; and
    (2) Any facility where any motorcycles to be introduced into 
commerce are manufactured or assembled.
    (d) On admission to any such facility referred to in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section, any EPA Enforcement Officer shall be allowed:
    (1) To inspect and monitor any aspects of such manufacture or 
assembly and other procedures;
    (2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, documents or 
designs; and
    (3) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any such new 
motorcycles and any component used in the assembly thereof that are 
reasonably related to the purpose of his entry.
    (e) Any EPA Enforcement Officer shall be furnished by those in 
charge of a facility being inspected with such reasonable assistance as 
he may request to help him discharge any function listed in this 
paragraph. Each applicant for or recipient of certification is required 
to cause those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to 
furnish such reasonable assistance without charge to EPA whether or not 
the applicant controls the facility.
    (f) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement 
Officer applies whether or not the applicant owns or controls the 
facility in question and applies both to domestic and to foreign 
manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not attempt to make any 
inspections which it has been informed that local law forbids. However, 
if local law makes it impossible to do what is necessary to insure the 
accuracy of data generated at a facility, no informed judgment that a 
vehicle or engine is certifiable or is covered by a certificate can 
properly be based on that data. It is the responsibility of the 
manufacturer to locate its testing and manufacturing facilities in 
jurisdictions where this situation will not arise.
    (g) For purposes of this section:
    (1) Presentation of credentials shall mean display of the document 
designating a person as an EPA Enforcement Officer.
    (2) Where vehicle, component, or engine storage areas or facilities 
are concerned, operating hours shall mean all times during which 
personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of 
the area or facility and have access to it.
    (3) Where facilities or areas other than those covered by paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section are concerned, operating hours shall mean all 
times during which an assembly line is in operation or all times during 
which testing, maintenance, service accumulation, production or 
compilation of records, or any other procedure or activity related to 
certification testing, to translation of designs from the test stage to 
the production stage, or to vehicle manufacture or assembly is being 
carried out in a facility.
    (4) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, 
copying, interpretation and translation services, the making available 
on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their 
working hours to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer of how the facility 
operates and to answer his questions, and the performance on request of 
emissions tests on any vehicle which is being, has been, or will be used 
for certification testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may 
require appropriate service accumulation. A manufacturer may be 
compelled to cause the personal appearance of any employee at such a 
facility before an EPA Enforcement Officer by written request for his 
appearance, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement, 
served on the manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by 
the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, 
represented, and advised by counsel. No counsel who accompanies, 
represents, or advises an employee compelled to appear may accompany,

represent, or advise any other person in the investigation.
    (5) Any entry without 24 hours prior written or oral notification to 
the affected manufacturer shall be authorized in writing by the 
Assistant Administrator for Enforcement.


<R05>
Sec. 86.442-78  Denial, revocation, or suspension of certification.

    (a) Notwithstanding the fact that any certification vehicle(s) may 
comply with other provisions of this subpart, the Administrator may 
withhold or deny the issuance of a certificate of conformity (or suspend 
or revoke any such certificate which has been issued) with respect to 
any such vehicle(s) if:
    (1) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in his 
application for certification thereof; or
    (2) The manufacturer renders inaccurate or invalid any test data 
which he submits pertaining thereto or otherwise circumvents the intent 
of the Act or of this subpart with respect to such vehicle; or
    (3) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied access on the terms 
specified in Sec. 86.441 to any facility or portion thereof which 
contains any of the following:
    (i) The vehicle, or
    (ii) Any components used or considered for use in its modification 
or build-up into a certification vehicle, or
    (iii) Any production vehicle which is or will be claimed by the 
manufacturer to be covered by the certificate, or
    (iv) Any step in the construction of a vehicle described in 
paragraph (c) of this section, or
    (v) Any records, documents, reports, or histories required by this 
part to be kept concerning any of the above.
    (4) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied ``reasonable assistance'' 
(as defined in Sec. 86.444) in examining any of the items listed in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (b) The sanctions of withholding, denying, revoking, or suspending 
of a certificate may be imposed for the reasons in paragraph (a) of this 
section only when the infraction is substantial.
    (c) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submits false or 
inaccurate information, or knowingly renders inaccurate or invalid any 
test data, or commits any fraudulent acts and such acts contribute 
substantially to the Administrator's decision to issue a certificate of 
conformity, the Administrator may deem such certificate void ab initio.
    (d) In any case in which certification of a vehicle is proposed to 
be withheld, denied, revoked, or suspended under paragraph (a) (3) or 
(4) of this section, and in which the Administrator has presented to the 
manufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a violation of 
Sec. 86.441 in fact occurred, the manufacturer, if the wishes to contend 
that, even though the violation occurred, the vehicle in question was 
not involved in the violation to a degree that would warrant 
withholding, denial, revocation, or suspension of certification under 
either paragraph (a) (3) or (4) of this section, shall have the burden 
of establishing that contention to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator.
    (e) Any revocation or suspension of certification under paragraph 
(a) of this section shall:
    (1) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered 
an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.444 
hereof.
    (2) Extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce 
of vehicles previously covered by the certification which are still in 
the hands of the manufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or other 
misconduct as makes the certification invalid ab initio.
    (f) The manufacturer may request in the form and manner specified in 
Sec. 86.443 that any determination made by the Administrator under 
paragraph (a) of this section to withhold or deny certification be 
reviewed in a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.444. If the 
Administrator finds, after a review of the request and supporting data, 
that the request raises a substantial factual issue, he will grant the 
request with respect to such issue.

<R05>
Sec. 86.509-90  Exhaust gas sampling system.

    (a)(1) General. The exhaust gas sampling system is designed to 
measure the true mass emissions of vehicle exhaust. In the CVS concept 
of measuring mass emissions, two conditions must be satisfied: the total 
volume of the mixture of exhaust and dilution air must be measured and a 
continuously proportioned volume of sample must be collected for 
analysis. Mass emissions are determined from the sample concentration 
and totalized flow over the test period.
    (2) Vehicle tailpipe to CVS duct. For methanol fueled vehicles, 
cooling of the exhaust gases in the duct connecting the vehicle tailpipe 
to the CVS shall be minimized. This may be accomplished by:
    (i) Using a duct of unrestricted length maintained at a temperature 
above the maximum dew point of the exhaust, but below 121  deg.C (250 
deg.F); heating and possibly cooling capabilities are required; or
    (ii) Using a short duct (up to 12 feet long) constructed of smooth 
wall pipe with a minimum of flexible sections, maintained at a 
temperature above the maximum dew point of the exhaust, but below 121 
deg.C (250  deg.F), prior to the test and during any breaks in the test 
and uninsulated during the test (insulation may remain in place and/or 
heating may occur during testing provided maximum temperature is not 
exceeded); or
    (iii) Using smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no 
required heating. A maximum of two short flexible connectors are allowed 
under this option; or
    (iv) Omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution 
function at the motorcycle tailpipe exit.
    (3) Positive displacement pump. The Positive Displacement Pump-
Constant Volume Sampler (PDP-CVS), Figure F90-1 satisfies the first 
condition by metering at a constant temperature and pressure through the 
pump. The total volume is measured by counting the revolutions made by 
the calibrated positive displacement pump. The proportional samples are 
achieved by sampling at a constant flow rate. For methanol-fueled 
motorcycle sample lines for the methanol and formaldehyde samples are 
heated to prevent condensation. The temperature of the sample lines 
shall be more than 3  deg.C (5  deg.F) above the maximum dew point of 
the sample, but below 121  deg.C (250  deg.F). (Note: For 1990 through 
1994 model year methanol-fueled motorcycles, methanol and formaldehyde 
sampling may be omitted provided the bag sample (hydrocarbons and 
methanol) is analyzed using a HFID calibrated with methanol.)

[[Page 632]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.173

    (4) Critical flow venturi. The operation of the Critical Flow 
Venturi--Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-CVS) sample system, Figure F90-2, 
is based upon the principles of fluid dynamics associated with critical 
flow. Proportional sampling throughout temperature excursions is 
maintained by use of small

[[Page 633]]

CFVs in the sample lines, which respond to the varying temperatures in 
the same manner as the main CFV. For methanol-fueled motorcycles, the 
methanol and formaldehyde sample lines are heated to prevent 
condensation. The temperature of the sample lines shall be more than 3 
deg.C (5  deg.F) above the maximum dew point of the sample, but below 
121  deg.C (250  deg.F). Care must be taken to ensure that the CFVs of 
the sample probes are not heated since heating of the CFVs would cause 
loss of proportionality. (Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year 
methanol-fueled motorcycles, methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be 
omitted provided the bag sample (hydrocarbons and methanol) is analyzed 
using a HFID calibrated with methanol.) Total flow per test is 
determined by continuously computing and integrating instantaneous flow. 
A low response time temperature sensor is necessary for accurate flow 
calculation.

    (5) Electronic Flow Control. The Critical Flow Venturi--Electronic 
Flow Control--Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-EFC-CVS) system is identical 
to the CFV-CVS system described in paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) of this 
section, except that it maintains proportional sampling for methanol and 
formaldehyde by measuring the CVS flow rate, and electronically 
controlling sample flow rates. It is recommended that sample volumes be 
measured by separate flow meters. For methanol-fueled motorcycles, the 
samples lines for the methanol and formaldehyde samples are heated to 
prevent condensation. The temperature of the sample lines shall be more 
than 20  deg.F (11  deg.C) above

[[Page 636]]

the maximum dew point of the sample, but below 121  deg.C (250  deg.F).
    (6) Other systems. Other sampling systems may be used if shown to 
yield equivalent results, and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator (e.g., a heat exchanger with the CFV-CVS or an electronic 
flow integrator without a heat exchanger, with the PDP-CVS).
    (b) Component description, PDP-CVS. The PDP-CVS, Figure F90-1, 
consists of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, heat exchanger, 
positive displacement pump, sampling systems including, probes and 
sampling lines which, in the case of the methanol-fueled motorcycles, 
are heated to prevent condensation (heating of the sample lines may be 
omitted, provided the methanol and formaldehyde sample collection 
systems are close coupled to the probes thereby preventing loss of 
sample due to cooling and resulting condensation in the sample lines), 
and associated valves, pressure and temperature sensors. The PDP-CVS 
shall conform to the following requirements:
    (1) Static pressure variations at the tailpipe(s) of the vehicle 
shall remain within <plus-minus>1.25 kPa (<plus-minus>5.02 in 
H<INF>2</INF>O) of the static pressure variations measured during a 
dynamometer driving cycle with no connection to the tailpipe(s). 
(Sampling systems capable of maintaining the static pressure to within 
<plus-minus>0.25 kPa (<plus-minus>1.00 in. H<INF>2</INF>O) will be used 
by the Administrator if a written request substantiates the need for 
this closer tolerance.)
    (2) The gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately 
ahead of the positive displacement pump, shall be within <plus-minus>5 
deg.C (9  deg.F) of the designed operating temperature at the start of 
the test. The gas mixture temperature variation from its value at the 
start of the test shall be limited to <plus-minus>5  deg.C (9  deg.F) 
during the entire test. The temperature measuring system shall have an 
accuracy and precision of <plus-minus>1  deg.C (1.8  deg.F).
    (3) The pressure gauges shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>0.4 kPa (<plus-minus>3 mm Hg).
    (4) The location of the dilution air inlet shall be placed so as to 
use test-cell air for dilution and the flow capacity of the CVS shall be 
large enough to completely eliminate water condensation in the dilution 
and sampling systems. Control of water condensation with methanol-fueled 
vehicles is critical. Additional care may also be required to eliminate 
water condensation when testing natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas-
fueled vehicles. (Procedures for determining CVS flow rates are detailed 
in ``Calculation of Emissions and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative 
Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-83-009.) Dehumidifying the dilution air before 
entering the CVS is allowed. Heating the dilution air is also allowed, 
provided:
    (i) The air (or air plus exhaust gas) temperature does not exceed 
121  deg.C (250  deg.F).
    (ii) Calculation of the CVS flow rate necessary to prevent water 
condensation is based on the lowest temperature encountered in the CVS 
prior to sampling. (It is recommended that the CVS system be insulated 
when heated dilution air is used.)
    (iii) The dilution ratio is sufficiently high to prevent 
condensation in bag samples as they cool to room temperature.
    (5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples 
(hydrocarbons and carbon monoide) shall be of sufficient size so as not 
to impede sample flow. A single dilution air sample, covering the total 
test period, may be collected for the determination of methanol and 
formaldehyde background (methanol-fueled motorcycles).
    (6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde 
sample collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to 
collect samples of adequate size for analysis without significant impact 
on the volume of dilute exhaust passing through the PDP. The systems 
shall also comply with the following requirements that apply to the 
design of the systems, not to individual tests:
    (i) The methanol system shall be designed such that if a test 
motorcycle continuously emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol 
(based on all applicable standards) the measured concentration in the 
primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a concentration equal to 
25 times the limit of detection for the GC analyzer.

[[Page 637]]

    (ii) The formaldehyde system shall be designed such that if a test 
motorcycle continuously emitted formaldehyde at a rate equal to twenty 
percent of the maximum allowable level of THCE (i.e., 1.0 g/km for a 5.0 
g/km standard), or the maximum formaldehyde level allowed by a specific 
formaldehyde standard, whichever is less, the concentration of 
formaldehyde in the DNPH solution of the primary impinger, or solution 
resulting from the extraction of the DNPH cartridge, shall exceed either 
2.5 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for 
the HPLC analyzer.
    (iii) The methanol and formaldehyde systems shall be designed such 
that the primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in 
the samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary 
impinger. This requirement does not apply to dilution air samples, since 
they do not require secondary impingers, or to samples in which the 
concentrations approach the limit of detection.
    (c) Component description, CFV-CVS. The CFV-CVS sample system, 
Figure F90-2, consists of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, a 
cyclone particulate separator, unheated sampling venturies for the bag 
samples, and for the methanol and formaldehyde samples from methanol-
fueled vehicles, samples lines heated to prevent condensation for the 
methanol and formaldehyde samples from methanol fueled vehicles (heating 
of the sample lines may be omitted provided, the methanol and 
formaldehyde sample collection systems are close coupled to the probes 
thereby preventing loss of sample due to cooling and resulting 
condensation in the sample lines), a critical flow venturi, and assorted 
valves, and pressure and temperature sensors. The CFV sample system 
shall conform to the following requirements:
    (1) Static pressure variations at the tailpipe(s) of the vehicle 
shall remain within <plus-minus>1.25 kPa (5.02 in H<INF>2</INF>O) of the 
static pressure variations measured during a dynamometer driving cycle 
with no connection to the tailpipe(s). (Sampling systems capable of 
maintaining the static pressure to within <plus-minus>0.25 kPa (1.00 in 
H<INF>2</INF>O) will be used by the Administrator if a written request 
substantiates the need for this closer tolerance.)
    (2) The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus>1  deg.C (1.8  deg.F) and a response time of 
0.100 second to 62.5 percent of a temperature change (as measured in hot 
silicone oil).
    (3) The pressure measuring system shall have an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus>0.4 kPa (<plus-minus>3 mm Hg).
    (4) The location of the dilution air inlet shall be placed so as to 
use test-cell air for dilution and the flow capacity of the CVS shall be 
large enough to completely eliminate water condensation in the dilution 
and sampling systems. Control of water condensation with methanol-fueled 
vehicles is critical. Additional care may also be required to eliminate 
water condensation when testing natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas-
fueled vehicles. (Procedures for determining CVS flow rates are detailed 
in ``Calculation of Emissions and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative 
Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-83-009.) Dehumidifying the dilution air before 
entering the CVS is allowed. Heating the dilution air is also allowed, 
provided:
    (i) The air (or air plus exhaust gas) temperature does not exceed 
250  deg.F.
    (ii) Calculation of the CVS flow rate necessary to prevent water 
condensation is based on the lowest temperature encountered in the CVS 
prior to sampling. (It is recommended that the CVS system be insulated 
when heated dilution air is used.)
    (iii) The dilution ratio is sufficiently high to prevent 
condensation in bag samples as they cool to room temperature.
    (5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples 
(hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide) shall be of sufficient size so as not 
to impede sample flow. A single dilution air sample, covering the total 
test period, may be collected for the determination of methanol and 
formaldehyde background (methanol-fueled motorcycles).
    (6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde 
sample collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to 
collect samples of adequate size for analysis without

[[Page 638]]

significant impact on the volume of dilute exhaust passing through the 
CVS. The systems shall also comply with the following requirements that 
apply to the design of the systems, not to individual tests:
    (i) The methanol system shall be designed such that if a test 
motorcycle continuously emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol 
(based on all applicable standards) the measured concentration in the 
primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a concentration equal to 
25 times the limit of detection for the GC analyzer.
    (ii) The formaldehyde system shall be designed such that if a test 
motorcycle continuously emitted formaldehyde at a rate equal to twenty 
percent of the maximum allowable level of THCE (i.e., 1.0 g/km for a 5.0 
g/km standard), or the maximum formaldehyde level allowed by a specific 
formaldehyde standard, whichever is less, the concentration of 
formaldehyde in the DNPH solution of the primary impinger, or solution 
resulting from the extraction of the DNPH cartridge, shall exceed either 
2.5 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for 
the HPLC analyzer.
    (iii) The methanol and formaldehyde systems shall be designed such 
that the primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in 
the samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary 
impinger. This requirement does not apply to dilution air samples, since 
they do not require secondary impingers, or to samples in which the 
concentrations approach the limit of detection.
    (d) Component description, CFV-EFC-CVS. The CVS sample system is 
identical to the system described in paragraph (c) of this section, plus 
includes a means of electronically measuring the CVS flow rate, and 
electronic mass flow controllers for the methanol and formaldehyde 
sample lines, and separate flow meters to totalize sample flow volumes 
(optional). The EFC sample system shall conform to all of the 
requirements listed in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the 
methanol and formaldehyde samples mat both be drawn from a single static 
probe. It also must comply with the following additional requirements:
    (1) The ratio of the CVS flow rate to the sample flow rate shall not 
deviate from the ratio at the start of the test by more than 
<plus-minus>5 percent. (The volumetric sample flow rate shall be varied 
inversely with the square root of the bulk stream temperature.)
    (2) Flow totalizers for methanol and/or formaldehyde samples shall 
have an accuracy of <plus-minus>2 percent. Total sample volumes may be 
obtained from the flow controllers, with the advance approval of the 
administrator, provided that the controllers can be shown to have an 
accuracy of <plus-minus>2 percent.

Sec. 86.511-90  Exhaust gas analytical system.

    (a) Schematic drawings. Figure F90-3 is a schematic drawing of the 
exhaust gas analytical system for analysis of hydrocarbons (HC) 
(hydrocarbons plus methanol in the case of methanol-fueled motorcycles), 
carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>), and oxides of 
nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>). Since various configurations can produce 
accurate results, exact conformance with the drawing is not required. 
Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and 
switches may be used to provide additional information and coordinate 
the functions of the component systems

    (b) Major component description. The exhaust gas analytical system 
for HC, CO and CO<INF>2</INF>, Figure F90-3, consists of a flame 
ionization detector (FID) (heated (235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.C 
(113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C)) for methanol-fueled vehicles) for the 
determination of hydrocarbons, nondispersive infrared analyzers (NDIR) 
for the determination of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and, if 
oxides of nitrogen are measured, a chemiluminescence analyzer (CL) for 
the determination of oxides of nitrogen. The analytical system for 
methanol consists of a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame 
ionization detector. The analysis for formaldehyde is performed using 
high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of 2,4-

[[Page 640]]

dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatives using ultraviolet (UV) 
detection. The exhaust gas analytical system shall conform to the 
following requirements:
    (1) The CL requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in the sample 
be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of analyzers 
may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (2) The carbon monoxide (CO) NDIR analyzer may require a sample 
conditioning column containing CaSO<INF>4</INF>, or indicating silica 
gel to remove water vapor and containing ascarite to remove carbon 
dioxide from the CO analysis stream.
    (i) If CO instruments which are essentially free of CO<INF>2</INF> 
and water vapor interference are used, the use of the conditioning 
column may be deleted, see Secs. 86.522 and 86.544.
    (ii) A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of 
CO<INF>2</INF> and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture 
of 3 percent CO<INF>2</INF> in N<INF>2</INF> which has been bubbled 
through water at room temperature produces an equivalent CO response, as 
measured on the most sensitive CO range, which is less than 1 percent of 
full scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or less 
than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale; see Sec. 86.522.
    (c) Other analyzers and equipment. Other types of analyzers and 
equipment may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.

to meet the requirements of Sec. 86.537 is defined by upper and lower 
limits. The upper limit is 3.2 km/h (2 mph) higher than the highest 
point on the trace within 1 second of the given time. The lower limit is 
3.2 km/h (2 mph) lower than the lowest point on the trace within 1 
second of the given time. Speed variations greater than the tolerances 
(such as may occur during gear changes) are acceptable provided they 
occur for less than 2 seconds on any occasion. Speeds lower than those 
prescribed are acceptable provided the vehicle is operated at maximum 
available power during such occurrences. When conducted to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 86.532 the speed tolerance shall be as specified 
above, except that the upper and lower limits shall be 6.4 km/h (4 mph).

Sec. 86.518-78  Dynamometer calibration.

    (a) The dynamometer shall be calibrated at least once each month or 
performance verified at least once each week and then calibrated as 
required. The dynamometer is driven above the test speed range. The 
device used to drive the dynamometer is then disengaged from the 
dynamometer and the roll is allowed to coast down. The kinetic energy of 
the system is dissipated by the dynamometer. This method neglects the 
variations in roll bearing friction due to the drive axle weight of the 
vehicle.
    (b) Calibration shall consist of coasting down the dynamometer for 
each inertia load combination used. Coastdown times for the interval 
from 70 to 60 km/h shall be within the tolerances specified in 
Sec. 86.529. The dynamometer adjustments necessary to produce these 
results shall be noted for future reference.
    (c) The performance check consists of conducting a dynamometer 
coastdown at one or more inertia-horsepower settings and comparing the 
coastdown time to the table in Figure F98-9 of Sec. 86.529-98. If the 
coastdown time is outside the tolerance, a new calibration is required.

Sec. 86.519-78  Constant volume sampler calibration.

    The CVS (Constant Volume Sampler) is calibrated using an accurate 
flowmeter and restrictor valve. Measurements of various parameters are 
made and related to flow through the unit. Procedures used by EPA for 
both PDP (Positive Displacement Pump) and CFV (Critical Flow Venturi) 
are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be 
used if approved in advance by the Administrator. After the calibration 
curve has been obtained, verification of the entire system can be 
performed by injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing 
the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. An indicated 
error does not necessarily mean that the calibration is wrong, since 
other factors can influence the accuracy of the system, e.g. analyzer 
calibration. A verification procedure is found in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (a) PDP calibration. (1) The following calibration procedure 
outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various 
parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the 
constant volume sampler pump. All the parameters related to the pump are 
simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which 
is connected in series with the pump. The calculated flow rate (at pump 
inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a 
correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of 
pump parameters. The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the 
correlation function is then determined. In the event that a CVS has a 
multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range used must be 
performed.
    (2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the 
absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the 
flow rate at each point. Three conditions must be

[[Page 647]]

maintained to assure the accuracy and integrity of the calibration 
curve. First, the pump pressures should be measured at taps on the pump 
rather than at the external piping on the pump inlet and outlet. 
Pressure taps that are mounted at the top center and bottom center of 
the pump drive headplate are exposed to the actual pump cavity 
pressures, and therefore reflect the absolute pressure differentials. 
Secondly, temperature stability must be maintained during the 
calibration. The laminar flowmeter is sensitive to inlet temperature 
oscillations which cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual 
changes (<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1  deg.C (1.8  deg.F)) in temperature are 
acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes. 
Finally, all connections between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be 
absolutely void of any leakage.
    (3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same 
pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the 
calibration equation.
    (4) Connect a system as shown in Figure F78-5. Although particular 
types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent 
results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the 
system indicated, the following data with given accuracy are required:

    (5) After the system has been connected as shown in Figure F78-5, 
set the variable restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS 
pump for twenty minutes. Record the calibration data.
    (6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an 
increment of pump inlet depression (about 1.0 kPa (4" H<INF>2</INF>O)) 
that will yield a minimum of six data points for the total calibration. 
Allow the system to stabilize for 3 minutes and repeat the data 
acquisition.
    (7) Data analysis: (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s</INF>, at each 
test point is calculated from the flowmeter data using the 
manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, 
V<INF>o</INF>, per revolution at absolute pump inlet temperature and 
pressure.

V<INF>o</INF> = (Q<INF>s</INF>/n)  x  (T<INF>p</INF>/293.15)  x  
(101.325/P<INF>p</INF>)

where:
V<INF>o</INF> = Pump flow, m \3\/revolution (ft \3\/revolution) at 
T<INF>p</INF>, P<INF>p
</INF>Q<INF>s</INF> = Meter air flow rate in standard cubic metres per 
minute, standard conditions are 20  deg.C, 101.325 kPa (68  deg.F, 29.92 
in. Hg).
n = Pump speed in revolutions per minute.
T<INF>p</INF> = Pump inlet temperature, K(R) = PTI + 273.15 for English 
units, T<INF>p</INF> = PTI + 459.67
P<INF>p</INF> = Absolute pump inlet pressure, kPa (in. Hg) = 
P<INF>B</INF>-PPI for English units, P<INF>p</INF> = P<INF>B</INF>-PPI 
(SP. GR./13.57)
where:
P<INF>B</INF> = barometric pressure, kPa (in. Hg)
PPI = Pump inlet depression, kPa (in. fluid)
SP. GR. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid relative to water.

    (iii) The correlation function at each test point is then calculated 
from the calibration data:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.103

where:
X<INF>o</INF> = correlation function.
P<INF>p</INF> = The pressure differential from pump inlet to pump 
outlet, kPa (in. Hg) = P<INF>e</INF>-P<INF>p

[[Page 649]]

</INF>P<INF>e</INF> = Absolute pump outlet pressure, kPa (in. Hg) = 
P<INF>B</INF> + PPO for English units, P<INF>e</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> + 
PPO(SP. GR./13.57)

where:
PPO = Pressure head at pump outlet, kPa (in. fluid)

    (iv) A linear least squares fit is performed to generate the 
calibration equations which have the forms:

V<INF>o</INF> = D<INF>o</INF>-M(X<INF>o</INF>)
n = A-B(P<INF>p</INF>)

D<INF>o</INF>, M, A, and B are the slope-intercept constants describing 
the lines.

    (8) A CVS system that has multiple speeds shall be calibrated on 
each speed used. The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be 
approximately parallel and the intercept values, D<INF>Q</INF>, will 
increase as the pump flow range decreases.
    (9) If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated 
values from the equation will be within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.50 
percent of the measured value of V<INF>O</INF>. Values of M will vary 
from one pump to another, but values of D<INF>O</INF> for pumps of the 
same make, model, and range should agree within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3 
percent of each other. Particulate influx from use will cause the pump 
slip to decrease as reflected by lower values for M. Calibrations should 
be performed at pump startup and after major maintenance to assure the 
stability of the pump slip rate. Analysis of mass injection data will 
also reflect pump slip stability.
    (b) CFV calibration. (1) Calibration of the Critical Flow Venturi 
(CFV) is based upon the flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow 
is a function of inlet pressure and temperature:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.104

where:
Q<INF>s</INF> = Flow
K<INF>v</INF> = Calibration coefficient
P = Absolute pressure
T = Absolute temperature


The calibration procedure described below establishes the value of the 
calibration coefficient at measured values of pressure, temperature and 
air flow.
    (2) The manufacturer's recommended procedure shall be followed for 
calibrating electronic portions of the CFV.
    (3) Measurements necessary for flow calibration are as follows:

    (4) Set up equipment as shown in Figure F78-6 and check for leaks. 
Any leaks between the flow measuring device and the critical flow 
venturi will seriously affect the accuracy of the calibration.
    (5) Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the 
blower and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all 
instruments.
    (6) Vary the flow restrictor and make at least 8 readings across the 
critical flow range of the venturi.
    (7) Data analysis. The data recorded during the calibration are to 
be used in the following calculations:

[[Page 651]]

    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s</INF>, at each test point is 
calculated from the flow meter data using the manufacturer's prescribed 
method.
    (ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test 
point:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.201

where:
Q<INF>s</INF> = Flow rate, standard conditions are 20  deg.C, 101.325 
kPa (68  deg.F, 29.92 in. Hg)
T<INF>v</INF> = Temperature at venturi inlet, K(R).
P<INF>v</INF> = Pressure at venturi inlet, kPa (mm Hg) = P<INF>B</INF> - 
PPI for English units P<INF>v</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> - PPI (SP. GR./
13.57).
where:
PPI = Venturi inlet pressure depression, kPa (in. fluid).
SP. GR. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid, relative to water.

    (iii) Plot K<INF>v</INF> as a function of venturi inlet depression. 
For sonic flow, K<INF>v</INF> will have a relatively constant value. As 
pressure decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and 
K<INF>v</INF> decreases (is no longer constant). See Figure F78-7.
    (iv) For a minimum of 8 points in the critical region calculate an 
average K<INF>v</INF> and the standard deviation.
    (v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average 
K<INF>v</INF> take corrective action.
    (c) CVS System Verification. The following ``gravimetric'' technique 
can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can 
accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. 
(Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using 
critical flow orifice devices.)
    (1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane 
or carbon monoxide gas (caution--carbon monoxide is poisonous).
    (2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.
    (3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of 
pure propane or carbon monoxide into the system during the sampling 
period (approximately 5 minutes).
    (4) The calculations of Sec. 86.544 are performed in the normal way 
except in the case of propane. The density of propane (0.6109 kg/m\3\ /
carbon atom (17.30 g/ft\3\ /carbon atom)) is used in place of the 
density of exhaust hydrocarbons. In the case of carbon monoxide, the 
density of 1.164 kg/m\3\ (32.97 g/ft\3\ ) is used.
    (5) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass 
and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent 
accuracy of the system.
    (6) The cause for any discrepancy greater than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 percent must be found and corrected.

Sec. 86.519-90  Constant volume sampler calibration.

    (a) The CVS (Constant Volume Sampler) is calibrated using an 
accurate flowmeter and restrictor valve. Measurements of various 
parameters are made and related to flow through the unit. Procedures 
used by EPA for both PDP (Positive Displacement Pump) and CFV (Critical 
Flow Venturi) are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent 
results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. After 
the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of the entire 
system can be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into the system 
and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true mass 
injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the 
calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of 
the system, e.g., analyzer calibration. A verification procedure is 
found in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) PDP calibration. (1) The following calibration procedures 
outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various 
parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the 
constant volume sampler pump. All the parameters related to the pump are 
simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which 
is connected in series with the pump. The calculated flow rate (at pump 
inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a 
correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of 
pump parameters. The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the 
correlation function is then determined. In the event that a

[[Page 652]]

CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range must be 
performed.
    (2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the 
absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the 
flow rate at each point. Three conditions must be maintained to assure 
the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve. First, the pump 
pressures should be measured at taps on the pump rather than at the 
external piping on the pump inlet and outlet. Pressure taps that are 
mounted at the top center and bottom center of the pump drive headplate 
are exposed to the actual pump cavity pressures, and therefore reflect 
the absolute pressure differentials. Secondly, temperature stability 
must be maintained during the calibration. The laminar flowmeter is 
sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations which cause the data points 
to be scattered. Gradual changes (<plus-minus>1  deg.C (<plus-minus>1.8 
deg.F)) in temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a 
period of several minutes. Finally, all connections between the 
flowmeter and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of any leakage.
    (3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same 
pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the 
calibration equation.
    (4) Connect a system as shown in Figure F78-5. Although particular 
types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent 
results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the 
system indicated, the following data with given accuracy are required:

    (5) After the system has been connected as shown in Figure F78-6, 
set the variable restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS 
pump for twenty minutes. Record the calibration data.
    (6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an 
increment of pump inlet depression (about 1.0 kPa (4 in. 
H<INF>2</INF>O)) that will yield a minimum of six data points for the 
total calibration. Allow the system to stabilize for 3 minutes and 
repeat the data acquisition.
    (7) Data analysis:
    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s</INF>, at each test point is 
calculated from the flowmeter data using the manufacturers' prescribed 
method.
    (ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, V<INF>o</INF> 
in m\3\ per revolution at absolute pump inlet temperature and pressure.
    V<INF>o</INF> = (Q<INF>s</INF>/n)  x  (T<INF>p</INF>/293)  x  
(101.3/P<INF>p</INF>)

Where:
    (A) V<INF>o</INF> = Pump flow, m\3\/rev (ft\3\/rev) at 
T<INF>p</INF>, P<INF>p</INF>.
    (B) Q<INF>s</INF> = Meter air flow rate in standard cubic meters per 
minute; standard conditions are 20  deg.C, 101.3 kPa (68  deg.F, 29.92 
in. Hg).
    (C) n = Pump speed in revolutions per minute.
    (D)(1) T<INF>p</INF> = Pump inlet temperature, ( deg.K) = PTI + 273.
    (2) For English units, T<INF>p</INF> = PTI + 460.
    (E)(1) P<INF>p</INF> = Absolute pump inlet pressure, kPa (in. Hg) = 
P<INF>B</INF> - PPI.
    (2) For English units, P<INF>p</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> - PPI(SP.GR./
13.57).

Where:

[[Page 653]]

    (F) P<INF>B</INF> = barometric pressure, kPa (in. Hg.).
    (G) PPI = Pump inlet depression, kPa (in. fluid).
    (H) SP.GR. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid relative to water.
    (iii) The correlation function at each test point is then calculated 
from the calibration data:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.105


Where:
    (A) X<INF>o</INF> = correlation function.
    (B) <greek-D> P<INF>p</INF> = The pressure differential from pump 
inlet to pump outlet, kPa (in. Hg) = P<INF>e</INF> - P<INF>p</INF>.
    (C)(1) P<INF>e</INF> = Absolute pump outlet pressure, kPa (in. Hg) = 
P<INF>B</INF> + PPO.
    (2) For English units, P<INF>e</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> + PPO(SP.GR./
13.57).

Where:
    (D) PPO = Pressure head at pump outlet, kPa (in. fluid).
    (iv) A linear least squares fit is performed to generate the 
calibration equations which have the forms:
    V<INF>o</INF> = D<INF>o</INF> - M(X<INF>o</INF>)
    n = A - B(<greek-D> P<INF>p</INF>)
    D<INF>0</INF>' M, A, and B are the slope-intercept constants, 
describing the lines.
    (8) A CVS system that has multiple speeds shall be calibrated on 
each speed used. The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be 
approximately parallel and the intercept values, D<INF>0</INF>' will 
increase as the pump flow range decreases.
    (9) If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated 
values from the equation will be within <plus-minus>0.50 percent of the 
measured value of V<INF>o</INF>. Values of M will vary from one pump to 
another, but values of D<INF>o</INF> for pumps of the same make, model, 
and range should agree within <plus-minus>3 percent of each other. 
Particulate influx from use will cause the pump slip to decrease as 
reflected by lower values for M. Calibrations should be performed at 
pump startup and after major maintenance to assure the stability of the 
pump slip rate. Analysis of mass injection data will also reflect pump 
slip stability.
    (c) CFV calibration. (1) Calibration of the Critical Flow Venturi 
(CFV) is based upon the flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow 
is a function of inlet pressure and temperature:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.106


Where:
    (i) Q<INF>s</INF> = Flow.
    (ii) K<INF>v</INF> = Calibration coefficient.
    (iii) P = Absolute pressure.
    (iv) T = Absolute temperature.
    The calibration procedure described below establishes the value of 
the calibration coefficient at the measured values of pressure, 
temperature and air flow.
    (2) The manufacturer's recommended procedure shall be followed for 
calibrating electronic portions of the CFV.
    (3) Measurements necessary for flow calibration are as follows:

    (4) Set up equipment as shown in Figure F78-6 and check for leaks. 
Any leaks between the flow measuring device and the critical flow 
venturi will seriously affect the accuracy of the calibration.
    (5) Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the 
blower and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all 
instruments.

[[Page 654]]

    (6) Vary the flow restrictor and make at least 8 readings across the 
critical flow range of the venturi.
    (7) Data analysis. The data recorded during the calibration are to 
be used in the following calculations:
    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s</INF>, at each test point is 
calculated from the flowmeter data using the manufacturer's prescribed 
method.
    (ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test 
point:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.107


Where:
    (A) Q<INF>s</INF> = Flow rate in m\3\/minute, standard conditions 
are 20  deg.C, 101.3 kPa (68  deg.F, 29.92 in. Hg)
    (B) T<INF>v</INF> = Temperature at venturi inlet,  deg.K( deg.R).
    (C)(1) P<INF>v</INF> = Pressure at venturi inlet, kPa (mm Hg) = 
P<INF>B</INF>-PPI.
    (2) For English units, P<INF>v</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> - PPI (SP.GR./
13.57).

Where:
    (D) PPI = Venturi inlet pressure depression, kPa (in. fluid).
    (E) SP.GR.=Specific gravity of manometer fluid, relative to water.
    (iii) Plot K<INF>v</INF> as a function of venturi inlet depression. 
For sonic flow, K<INF>v</INF> will have a relatively constant value. As 
pressure decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and 
K<INF>v</INF> decreases (is no longer constant). See Figure F78-7.
    (iv) For a minimum of 8 points in the critical region, calculate an 
average K<INF>v</INF> and the standard deviation.
    (v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average 
K<INF>v</INF>, take corrective action.
    (d) CVS system verification. The following ``gravimetric'' technique 
can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can 
accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. 
If the CVS and analytical system will be used only in the testing of 
gasoline-fueled vehicles, the system verification may be performed using 
either propane or carbon monoxide. If the CVS and analytical system will 
be used with methanol-fueled vehicles as well as gasoline-fueled 
vehicles, system verification performance check must include a methanol 
check in addition to either the propane or carbon monoxide check. 
(Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using 
critical flow orifice devices.)
    (1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane 
or carbon monoxide gas (CAUTION--carbon monoxide is poisonous).
    (2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.
    (3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of 
pure propane or carbon monoxide into the system during the sampling 
period (approximately 5 minutes).
    (4) Following completion of step (3) above (if methanol injection is 
required), continue to operate the CVS in the normal manner and release 
a known quantity of pure methanol (in gaseous form) into the system 
during the sampling period (approximately 5 minutes). This step does not 
need to be performed with each verification, provided that it is 
performed at least twice annually.
    (5) The calculations of Sec. 86.544 are performed in the normal way 
except in the case of propane. The density of propane (0.6109 kg/m\3\/
carbon atom (17.30 g/ft\3\/carbon atom)) is used in place of the density 
of exhaust hydrocarbons. In the case of carbon monoxide, the density of 
1.164 kg/m\3\ (32.97 g/ft\3\) is used. In the case of methanol, the 
density of 1.332 kg/m\3\ (37.71 g/ft\3\) is used.
    (6) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass 
and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent 
accuracy of the system.
    (7) The cause for any discrepancy greater than <plus-minus>2 percent 
must be found and corrected. The Administrator, upon request, may waive 
the requirement to comply with <plus-minus>2 percent methanol recovery 
tolerance, and instead require compliance with a higher tolerance (not 
to exceed <plus-minus>6 percent), provided that:
    (i) The Administrator determines that compliance with the specified 
tolerance is not practically feasible; and
    (ii) The manufacturer makes information available to the 
Administrator which indicates that the calibration tests and their 
results are consistent

[[Page 655]]

with good laboratory practice, and that the results are consistent with 
the results of calibration testing conducted by the Administrator.

Sec. 86.521-90  Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.

    (a) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall receive the following initial 
and periodic calibration. The HFID used with methanol-fueled vehicles 
shall be operated at 235  deg.F<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 
deg.C<plus-minus>8  deg.C).
    (b) Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to 
its introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, the FID 
hydrocarbon analyzer shall be adjusted for optimum hydrocarbon response. 
Analyzers used with petroleum fuels and liquefied petroleum gas-fuel 
shall be optimized using propane. Analyzers used with natural gas-fuel 
for measurement of hydrocarbons shall be optimized using methane. If a 
single analyzer is used for all measurements, it shall be optimized 
using propane and its response factor for methane shall be determined 
and accounted for in measurements of total hydrocarbons from natural 
gas-fuel. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions or good engineering 
practice for instrument startup and basic operating adjustment using the 
appropriate FID fuel and zero-grade air.
    (2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce into the 
analyzer a propane (methane as appropriate) in air mixture (methanol in 
air mixture for methanol-fueled vehicles when optional methanol 
calibrated FID procedure is used during the 1990 through 1994 model 
year) with a propane (or methane or methanol as appropriate) 
concentration equal to approximately 90 percent of the most common 
operating range.
    (3) Select an operating FID fuel flow rate that will give near 
maximum response and least variation in response with minor fuel flow 
variations.
    (4) To determine the optimum air flow, use the FID fuel flow setting 
determined above and vary air flow.
    (5) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, record them 
for future reference.
    (c) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter the FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be 
calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges, and, if applicable, 
the methanol response factor shall be determined (paragraph (d) of this 
section). Use the same flow rate as when analyzing sample.
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero grade air.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with propane in 
air (or methanol or methane in air as appropriate) calibration gases 
having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 percent of 
that range. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least 
squares best-fit straight line is two percent or less of the value at 
each data point, concentration values may be calculated by use of a 
single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two 
percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents 
the data to within two percent of each test point shall be used to 
determine concentration.
    (d) FID response factor to methanol. When the FID analyzer is to be 
used for the analysis of hydrocarbon samples containing methanol, the 
methanol response factor of the analyzer shall be established. The 
methanol response factor shall be determined at several concentrations 
in the range of concentrations in the exhaust sample, using either bag 
samples or gas bottles meeting the requirements of Sec. 86.514.
    (1) The bag sample, if used, of methanol for analysis in the FID 
shall be prepared using the apparatus shown in Figure F90-4. A known 
volume of methanol is injected, using a microliter syringe, into the 
heated mixing zone (250  deg.F (121  deg.C)) of the apparatus. The 
methanol is vaporized and swept into the sample bag with a known volume 
of zero grade air measured by a gas flow meter meeting the performance 
requirements of Sec. 86.120.

[[Page 656]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.180

    (2) The bag sample is analyzed using the FID.
    (3) The FID response factor, r, is calculated as follows:
    r = FID<INF>ppm</INF>/SAM<INF>ppm</INF>

Where:
    (i) r = FID response factor.

[[Page 657]]

    (ii) FID<INF>ppm</INF> = FID reading, ppmC.
    (iii) SAMppm=methanol concentration in the sample bag, or gas 
bottle, in ppmC. SAMppm for sample bags:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.108

Where:
    (iv) 0.02406 = Volume of one mole at 101.3 kPa (29.92 in. Hg) and 20 
 deg.C (68  deg.F), m\3\.
    (v) Fuel injected = Volume of methanol injected, ml.
    (vi) Fuel Density = Density of methanol, 0.7914 g/ml
    (vii) Air volume = Volume of zero grade air, m\3\
    (viii) Mol. Wt. CH<INF>3</INF>OH = 32.04
    (e) FID response factor to methane. When the FID analyzer is to be 
used for the analysis of natural gas-fueled motorcycle hydrocarbon 
samples, the methane response factor of the analyzer shall be 
established. To determine the total hydrocarbon FID response to methane, 
known methane in air concentrations traceable to National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) shall be analyzed by the FID. Several 
methane concentrations shall be analyzed by the FID in the range of 
concentrations in the exhaust sample. The total hydrocarbon FID response 
to methane is calculated as follows:
r<INF>CH4</INF> = FIDppm/SAMppm

Where:
(1) r<INF>CH4</INF> = FID response factor to methane.
(2) FIDppm = FID reading in ppmC.
(3) SAMppm = the known methane concentration in ppmC.

Sec. 86.522-78  Carbon monoxide analyzer calibration.

    (a) Initial and periodic interference check. Prior to its 
introduction into service and annually thereafter the NDIR carbon 
monoxide analyzer shall be checked for response to water vapor and 
CO<INF>2:
    </INF>(1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument 
startup and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance on 
the most sensitive range.
    (2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either zero grade air or 
zero grade nitrogen.
    (3) Bubble a mixture of 3 percent CO<INF>2</INF> in N<INF>2</INF> 
through water at room temperature and record analyzer response.
    (4) An analyzer response of more than 1 percent of full scale for 
ranges above 300 ppm full scale or of more than 3 ppm on ranges below 
300 ppm full scale will require corrective action. (Use of conditioning 
columns is one form of corrective action which may be taken.)
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer shall 
be calibrated.
    (1) Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either zero grade air or 
zero grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with carbon 
monoxide in N<INF>2</INF> calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of that range. 
Additional calibration points may be generated. For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is 2 percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration 
values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that 
range. If the deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, the best-fit 
non-linear equation which represents the data to within 2 percent of 
each test point shall be used to determine concentration.


<R05>
Sec. 86.523-78  Oxides of nitrogen analyzer calibration.

    (a) Prior to introduction into service and at least monthly 
thereafter, if oxides of nitrogen are measured, the chemiluminescent 
oxides of nitrogen analyzer must be checked for NO<INF>2</INF> to NO 
converter efficiency. Figure F78-8 is a reference for paragraphs (a) (1) 
through (11) of this section.

[[Page 658]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.181

    (1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup 
and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero grade air or zero 
grade nitrogen.
    (3) Connect the outlet of the NO<INF>X</INF> generator to the sample 
inlet of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer which has been set to the most 
common operating range.
    (4) Introduce into the NO<INF>X</INF> generator analyzer-system a NO 
in nitrogen (N<INF>2</INF>) mixture with a NO concentration equal to 
approximately 80 percent of the most common operating range. The 
NO<INF>2</INF> content of the gas mixture shall be less than 5 percent 
of the NO concentration.
    (5) With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO mode, record the 
concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.
    (6) Turn on the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O<INF>2</INF> (or air) 
supply and adjust the O<INF>2</INF> (or air) flow rate so that the NO 
indicated by the analyzer is about 10 percent less than indicated in 
step 5. Record the concentration of NO in this NO+O<INF>2</INF> mixture.
    (7) Switch the NO<INF>X</INF> generator to the generation mode and 
adjust the generation rate so that the NO measured on

[[Page 659]]

the analyzer is 20 percent of that measured in step 5. There must be at 
least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record the concentration of 
residual NO.
    (8) Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
mode and measure total NO<INF>X</INF>. Record this value.
    (9) Switch off the NO<INF>X</INF> generation but maintain gas flow 
through the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the 
NO<INF>X</INF> in the NO+O<INF>2</INF> mixture. Record this value.
    (10) Turn off the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O<INF>2</INF> (or air) 
supply. The analyzer will now indicate the NO<INF>X</INF> in the 
original NO in N<INF>2</INF> mixture. This value should be no more than 
5 percent above the value indicated in step 4.
    (11) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<INF>X</INF> converter by 
substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:
Percent Efficiency = [1 + (a-b)/(c-d)]x100

where:
a = concentration obtained in step (8).
b = concentration obtained in step (9).
c = concentration obtained in step (6).
d = concentration obtained in step (7).


If converter efficiency is not greater than 90 percent corrective action 
will be required.
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter, if oxides of nitrogen are measured, the 
chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer shall be calibrated on all 
normally used instrument ranges. Use the same flow rate as when 
analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero grade air or zero 
grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with NO in 
N<INF>2</INF> calibration gases with nominal concentrations of 50 and 
100 percent of that range. Additional calibration points may be 
generated.
    (c) When testing methanol-fueled motorcycles, it may be necessary to 
clean the analyzer frequently to prevent interference with 
NO<INF>X</INF> measurements (see EPA/600/S3-88/040).

Sec. 86.524-78  Carbon dioxide analyzer calibration.

    (a) Prior to its introduction into service and monthly thereafter

    (1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup 
and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the carbon dioxide analyzer with either zero grade air or 
zero grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with carbon 
dioxide in N<INF>2</INF> calibration gases with nominal concentrations 
of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of that range. Additional 
calibration points may be generated. For each range calibrated, if the 
deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 percent or 
less of the value at each data point, concentration values may be 
calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the 
deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear

Sec. 86.527-90  Test procedures, overview.

    (a) The procedures described in this and subsequent sections are 
used to determine the conformity of motorcycles with the standards set 
forth in subpart E of this part.

[[Page 660]]

    (b) The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling, 
parking, and operating conditions.
    (c) The exhaust emission test is designed to determine hydrocarbon 
(gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled 
motorcycles), methanol, formaldehyde, and hydrocarbon (methanol-fueled 
motorcycles), carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen mass emissions 
while simulating an average trip in an urban area. The test consists of 
engine startups and motorcycle operation on a chassis dynamometer, 
through a specified driving schedule. A proportional part of the diluted 
exhaust emissions is collected continuously for subsequent analysis, 
using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler.
    (d) Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all 
emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new 
motorcycle shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. 
Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be 
authorized in accordance with subpart E of this part.
    (e) Background concentrations are measured for all species for which 
emissions measurements are made. For exhaust testing, this requires 
sampling and analysis of the dilution air. (When testing methanol-fueled 
motorcycles, manufacturers may choose not to measure background 
concentrations of methanol and/or formaldehyde, and then assume that the 
concentrations are zero during calculations.)

Sec. 86.528-78  Transmissions.

    (a) Vehicles equipped with transfer cases, multiple sprockets, etc., 
shall be tested in the manufacturer's recommended configuration for 
street or highway use. If more than one configuration is recommended or 
if the recommendation is deemed unreasonable by the Administrator, the 
Administrator will specify the test configuration.
    (b) All tests shall be conducted with automatic transmissions in 
``Drive'' (highest gear). Automatic clutch-torque converter 
transmissions may be shifted as manual transmissions at the option of 
the manufacturer.
    (c) Idle modes shall be run with automatic transmissions in 
``Drive'' and the wheels braked, manual transmission shall be in gear 
with the clutch disengaged; except first idle, see Secs. 86.536 and 
86.537.
    (d) The vehicle shall be driven with minimum throttle movement to 
maintain the desired speed. No simultaneous use of brake and throttle 
shall be permitted.
    (e) Acceleration modes shall be driven smoothly. Automatic 
transmissions shall shift automatically through the normal sequence of 
gears; manual transmissions shall be shifted as recommended by the 
manufacturer to the ultimate purchaser (unless determined to be 
unreasonable by the Administrator) with the operator closing the 
throttle during each shift and accomplishing the shift with minimum 
time. If the vehicle cannot accelerate at the specified rate, the 
vehicle shall be operated with the throttle fully opened until the 
vehicle speed reaches the value prescribed for that time in the driving 
schedule.
    (f) The deceleration modes shall be run in gear using brakes or 
throttle as necessary to maintain the desired speed. Manual transmission 
vehicles shall be downshifted using the same shift points as when 
upshifting or as recommended by the manufacturer in the vehicle owner's 
manual. All downshifts shall be made smoothly, disengaging the clutch 
while shifting and engaging the clutch once the lower gear has been 
selected. For those modes which require the vehicle to decelerate to 
zero, manual transmission clutches shall be disengaged when the speed 
drops below 15 km/h (9.3 mph) for vehicles with engine displacements 
equal to or greater than 280 cc (17.1 cu. in.), when the speed drops 
below 10 km/h (6.2 mph) for vehicles with engine displacements less than 
280 cc (17.1 cu. in.), when engine roughness is evident, or when engine 
stalling is imminent.
    (g) If downshifting during deceleration is not permitted in the 
vehicle owner's manual, manual transmissions will be downshifted at the 
beginning of or during a power mode if recommended by the manufacturer 
or if

[[Page 661]]

the engine obviously is lugging. For those modes which require these 
vehicles to decelerate to zero, manual transmission clutches shall be 
disengaged when the speed drops below 25 km/h (15.5 mph) for vehicles 
with engine displacement equal to or greater than 280 cc (17.1 cu. in.), 
when the speed drops below 20 km/h (12.4 mph) for vehicles with engine 
displacements less than 280 cc (17.1 cu. in.), when engine roughness is 
evident, or when engine stalling is imminent. While the clutch is 
disengaged and during these deceleration modes, the vehicle shall be 
shifted to the appropriate gear for starting the next mode.
    (h) If shift speeds are not recommended by the manufacturer, manual 
transmission vehicles shall be shifted as follows:
    (1) For Class I and II motorcycles:

    (c) The dynamometer shall be adjusted to reproduce the specified 
road load as determined by the most recent calibration. Alternatively, 
the actual vehicle road load can be measured and duplicated:
    (1) Make at least 5 replicate coastdowns in each direction from 70 
to 60 km/h on a smooth, level, track under balanced wind conditions. The 
driver must have a mass of 80<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 kg and be in the 
normal driving position. Record the coastdown time.
    (2) Average the coastdown times. Adjust the dynamometer load so that 
the coastdown time is duplicated with the vehicle and driver on the 
dynamom-eter.
    (3) Alternate procedures may be used if approved in advance by the 
Administrator.

Sec. 86.529-98  Road load force and inertia weight determination.

    (a)(1) Road load as a function of speed is given by the following 
equation:

F = A + CV<SUP>2</SUP>

    (2) The values for coefficients A and C and the test inertia are 
given in Figure F98-9 of this section. Velocity V is in km/h and force 
(F) is in newtons. The forces given by the equation in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section shall be simulated to the best ability of the equipment 
being used.
    (b) The inertia given in Figure F98-9 shall be used. Motorcycles 
with loaded

    (c) The dynamometer shall be adjusted to reproduce the specified 
road load as determined by the most recent calibration. Alternatively, 
the actual vehicle road load can be measured and duplicated:
    (1) Make at least 5 replicate coastdowns in each direction from 70 
to 60 km/h on a smooth, level track under balanced wind conditions. The 
driver must have a mass of 80 <plus-minus>10 kg and be in the normal 
driving position. Record the coastdown time.
    (2) Average the coastdown times. Adjust the dynamometer load so that

<R05>
Sec. 86.535-90  Dynamometer procedure.

    (a) The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ``cold'' start test 
and a ``hot'' start test following the ``cold'' start by 10 minutes. 
Engine startup (with all accessories turned off), operation over the 
driving schedule, and engine shutdown make a complete cold start test. 
Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds of the driving 
schedule complete the hot start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted 
with ambient air and a continuously proportional sample is collected for 
analysis during each phase. The composite samples collected in bags are 
analyzed for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and, 
optionally, for oxides of nitrogen. A parallel sample of the dilution 
air is similarly analyzed for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon 
dioxide, and, optionally, for oxides of nitrogen. Methanol and 
formaldehyde samples (exhaust and dilution air) are collected and 
analyzed for methanol-fueled vehicles (a single dilution air 
formaldehyde sample covering the total time of the test may be collected 
in place of individual test phases).
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The vehicle speed, as measured from the dynamometer roll, shall 
be used. A speed vs. time recording, as evidence of dynamometer test 
validity, shall be supplied on request of the Administrator.
    (d) Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may be 
performed at test points, provided an emission sample is not taken, for 
the purpose of finding the minimum throttle action to maintain the 
proper speed-time relationship, or to permit sampling system 
adjustments.
    (e) The drive wheel tires must be inflated to the manufacturer's 
recommended pressure, <plus-minus>15 kPa (<plus-minus>2.2 psi). The 
drive wheel tire pressure shall be reported with the test results.
    (f) If the dynamometer has not been operated during the two-hour 
period immediately preceding the test, it shall be warmed up for 15 
minutes by operating at 50 km/h (31 mph) using a nontest vehicle, or as 
recommended by the dynamometer manufacturer.
    (g) If the dynamometer horsepower must be adjusted manually, it 
shall be set within one hour prior to the exhaust emissions test phase. 
The test vehicle shall not be used to make this adjustment. Dynamometers 
using automatic control of preselectable power settings may be set 
anytime prior to the beginning of the emissions test.
    (h) The driving distance, as measured by counting the number of 
dynamometer roll revolutions, shall be determined for the transient cold 
start, stabilized cold start, and transient hot start phases of the 
test.

<R05>
Sec. 86.536-78  Engine starting and restarting.

    (a)(1) The engine shall be started according to the manufacturer's 
recommended starting procedures. The initial 20 second idle period shall 
begin when the engine starts.
    (2) Choke operation. (i) Vehicles equipped with automatic chokes 
shall be operated according to the instructions in the manufacturer's 
operating instructions or owner's manual including choke setting and 
``kick-down'' from cold fast idle. The transmission shall be placed in 
gear 15 seconds after the engine is started. If necessary, braking may 
be employed to keep the drive wheels from turning.
    (ii) Vehicles equipped with manual chokes shall be operated 
according to the manufacturer's operating instructions or owner's 
manual. Where times are provided in the instructions, the Administrator 
may specify the specific point for operation, within 15 seconds of the 
recommended time.
    (3) The operator may use the choke, throttle etc. where necessary to 
keep the engine running.
    (4) If the manufacturer's operating instructions or owner's manual 
do not specify a warm engine starting procedure, the engine (automatic 
and manual choke engines) shall be started by

[[Page 666]]

opening the throttle about half way and cranking the engine until it 
starts.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) If, during the cold start, the vehicle does not start after 10 
seconds of cranking, or ten cycles of the manual starting mechanism, 
cranking shall cease and the reason for failure to start determined. The 
revolution counter on the constant volume sampler shall be turned off 
and the sample solenoid valves placed in the ``standby'' position during 
this diagnostic period. In addition, either the CVS blower shall be 
turned off or the exhaust tube disconnected from the tailpipe during the 
diagnostic period.
    (1) If failure to start is an operational error, the vehicle shall 
be rescheduled for testing from a cold start. If failure to start is 
caused by vehicle malfunction, corrective action (following the 
unscheduled maintenance provisions) of less than 30 minutes duration may 
be taken and the test continued. The sampling system shall be 
reactivated at the same time cranking is started. When the engine 
starts, the driving schedule timing sequence shall begin. If failure to 
start is caused by vehicle malfunction and the vehicle cannot be 
started, the test shall be voided, the vehicle removed from the 
dynamometer, corrective action taken (following the unscheduled 
maintenance provisions), and the vehicle rescheduled for test. The 
reason for the malfunction (if determined) and the corrective action 
taken shall be reported.
    (2) If the vehicle does not start during the hot start after ten 
seconds of cranking, or ten cycles of the manual starting mechanism, 
cranking shall cease, the test shall be voided, the vehicle removed from 
the dynamometer, corrective action taken in accordance with Sec. 86.428 
or Sec. 86.429, and the vehicle rescheduled for test. The reason for the 
malfunction (if determined) and the corrective action taken shall be 
reported.
    (d) If the engine ``false starts'', the operator shall repeat the 
recommended starting procedure (such as resetting the choke, etc.)
    (e) Stalling. (1) If the engine stalls during an idle period, the 
engine shall be restarted immediately and the test continued. If the 
engine cannot be started soon enough to allow the vehicle to follow the 
next acceleration as prescribed, the driving schedule indicator shall be 
stopped. When the vehicle restarts, the driving schedule indicator shall 
be reactivated.
    (2) If the engine stalls during some operating mode other than idle, 
the driving schedule indicator shall be stopped, the vehicle shall then 
be restarted and accelerated to the speed required at that point in the 
driving schedule and the test continued. During acceleration to this 
point, shifting shall be performed in accordance with Sec. 86.528.
    (3) If the vehicle will not restart within one minute, the test 
shall be voided, the vehicle removed from the dynamometer, corrective 
action taken, and the vehicle rescheduled for test. The reason for the 
malfunction (if determined) and the corrective action taken shall be 
reported.


<R05>
Sec. 86.537-90  Dynamometer test runs.

    (a) The vehicle shall be allowed to stand with the engine turned off 
(see Sec. 86.532 for required time). The vehicle shall be stored prior 
to the emission test in such a manner that precipitation (e.g., rain or 
dew) does not occur on the vehicle. The complete dynamometer test 
consists of a cold start drive of 12.0 km (7.5 mi), (10.9 km (6.8 mi) 
for Class I motorcycles) and simulates a hot start drive of 12.0 km (7.5 
mi), (10.9 km (6.8 mi) for Class I motorcycles). The vehicle is allowed 
to stand on the dynamometer during the 10-minute period between the cold 
and hot start tests. The cold start is divided into two periods. The 
first period, representing the cold start ``transient'' phase, 
terminates at the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 
505 seconds of the driving schedule. The second period, representing the 
``stabilized'' phase, consists of the remainder of the driving schedule 
including engine shutdown. The hot start test similarly consists of two 
periods. The period, representing the hot start ``transient'' phase, 
terminates at the same point in the driving schedule at the first point 
of the cold start test. The second period of the hot start test, 
``stabilized'' phase, is assumed to be identical to the second period of 
the

[[Page 667]]

cold start test. Therefore, the hot start test terminates after the 
first period (505 seconds) is run.
    (b) The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (1) Place drive wheel of vehicle on dynamometer without starting 
engine.
    (2) Activate vehicle cooling fan.
    (3) For all vehicles, with the sample selector valves in the 
``standby'' position connect evacuated sample collection bags to the 
dilute exhaust and dilution air sample collection systems.
    (4) For methanol-fueled vehicles, with the sample selector valves in 
the ``standby'' position, insert fresh sample collection impingers into 
the methanol sample collection system, fresh impingers or a fresh 
cartridge into the formaldehyde sample collection system and fresh 
impingers (or a single cartridge for formaldehyde) into the dilution air 
sample collection systems for methanol and formaldehyde (background 
measurements of methanol and formaldehyde may be omitted and 
concentrations assumed to be zero for calculations in Sec. 86.544).
    (5) Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps and the 
temperature recorder. (The heat exchanger of the constant volume 
sampler, if used, methanol-fueled vehicle hydrocarbon analyzer and 
sample lines should be preheated to their respective operating 
temperatures before the test begins.)
    (6) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set 
the gas flow measuring devices to zero.
    (i) For gaseous bag samples (except hydrocarbon samples), the 
minimum flow rate is 0.17 cfm (0.08 l/s).
    (ii) For hydrocarbon samples, the minimum FID (or HFID in the case 
of methanol-fueled vehicles) flow rate is 0.066 cfm (0.031 l/s).
    (iii) For methanol samples, the flow rates shall be set such that 
the system meets the design criteria of Sec. 86.509. For samples in 
which the concentration in the primary impinger exceeds 0.5 mg/l, it is 
recommended that the mass of methanol collected in the secondary 
impinger not exceed ten percent of the total mass collected. For samples 
in which the concentration in the primary impinger does not exceed 0.5 
mg/l, secondary impingers do not need to be analyzed.
    (iv) For formaldehyde samples, the flow rates shall be set such that 
the system meets the design criteria of Sec. 86.509. For impinger 
samples in which the concentration of formaldehyde in the primary 
impinger exceeds 0.1 mg/l, it is recommended that the mass of 
formaldehyde collected in the secondary impinger not exceed ten percent 
of the total mass collected. For samples in which the concentration in 
the primary impinger does not exceed 0.1 mg/l, secondary impingers do 
not need to be analyzed.
    (7) Attach the flexible exhaust tube to the vehicle tailpipe(s).
    (8) Start the gas flow measuring device, position the sample 
selector valves to direct the sample flow into the ``transient'' exhaust 
sample bag, the ``transient'' methanol exhaust sample, the ``transient'' 
formaldehyde exhaust sample, the ``transient'' dilution air sample bag, 
the ``transient'' methanol dilution air sample and the ``transient'' 
formaldehyde dilution air sample, turn the key on, and start cranking 
the engine.
    (9) Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission 
in gear.
    (10) Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial 
vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule.
    (11) Operate the vehicle according to the Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule (Sec. 86.515).
    (12) At the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 
505 seconds, simultaneously switch the sample flows from the 
``transient'' bags and samples to ``stabilized'' bags and samples, 
switch off gas flow measuring device No. 1 and, start gas flow measuring 
device No. 2. Before the acceleration which is scheduled to occur at 510 
seconds, record the measured roll or shaft revolutions and reset the 
counter or switch to a second counter. As soon as possible, transfer the 
``stabilized'' exhaust and dilution air samples to the analytical system 
and process the samples according to Sec. 86.540, obtaining a stabilized 
reading of the exhaust bag sample on all analyzers within 20 minutes of 
the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Obtain methanol and 
formaldehyde sample analyses, if applicable, within 24 hours of the end 
of the sample period. (If it is not possible to

[[Page 668]]

perform analysis on the methanol and formaldehyde samples within 24 
hours, the samples should be stored in a dark cold (4-10  deg.C) 
environment until analysis. The samples should be analyzed within 
fourteen days.)
    (13) Turn the engine off 2 seconds after the end of the last 
deceleration (at 1,369 seconds).
    (14) Five seconds after the engine stops running, simultaneously 
turn off gas flow measuring device No. 2 and position the sample 
selector valves to the ``standby'' position (and open the valves 
isolating particulate filter No. 1, if applicable). Record the measured 
roll or shaft revolutions (both gas meter or flow measurement 
instrumentation readings) and re-set the counter. As soon as possible, 
transfer the ``stabilized'' exhaust and dilution air samples to the 
analytical system and process the samples according to Sec. 86.540, 
obtaining a stabilized reading of the exhaust bag sample on all 
analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection phase of 
the test. Obtain methanol and formaldehyde sample analyses, if 
applicable, within 24 hours of the end of the sample period. (If it is 
not possible to perform analysis on the methanol and formaldehyde 
samples within 24 hours, the samples should be stored in a dark cold (4-
10  deg.C) environment until analysis. The samples should be analyzed 
within fourteen days.)
    (15) Immediately after the end of the sample period, turn off the 
cooling fan.
    (16) Turn off the CVS or disconnect the exhaust tube from the 
tailpipe(s) of the vehicle.
    (17) Repeat the steps in paragraph (b) (2) through (11) of this 
section for the hot start test, except only two evacuated sample bags, 
two methanol sample impingers, and two formaldehyde sample impingers are 
required. The step in paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall begin 
between 9 and 11 minutes after the end of the sample period for the cold 
start test.
    (18) At the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 
505 seconds, simultaneously turn off gas flow measuring device No. 1 and 
position the sample selector valve to the ``standby'' position. (Engine 
shutdown is not part of the hot start test sample period.) Record the 
measured roll or shaft revolutions.
    (19) As soon as possible, transfer the hot start ``transient'' 
exhaust and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system and 
process the samples according to Sec. 86.540 obtaining a stabilized 
reading of the bag exhaust sample on all analyzers within 20 minutes of 
the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Obtain methanol and 
formaldehyde sample analyses, if applicable, within 24 hours of the end 
of the sample period (if it is not possible to perform analysis on the 
methanol and formaldehyde samples within 24 hours, the samples should be 
stored in a dark, cold (~ 0  deg.C) environment until analysis).
    (20) Disconnect the exhaust tube from the vehicle tailpipe(s) and 
remove the vehicle from dynamometer.
    (21) The CVS or CFV may be turned off, if desired.
    (22) Continuous monitoring of exhaust emissions will not normally be 
allowed. Specific written approval must be obtained from the 
Administrator for continuous monitoring of exhaust emissions.

percent of full scale, repeat the procedure in paragraphs (a) (1) 
through (5) of this section.
    (b) For CH<INF>3</INF>OH (methanol-fueled vehicles), introduce test 
samples into the gas chromatograph and measure the concentration. This 
concentration is C<INF>MS</INF> in the calculations.
    (c) For HCHO (methanol-fueled vehicles), introduce test samples into 
the high pressure liquid chromatograph and measure the concentration of
