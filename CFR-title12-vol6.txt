                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

               Subpart A_Information and Records Generally


<R05>
Sec. 602.1  Purpose and scope.

    This part contains FCA's rules for disclosing our records or 
information; processing requests for records under the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, as amended)(FOIA); FOIA fees; disclosing 
otherwise exempt information in litigation when FCA is not a party; and 
getting documents in public rulemaking files. Part 603 of this chapter 
tells you how to get records about yourself under the Privacy Act of 
1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.


<R05>
Sec. 602.2  Disclosing reports of examination.

    (a) Disclosure by FCA. Reports of examination are FCA property. We 
prepare them for our confidential use and the use of the institution 
examined. We do not give reports of examination to the public. Except as 
provided in this section, only the Chairman or the Chairman's designee 
may consent to disclosing reports of examination of Farm Credit System 
institutions and other institutions subject to our examination. You may 
send a written request to our General Counsel that explains why we 
should give permission.
    (b) Disclosure by Farm Credit System institutions. An institution 
that we have examined may disclose its report of examination to its 
officers, directors, and agents, such as its attorney or accountant, if 
they agree to keep the report confidential. In addition, banks may 
disclose their reports of examination to their affiliated associations, 
associations may disclose their reports to their supervisory bank, and 
service corporations may disclose their reports of examination to the 
institutions that own them. An institution may not disclose these 
institutions' reports of examination to any other person without our 
written permission.
    (c) Disclosure to governmental entities. Without waiving any 
privilege, we will disclose reports of examination to other Federal 
government entities:
    (1) In response to a Federal court order;
    (2) In response to a request of either House or a Committee or 
Subcommittee of Congress; or

[[Page 8]]

    (3) When requested for confidential use in an official investigation 
by authorized representatives of other Federal agencies.


<R04>
   Subpart B_Availability of Records of the Farm Credit Administration


<R05>
Sec. 602.3  Definitions.

    Appeal means a request under the FOIA asking for the reversal of a 
decision.
    Business information means trade secrets or other commercial or 
financial information that is privileged or confidential.
    Business submitter means any person or entity that gives business 
information to the Government.
    FOIA request means a written request for FCA records, made by any 
person or entity that either directly or indirectly invokes the FOIA or 
this part.
    Record means all documentary materials, such as books, papers, maps, 
photographs, and machine-readable materials, regardless of physical form 
or characteristics (for example, electronic format) in our possession 
and control when we receive your FOIA request.


<R05>
Sec. 602.4  How to make a request.

    (a) How to make and address a request. Your request for records must 
be in writing and addressed to the FOIA Officer, Farm Credit 
Administration. You may send it:
    (1) By mail to 1501 Farm Credit Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102-5090;
    (2) By facsimile to (703) 790-0052; or
    (3) By E-mail to foiaofficer@fca.gov.
    (b) Description of requested records. You must describe the 
requested records in enough detail to let us find them with a reasonable 
effort. If the description is inadequate, we will ask you to provide 
more information and the 20-day response period under Sec. 602.5(a) 
will not begin until we receive your reply.
    (c) Faster response. You may ask for a faster response to your FOIA 
request by giving us a statement, certified to be true, that you have a 
``compelling need.'' The FOIA Officer will tell you within 10 calendar 
days after receiving the request whether we will respond to it faster. 
If so, we will respond to your request as soon as we can. A compelling 
need means:
    (1) Someone's life or physical safety may be in danger if we do not 
respond to the request faster; or
    (2) You urgently need to tell the public about Federal government 
activity as a representative of the news media.
    (d) Request for personal information. If you or your representative 
requests your personal information, we may require you to give us a 
notarized request, identify yourself under penalty of perjury, or 
provide other proof of your identity.
    (e) Fees. When making a request, you must tell us the most you are 
willing to pay. Our charges are in the fee tables in Sec. Sec. 602.11 
and 602.12. You may also want to tell us the purpose of your request so 
we can classify your request for fee purposes.
    (f) Other requests. To ensure the public has timely information 
about our activities, the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs 
will make available copies of public documents, such as the FCA annual 
report and media advisories.


<R05>
Sec. 602.5  FCA response to requests for records.

    (a) Response time. Within 20 business days of receiving your 
request, the FOIA Officer will tell you whether we have granted or 
denied it. If you send your request to the wrong address, the 20-day 
response time will not begin until the FOIA Officer receives your 
request.
    (b) Extension of response time. In ``unusual circumstances,'' the 
FOIA Officer may extend the 20-day response time for up to 10 more 
business days by telling you in writing why we need more time and the 
date we will mail you our response. As used in this subpart, ``unusual 
circumstances'' means our need to:
    (1) Search for and get the requested records from field offices or 
other locations;
    (2) Search for, get, and review many records identified in a single 
request;
    (3) Consult with another Federal agency having a substantial 
interest in the request; or

[[Page 9]]

    (4) Consult with two or more FCA offices having a substantial 
interest in the request.
    (c) Referrals. If you ask for records we have that another Federal 
agency originated, we will refer the request to the originating agency 
and tell you about the referral. If you should have sent your request to 
another Federal agency, we will refer the request to that agency and so 
advise you.


<R05>
Sec. 602.6  FOIA exemptions.

    The FOIA allows agencies to withhold documents in certain 
categories. For instance, we do not have to give you documents that 
relate to our examination of institutions or that would violate the 
personal privacy of an individual. If we do not give you a document 
because the FOIA does not require us to, we will tell you which FOIA 
exemption applies to our decision.


<R05>
Sec. 602.7  Confidential business information.

    (a) FCA disclosure. FCA may disclose business information from a 
business submitter only under this section. This section will not apply 
if:
    (1) We decide the business submitter has no valid basis to object to 
disclosure;
    (2) The information has been published lawfully or made available to 
the public; or
    (3) Law (other than the FOIA) requires disclosure of the 
information.
    (b) Notice by FCA. When we receive a request for confidential 
business information, the FOIA Officer will promptly tell the requester 
and the business submitter in writing that the responsive records may be 
free from disclosure under the FOIA. We will give the business submitter 
a reasonable time to object to the proposed disclosure of the responsive 
records and tell the requester whenever:
    (1) The business submitter has in good faith labeled the information 
a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged 
or confidential. We will provide such notice for 10 years after 
receiving the information unless the business submitter justifies the 
need for a longer period; or
    (2) We believe that disclosing the information may result in 
commercial or financial injury to the business submitter.
    (c) Objection to release. A business submitter who objects to our 
releasing the requested information should tell us in writing why the 
information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information 
that is privileged or confidential.
    (d) FCA response. (1) We will consider carefully a business 
submitter's objections. If we decide to disclose business information 
over the submitter's objection, the FOIA Officer will explain to the 
submitter in writing why we disagreed with the submitter's objection and 
describe the business information to be disclosed.
    (2) We will tell the requester and the submitter the proposed 
disclosure date at the same time.
    (3) If a submitter sues to prevent release, we will promptly tell 
the requester and will not disclose the business information until after 
the court's decision.
    (4) If a requester sues to compel disclosure, we will promptly tell 
the business submitter.


<R05>
Sec. 602.8  Appeals.

    (a) How to appeal. You may appeal a total or partial denial of your 
FOIA request within 30 calendar days of the date of the denial letter. 
Your appeal must be in writing and addressed to the Director, Office of 
Management Services (OMS), Farm Credit Administration. You may send it:
    (1) By mail to 1501 Farm Credit Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102-5090;
    (2) By facsimile to (703) 893-2608; or
    (3) By E-mail to foiaappeal@fca.gov.
    (b) FCA action on appeal. Within 20 business days of receiving your 
appeal, the OMS Director will tell you, in writing, whether we have 
granted or denied it. If you send your appeal to the wrong address, the 
20-day response time will not begin until the OMS Director receives your 
appeal.
    (c) Unusual circumstances. In unusual circumstances, the OMS 
Director may extend the 20-day response time by telling you in writing 
why we need more time and the date we will mail

[[Page 10]]

you our response. All extensions, including any extension of the 
response time for the first request, may not total more than 10 business 
days.

[64 FR 41770, Aug. 2, 1999, as amended at 70 FR 69645, Nov. 17, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 602.9  Current FOIA index.

    FCA will make a current index available for public inspection and 
copying, as required by the FOIA. We will give you an index for the cost 
of copying it. Because we rarely receive requests for an index, we have 
not published one in the Federal Register.


<R04>
                           Subpart C_FOIA Fees


<R05>
Sec. 602.10  Definitions.

    Commercial use request means an information request by an individual 
or entity seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the 
commercial, trade, or profit interests of that individual or entity.
    Direct costs means the costs FCA incurs in searching for and 
reproducing documents to respond to a FOIA request. For a commercial use 
request, it also means the costs we incur in reviewing documents to 
respond to the request. Direct costs include the pro rated cost of the 
salary of the employee performing the work (based on the basic rate of 
pay plus 16 percent to cover benefits) and the cost of operating 
reproduction equipment. They do not include overhead expenses.
    Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or 
graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or 
an institution of vocational education that runs a program of scholarly 
research.
    Noncommercial scientific institution means a nonprofit institution 
that conducts scientific research that is not intended to promote any 
particular product or industry.
    Pages mean 8-1/2 x 11 inch or 11 x 14 inch paper copies.
    Representative of the news media means any person actively gathering 
news for an entity that publishes or broadcasts news to the public. News 
means information about current events or of current interest to the 
public.
    Reproduce (or reproduction) means copying a record.
    Review means looking at documents found in response to a FOIA 
request to decide whether any portion should be withheld. It does not 
include the time spent resolving legal or policy issues.

FOIA request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of 
material within documents.


<R05>
Sec. 602.11  Fees by type of requester.

    Depending on your identity and the purpose of your request, the FCA 
may charge you the direct costs of searching for responsive records, 
reviewing the records, and reproducing them. If necessary, we will seek 
clarification before classifying the request.
    (a) Educational institutions and noncommercial scientific 
institutions. We charge fees for reproduction costs only. The first 100 
pages are free. You must show that the request is sanctioned by an 
educational or noncommercial scientific institution and that you seek 
the records for scholarly or scientific research, not for a commercial 
use.
    (b) Representatives of the news media. We charge fees for 
reproduction costs only. The first 100 pages are free. You must be a 
representative of the news media, and the request must not be made for a 
commercial use. A request for records supporting news distribution is 
not a request for a commercial use.
    (c) Commercial use. We charge the direct cost for search, review, 
and reproduction. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to free 
search time or free reproduction. We will charge you even if we do not 
disclose any records.
    (d) All others. The first 2 hours of search time and the first 100 
pages of reproduction are free. After that, we will charge you for 
search and reproduction costs. We will charge you for a search even if 
we do not disclose any records.
    (e) Fee table. The fee information in paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section is presented in the table to this paragraph. You may apply 
for a waiver if your request is not mostly in your

[[Page 11]]

commercial interest and the disclosure is in the public interest. See 
Sec. 602.13.

<R05>
Sec. 602.13  Fee waiver.

    We may waive or reduce fees if disclosure is not mostly in your 
commercial interest but, instead, is in the public interest because it 
will advance public understanding of the Federal government's operations 
or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 602.14  Advance payments--notice.

    (a) If fees will be more than $25.00 and you have not told us in 
advance that you will pay estimated fees, we will tell you the estimated 
amount and ask that you agree to pay it. Except as noted in this 
section, we will begin processing the FOIA request when we receive your 
agreement to pay.
    (b) If estimated fees exceed $250.00 and you have a history of 
promptly paying fees charged for information requests, we may respond to 
your request based on your agreement to pay.
    (c) If estimated fees exceed $250.00 and you have no history of 
paying fees, we may require you to pay in advance.
    (d) If you have previously failed to pay fees for information 
requests or paid them late, you must pay any fees still owed, plus 
interest calculated under Sec. 602.15, and the estimated fees before we 
will respond to a new or a pending request.

[[Page 12]]

    (e) If we require advance payment or an advance agreement to pay, we 
will not consider your request to be received and will not respond to it 
until you meet the requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 602.15  Interest on unpaid fees.

    If you fail to pay fees on time, FCA may charge you interest 
starting on the 31st calendar day following the date we bill you. We 
will charge you interest at the rate allowed by law (31 U.S.C. 3717) on 
the billing date.


<R05>
Sec. 602.16  Combining requests.

    You may not avoid paying fees by filing multiple requests at the 
same time. When FCA reasonably believes that you, alone or with others, 
are breaking down a request into a series of requests to avoid fees, we 
will combine the requests and charge accordingly. We will assume that 
multiple requests within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees.


<R04>
Subpart D_Testimony and Production of Documents in Legal Proceedings in 
                     Which FCA is Not a Named Party


<R05>
Sec. 602.17  Policy.

    (a) The rules in this subpart preserve the confidentiality of FCA's 
documents and information, conserve employees' time for official duties, 
uphold fairness in litigation, and help the Chairman decide when to 
allow testimony and to produce documents. This subpart does not affect 
access to documents under the FOIA or the Privacy Act. See subpart B of 
this part and part 603 of this chapter.
    (b) Generally, we will not produce documents voluntarily and 
employees will not appear as witnesses voluntarily in any legal 
proceeding. However, in limited circumstances, the Chairman may allow 
the production of documents or testimony when the Chairman decides it 
would be in the best interest of FCA or the public. All privileged 
documents produced under this subpart remain our property. Any employee 
having information or privileged documents may disclose them only as 
allowed by the Chairman.


<R05>
Sec. 602.18  Definitions.

    Court means any entity conducting a legal proceeding.
    Demand means any order, subpoena, or other legal process for 
testimony or documents.

documents to respond to a request. Direct costs include the pro rated 
cost of the salary of the employee performing the work (based on the 
basic rate of pay plus 16 percent to cover benefits) and the cost of 
operating reproduction equipment.

regardless of the Chairman's instructions not to do so, the employee 
must respectfully refuse to comply.
    (d) FCA's decision under this subpart to comply or not to comply 
with any demand is not a waiver, an assertion of privilege, or an 
objection based on relevance, technical deficiency, or any other ground. 
We may oppose any demand on any legal ground.


<R05>
Sec. 602.24  Responses to demands served on non-FCA employees or entities.

or any related

[[Page 14]]

document, you must object and immediately tell the General Counsel of 
such service, the testimony or documents described in the demand, and 
all relevant facts. You also must object to the production of any 
documents on the basis that they are FCA's property and cannot be 
released without FCA's consent. You should tell the requester the

part.

<R05>
Sec. 603.355  Exemptions.

    (a) Specific. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the investigatory 
material compiled for law enforcement purposes in the following systems 
of records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), 
(H), and (I) and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and from the provisions of this 
part:

Farm Credit Bank loans--FCA.
Production Credit Association loans--FCA.
Agricultural Credit Association loans--FCA.
Federal Land Credit Association loans--FCA.
Agricultural Credit Bank loans--FCA.
Office of Inspector General Investigative Files--FCA.

    (b) General. (1) In addition, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), 
investigatory materials compiled for criminal law enforcement in the 
system of records described in (b)(2) are exempt from all subsections of 
5 U.S.C. 552a, except (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) 
(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i). Exemptions from the particular 
subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (i) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
would reveal investigative interest on the part of the OIG. This would 
enable record subjects to impede the investigation by, for example, 
destroying evidence, intimidating potential witnesses, or fleeing the 
area to avoid inquiries or apprehension by law enforcement personnel.
    (ii) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the 
access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsection (j)(2) of the 
Privacy Act.
    (iii) From subsection (d) because the records contained in this 
system relate to official Federal investigations. Individual access to 
those records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal 
confidential informants or constitute unwarranted invasions of the 
personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain 
investigation. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing 
criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible 
administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (iv) From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because in the course of law 
enforcement investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or 
introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly 
relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of 
effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information 
that may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it 
would impede the specific investigative process if it were necessary to 
assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness and completeness of all 
information obtained.
    (v) From subsection (e)(2) because in a law enforcement 
investigation the requirement that information be collected to the 
greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the 
investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation 
and would therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal 
obligations or duties.

[[Page 18]]

    (vi) From subsection (e)(3) because to comply with the requirements 
of this subsection during the course of an investigation could impede 
the information gathering process, thus hampering the investigation.
    (vii) From subsections (e)(4) (G), and (H), and (I), (e)(8), (f), 
(g) and (h) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of 
subsection (d) pursuant to subsection (j) of the Privacy Act.
    (2) Office of Inspector General Investigative Files--FCA.

Sec. 605.500  Policy.

Oversight Office (ISOO).

[49 FR 9859, Mar. 16, 1984, as amended at 71 FR 54900, Sept. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 605.501  Information Security Officer.

    (a) The Information Security Officer of the Farm Credit 
Administration shall be responsible for implementation and oversight of 
the information security program and procedures adopted by the Agency 
pursuant to the Executive order. This officer shall be the recipient of 
questions, suggestions, and complaints regarding all elements of this 
program and shall be solely responsible for changes to it and for the 
assurance that it is at all times consistent with the Executive order 
and ISOO directive.
    (b) The Information Security Officer shall be the Farm Credit 
Administration's official contact for requests for declassification of 
materials submitted under the Executive order, regardless of the point 
of origin of such requests, and shall assure that such requests for 
records in the Farm Credit Administration's possession that were 
originated by another agency shall be forwarded to the originating 
agency. The Farm Credit Administration shall include a copy of the 
records requested together with its recommendation for action. Upon 
receipt, the originating agency shall process the request in accordance 
with 32 CFR 2001.33(a)(2)(i). Upon request, the originating agency shall 
communicate its declassification determination to the Farm Credit 
Administration. The Farm Credit Administration shall inform the 
requester of the determination within 1 year from the date of receipt, 
except in unusual circumstances. If an appeal is made on a denial of a 
mandatory declassification review request, the originating agency's 
appellate authority shall normally make a determination within 30 
working days following the receipt of an appeal. If additional time is 
required to make a determination, the originating appellate authority 
shall notify the requester of the additional time needed and provide the 
requester with the reason for extension. The originating agency's 
appellate authority shall notify the requester in writing of the final 
determination and of the reasons for any denial. Such officer shall also 
assure that requests for declassification submitted under the Freedom of 
Information Act are handled in accordance with that Act.

[49 FR 9859, Mar. 16, 1984, as amended at 71 FR 54900, Sept. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 605.502  Program and procedures.

    (a) The Farm Credit Administration has no authority for the original 
classification of information for national security purposes. Only those 
agencies described in the Executive order may so classify information.
    (b) Derivative classification. ``Derivative classification'' means 
the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating or

[[Page 22]]

generating in new form information that is already classified, and 
marking the newly developed material consistent with the classification 
markings that apply to the source information. Derivative classification 
includes the classification of information based on classification 
guidance. The duplication or reproduction of existing classified 
information is not derivative classification.
    (c) Mandatory declassification review. ``Mandatory declassification 
review'' means the review for declassification of classified information 
in response to a request for declassification that meets the 
requirements under section 3.5 of the Executive order. All requests for 
review for declassification under the mandatory review provisions of the 
Executive order shall be handled by the Information Security Officer or 
his/her designee.
    (d) Handling of classified documents. All documents bearing the 
terms ``Top Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential'' shall be 
delivered to the Information Security Officer or his/her designee 
immediately upon receipt. All potential recipients of such documents 
shall be advised of the names of such designees. In the event that the 
Information Security Officer or his/her designee is not available to 
receive such documents, they shall be sent to the FCA mailroom and 
stored in the combination safe and secured unopened until the 
Information Security Officer is available. Under no cirumstances shall 
classified materials that cannot be delivered be stored other than in 
the designated safe. All materials not immediately deliverable or able 
to be secured in the designated safe shall be returned to the sender, 
under appropriate cover, for redelivery to the FCA at the next earliest 
opportunity.
    (e) Reproduction. Reproduction of classified materials shall take 
place only in accordance with section 4.2(g) of the Executive order and 
any limitations imposed by the originator. Should copies be made, they 
shall be subject to the same controls as the original document. Records 
showing the number and distribution of copies shall be maintained by the 
Information Security Officer or his/her designee, and the log stored 
with the original documents. These measures shall not restrict 
reproduction for the purposes of Mandatory Review.
    (f) Storage. In accordance with 32 CFR 2001.43, all classified 
documents shall be stored in combination safes located at the primary 
headquarters and/or a Field Office, Office of Examination, Farm Credit 
Administration. The combinations shall be changed as required by 
directives issued by ISOO. The combinations shall be known only to the 
Information Security Officer and his/her designees who have appropriate 
security clearances.
    (g) Employee education. All employees who have been granted a 
security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials 
shall be advised of handling, reproduction, and storage procedures and 
shall be required to review the Executive order and appropriate ISOO 
directives.
    (h) Agency terminology. No official of the Farm Credit 
Administration shall use the terms ``Top Secret'', ``Secret'', or 
``Confidential'' except in relation to materials classified for national 
security purposes. As a Federal regulatory agency, the Farm Credit 
Administration maintains certain internal documents that relate to its 
examination and supervision of the institutions of the Farm Credit 
System. Such documents are limited in use and distribution. Material 
that is of a sensitive nature to the Farm Credit Administration may be 
designated ``Executive Document.''
    (i) Nondisclosure agreement. In accordance with 32 CFR 2003.20, the 
Farm Credit Administration requires that any person whose position 
requires access to classified information must execute a nondisclosure 
agreement on Standard Form 312--Classified Information Nondisclosure 
Agreement. Persons not executing such nondisclosure agreements are 
subject to sanctions of Executive Order 13292. It is the policy of the 
Farm Credit Administration that any employee authorized access to 
classified information holds a personal responsibility for safeguarding 
against unlawful disclosures, and such employees are prohibited from 
disclosure without consent of the FCA Information Security Officer. Any 
such unauthorized disclosure will be reported to

[[Page 23]]

the Information Security Oversight Office, the Department of Justice, 
the Department of State, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and to 
any other Federal agency for which the Farm Credit Administration has 
access to classified information, as such reportings are subject to 
interpretation as required by statute and Executive order. Any employee 
who knowingly disclosed classified information or who refuses to 
cooperate with an investigation may be subject to mandatory 
administrative sanctions, including as a minimum, denial of further 
access to classified information. Further sanctions could include 
demotion or dismissal depending on the circumstances of a particular 
case.
    (j) Freedom of Information request. All inquiries regarding requests 
for classified information under the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552), including those from the news media, shall be referred to 
the FCA FOI Officer, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, Farm 
Credit Administration, and shall be handled in accordance with 
provisions of that statute and applicable regulations.

in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. In preparing the report, the agency shall make reasonable 
efforts to ensure that the person(s) to be accommodated has an 
opportunity to provide relevant information. If an action would result 
in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other 
action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but 
would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the 
benefits and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities,

[[Page 27]]

or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities 
readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The 
agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities 
where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this 
section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall 
meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the 
Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 
4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available 
methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall 
give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to 
qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting 
appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section within sixty days of the 
effective date of this part except that where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years 
of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve accessibility, the agency shall 
develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a 
transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such 
changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, 
including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing 
individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the 
transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy 
of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. 
The plan shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section, and if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period;
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan; and
    (5) Identify the persons or groups who commented on the plan.

Sec. 606.651  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as 
established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings

Sec. 606.660  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in and enjoy the benefits of a program or activity conducted 
by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDDs) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.

[[Page 28]]

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with this section would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. In preparing the report, the agency shall make reasonable 
efforts to ensure that the person(s) to be accommodated has an 
opportunity to provide relevant information. If an action required to 
comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, 
to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the 
benefits and services of the program or activity.

Sec. 607.1  Purpose and scope.

    The regulations in part 607 implement the provisions of section 5.15 
of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, 12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. (Act) relating to 
Farm Credit Administration (FCA) assessments. The regulations prescribe 
the procedures for the equitable apportionment of FCA annual 
administrative expenses and necessary reserves among Farm Credit System 
(System) institutions. Pursuant to section 5.15(a) of the Act, the 
regulations also provide for the separate assessment of the FCA's costs 
of supervising and examining the Federal Agricultural Mortgage 
Corporation (FAMC). The regulations further provide for the 
reimbursement of expenses incurred in performing statutorily required 
examinations of non-System entities.


<R05>
Sec. 607.2  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part, the following definitions shall apply:
    (a) Assessment means the annual amount to be paid by each System 
institution to the Farm Credit Administration in accordance with section 
5.15 of the Act.
    (b) Average risk-adjusted asset base means the average of the risk-
adjusted asset base (as determined in accordance with Sec. 615.5210 of 
this chapter) of banks, associations, and designated other System 
entities, calculated as follows:
    (1) For banks, associations, and designated other System entities 
with four quarters of risk-adjusted assets as of June 30 of each year, 
the sum of the average daily risk-adjusted assets as of the last day of 
the quarter as reported on each quarterly Call Report Schedule RC-G to 
the FCA for the most recent four quarters immediately preceding each 
September 15, divided by four;
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this 
section, for banks, associations, and designated other System entities 
with less than four quarters of risk-adjusted assets as of June 30 of 
each year, the sum of the average daily risk-adjusted assets as of the 
last day of the quarter reported on each quarterly Call Report Schedule 
RC-G to the FCA for the quarters in which it was in existence 
immediately preceding September 15, divided by the number of quarters 
for which the Call Report Schedule RC-G was received;
    (3) For banks, associations, and designated other System entities 
that were formed through mergers, consolidations, or transfers of direct 
lending authority, and have less than four quarters of risk-adjusted 
assets as of June 30, the sum of the average daily risk-adjusted assets 
as of the last day of the quarter for the most recent four

[[Page 30]]

quarters immediately preceding September 15 as reported on each 
quarterly Call Report Schedule RC-G filed by the newly chartered 
institution and the institutions that were merged or consolidated or 
that received direct lending authority, divided by four;
    (4) For banks, associations, and designated other System entities

    (c) Composite Financial Institution Rating System (FIRS) rating 
means the composite numerical assessment of the financial condition of 
an institution assigned to the institution by the FCA based on its most 
recent examination of the institution. The FIRS factors are generally 
considered to be important indicators of an institution's financial 
health. Institutions are rated on each of the factors during an 
examination. The composite FIRS rating ranges from 1 to 5, with a lower 
number indicating a better financial condition than a higher number.
    (d) Delinquent amount means an amount owed to the FCA that has not 
been paid by the date specified in the FCA's Notice of Assessment or 
billing.
    (e) Designated other System entities means other System entities

Sec. 607.3  Assessment of banks, associations, and designated other System entities.

    (a) Banks, associations, and other System entities designated in 
paragraph (c) of this section will be assessed annually pursuant to this 
section for funds to cover a portion of the FCA's administrative 
expenses and for such funds as may be required to maintain a necessary 
reserve. The total amount of the annual assessment of banks, 
associations, and designated other System entities shall be based on the 
FCA budget for each fiscal year plus such amount as may be required to 
maintain a necessary reserve, excluding amounts to be assessed against 
other System entities and reimbursements received from non-System 
entities.
    (b) The assessment shall be apportioned among the banks, 
associations, and designated other System entities as follows:
    (1) Thirty (30) percent of the assessment under this section shall 
be apportioned to each bank, association, and designated other System 
entity on the basis of each institution's pro rata share of the total 
average risk-adjusted asset base.

[[Page 31]]

    (2) Seventy (70) percent of the assessment under this section shall 
be apportioned to each bank, association, and designated other System 
entity based upon the amounts of the institution's average risk-adjusted 
assets that fall within the graduated risk-adjusted asset tiers 
contained in the following table. An institution's total assessment 
under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts assessed for risk-
adjusted assets falling into each applicable tier, subject to adjustment 
for its FIRS rating as required in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section. The same assessment rate (designated as X<INF>1</INF> 
or a declining percentage of X<INF>1</INF> in the following table) will 
be applied to each dollar value of risk-adjusted assets falling within 
each tier, increased where applicable, by the amounts prescribed in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The actual 
assessment rate under this paragraph shall be determined annually based 
on relative average risk-adjusted asset bases, the FIRS ratings of 
individual institutions, and the FCA budget as adjusted pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, but the relationship between the rates 
applied to each tier shall remain constant as set forth in the following 
table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Average risk-adjusted asset size range (in
                    millions)

10,000..............................  ...........  .10X1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Example: XYZ association has a FIRS rating of 2 and average risk-
adjusted assets of $500.4 million. The value of X<INF>1</INF> has been 
determined to be .000917, based on an FCA budget of $40.29 million.

X1=.000917 therefore $25,000,000x.0917%...................   =   $22,925
.85X1=.000780 therefore $25,000,000x.0780%................   =    19,500
.75X1=.000688 therefore $50,000,000x.0688%................   =    34,400
.60X1=.000550 therefore $400,000,000x.0550%...............   =   220,000
.50X1=.000458 therefore $400,000x.0458%...................   =       183

    Total Assessment under Sec.  607.3(b)(2).............   =   297,008
 

    (i) If the FCA assigns a bank, association, or designated other 
System entity a composite FIRS rating of 3 following its most recent 
examination of the institution prior to the date of assessment, the 
assessment provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be 
increased by 20 percent.
    (ii) If the FCA assigns a bank, association, or designated other 
System entity a composite FIRS rating of 4 or 5 following its most 
recent examination of the institution prior to the date of assessment, 
the assessment provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be 
increased by 40 percent.
    (iii) Banks, associations, and designated other System entities that 
were formed through mergers or consolidations and have not been examined 
before their initial assessment under this section shall be deemed to 
have a composite FIRS rating equivalent to the best composite FIRS 
rating assigned to the merged or consolidated institutions in the FCA's 
most recent examination of the individual institutions prior to the date 
of merger or consolidation. Newly chartered institutions not formed 
through mergers or consolidations that have not been examined before 
their initial assessment under this section shall be deemed to have a 
composite FIRS rating of 2.
    (3) Each bank, association, and designated other System entity shall 
pay a minimum assessment of $20,000 regardless of the result of the 
application of the assessment formula established by paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (b)(2) of this section. If such a minimum assessment is apportioned 
to an institution, that institution's average risk-adjusted asset base 
shall be deducted from the total average risk-adjusted asset base, and 
$20,000 shall be deducted from the total assessment amount for purposes 
of determining the assessments of banks, associations, and designated 
other System entities paying more than the $20,000 minimum assessment.
    (c) Other System entities designated to be assessed in accordance 
with this section are:

[[Page 32]]

    The Farm Credit Services Leasing Corporation.
    (d) Assessments may be adjusted periodically to reflect:
    (1) Changes in the FCA budget and necessary reserve; and
    (2) Any overpayment or underpayment by a bank, association, or 
designated other System entity in the prior fiscal year.

Sec. 607.4  Assessment of other System entities.

    (a)(1) Unless otherwise designated to be assessed under Sec. 607.3, 
and with the exception of FAMC as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, other System entities will be assessed for estimated direct 
expenses plus an allocated portion of FCA indirect expenses and such 
amount as may be required to maintain a necessary reserve. The estimate 
for direct expenses shall take into account the direct expenses incurred 
in the most recent examination of the entity preceding each September 15 
and expected increases or decreases in examination work for the next 
fiscal year. A proportional amount of FCA indirect expenses will be 
allocated to each entity based on the estimated direct expenses related 
to the particular entity as a percentage of the total budgeted direct 
expenses of the agency (excluding direct expenses under paragraph (b) of 
this section) for the fiscal year covered by the assessment.
    (2) Assessments of other System entities under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may be adjusted periodically to reflect:
    (i) Changes in the FCA budget and necessary reserve; and
    (ii) Any overpayment or underpayment by such other System entity in 
the prior fiscal year.
    (b) Assessment of Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. The FCA 
shall assess FAMC for the estimated cost of FCA's regulation, 
supervision, and examination of FAMC, including reasonably related 
administrative and overhead expenses. FAMC's assessment may be adjusted 
periodically to reflect changes in the FCA budget and to reconcile 
differences between FAMC's assessment and FCA's actual expenditures for 
regulation of FAMC in the prior fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 607.5  Notice of assessment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, prior to 
September 15 of each year, the FCA shall determine the amount of 
assessment to be collected from each System institution for the next 
fiscal year under Sec. Sec. 607.3 and 607.4 and shall provide each 
System institution with a Notice of Assessment. The total amount 
assessed each System institution in the Notice of Assessment shall be an 
obligation of each institution on October 1 of each fiscal year. The 
total amount assessed each System institution shall be payable not less 
often than quarterly in equal installments during each fiscal year, 
subject to adjustment pursuant to Sec. Sec. 607.3(d), 607.4(a)(2), 
607.4(b), and 607.10.
    (b) For banks, associations and designated other System entities 
chartered during the period July 1 through September 30 of each year, 
the FCA shall, prior to December 15, determine the amount of assessment 
to be collected from each such institution for the remainder of the 
fiscal year and provide the institution with a Notice of Assessment. The 
total amount of the assessment becomes an obligation of the institution 
on January 1 and shall be payable in equal installments, subject to 
adjustment pursuant to Sec. Sec. 607.3(d) and 607.10, not less often 
than quarterly for the remainder of the fiscal year. The first 
installment shall be due on January 1. This paragraph shall not apply to 
banks, associations, and designated other System entities formed by 
merger, consolidation, or transfer of direct lending authority.
    (c) In the event of the proposed cancellation of the charter of a 
System institution, the unpaid installments of the total amount of the 
institution's assessment shall be provided for prior to the cancellation 
of the charter.


<R05>
Sec. 607.6  Payment of assessment.

    (a) System institutions shall pay the amounts due as scheduled in 
the FCA Notice of Assessment. Payment shall be made by electronic funds 
transfer (EFT) for credit to the FCA's account in the Department of the 
Treasury, by check to the FCA for deposit, or by

[[Page 33]]

such other means as the FCA may authorize.
    (b) Payments made by EFT that are not received by the close of 
business on the due date shall be considered delinquent in accordance 
with Sec. 607.7.
    (c) Payments made by check that are not received by the FCA before 
the close of business on the third workday preceding the due date shall 
be considered delinquent in accordance with Sec. 607.7.


<R05>
Sec. 607.7  Late-payment charges on assessments.

    (a) If any portion of a scheduled installment of a System 
institution's total assessment or the reimbursement billed to a non-
System entity is not paid by the due date, the overdue amount shall be 
considered delinquent.
    (b) Delinquent amounts shall be charged late-payment interest at the 
United States Treasury Department's current value of funds rate 
published in the Federal Register. Late payment interest shall be 
expressed as an annual rate of interest and shall accrue on a daily 
basis starting on the due date of the delinquent amount and continuing 
through the date payment is received by the FCA.
    (c) The FCA shall waive the collection of interest on the delinquent 
amounts if such amounts are paid within 30 days of the date interest 
begins to accrue. The FCA may waive interest due on delinquent amounts 
upon finding no fault with the performance of the remitter.
    (d) The FCA shall charge an amount necessary to cover the 
administrative costs incurred as a result of collection of any 
delinquent amount.
    (e) The FCA shall charge a penalty of 6 percent per annum on any 
portion of a delinquent amount that is more than 90 days past due. Such 
penalty shall accrue from the date the amount became delinquent.


<R05>
Sec. 607.8  Reimbursements for services to non-System entities.

    Non-System entities shall be assessed for direct expenses plus an 
amount for FCA indirect expenses reasonably related to the services 
rendered to the non-System entity. Such related indirect expenses shall 
be calculated as a percentage of the FCA's overall indirect expenses 
based on the extent of FCA activities with respect to the non-System 
entity during the period since the entity's most recent assessment.


<R05>
Sec. 607.9  Reimbursable billings.

    The FCA shall bill the amounts due for services to non-System 
entities each year subsequent to the issuance of their respective 
Reports of Examination. Amounts billed are due in full within 30 days 
from the date billed. If the billed amount or any portion thereof 
remains unpaid at close of business on the due date, such amount or 
portion shall be considered delinquent in accordance with Sec. 607.7.


<R05>
Sec. 607.10  Adjustments for overpayment or underpayment of assessments.

    Where adjustments for overpayment or underpayment of assessments are 
made pursuant to Sec. Sec. 607.3(d), 607.4(a)(2), and 607.4(b), credits 
for overpayments or charges for underpayments shall be based on FCA 
administrative operating expenses incurred in the applicable fiscal year 
and on funds required to be maintained pursuant to section 5.15 of the 
Act. Such credits or charges shall be applied to the next applicable 
assessment payment due during the current or subsequent fiscal year. 
Where such adjustments are made, the FCA shall provide the institution 
with a statement of adjustment at least 15 days prior to the date when 
the institution's next assessment payment is due. Adjustments in 
assessments shall be made in principal amount only. Overdue amounts 
under Sec. 607.7 are not underpayments for assessment adjustment 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 607.11  Report of assessments and expenses.

    By January 15 of each calendar year, the FCA shall provide each 
assessed System institution with a report of assessments and expenses 
for the preceding fiscal year showing total assessments and other income 
received as applied to expenses incurred by major budget category and 
amounts set aside for a necessary reserve.

              Subpart A_Administrative Collection of Claims


<R05>
Sec. 608.801  Authority.

    The regulations of this part are issued under the Federal Claims 
Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 
31 U.S.C. 3701-3719 and 5 U.S.C. 5514, and in conformity with the joint 
regulations issued under that Act by the General Accounting Office and 
the Department of Justice (joint regulations) prescribing standards for 
administrative collection, compromise, suspension, and termination of 
agency collection actions, and referral to the General Accounting Office 
and to the Department of Justice for litigation of civil claims for 
money or property owed to the United States (4 CFR parts 101-105).


<R05>
Sec. 608.802  Applicability.

    This part applies to all claims of indebtedness due and owing to the 
United States and collectible under procedures authorized by the Federal 
Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 
1982. The joint regulations and this part do not apply to conduct in 
violation of antitrust laws, tax claims, claims between Federal 
agencies, or to any claim which appears to involve fraud, presentation 
of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any 
other party having an interest in the claim, unless the Justice 
Department authorizes the Farm Credit Administration, pursuant to 4 CFR 
101.3, to handle the claim in accordance with the provisions of 4 CFR 
parts 101-105. Additionally, this part does not apply to Farm Credit 
Administration assessments under part 607 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 608.803  Definitions.

    In this part (except where the term is defined elsewhere in this 
part), the following definitions shall apply:
    (a) Administrative offset or offset, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 
3701(a)(1), means withholding money payable by the United States 
Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt 
the person owes the Government.
    (b) Agency means a department, agency, or instrumentality in the 
executive

[[Page 35]]

or legislative branch of the Government.
    (c) Claim or debt means money or property owed by a person or entity 
to an agency of the Federal Government. A ``claim'' or ``debt'' includes 
amounts due the Government from loans insured by or guaranteed by the 
United States and all other amounts due from fees, leases, rents, 
royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, overpayment, 
penalties, damages, interest, and fines.
    (d) Claim certification means a creditor agency's written request to 
a paying agency to effect an administrative offset.
    (e) Creditor agency means an agency to which a claim or debt is 
owed.
    (f) Debtor means the person or entity owing money to the Federal 
Government.
    (g) FCA means the Farm Credit Administration.
    (h) Hearing official means an individual who is responsible for 
reviewing a claim under Sec. 608.810 of this part.
    (i) Paying agency means an agency of the Federal Government owing 
money to a debtor against which an administrative or salary offset can 
be effected.
    (j) Salary offset means an administrative offset to collect a debt 
under 5 U.S.C. 5514 by deductions at one or more officially established 
pay intervals from the current pay account of a debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 608.804  Delegation of authority.

    The FCA official(s) designated by the Chairman of the Farm Credit 
Administration are authorized to perform all duties which the Chairman 
is authorized to perform under these regulations, the Federal Claims 
Collection Act of 1966, as amended, and the joint regulations issued 
under that Act.


<R05>
Sec. 608.805  Responsibility for collection.

    (a) The collection of claims shall be aggressively pursued in 
accordance with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 
1966, as amended, the joint regulations issued under that Act, and these 
regulations. Debts owed to the United States, together with charges for 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs, should be collected in 
one lump sum unless otherwise provided by law. If a debtor requests 
installment payments, the debtor, as requested by the FCA, shall provide 
sufficient information to demonstrate that the debtor is unable to pay 
the debt in one lump sum. When appropriate, the FCA shall arrange an 
installment payment schedule. Claims which cannot be collected directly 
or by administrative offset shall be either written off as 
administratively uncollectible or referred to the General Counsel for 
further consideration.
    (b) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may compromise claims 
for money or property arising out of the activities of the FCA, where 
the claim (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs) does not exceed $100,000. When the claim exceeds 
$100,000 (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs), the authority to accept a compromise rests solely 
with the Department of Justice. The standards governing the compromise 
of claims are set forth in 4 CFR part 103.
    (c) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may suspend or 
terminate the collection of claims which do not exceed $100,000 
(exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs) 
after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections. If, 
after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, a 
claim exceeds $100,000 (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, 
and administrative costs), the authority to suspend or terminate rests 
solely with the Department of Justice. The standards governing the 
suspension or termination of claim collections are set forth in 4 CFR 
part 104.
    (d) The FCA shall refer claims to the Department of Justice for 
litigation or to the General Accounting Office (GAO) for claims arising 
from audit exceptions taken by the GAO to payments made by the FCA in 
accordance with 4 CFR part 105.


<R05>
Sec. 608.806  Demand for payment.

    (a) A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not 
more than 30-day intervals should normally be made upon a debtor, unless 
a response or other information indicates that additional written 
demands would

[[Page 36]]

either be unnecessary or futile. When necessary to protect the 
Government's interest, written demands may be preceded by other 
appropriate actions under Federal law, including immediate referral for 
litigation and/or administrative offset.
    (b) The initial demand for payment shall be in writing and shall 
inform the debtor of the following:
    (1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, and the facts 
upon which the determination of indebtedness was made;
    (2) The payment due date, which shall be 30 calendar days from the 
date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand for payment;
    (3) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the 
agency related to the claim or to receive copies if personal inspection 
is impractical. The debtor shall be informed that the debtor may be 
assessed for the cost of copying the documents in accordance with Sec. 
608.807;
    (4) The right of the debtor to obtain a review of the FCA's 
determination of indebtedness;
    (5) The right of the debtor to offer to enter into a written 
agreement with the agency to repay the amount of the claim. The debtor 
shall be informed that the acceptance of such an agreement is 
discretionary with the agency;
    (6) That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs 
will be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, 
if payment is not received by the payment due date;
    (7) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the 
FCA to pay the debt, has not requested the FCA to review the debt, or 
has not paid the debt by the payment due date, the FCA intends to 
collect the debt by all legally available means, which may include 
initiating legal action against the debtor, referring the debt to a 
collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by offset, or 
asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by 
offset;
    (8) The name and address of the FCA official to whom the debtor 
shall send all correspondence relating to the debt; and
    (9) Other information, as may be appropriate.
    (c) If, prior to, during, or after completion of the demand cycle, 
the FCA determines to collect the debt by either administrative or 
salary offset, the FCA shall follow, as applicable, the requirements for 
a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset or a Notice of 
Intent to Collect by Salary Offset set forth in Sec. 608.822.
    (d) If no response to the initial demand for payment is received by 
the payment due date, the FCA shall take further action under this part, 
under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, under the 
joint regulations (4 CFR parts 101-105), or under any other applicable 
State or Federal law. These actions may include reports to credit 
bureaus, referrals to collection agencies, termination of contracts, 
debarment, and salary or administrative offset.


<R05>
Sec. 608.807  Right to inspect and copy records.

    The debtor may inspect and copy the FCA records related to the 
claim. The debtor shall give the FCA reasonable advance notice that it 
intends to inspect and copy the records involved. The debtor shall pay 
copying costs unless they are waived by the FCA. Copying costs shall be 
assessed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 602.11 and 602.12 of this chapter.

[59 FR 13187, Mar. 21, 1994, as amended at 71 FR 54900, Sept. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 608.808  Right to offer to repay claim.

    (a) The debtor may offer to enter into a written agreement with the 
FCA to repay the amount of the claim. The acceptance of such an offer 
and the decision to enter into such a written agreement is at the 
discretion of the FCA.
    (b) If the debtor requests a repayment arrangement because payment 
of the amount due would create a financial hardship, the FCA shall 
analyze the debtor's financial condition. The FCA may enter into a 
written agreement with the debtor permitting the debtor to repay the 
debt in installments if the FCA determines, in its sole discretion, that 
payment of the amount due would create an undue financial hardship for 
the debtor. The written agreement shall set forth the amount and 
frequency of installment payments and shall, in accordance with

[[Page 37]]

Sec. 608.812, provide for the imposition of charges for interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs unless waived by the FCA.
    (c) The written agreement may require the debtor to execute a 
confess-judgment note when the total amount of the deferred installments 
will exceed $750. The FCA shall provide the debtor with a written 
explanation of the consequences of signing a confess-judgment note. The 
debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the written 
explanation. The statement shall recite that the written explanation was 
read and understood before execution of the note and that the debtor 
signed the note knowingly and voluntarily. Documentation of these 
procedures will be maintained in the FCA's file on the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 608.809  Right to agency review.

    (a) If the debtor disputes the claim, the debtor may request a 
review of the FCA's determination of the existence of the debt or of the 
amount of the debt. If only part of the claim is disputed, the 
undisputed portion should be paid by the payment due date.
    (b) To obtain a review, the debtor shall submit a written request 
for review to the FCA official named in the initial demand letter, 
within 15 calendar days after receipt of the letter. The debtor's 
request for review shall state the basis on which the claim is disputed.
    (c) The FCA shall promptly notify the debtor, in writing, that the 
FCA has received the request for review. The FCA shall conduct its 
review of the claim in accordance with Sec. 608.810.
    (d) Upon completion of its review of the claim, the FCA shall notify 
the debtor whether the FCA's determination of the existence or amount of 
the debt has been sustained, amended, or canceled. The notification 
shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing 
official pursuant to Sec. 608.810(e). If the FCA's determination is 
sustained, this notification shall contain a provision which states that 
the FCA intends to collect the debt by all legally available means, 
which may include initiating legal action against the debtor, referring 
the debt to a collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by 
offset, or asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting 
the debt by offset.


<R05>
Sec. 608.810  Review procedures.

    (a) Unless an oral hearing is required by Sec. 608.823(d), the 
FCA's review shall be a review of the written record of the claim.
    (b) If an oral hearing is required under Sec. 608.823(d), the FCA 
shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for such a 
hearing. The oral hearing, however, shall not be an adversarial 
adjudication and need not take the form of a formal evidentiary hearing. 
All significant matters discussed at the hearing, however, will be 
carefully documented.
    (c) Any review required by this part, whether a review of the 
written record or an oral hearing, shall be conducted by a hearing 
official. In the case of a salary offset, the hearing official shall not 
be under the supervision or control of the Chairman of the Farm Credit 
Administration.
    (d) The FCA may be represented by legal counsel. The debtor may 
represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of 
the debtor's choice and at the debtor's expense.
    (e) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision based 
on documentary evidence and, if applicable, information developed at an 
oral hearing. The written decision shall be issued as soon as 
practicable after the review but not later than 60 days after the date 
on which the request for review was received by the FCA, unless the 
debtor requests a delay in the proceedings. A delay in the proceedings 
shall be granted if the hearing official determines, in his or her sole 
discretion, that there is good cause to grant the delay. If a delay is 
granted, the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of 
days by which the review was postponed.
    (f) Upon issuance of the written opinion, the FCA shall promptly 
notify the debtor of the hearing official's decision. Said notification 
shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing 
official pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

[[Page 38]]


<R05>
Sec. 608.811  Special review.

    (a) An employee subject to salary offset, under subpart C of this 
part, or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a 
special review by the FCA of the amount of the salary offset or 
voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances such as, 
but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.
    (b) To determine whether an offset would prevent the employee from 
meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, 
housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the employee shall 
submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, 
his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:
    (1) Income from all sources;
    (2) Assets;
    (3) Liabilities;
    (4) Number of dependents;
    (5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;
    (6) Medical expenses; and
    (7) Exceptional expenses, if any.
    (c) If the employee requests a special review under this section, 
the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment 
schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the 
current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial 
hardship to the employee.
    (d) The FCA shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, 
and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes 
an undue financial hardship on the employee. The FCA shall notify the 
employee in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a 
revised offset or payment schedule.


<R05>
Sec. 608.812  Charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the FCA 
shall:
    (1) Assess interest on unpaid claims;
    (2) Assess administrative costs incurred in processing and handling 
overdue claims; and
    (3) Assess penalty charges not to exceed 6 percent a year on any 
part of a debt more than 90 days past due. The imposition of charges for 
interest, administrative costs, and penalties shall be made in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (b)(1) Interest shall accrue from the date of mailing or hand 
delivery of the initial demand for payment or the Notice of Intent to 
Collect by either Administrative or Salary Offset if the amount of the 
claim is not paid within 30 days from the date of mailing or hand 
delivery of the initial demand or notice.
    (2) The 30-day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis if the 
FCA reasonably determines that such action is appropriate. Interest 
shall only accrue on the principal of the claim and the interest rate 
shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except, as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in cases where a debtor has 
defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new 
agreement, or if the FCA reasonably determines that a higher rate is 
necessary to protect the interests of the United States.
    (c) If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter 
into a new agreement, the FCA may assess a new interest rate on the 
unpaid claim. In addition, charges for interest, administrative costs, 
and penalties which accrued but were not collected under the original 
repayment agreement shall be added to the principal of the claim to be 
paid under the new repayment agreement. Interest shall accrue on the 
entire principal balance of the claim, as adjusted to reflect any 
increase resulting from the addition of these charges.
    (d) The FCA may waive charges for interest, administrative costs, 
and/or penalties if it determines that:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the claim 
within a reasonable period of time;
    (2) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or 
penalties would jeopardize collection of the principal of the claim;
    (3) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, or 
penalties would be against equity and good conscience; or
    (4) It is otherwise in the best interest of the United States, 
including the situation where an installment payment agreement or offset 
is in effect.

[[Page 39]]


<R05>
Sec. 608.813  Contracting for collection services.

    The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may contract for 
collection services in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718 and 4 CFR 102.6 to 
recover debts.


<R05>
Sec. 608.814  Reporting of credit information.

    The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may disclose to a 
consumer reporting agency information that an individual is responsible 
for a debt owed to the United States. Information will be disclosed to 
reporting agencies in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
agreements entered into between the FCA and the reporting agencies. The 
terms and conditions of such agreements shall specify that all of the 
rights and protection afforded to the debtor under 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) 
have been fulfilled. The FCA shall notify each consumer reporting 
agency, to which a claim was disclosed, when the debt has been 
satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 608.815  Credit report.

    In order to aid the FCA in making appropriate determinations 
regarding the collection and compromise of claims; the collection of 
charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties; the use of 
administrative offset; the use of other collection methods; and the 
likelihood of collecting the claim, the FCA may institute, consistent 
with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681, et 
seq.), a credit investigation of the debtor immediately following a 
determination that the claim exists.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Administrative Offset


<R05>
Sec. 608.820  Applicability.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart shall apply to the collection of 
debts by administrative [or salary] offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 
U.S.C. 5514, or other statutory or common law.
    (b) Offset shall not be used to collect a debt more than 10 years 
after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless 
facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not 
known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or 
officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility of 
discovering and collecting such debt.
    (c) Offset shall not be used with respect to:
    (1) Debts owed by other agencies of the United States or by any 
State or local government;
    (2) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security 
Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or tariff laws of 
the United States; or
    (3) Any case in which collection by offset of the type of debt 
involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.
    (d) Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments 
which are not subject to offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 or 5 U.S.C. 5514 
may be collected by offset if such collection is authorized under common 
law or other applicable statutory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 608.821  Collection by offset.

    (a) Collection of a debt by administrative [or salary] offset shall 
be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, 
of 4 CFR 102.3, and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. It is not necessary for 
the debt to be reduced to judgment or to be undisputed for offset to be 
used.
    (b) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may determine that it 
is feasible to collect a debt to the United States by offset against 
funds payable to the debtor.
    (c) The feasibility of collecting a debt by offset will be 
determined on a case-by-case basis. This determination shall be made by 
considering all relevant factors, including the following:
    (1) The degree to which the offset can be accomplished in accordance 
with law. This determination should take into consideration relevant 
statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements;
    (2) The degree to which the FCA is certain that its determination of 
the existence and amount of the debt is correct;
    (3) The practicality of collecting the debt by offset. The cost, in 
time and money, of collecting the debt by offset and the amount of money 
which can reasonably be expected to be recovered

[[Page 40]]

through offset will be relevant to this determination; and
    (4) Whether the use of offset will substantially interfere with or 
defeat the purpose of a program authorizing payments against which the 
offset is contemplated. For example, under a grant program in which 
payments are made in advance of the grantee's performance, the 
imposition of offset against such a payment may be inappropriate.
    (d) The collection of a debt by offset may not be feasible when 
there are circumstances which would indicate that the likelihood of 
collection by offset is less than probable.
    (e) The offset will be effected 31 days after the debtor receives a 
Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset (or Notice of 
Intent to Collect by Salary Offset if the offset is a salary offset), or 
upon the expiration of a stay of offset, unless the FCA determines under 
Sec. 608.824 that immediate action is necessary.
    (f) If the debtor owes more than one debt, amounts recovered through 
offset may be applied to them in any order. Applicable statutes of 
limitation would be considered before applying the amounts recovered to 
any debts owed.


<R05>
Sec. 608.822  Notice requirements before offset.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 608.824, the FCA will provide the 
debtor with 30 calendar days' written notice that unpaid debt amounts 
shall be collected by administrative [or salary] offset (Notice of 
Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] Offset) before the FCA 
imposes offset against any money that is to be paid to the debtor.
    (b) The Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] 
Offset shall be delivered to the debtor by hand or by mail and shall 
provide the following information:
    (1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, and the facts 
upon which the determination of indebtedness was made;
    (2) In the case of an administrative offset, the payment due date, 
which shall be 30 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand 
delivery of the Notice;
    (3) In the case of a salary offset: (i) The FCA's intention to 
collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current 
disposable pay account until the debt and all accumulated interest is 
paid in full; and
    (ii) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of 
the intended deductions;
    (4) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the 
FCA related to the claim or to receive copies if personal inspection is 
impractical. The debtor shall be informed that the debtor shall be 
assessed for the cost of copying the documents in accordance with Sec. 
608.807;
    (5) The right of the debtor to obtain a review of, and to request a 
hearing, on the FCA's determination of indebtedness, the propriety of 
collecting the debt by offset, and, in the case of salary offset, the 
propriety of the proposed repayment schedule (i.e., the percentage of 
disposable pay to be deducted each pay period). The debtor shall be 
informed that to obtain a review, the debtor shall deliver a written 
request for a review to the FCA official named in the Notice, within 15 
calendar days after the debtor's receipt of the Notice. In the case of a 
salary offset, the debtor shall also be informed that the review shall 
be conducted by an official arranged for by the FCA who shall be a 
hearing official not under the control of the Chairman of the Farm 
Credit Administration, or an administrative law judge;
    (6) That the filing of a petition for hearing within 15 calendar 
days after receipt of the Notice will stay the commencement of 
collection proceedings;
    (7) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will 
be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days 
after the filing of the written request for review unless the employee 
requests, and the hearing official grants, a delay in the proceedings;
    (8) The right of the debtor to offer to enter into a written 
agreement with the FCA to repay the amount of the claim. The debtor 
shall be informed that the acceptance of such an agreement is 
discretionary with the FCA;
    (9) That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs 
shall

[[Page 41]]

be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if 
payment is not received by the payment due date. The debtor shall be 
informed that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 103 and 104);
    (10) The amount of accrued interest and the amount of any other 
penalties or administrative costs which may have been added to the 
principal debt;
    (11) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the 
FCA to pay the debt, has not requested the FCA to review the debt, or 
has not paid the debt prior to the date on which the offset is to be 
imposed, the FCA intends to collect the debt by administrative [or 
salary] offset or by requesting other Federal agencies for assistance in 
collecting the debt by offset. The debtor shall be informed that the 
offset shall be imposed against any funds that might become available to 
the debtor, until the principal debt and all accumulated interest and 
other charges are paid in full;
    (12) The date on which the offset will be imposed, which shall be 31 
calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the Notice. 
The debtor shall be informed that the FCA reserves the right to impose 
an offset prior to this date if the FCA determines that immediate action 
is necessary;
    (13) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, 
representations, or evidence may subject the debtor to:
    (i) Penalties under the False Claims Act, sections 3729 through 3731 
of title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory 
authority;
    (ii) Criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 of 
title 18, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory 
authority; and, with regard to employees,
    (iii) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under chapter 75 of title 
5, United States Code; part 752 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, 
or any other applicable statute or regulation;
    (14) The name and address of the FCA official to whom the debtor 
shall send all correspondence relating to the debt or the offset;
    (15) Any other rights and remedies available to the debtor under 
statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection 
is being made;
    (16) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory 
provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt, 
which are later waived or found not owed to the United States, will be 
promptly refunded to the employee; and
    (17) Other information, as may be appropriate.
    (c) When the procedural requirements of this section have been 
provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt or under some 
other statutory or regulatory authority, the FCA is not required to 
duplicate those requirements before effecting offset.


<R05>
Sec. 608.823  Right to review of claim.

    (a) If the debtor disputes the claim, the debtor may request a 
review of the FCA's determination of the existence of the debt, the 
amount of the debt, the propriety of collecting the debt by offset, and 
in the case of salary offset, the propriety of the proposed repayment 
schedule. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion 
should be paid by the payment due date.
    (b) To obtain a review, the debtor shall submit a written request 
for review to the FCA official named in the Notice of Intent to Collect 
by Administrative [or Salary] Offset within 15 calendar days after 
receipt of the notice. The debtor's written request for review shall 
state the basis on which the claim is disputed and shall specify whether 
the debtor requests an oral hearing or a review of the written record of 
the claim. If an oral hearing is requested, the debtor shall explain in 
the request why the matter cannot be resolved by a review of the 
documentary evidence alone.
    (c) The FCA shall promptly notify the debtor, in writing, that the 
FCA has received the request for review. The FCA shall conduct its 
review of the claim in accordance with Sec. 608.810.
    (d) The FCA's review of the claim, under this section, shall include 
providing the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing 
if:
    (1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the FCA to consider 
waiver

[[Page 42]]

of the indebtedness, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and 
the waiver determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity; 
or
    (2) The debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the FCA 
determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by 
reviewing the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of 
the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.
    (e) A debtor waives the right to a hearing and will have his or her 
debt offset in accordance with the proposed offset schedule if the 
debtor:
    (1) Fails to file a written request for review within the timeframe 
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the FCA determines 
that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her 
control; or
    (2) Fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was 
notified unless the hearing official determines that the failure to 
appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.
    (f) Upon completion of its review of the claim, the FCA shall notify 
the debtor whether the FCA's determination of the existence or amount of 
the debt has been sustained, amended, or canceled. The notification 
shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing 
official, pursuant to Sec. 608.810(e). If the FCA's determination is 
sustained, this notification shall contain a provision which states that 
the FCA intends to collect the debt by offset or by requesting other 
Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt.
    (g) When the procedural requirements of this section have been 
provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt or under some 
other statutory or regulatory authority, the FCA is not required to 
duplicate those requirements before effecting offset.


<R05>
Sec. 608.824  Waiver of procedural requirements.

    (a) The FCA may impose offset against a payment to be made to a 
debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by this part, 
if:
    (1) Failure to impose the offset would substantially prejudice the 
Government's ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The timing of the payment against which the offset will be 
imposed does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures.
    (b) The procedures required by this part shall be complied with 
promptly after the offset is imposed. Amounts recovered by offset, which 
are later found not to be owed to the Government, shall be promptly 
refunded to the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 608.825  Coordinating offset with other Federal agencies.

    (a)(1) Any creditor agency which requests the FCA to impose an 
offset against amounts owed to the debtor shall submit to the FCA a 
claim certification which meets the requirements of this paragraph. The 
FCA shall submit the same certification to any agency that the FCA 
requests to effect an offset.
    (2) The claim certification shall be in writing. It shall certify 
the debtor owes the debt and that all of the applicable requirements of 
31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met. If the intended offset 
is to be a salary offset, a claim certification shall instead certify 
that the debtor owes the debt and that the applicable requirements of 5 
U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met.
    (3) A certification that the debtor owes the debt shall state the 
amount of the debt, the factual basis supporting the determination of 
indebtedness, and the date on which payment of the debt was due. A 
certification that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 
have been met shall include a statement that the debtor has been sent a 
notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset at least 31 
calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a statement 
that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not required to be 
sent. A certification that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 
part 550, subpart K, have been met shall include a statement that the 
debtor has been sent a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset at 
least 31 calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a 
statement that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not 
required to be sent.

[[Page 43]]

    (b)(1) The FCA shall not effect an offset requested by another 
Federal agency without first obtaining the claim certification required 
by paragraph (a) of this section. If the FCA receives an incomplete 
claim certification, the FCA shall return the claim certification with 
notice that a claim certification which complies with the requirements 
of paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to the FCA before the 
FCA will consider effecting an offset.
    (2) The FCA may rely on the information contained in the claim 
certification provided by a requesting creditor agency. The FCA is not 
authorized to review a creditor agency's determination of indebtedness.
    (c) Only the creditor agency may agree to enter into an agreement 
with the debtor for the repayment of the claim. Only the creditor agency 
may agree to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection of the claim.
    (d) The FCA may decline, for good cause, a request by another agency 
to effect an offset. Good cause includes that the offset might disrupt, 
directly or indirectly, essential FCA operations. The refusal and the 
reasons shall be sent in writing to the creditor agency.


<R05>
Sec. 608.826  Stay of offset.

    (a)(1) When a creditor agency receives a debtor's request for 
inspection of agency records, the offset is stayed for 10 calendar days 
beyond the date set for the record inspection.
    (2) When a creditor agency receives a debtor's offer to enter into a 
repayment agreement, the offset is stayed until the debtor is notified 
as to whether the proposed agreement is acceptable.
    (3) When a review is conducted, the offset is stayed until the 
creditor agency issues a final written decision.
    (b) When offset is stayed, the amount of the debt and the amount of 
any accrued interest or other charges will be withheld from payments to 
the debtor. The withheld amounts shall not be applied against the debt 
until the stay expires. If withheld funds are later determined not to be 
subject to offset, they will be promptly refunded to the debtor.
    (c) If the FCA is the creditor agency and the offset is stayed, the 
FCA will immediately notify an offsetting agency to withhold the payment 
pending termination of the stay.


<R05>
Sec. 608.827  Offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

    The FCA may request that monies payable to a debtor from the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset to 
collect debts owed to the FCA by the debtor. The FCA must certify that 
the debtor owes the debt, the amount of the debt, and that the FCA has 
complied with the requirements set forth in this part, 4 CFR 102.3, and 
the Office of Personnel Management regulations. The request shall be 
submitted to the official designated in the Office of Personnel 
Management regulations to receive the request.


<R04>
                     Subpart C_Offset Against Salary


<R05>
Sec. 608.835  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 5 of the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365)(5 U.S.C. 5514), which authorizes 
the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal 
Government by means of salary offsets. These regulations provide 
procedures for the collection of a debt owed to the Government by the 
imposition of a salary offset against amounts payable to a Federal 
employee as salary. These regulations are consistent with the 
regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel 
Management, codified in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. Since salary offset 
is a type of administrative offset, this subpart supplements subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 608.836  Applicability of regulations.

    (a) These regulations apply to the following cases:
    (1) Where the FCA is owed a debt by an individual currently employed 
by another agency;
    (2) Where the FCA is owed a debt by an individual who is currently 
employed by the FCA; or

[[Page 44]]

    (3) Where the FCA currently employs an individual who owes a debt to 
another Federal agency. Upon receipt of proper certification from the 
creditor agency, the FCA will offset the debtor-employee's salary in 
accordance with these regulations.
    (b) These regulations do not apply to the following:
    (1) Debts or claims rising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 
et seq.); the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where 
collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or 
prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 
and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).
    (2) Any adjustment to pay arising from an employee's election of 
coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program 
requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was 
accumulated over four pay periods or less.
    (3) A claim which has been outstanding for more than 10 years after 
the creditor agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless 
facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known and 
could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials 
charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection of such 
debts.


<R05>
Sec. 608.837  Definitions.

    In this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:
    (a) Agency means:
    (1) An executive agency as defined by 5 U.S.C. 105, including the 
United States Postal Service and the United States Postal Rate 
Commission;
    (2) A military department as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102;
    (3) An agency or court of the judicial branch, including a court as 
defined in 28 U.S.C. 610, the District Court for the Northern Mariana 
Islands, and the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation;
    (4) An agency of the legislative branch, including the United States 
Senate and the United States House of Representatives; or
    (5) Other independent establishments that are entities of the 
Federal Government.
    (b) Disposable pay means, for an officially established pay 
interval, that part of current basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, 
retired pay, retainer pay, or, in the case of an employee not entitled 
to basic pay, other authorized pay, remaining after the deduction of any 
amount required by law to be withheld. The FCA shall allow the 
deductions described in 5 CFR 581.105 (b) through (f).
    (c) Employee means a current employee of the FCA or other agency, 
including a current member of the Armed Forces or Reserve of the Armed 
Forces of the United States.
    (d) Waiver means the cancellation, remission, forgiveness, or 
nonrecovery of a debt allegedly owed by an employee to the FCA or 
another agency as permitted or required by 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 
U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or any other law.


<R05>
Sec. 608.838  Waiver requests and claims to the General Accounting Office.

    (a) The regulations contained in this subpart do not preclude an 
employee from requesting a waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 
or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the 
amount or validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the 
General Accounting Office in accordance with the procedures prescribed 
by the General Accounting Office.
    (b) These regulations also do not preclude an employee from 
requesting a waiver pursuant to other statutory provisions pertaining to 
the particular debts being collected.


<R05>
Sec. 608.839  Procedures for salary offset.

    (a) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, shall determine the 
amount of an employee's disposable pay and the amount to be deducted 
from the employee's disposable pay at regular pay intervals.
    (b) Deductions shall begin within three official pay periods 
following the date of mailing or delivery of the Notice of Intent to 
Collect by Salary Offset.

[[Page 45]]

    (c)(1) If the amount of the debt is equal to or is less than 15 
percent of the employee's disposable pay, such debt should be collected 
in one lump-sum deduction.
    (2) If the amount of the debt is not collected in one lump-sum 
deduction, the debt shall be collected in installment deductions over a 
period of time not greater than the anticipated period of employment. 
The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable 
relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. 
However, the amount deducted from any pay period will not exceed 15 
percent of the employee's disposable pay for that period, unless the 
employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.
    (3) A deduction exceeding the 15-percent disposable pay limitation 
may be made from any final salary payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in 
order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated 
voluntarily or involuntarily.
    (4) Whenever an employee subject to salary offset is separated from 
the FCA and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of 
the final salary check pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the FCA may offset 
any later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt.
    (d) In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking 
salary offsets against current employees of the FCA or where two or more 
debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the FCA, at its discretion, 
may determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously 
within the 15-percent limitation. Debts owed to the FCA should generally 
take precedence over debts owed to other agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 608.840  Refunds.

    (a) In instances where the FCA is the creditor agency, it shall 
promptly refund any amounts deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 
5514 when:
    (1) The debt is waived or otherwise found not to be owed to the 
United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulations); 
or
    (2) An administrative or judicial order directs the FCA to make a 
refund.
    (b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under 
this section shall not bear interest.


<R05>
Sec. 608.841  Requesting current paying agency to offset salary.

    (a) To request a paying agency to impose a salary offset against 
amounts owed to the debtor, the FCA shall provide the paying agency with 
a claim certification which meets the requirements set forth in Sec. 
608.825(a). The FCA shall also provide the paying agency with a 
repayment schedule determined under the provisions of Sec. 608.839 or 
in accordance with a repayment agreement entered into with the debtor.
    (b) If the employee separates from the paying agency before the debt 
is paid in full, the paying agency shall certify the total amount 
collected on the debt. A copy of this certification shall be sent to the 
employee and a copy shall be sent to the FCA. If the paying agency is 
aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must 
provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such 
payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the 
provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, the 
FCA must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for 
making such payments before the collection can be made.
    (c) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the FCA is 
not required to repeat the due process procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 
5514 and this part to resume the collection. The FCA shall, however, 
review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the 
employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new 
paying agency.
    (d) If a special review is conducted pursuant to Sec. 608.811 and 
results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the FCA shall provide 
a new claim certification to the paying agency.


<R05>
Sec. 608.842  Responsibility of the FCA as the paying agency.

    (a) When the FCA receives a claim certification from a creditor 
agency, deductions should be scheduled to

[[Page 46]]

begin at the next officially established pay interval. The FCA shall 
send the debtor written notice which provides:
    (1) That the FCA has received a valid claim certification from the 
creditor agency;
    (2) The date on which salary offset will begin;
    (3) The amount of the debt; and
    (4) The amount of such deductions.
    (b) If, after the creditor agency has submitted the claim 
certification to the FCA, the employee transfers to a different agency 
before the debt is collected in full, the FCA must certify the total 
amount collected on the debt. The FCA shall send a copy of this 
certification to the creditor agency and a copy to the employee. If the 
FCA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil 
Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, 
it shall provide written notification to the agency responsible for 
making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount).


<R05>
Sec. 608.843  Nonwaiver of rights by payments.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt 
being collected under this subpart shall not be construed as a waiver of 
any rights the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other 
provisions of a written contract or law unless there are statutory or 
contractual provisions to the contrary.

<R04>
                         Subpart A_General Rules


<R05>
Sec. 609.905  Background.

    The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) wants to create a flexible 
regulatory environment that facilitates electronic commerce (E-commerce) 
and allows Farm Credit System (System) institutions and their customers 
to use new technologies. System institutions may use E-commerce but must 
establish good business practices that ensure safety and soundness while 
doing so.


<R05>
Sec. 609.910  Compliance with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (Public Law 106-229) (E-SIGN).

    (a) General. E-SIGN makes it easier to conduct E-commerce. With some 
exceptions, E-SIGN permits the use and establishes the legal validity of 
electronic contracts, electronic signatures, and records maintained in 
electronic rather than paper form. It governs transactions relating to 
the conduct of business, consumer, or commercial affairs between two or 
more persons. E-commerce is optional; all parties to a transaction must 
agree before it can be used.
    (b) Consumer transactions. E-SIGN contains extensive consumer 
disclosure provisions that apply whenever another consumer protection 
law, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, requires the disclosure 
of information to a consumer in writing. Consumer means an individual 
who obtains, through a transaction, products or services, including 
credit, used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. You 
must follow E-SIGN's specific procedures to make the required consumer 
disclosures electronically. E-SIGN's special disclosure rules for 
consumer transactions do not apply to business transactions. Under E-
SIGN, some System loans qualify as consumer transactions, while others 
are business transactions. You will need to distinguish between the two 
types of transactions to comply with E-SIGN.
    (c) Specific exceptions. E-SIGN does not permit electronic 
notification for notices of default, acceleration, repossession, 
foreclosure, eviction, or the right to cure, under a credit agreement 
secured by, or a rental agreement for, a person's primary residence. 
These notices require paper notification. The law also requires paper 
notification to cancel or terminate life insurance. Thus, System 
institutions cannot use electronic notification to deliver some notices 
that must be provided under part 617, subparts A, D, E, and G of this 
chapter. In addition, E-SIGN does not apply to the writing or signature 
requirements imposed under the Uniform Commercial Code, other than 
sections 1-107 and 1-206 and Articles 2 and 2A.
    (d) Promissory notes. E-SIGN establishes special technological and 
business process standards for electronic promissory notes secured by 
real estate. To treat an electronic version of

[[Page 48]]

such a promissory note as the equivalent of a paper promissory note, you 
must conform to E-SIGN's detailed requirements for transferable records. 
A transferable record is an electronic record that:
    (1) Would be a note under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code 
if the electronic record were in writing;
    (2) The issuer of the electronic record has expressly agreed is a 
transferable record; and
    (3) Relates to a loan secured by real property.
    (e) Effect on State and Federal law. E-SIGN preempts most State and 
Federal statutes or regulations, including the Farm Credit Act of 1971, 
as amended (Act), and its implementing regulations, that require 
contracts or other business, consumer, or commercial records to be 
written, signed, or in non-electronic form. Under E-SIGN, an electronic 
record or signature generally satisfies any provision of the Act, or its 
implementing regulations that requires such records and signatures to be 
written, signed, or in paper form. Therefore, unless an exception 
applies or a necessary condition under E-SIGN has not been met, an 
electronic record or signature satisfies any applicable provision of the 
Act or its implementing regulations.
    (f) Document integrity and signature authentication. Each System 
institution must verify the legitimacy of an E-commerce communication, 
transaction, or access request. Document integrity ensures that the same 
document is provided to all parties. Signature authentication proves the 
identities of all parties. The parties to the transaction may determine 
how to ensure document integrity and signature authentication.
    (g) Records retention. Each System institution may maintain all 
records electronically even if originally they were paper records. The 
stored electronic record must accurately reflect the information in the 
original record. The electronic record must be accessible and capable of

<R05>
Sec. 609.915  Compliance with Federal Reserve Board Regulations B, M, and Z.

    The regulations in this part require fair practices and meaningful 
disclosures for certain lending and leasing activities. System 
institutions must comply with Federal Reserve Board Regulations B (Equal 
Credit Opportunity), M (Consumer Leasing), and Z (Truth in Lending) (12 
CFR parts 202, 213, and 226).


<R04>
                Subpart B_Interpretations and Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 609.920  Interpretations.

    (a) E-SIGN preempts most statutes and regulations, including the Act 
and its implementing regulations that require paper copies and 
handwritten signatures in business, consumer, or commercial 
transactions. E-SIGN requires that statutes and regulations be 
interpreted to allow E-commerce as long as the safeguards of E-SIGN are 
met and its exceptions recognized. Generally, an electronic record or 
signature satisfies any provision of the Act or its implementing 
regulations that require such records and signatures to be written, 
signed, or in paper form.
    (b) System institutions may interpret the Act and its implementing 
regulations broadly to allow electronic transmissions, communications, 
records, and submissions, as provided by E-SIGN. This means that the 
terms address, copy, distribute, document, file, mail, notice, notify, 
record, provide, send, signature, sent, written, writing, and similar 
words generally should be interpreted to permit electronic 
transmissions, communications, records, and submissions in business, 
consumer, or commercial transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 609.925  Definitions.

    We provide the following definitions that apply to the Act and its 
implementing regulations:
    (a) Electronic means relating to technology having electrical, 
digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar 
capabilities.
    (b) Electronic communication means a message that can be transmitted 
electronically and displayed on equipment

[[Page 49]]

as visual text. An example is a message displayed on a personal computer 
monitor screen. This does not include audio- and voice-response 
telephone systems.
    (c) Electronic business (E-business) or electronic commerce (E-
commerce) means buying, selling, producing, or working in an electronic 
medium.
    (d) Electronic mail (E-mail) means:
    (1) To send or submit information electronically; or
    (2) A communication received electronically.
    (e) Electronic signature means an electronic sound, symbol, or 
process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other 
record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the 
record. Electronic signature describes a category of electronic 
processes that can be substituted for a handwritten signature.


<R04>
              Subpart C_Standards for Boards and Management


<R05>
Sec. 609.930  Policies and procedures.

    The FCA supports E-commerce and wants to facilitate it and other new 
technologies and innovations to enhance the efficient conduct of 
business and the delivery of safe and sound credit and closely related 
services. Through E-commerce, System institutions can enhance customer 
service, access information, and provide alternate communication 
systems. At the same time, E-commerce presents challenges and risks that 
your board must carefully consider in advance. Before engaging in E-
commerce, you must weigh its business risks against its benefits. You 
must also adopt E-commerce policies and procedures to ensure your 
institution's safety and soundness and compliance with law and 
regulations. Among other concerns, the policies and procedures must 
address, when applicable:
    (a) Security and integrity of System institution and borrower data;
    (b) The privacy of your customers as well as visitors to your Web 
site;
    (c) Notices to customers or visitors to your Web site when they link 
to an affiliate or third party Web site;
    (d) Capability of vendor or application providers;
    (e) Business resumption after disruption;
    (f) Fraud and money laundering;
    (g) Intrusion detection and management;
    (h) Liability insurance; and
    (i) Prompt reporting of known or suspected criminal violations 
associated with E-commerce to law enforcement authorities and FCA under 
part 612, subpart B of this chapter.

[67 FR 16631, Apr. 8, 2002; 69 FR 42853, July 19, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 609.935  Business planning.

    When engaging in E-commerce, the business plan required under part 
618 of this chapter, subpart J, must describe the E-commerce initiative, 
including intended objectives, business risks, security issues, relevant 
markets, and legal compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 609.940  Internal systems and controls.

    When applicable, internal systems and controls must provide 
reasonable assurances that System institutions will:
    (a) Follow and achieve business plan objectives and policies and 
procedures requirements regarding E-commerce; and
    (b) Prevent and detect material deficiencies on a timely basis.


<R05>
Sec. 609.945  Records retention.

    Records stored electronically must be accurate, accessible, and 
reproducible for later reference.


<R04>
      Subpart D_General Requirements for Electronic Communications


<R05>
Sec. 609.950  Electronic communications.

    (a) Agreement. In accordance with E-SIGN, System institutions may 
communicate electronically in business, consumer, or commercial 
transactions. E-commerce transactions require the agreement of all 
parties when you do business.
    (b) Communications with consumers. E-SIGN and Federal Reserve Board 
Regulations B, M, and Z (12 CFR parts 202, 213, and 226) outline 
specific disclosure requirements for communications with consumers.

[[Page 50]]

    (c) Communications with parties other than consumers. The consumer 
disclosure requirements of E-SIGN and of Federal Reserve Board 
Regulation B (12 CFR part 202) do not apply to your communications with 
parties other than consumers. (Federal Reserve Board Regulations M and Z 
(12 CFR parts 213 and 226) apply to consumers only.) Nonetheless, you 
must ensure that your communications, including those disclosures 
required under the Act and the regulations in this part, demonstrate 
good business practices in the delivery of credit and closely related 
services and in your obtaining goods and services.

<R05>
Sec. 611.210  Director qualifications and training.

    (a) Qualifications. (1) Each bank and association board of directors 
must establish and maintain a policy identifying desirable director 
qualifications. The policy must explain the type and level of knowledge 
and experience desired for board members, explaining how the desired 
qualifications were identified. The policy must be periodically updated 
and provided to the institution's nominating committee.
    (2) Each Farm Credit institution board must have a director who is a 
financial expert. Boards of directors for associations with $500 million 
or less in total assets as of January 1 of each year may satisfy this 
requirement by retaining an advisor who is a financial expert. The 
financial advisor must report to the board of directors and be free of 
any affiliation with the external auditor or institution management. A 
financial expert is one recognized as having education or experience in: 
Accounting, internal accounting controls, or preparing or reviewing 
financial statements for financial institutions or large corporations 
consistent with the breadth and complexity of accounting and financial 
reporting issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by the 
institution's financial statements.
    (b) Training. Each bank and association board of directors must 
establish and maintain a policy for director training that includes 
appropriate implementing procedures. The policy must identify training 
areas supporting desired director qualifications. Each Farm Credit bank 
and association must require newly elected or appointed directors to 
complete director orientation training within 1 year of assuming their 
position and require incumbent directors to attend training periodically 
to advance their skills.


<R05>
Sec. 611.220  Outside directors.

    (a) Eligibility, number and term. (1) Eligibility. No candidate for 
an outside director position may be a director, officer, employee, 
agent, or stockholder of an institution in the Farm Credit System. Farm 
Credit banks and associations must make a reasonable effort to select 
outside directors possessing some or all of the desired director 
qualifications identified pursuant to Sec. 611.210(a) of this part.
    (2) Number. Stockholder-elected directors must constitute at least 
60 percent of the members of each institution's board.
    (i) Each Farm Credit bank must have at least two outside directors.
    (ii) Associations with total assets exceeding $500 million as of 
January 1 of each year must have no fewer than two outside directors on 
the board. However, this requirement does not apply if it causes the 
percent of stockholder-elected directors to be less than 75 percent of 
the board.
    (iii) Associations with $500 million or less in total assets as of 
January 1 of each year must have at least one outside director.
    (3) Terms of office. Banks and associations may not establish a 
different term of office for outside directors than that established for 
stockholder-elected directors.

[[Page 52]]

    (b) Removal. Each institution must establish and maintain procedures 
for removal of outside directors. When the removal of an outside 
director is sought before the expiration of the outside director's term, 
the reason for removal must be documented. An institution's director 
removal procedures must allow for removal of an outside director by a 
majority vote of all voting stockholders voting, in person or by proxy, 
or by a two-thirds majority vote of the full board of directors. The 
outside director subject to the removal action is prohibited from voting 
in his or her own removal action.

association board who is or has been, within 1 year preceding the date 
the term of office begins, a salaried officer or employee of any bank or 
association in the System.
    (b) No bank or association director shall be eligible to continue to 
serve in that capacity and his or her office shall become vacant if 
after election as a member of the board, he or she becomes legally 
incompetent or is convicted of a felony or held liable in damages for 
fraud.
    (c) No bank director shall, within 1 year after the date when he or 
she ceases to be a member of the board, serve as a salaried officer or 
employee of such bank, or any association with which the bank has a 
discount or agent relationship.
    (d) No director of an association shall, within 1 year after he or

    (a) Each System institution shall adopt policies and procedures that 
are designed to assure that the elections of board members are conducted 
in an impartial manner.
    (b) No employee or agent of a Farm Credit institution shall take any 
part, directly or indirectly, in the nomination or election of members 
to the board of directors of a Farm Credit institution, or make any 
statement, either orally or in writing, which may be construed as 
intended to influence any vote in such nominations, or elections. This 
paragraph shall not prohibit employees or agents from providing 
biographical and other similar information or engaging in other 
activities pursuant to policies and procedures for nominations and 
elections. This paragraph does not affect the right of an employee or 
agent to nominate or vote for stockholder-elected directors of an 
institution in which the employee or agent is a voting member.
    (c) No property, facilities, or resources of any System institution 
shall be used by any candidate for nomination or election or by any 
other person for the benefit of any candidate for nomination or 
election, unless the same property, facilities, or resources are 
simultaneously available and made known to be available for use by all 
declared candidates.
    (d) No director, employee, or agent of a System institution shall, 
for the purpose of furthering the interests of any candidates for 
nomination or election, furnish or make use of records that are not made 
available for use by all declared candidates.
    (e) No Farm Credit institution may in any way distribute or mail, 
whether at the expense of the institution or another, any campaign 
materials for director candidates. Institutions may request biographical 
information, as well as the disclosure information required under Sec. 
620.21(d), from all declared candidates who certify that they are 
eligible, restate such information in a standard format, and distribute 
or mail it with ballots or proxy ballots.

Sec. 611.325  Bank and association nominating committees.

    Nominating committees must conduct themselves in the impartial 
manner prescribed by the policies and procedures adopted by their 
institution under Sec. 611.320.
    (a) Composition. The voting stockholders of each bank and 
association must elect a nominating committee of no fewer than three 
members. No individual may serve on a nominating committee who, at the 
time of selection to or during service on a nominating committee, is an 
employee, director, or agent of that bank or association. A nominating 
committee member may not be a candidate for election to the board in the 
same election for which the committee is identifying nominees.
    (b) Responsibilities. It is the responsibility of each nominating 
committee to identify, evaluate, and nominate candidates for stockholder 
election to a bank or association board of directors.
    (1) Each nominating committee must nominate individuals whom the 
committee determines meet the eligibility requirements to run for 
director positions. The committee must endeavor to assure representation 
from all areas of the institution's territory and as nearly as possible 
all types of agriculture practiced within the territory.
    (2) The nominating committee must evaluate the qualifications of the 
director candidates. The evaluation process must consider whether there 
are any known obstacles preventing a candidate from performing the 
duties of the position.
    (3) Each committee must nominate at least two candidates for each 
director position being voted on by stockholders. If two nominees cannot 
be identified, the nominating committee must provide written explanation 
to the existing board of the efforts to locate candidates or the reasons 
for disqualifying any other candidate that resulted in fewer than two 
nominees.
    (c) Resources. Each bank and association must provide its nominating 
committee reasonable access to administrative resources in order for the 
committee to perform its duties. Banks and associations must, at a 
minimum, provide their nominating committees with a current list of 
stockholders, the most recent bylaws, the current director 
qualifications policy, and a copy of the policies and procedures that 
the bank or the association has adopted pursuant to Sec. 611.320(a) 
assuring impartial elections. On the request of the nominating 
committee, the institution must also provide a summary of the current 
board self-evaluation. The bank or association may require a pledge of 
confidentiality by committee members prior to releasing evaluation 
documents.

[71 FR 5762, Feb. 2, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 611.330  Confidentiality in voting.

    (a) No bank or association may use signed ballots in stockholder 
votes. Each bank and association must adopt policies and procedures to 
ensure that all information and materials regarding how or whether an 
individual stockholder has voted remain confidential, including with 
respect to the institution, its directors, stockholders, or employees, 
or any other person except:
    (1) An independent third party tabulating the vote; or
    (2) The Farm Credit Administration.
    (b) A bank or association may use balloting procedures, such as an 
identity code on the ballot, that can be used to identify how or whether 
an individual stockholder has voted only if the votes are tabulated by 
an independent third party. In weighted voting, the votes must be 
tabulated by an independent third party. An independent third party that 
tabulates the votes must certify in writing that such party will not 
disclose to any person (including the institution, its directors, 
stockholders, or employees) any information about how or whether an 
individual stockholder has voted, except that the information must be 
disclosed to the Farm Credit Administration if requested.
    (c) Once a bank or association receives a ballot, the vote of that 
stockholder is final, except that a stockholder may withdraw a proxy 
ballot before balloting begins at a stockholders' meeting.
    (d) A bank or association may give a stockholder voting by proxy an 
opportunity to give voting discretion to the

[[Page 54]]

proxy of the stockholder's choice, provided that the proxy is also a 
stockholder eligible to vote.

[63 FR 64843, Nov. 24, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 611.340  Security in voting.

    (a) Each bank and association must adopt policies and procedures 
that assure the security of all records and materials related to a 
stockholder vote including, but not limited to, ballots, proxy ballots, 
and other related materials.
    (b) Bank and association procedures must assure that ballots and 
proxy ballots are provided only to stockholders who are eligible to 
vote.
    (c) Ballots and proxy ballots must be safeguarded before the time of 
distribution or mailing to voting stockholders and after the time of 
receipt by the bank or association until disposal. In an election of 
directors, ballots, proxy ballots and election records must be retained 
at least until the end of the term of office of the director. In other 
stockholder votes, ballots, proxy ballots, and records must be retained 
for at least 3 years after the vote.
    (d) The voting procedures of each institution must provide for the 
establishment of a tellers committee or other designated group of 
persons which must be responsible for validating ballots and proxies and 
tabulating voting results. An institution and its officers, directors, 
and employees may not make any public announcement of the results of a 
stockholder vote before the tellers committee or other designated 
persons have validated the results of the vote.

            Subpart D_Rules for Compensation of Board Members


<R05>
Sec. 611.400  Compensation of bank board members.

    (a) Farm Credit System banks are authorized to pay fair and 
reasonable compensation to directors for services performed in an 
official capacity at a rate not to exceed the level established in 
section 4.21 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, unless the FCA 
determines that such a level adversely affects the safety and soundness 
of the institution.
    (b) The bank director compensation level established in section 4.21 
of the Act shall be adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) for all urban consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, in the following manner: Current year's maximum compensation 
= Prior year's maximum compensation adjusted by the prior year's annual 
average percent change in the CPI for all urban consumers. Adjustments 
will be made to the bank director statutory compensation limit beginning 
from October 28, 1992 (the date of enactment of the Farm Credit Banks 
and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992). Additionally, each 
year the FCA will distribute a bookletter to all FCS banks that 
communicates the CPI adjusted bank director statutory compensation 
limit.
    (c)(1) A Farm Credit bank is authorized to pay a director up to 30 
percent more than the statutory compensation limit in exceptional 
circumstances where the director contributes extraordinary time and 
effort in the service of the bank and its shareholders.
    (2) Banks must document the exceptional circumstances justifying 
additional director compensation. The documentation must describe:
    (i) The exceptional circumstances justifying the additional director 
compensation, including the extraordinary time and effort the director 
devoted to bank business; and
    (ii) The amount and the terms and conditions of the additional 
director compensation.
    (d) Each bank board shall adopt a written policy regarding 
compensation

[[Page 55]]

of bank directors. The policy shall address, at a minimum, the following 
areas:
    (1) The activities or functions for which attendance is necessary 
and appropriate and may be compensated, except that a Farm Credit System 
bank shall not compensate any director for rendering services on behalf 
of any other Farm Credit System institution or a cooperative of which 
the director is a member, or for performing other assignments of a non-
official nature;
    (2) The methodology for determining each director's rate of 
compensation; and
    (3) The exceptional circumstances under which the board would pay 
additional compensation for any of its directors as authorized by 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Directors may also be reimbursed for reasonable travel, 
subsistence, and other related expenses in accordance with the bank's 
policy.

to Federal land bank associations. The regulations in this subpart set 
forth the procedures and voting and approval requirements applicable to 
such transfers.


<R05>
Sec. 611.501  Procedures.

    (a) The boards of directors of a bank and an association which seek 
to transfer authorities may adopt appropriate resolutions approving such 
transfer and providing for the submission of such a proposal to their 
respective stockholders for a vote.
    (b) The resolutions accompanied by the following information shall 
be submitted to the Farm Credit Administration for review and approval:

the affiliated bank.
    (h) No director, officer, or employee of a bank or an association

information required under paragraph (e) of this section in furtherance 
of meaningful disclosure to stockholders. Any waiver sought under this 
paragraph shall be obtained before preparation of the financial 
statements and accompanying schedules required under paragraph (e) of 
this section.

    (k) The effective date of a merger or consolidation may not be less 
than 35 days after the date of mailing of the notification to 
stockholders of the results of the stockholder vote, or 15 days after 
the date of submission to the Farm Credit Administration of all required 
documents for the Agency's consideration of final approval, whichever 
occurs later. If a petition for reconsideration is filed within 35 days 
after mailing of the notification to stockholders of the results of the 
stockholder vote, the constituent institutions must agree on a second 
effective date to be used in the event the merger or consolidation is 
approved on reconsideration. The second effective date may not be less 
than 60 days after stockholder notification of the results of the first 
vote, or 15 days after the date of the reconsideration vote, whichever

<R05>
Sec. 611.1130  Inter-System transfer of funds and equities.

    (a) Section 5.17(a)(6) of the Act authorizes the FCA to regulate the 
borrowing, repayment, and transfer of funds and equities between 
institutions of the System, including banks, associations, and service 
organizations organized under the Act. This section sets forth the 
circumstances and procedures under which the FCA may direct such a 
transfer of funds and equities based on its determination with respect 
to the financial condition of one or more institutions of the System. 
For purposes of this section, the term ``bond'' refers to long-term 
notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations, or short-term 
discount notes issued by one or more banks pursuant to section 4.2 of 
the Act.
    (b) The FCA may direct a transfer of funds or equities by one or 
more banks of the System to another bank of the System where it 
determines that:
    (1) The receiving institution will not be able to make payments of 
principal or interest on bonds for which it is primarily liable within 
the meaning of section 4.4(a) of the Act; or
    (2) The common or preferred stock, participation certificates, or 
allocated equities of the receiving institution have a book value less 
than their par or stated values; or
    (3) The total bonds outstanding for which the receiving institution 
is primarily liable exceed 20 times the combined capital and surplus 
accounts of the bank; or
    (4) Based on application to it of one or more of the following 
ratios, the receiving institution is not financially viable in that it 
will not be able to continue to extend new or additional credit or 
financial assistance to its eligible borrowers:
    (i) The ratio of stock to earned net worth (including legal reserve, 
unallocated and reserved surplus, undistributed earnings, and allowance 
for losses) exceeds 2 to 1;
    (ii) The ratio of the outstanding bonds to capital and surplus 
exceeds 15 to 1;
    (iii) Nonearning assets (any noninterest-bearing assets, including 
but not limited to cash, noninterest-earning loans, net fixed assets, 
other property owned, accrued interest receivable, and accounts 
receivable) exceed 15 percent of total assets;
    (iv) Lendable net worth (interest-earning assets less interest-
bearing liabilities) is zero or less.
    (c) The FCA may direct a transfer of funds or equities between two 
or more Federal land bank associations or two or more production credit 
associations in district where it determines that such transfer:
    (1) Is necessary to provide financial support to the district bank 
in which those associations are stockholders based on application of the 
criteria to the bank as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (2) Is necessary to provide financial support to one or more other 
like associations in the district based on application of the criteria 
set forth in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4) of this section to the 
associations, provided that in applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this 
section the ratio of outstanding indebtedness to capital and surplus of 
the receiving association(s) shall not exceed 9 to 1; or
    (3) Is an integral part of a plan that has been adopted by other 
institutions of the System, and approved by the FCA, under which those 
institutions will extend financial assistance to the district bank in 
which those associations are stockholders.
    (d) A direction by the FCA for a transfer of funds or equities 
pursuant to this section shall be signed by the Chairman and shall 
establish the

[[Page 69]]

amount, timing, duration, repayment, and other terms of assessments 
necessary to accomplish such transfer, taking into consideration the 
financial condition of each institution to be assessed. Where the FCA 
directs a transfer of funds or equities between associations under 
paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, it may authorize the district 
bank in which such associations are stockholders to accomplish the 
necessary assessments through debits and credits to the accounts of the 
bank.

acting alone or with other Farm Credit banks or associations to perform, 
for you or on your behalf, any function or service that you are 
authorized to perform under the Act and Farm Credit Administration (we, 
us, or our) regulations, with two exceptions. Those exceptions are that 
your corporation may not extend credit or provide insurance services. To 
organize a service corporation, you must submit an application to us 
following the applicable requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. 
If what you propose in your application meets the requirements of the

will be subject to examination, supervision, and regulation by us.

service corporation may only issue voting and non-voting stock to:
    (i) One or more Farm Credit banks and associations; and

corporation as a corporate body and a federally chartered

imposing minimum capital requirements, as we deem appropriate. For good 
cause, we may deny your application.
    (e) Once your service corporation is formed, how are its articles of 
incorporation amended? Your service corporation's articles of 
incorporation may be amended in either of two ways:
    (1) The board of directors of the corporation may request that we 
amend the articles of incorporation by sending us a certified resolution 
of the board of directors of the service corporation that states the:

    (ii) Reason(s) for the amendment;
    (iii) Language of the articles of incorporation provision, as

Sec. 611.1210  Advance notices--commencement resolution and notice to equity holders.

    (a) Adoption of commencement resolution. Your board of directors 
must begin the termination process by adopting a commencement resolution 
stating your intention to terminate Farm Credit status under section 
7.10 of the Act. Immediately after you adopt the commencement 
resolution, send a certified copy by overnight mail to us and to the 
Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC). If your institution is 
an association, also send a copy to your affiliated bank. If your 
institution is a bank, also send a copy to your affiliated associations, 
the other Farm Credit banks, and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding 
Corporation (Funding Corporation).
    (b) Advance notice. Within 5 business days after adopting the 
commencement resolution, you must:
    (1) Send us copies of all contracts and agreements related to the 
termination.
    (2) Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section:
    (i) Send an advance notice to all equity holders stating you are 
taking steps to terminate System status. Immediately upon mailing the 
notice to equity holders, you must also place it in a prominent location 
on your Web site. The advance notice must describe the following:
    (A) The process of termination;
    (B) The expected effect of termination on borrowers and other equity 
holders, including the effect on borrower rights and the consequences of 
any stock retirements before termination;
    (C) The type of charter the successor institution will have; and
    (D) Any bylaw creating a special class of borrower stock and 
participation certificates under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (ii) Send us a draft of the advance notice by facsimile or 
electronic mail before mailing it to your equity holders. If we have not 
contacted you within 2 business days of our receipt of the draft notice 
regarding modifications, you may mail the notice to your equity holders.
    (c) Bank negotiations on joint and several liability. If your 
institution is a terminating bank, within 10 days of adopting the 
commencement resolution, your bank and the other Farm Credit banks must 
begin negotiations to provide for your satisfaction of liabilities 
(other than your primary liability) under section 4.4 of the Act. The 
Funding Corporation may, at its option, be a party to the negotiations 
to the extent necessary to fulfill its duties with respect to financing 
and disclosure. The agreement must comply with the requirements in Sec. 
611.1270(c).
    (d) Disclosure to loan applicants and equity holders after 
commencement resolution. Between the date your board of directors adopts 
the commencement resolution and the termination date, you must give the 
following information to your loan applicants and equity holders:
    (1) For each loan applicant who is not a current stockholder, 
describe at the time of loan application:
    (i) The effect of the proposed termination on the prospective loan; 
and
    (ii) Whether, after the proposed termination, the borrower will 
continue to have any of the borrower rights provided under the Act and 
regulations.
    (2) For any equity holders who ask to have their equities retired, 
explain that the retirement would extinguish

[[Page 72]]

the holder's right to exchange those equities for an interest in the 
successor institution. In addition, inform holders of equities entitled 
to your residual assets in liquidation that retirement before 
termination would extinguish their right to dissent from the termination 
and have their equities retired.
    (e) Terminating bank's right to continue issuing debt. Through the 
termination date, a terminating bank may continue to participate in the 
issuance of consolidated and System-wide obligations to the same extent 
it would be able to participate if it were not terminating.
    (f) Special class of stock. Notwithstanding any requirements to the 
contrary in Sec. 615.5230(b) of this chapter, you may adopt bylaws 
providing for the issuance of a special class of stock and participation 
certificates between the date of adoption of a commencement resolution 
and the termination date. Your voting stockholders must approve the 
special class before you adopt the commencement resolution. The equities 
must comply with section 4.3A of the Act and be identical in all 
respects to existing classes of equities that are entitled to the 
residual assets of the institution in a liquidation, except for the 
value a holder will receive in a termination. In a termination, the 
holder of the special class of stock receives value equal to the lower 
of either par (or face) value, or the value calculated under Sec. 
611.1280(c) and (d). A holder must have the same right to vote (if the 
equity is held on the voting record date) and to dissent as holders of 
similar equities issued before the commencement resolution. If the 
termination does not occur, the special classes of stock and 
participation certificates must automatically convert into shares of the 
otherwise identical equities.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1211  Special requirements.

    (a) Special assessments, analyses, studies, and rulings. At any time 
after we receive your commencement resolution, and as we deem necessary 
or useful to evaluate your proposal, we may require you to engage 
independent experts, acceptable to us, to conduct assessments, analyses, 
or studies, or to request rulings, including, but not limited to:
    (1) Assessments of fair value;
    (2) Analyses and rulings on tax implications; and
    (3) Studies of the effect of your proposal on equity holders 
(including the effect on holders in their capacity as borrowers), the 
System, and other parties.
    (b) Informational meetings. After the advance notice, but before the 
stockholder vote, we may require you to hold regional or local 
informational meetings in convenient locations, at convenient times, and 
in a manner conducive to accommodating all equity holders that wish to 
attend, to discuss equity holder issues and answer questions. These 
meetings are subject to the plain language requirements of Sec. 
611.1217(b) regarding balanced statements.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1215  Communications with the public and equity holders.

    (a) Communications after commencement resolution and before 
termination. The terminating institution may communicate with equity 
holders and the public regarding the proposed termination, as long as 
written communications (other than non-public communications among 
participants, i.e., persons or entities that are parties to a proposed 
corporate restructuring involving the successor institution, or their 
agents) made in connection with or relating to the proposed termination 
and any related transactions are filed in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section and the conditions in this section are satisfied.
    (b) To rely on this section, you must include the following legend 
in each communication in a prominent location:

    Equity holders should read the plan of termination that they have 
received or will receive (as appropriate) because it contains important 
information, including an enumerated statement of the anticipated 
benefits and potential disadvantages of the proposal.

    (c) All your written communications and all written communications 
by your directors, employees, and agents in connection with or relating 
to the proposed termination or any related transactions must be filed

[[Page 73]]

    (d) We will require you to correct communications that we deem are 
misleading or inaccurate.
    (e) In addition to the filings we require under paragraph (c) of 
this section, we may require you to file timely any written 
communications you have knowledge of that are made by any other 
participants or their agents in connection with or related to the 
proposed termination or to any transaction related to the proposed 
termination.
    (f) An immaterial or unintentional failure to file or a delay in 
filing a written communication described in this section will not result 
in a violation of this section, as long as:
    (1) A good faith and reasonable effort was made to comply with the 
filing requirement; and
    (2) The written communication is filed as soon as practicable after 
discovery of the failure to file.
    (g) Communications that exist in electronic form must be filed 
electronically with the FCA as we direct. For communications that do not 
exist in electronic form, you must timely notify us by electronic mail 
and send us a copy by regular mail.
    (h) You do not need to file a written communication that does not 
contain new or different information from that which you have previously 
publicly disclosed and filed under this section.


<R05>

    (c) You may request that we treat specific information as 
confidential under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (see 12 
CFR part, 602 subpart B). You should draft your request for confidential 
treatment narrowly to extend only to those portions of a document you 
consider to be confidential. If you request confidential treatment for 
information that we do not consider to be confidential, we may post that 
information on our Web site after providing notice to you. On our own 
initiative, we may determine that certain information should be treated 
as confidential and, if so, we will not make that information public.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1217  Plain language requirements.

    (a) Plain language presentation. All communications to equity 
holders required under Sec. Sec. 611.1210, 611.1223, 611.1240, and 
611.1280 must be clear, concise, and understandable. You must:
    (1) Use short, explanatory sentences, bullet lists or charts where 
helpful, and descriptive headings and subheadings;

same degree of detail.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1218  Role of directors.

    (a) Statements by directors. Directors may not be prohibited by 
confidentiality agreements or otherwise from publicly or privately 
commenting orally or in writing on the termination proposal and related 
matters.
    (b) Directors' right to obtain independent advice. One or more 
directors of a terminating institution or an institution that is 
considering terminating have the right to obtain independent legal and 
financial advice regarding the proposed termination and related 
transactions. The institution must pay for such advice and related 
expenses as are reasonable in light of the circumstances. A request by a 
director or directors for the institution to pay

[[Page 74]]

such expenses cannot be denied unless the board of directors, by at 
least a two-thirds vote of the full board (the total number of current 
directors), denies the request. The institution must act on any request 
in a timely manner. For any denial of payment, the board must provide 
notice to the FCA within 1 business day of the denial, fully document 
the reasons for such a denial, and ensure that the institution discloses 
the nature of the request and the reasons for any denial to the 
terminating institution's equity holders in the plan of termination.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1219  Prohibited acts.

    (a) Statements about termination. Neither the institution nor any 
director, officer, employee, or agent may make any untrue or misleading 
statement of a material fact, or fail to disclose any material fact, to 
the FCA or a current or prospective equity holder about the proposed 
termination and any related transactions.
    (b) Representations regarding FCA approval. Neither the institution 
nor any director, officer, employee, or agent may make an oral or 
written representation to anyone that our approval of the plan of 
termination or the termination is, directly or indirectly, either a 
recommendation on the merits of the proposal or an assurance that the 
information you give to your equity holders is adequate or accurate.

within 60 days after the date on which you mailed to stockholders the 
results of the termination vote.
    (b) Quorum requirement for termination reconsideration vote. At 
least 30 percent, unless your bylaws provide for a higher quorum, of the 
voting stockholders of the institution must be present at the 
stockholders' meeting either in person or by proxy in order to hold the 
reconsideration vote. If a majority of the voting stockholders voting in 
person or by proxy vote against the termination, the termination may not 
take place.
    (c) Stockholder list and expenses. You must, at your expense, timely 
give stockholders who request it a list of the names and addresses of 
stockholders eligible to vote in the reconsideration vote. The 
petitioners must pay all other expenses for the petition. You must pay 
expenses that you incur for the reconsideration vote.

<R05>
Sec. 611.1250  Preliminary exit fee estimate.

    (a) Preliminary exit fee estimate--terminating association. You must 
provide a preliminary exit fee estimate to us when you submit the plan 
of termination under Sec. 611.1221. Calculate the preliminary exit fee 
estimate in the following order:
    (1) Base your exit fee calculation on the average daily balances of 
assets and liabilities for the 12-month period as of the quarter end 
immediately before the date you send us your plan of termination.
    (2) Any amounts we refer to in this section are average daily 
balances unless we specify that they are not. Amounts that are not 
average daily balances will be referred to as ``dollar amount.''
    (3) Compute the average daily balances based on financial statements 
that comply with GAAP. The financial statements, as of the quarter end 
immediately before the date you send us your plan of termination, must 
be independently audited by a qualified public accountant. We may, in 
our discretion, waive the audit requirement if an independent audit was 
performed as of a date less than 6 months before you submit the plan of 
termination.
    (4) Make adjustments to assets as follows:
    (i) Add back expenses you have incurred related to termination. 
Related expenses include, but are not limited to, legal services, 
accounting services, tax services, studies, auditing, business planning, 
equity holder meetings, and application fees for the termination and 
reorganization. Do not add back to

[[Page 80]]

assets expenses related to a requirement by the FCA to engage 
independent experts to conduct assessments, analyses, or studies, or to 
request rulings that solely address the impact of the termination on the 
System or parties other than the terminating institution and its 
stockholders.
    (ii) Subtract the dollar amount of estimated current and deferred 
tax expenses, if any, due to the termination.
    (iii) Add the dollar amount of estimated current and deferred tax 
benefits, if any, due to the termination.
    (iv) Adjust for the dollar amount of significant transactions you 
reasonably expect to occur between the quarter end before you file your 
plan of termination and date of termination. Examples of these 
transactions include, but are not limited to, gains or losses on the 
sale of assets, retirements of equity, loan repayments, and patronage 
distributions. Do not make adjustments for future expenses related to 
termination, such as severance or special retirement payments, or stock 
retirements to dissenting stockholders and Farm Credit institutions.
    (5) Subtract from liabilities any liability that we treat as 
regulatory capital under the capital or collateral requirements in 
subparts H and K of part 615 of this chapter.
    (6) Make any adjustments we require under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (7) After making these adjustments to assets and liabilities, 
subtract liabilities from assets. This is your preliminary total capital 
for purposes of termination.
    (8) Multiply assets as adjusted above by 6 percent, and subtract 
this amount from preliminary total capital. This is your preliminary 
exit fee estimate.
    (b) Preliminary exit fee estimate--terminating bank.
    (1) Affiliated associations that are terminating with you must 
calculate their individual preliminary exit fee estimates as described 
in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Base your exit fee calculation on the average daily balances of 
assets and liabilities for the 12-month period as of the quarter end 
immediately before the date you send us your plan of termination.
    (3) Any amounts we refer to in this section are average daily 
balances unless we specify that they are not. Amounts that are not 
average daily balances will be referred to as ``dollar amount.''
    (4) Compute the average daily balances based on bank-only financial 
statements that comply with GAAP. The financial statements, as of the 
quarter end immediately before the date you send us your plan of 
termination, must be independently audited by a qualified public 
accountant. We may, in our discretion, waive this requirement if an 
independent audit was performed as of a date less than 6 months before 
you submit the plan of termination.
    (5) Make adjustments to assets and liabilities as follows:
    (i) Add back to assets the following:
    (A) Expenses you have incurred related to termination. Related 
expenses include, but are not limited to, legal services, accounting 
services, tax services, studies, auditing, business planning, equity 
holder meetings, and application fees for the termination and 
reorganization. Do not add back to assets expenses related to a 
requirement by the FCA to engage independent experts to conduct 
assessments, analyses, or studies, or to request rulings that solely 
address the impact of the termination on the System or parties other 
than the terminating institution and its stockholders.
    (B) Any specific allowance for losses, and a pro rata portion of any 
general allowance for loan losses, on direct loans to associations that 
you do not expect to incur before or at termination.
    (ii) Subtract from your assets and liabilities an amount equal to 
your direct loans to your affiliated associations that are not 
terminating.
    (iii) Subtract the following from assets:
    (A) Equity investments in your institution that are held by 
nonterminating associations and that you expect to transfer to another 
System bank before or at termination. A nonterminating association's 
investment consists of purchased equities, allocated equities, and a 
share of the bank's unallocated surplus calculated in accordance with

[[Page 81]]

the bank's bylaw provisions on liquidation. We may require a different 
calculation method for the unallocated surplus if we determine that 
using the liquidation provision would be inequitable to stockholders; 
and
    (B) The dollar amount of estimated current and deferred tax 
expenses, if any, due to the termination.
    (iv) Add the dollar amount of current and deferred estimated tax 
benefits, if any, due to the termination.
    (v) Subtract from liabilities any liability that we treat as 
regulatory capital under the capital or collateral requirements in 
subparts H and K of part 615 of this chapter.
    (vi) Adjust for the dollar amount of significant transactions you 
reasonably expect to occur between the quarter end before you file your 
plan of termination and date of termination. Examples of these 
transactions include, but are not limited to, retirements of equity, 
loan repayments, and patronage distributions. Do not make adjustments 
for future expenses related to termination, such as severance or special 
retirement payments, or stock retirements to dissenting stockholders and 
Farm Credit institutions.
    (6) Make any adjustments we require under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (7) After the above adjustments, combine your balance sheet with the 
balance sheets of your terminating associations after they have made the 
adjustments required in paragraph (a) of this section. Subtract 
liabilities from assets. This is your preliminary total capital estimate 
for purposes of termination.
    (8) Multiply the assets of the combined balance sheet after the 
above adjustments by 6 percent. Subtract this amount from the 
preliminary total capital estimate of the combined balance sheet. The 
remainder is the preliminary exit fee estimate of the bank and 
terminating affiliated associations.
    (9) Your preliminary exit fee estimate is the amount by which the 
preliminary exit fee estimate for the combined entity exceeds the total 
of the individual preliminary exit fee estimates of your affiliated 
terminating associations.
    (c) Adjustments.
    (1) We will review your account balances, transactions over the 3 
years before the date of the termination resolution under Sec. 
611.1220, and any subsequent transactions. Our review will include, but 
not be limited to, the following:
    (i) Additions to or subtractions from any allowance for losses;
    (ii) Additions to assets or liabilities, or subtractions from assets 
or liabilities, due to transactions that are outside your ordinary 
course of business;
    (iii) Dividends or patronage refunds exceeding your usual practices;
    (iv) Changes in the institution's capital plan, or in implementing 
the plan, that increased or decreased the level of borrower investment;
    (v) Contingent liabilities, such as loss-sharing obligations, that 
can be reasonably quantified; and
    (vi) Assets, including real property and servicing rights, that may 
be overvalued, undervalued, or not recorded on your books.
    (2) If we determine the account balances do not accurately show the 
value of your assets and liabilities (whether the assets and liabilities 
were booked before or during the 3-year look-back adjustment period), we 
will make any adjustments we deem necessary.
    (3) We may require you to reverse the effect of a transaction if we 
determine that:
    (i) You have retired capital outside the ordinary course of 
business;
    (ii) You have taken any other actions unrelated to your core 
business that have the effect of changing the exit fee; or
    (iii) You incurred expenses related to termination prior to the 12-
month average daily balance period on which the exit fee calculation is 
based.
    (4) We may require you to make these adjustments to the preliminary 
exit fee estimate that is disclosed in the information statement, the 
final exit fee calculation, and the calculations of the value of 
equities held by dissenting stockholders, Farm Credit institutions that 
choose to have their equities retired at termination, and reaffiliating 
associations.

<R05>
Sec. 611.1255  Exit fee calculation.

    (a) Final exit fee calculation--terminating association. Calculate 
the final exit fee in the following order:
    (1) Base your exit fee calculation on the average daily balances of 
assets and liabilities for the 12-month period preceding the termination 
date. Assume for this calculation that you have not paid or accrued the 
items described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (2) Any amounts we refer to in this section are average daily 
balances unless we specify that they are not. Amounts that are not 
average daily balances will be referred to as ``dollar amount.''
    (3) Compute the average daily balances based on financial statements 
that comply with GAAP. The financial statements, as of the termination 
date, must be independently audited by a qualified public accountant.
    (4) Make adjustments to assets and liabilities as follows:
    (i) Add back expenses related to the termination. Related expenses 
include, but are not limited to, legal services, accounting services, 
tax services, studies, auditing, business planning, payments of 
severance and special retirements, equity holder meetings, and 
application fees for the termination and reorganization. Do not add back 
to assets expenses related to a requirement by the FCA to engage 
independent experts to conduct assessments, analyses, or studies, or to 
request rulings that solely address the impact of the termination on the 
System or parties other than the terminating institution and its 
stockholders.
    (ii) Subtract from assets the dollar amount of current and deferred 
tax expenses, if any, due to the termination.
    (iii) Add to assets the dollar amount of current and deferred tax 
benefits, if any, due to the termination.
    (iv) Subtract from liabilities any liability that we treat as 
regulatory capital under the capital or collateral requirements in 
subparts H and K of part 615 of this chapter.
    (v) Make the adjustments that we require under Sec. 611.1250(c). 
For the final exit fee, we will review and may require additional 
adjustments for transactions between the date you adopted the 
termination resolution and the termination date.
    (5) After making these adjustments to assets and liabilities, 
subtract liabilities from assets. This is your total capital for 
purposes of termination.
    (6) Multiply assets by 6 percent, and subtract this amount from 
total capital. This is your final exit fee.
    (b) Final exit fee calculation--terminating bank.
    (1) The individual exit fees of affiliated associations that are 
terminating with you must be calculated as described in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (2) Base your exit fee calculation on the average daily balances of 
assets and liabilities for the 12-month period preceding the termination 
date. Assume for this calculation that you have not paid or accrued the 
items described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) and (b)(5)(iv) of this 
section.
    (3) Any amounts we refer to in this section are average daily 
balances unless we specify that they are not. Amounts that are not 
average daily balances will be referred to as ``dollar amount.''
    (4) Compute the average daily balances based on bank-only financial 
statements that comply with GAAP. The financial statements, as of the 
termination date, must be independently audited by a qualified public 
accountant.
    (5) Make adjustments to assets and liabilities as follows:
    (i) Add back the following to your assets:
    (A) Expenses you have incurred related to termination. Related 
expenses include, but are not limited to, legal services, accounting 
services, tax services, studies, auditing, business planning, payments 
of severance and special retirements, equity holder meetings, and 
application fees for the termination and reorganization. Do not add back 
to assets expenses related to a requirement by the FCA to engage 
independent experts to conduct assessments, analyses, or studies, or to 
request rulings that solely address the impact of the termination on the 
System or parties other than the terminating institution and its 
stockholders.

[[Page 83]]

    (B) Any specific allowance for losses, and a pro rata share of any 
general allowance for losses, on direct loans to associations that are 
paid off or transferred before or at termination.
    (ii) Subtract from your assets and liabilities your direct loans to 
affiliated associations that were paid off or transferred in the 12-
month period before termination or at termination.
    (iii) Subtract from your assets the following:
    (A) Equity investments held in your institution by affiliated 
associations that you transferred at termination or during the 12 months 
before termination; and
    (B) The dollar amount of current and deferred tax expenses, if any, 
due to the termination;
    (iv) Add to assets, the dollar amount of estimated current and 
deferred tax benefits, if any, due to the termination.
    (v) Subtract from liabilities any liability that we treat as 
regulatory capital (or that we do not treat as a liability) under the 
capital or collateral requirements in subparts H and K of part 615 of 
this chapter.
    (vi) Make the adjustments that we require under Sec. 611.1250(c). 
For the final exit fee, we will review and may require additional 
adjustments for transactions between the date you adopted the 
termination resolution and the termination date.
    (6) After the above adjustments, combine your balance sheet with the 
balance sheets of terminating associations after making the adjustments 
required in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (7) Subtract combined liabilities from combined assets. This is the 
total capital of the combined balance sheet.
    (8) Multiply the assets of the combined balance sheet after the 
above adjustments by 6 percent. Subtract this amount from the total 
capital of the combined balance sheet. This amount is the combined final 
exit fee for your institution and the terminating affiliated 
associations.
    (9) Your final exit fee is the amount by which the combined final 
exit fee exceeds the total of the individual final exit fees of your 
affiliated terminating associations.
    (c) Payment of exit fee. On the termination date, you must:
    (1) Deposit into an escrow account acceptable to us and the FCSIC an 
amount equal to 110 percent of the preliminary exit fee estimate, 
adjusted to account for stock retirements to dissenting stockholders and 
Farm Credit institutions, and any other adjustments we require.
    (2) Deposit into an escrow account acceptable to us an amount equal 
to 110 percent of the equity you must retire for dissenting stockholders 
and System institutions holding stock that would be entitled to a share 
of the remaining assets in a liquidation.
    (d) Pay-out of escrow. Following the independent audit of the 
institution's account balances as of the termination date, we will 
determine the amount of the final exit fee and the amounts owed to 
stockholders to retire their equities. We will then direct the escrow 
agent to:
    (1) Pay the exit fee to the Farm Credit Insurance Fund;
    (2) Pay the amounts owed to dissenting stockholders and Farm Credit 
institutions; and
    (3) Return any remaining amounts to the successor institution.
    (e) Additional payment. If the amount held in escrow is not enough 
to pay the amounts under paragraph (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, 
the successor institution must pay any remaining liability to the escrow 
agent for distribution to the appropriate parties. The termination 
application must include evidence that, after termination, the successor 
institution will pay any remaining amounts owed.

[67 FR 17909, Apr. 12, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 76118, Dec. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 611.1260  Payment of debts and assessments--terminating association.

    (a) General rule. If your institution is a terminating association, 
you must pay or make adequate provision for the payment of all 
outstanding debt obligations and assessments.
    (b) No OFI relationship. If the successor institution will not 
become an OFI, you must either:
    (1) Pay debts and assessments owed to your affiliated Farm Credit 
bank at termination; or

[[Page 84]]

    (2) With your affiliated Farm Credit bank's concurrence, arrange to 
pay any obligations or assessments to the bank after termination.
    (c) Obligations to other Farm Credit institutions. You must pay or 
make adequate provision for payment of obligations to any Farm Credit 
institution (other than your affiliated bank) under any loss-sharing or 
other agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1265  Retirement of a terminating association's investment in its affiliated bank.

    (a) Safety and soundness restrictions. Notwithstanding anything in 
this subpart to the contrary, we may prohibit a bank from retiring the 
equities you hold in the bank if the retirement would cause the bank to 
fall below its regulatory capital requirements after retirement, or if 
we determine that the bank would be in an unsafe or unsound condition 
after retirement.
    (b) Retirement agreement. Your affiliated bank may retire the 
purchased and allocated equities held by your institution in the bank 
according to the terms of the bank's capital revolvement plan or an 
agreement between you and the bank.
    (c) Retirement in absence of agreement. Your affiliated bank must 
retire any equities not subject to an agreement or revolvement plan no 
later than when you or the successor institution pays off your loan from 
the bank.
    (d) No retirement of unallocated surplus. When your bank retires 
equities you own in the bank, the bank must pay par or face value for 
purchased and allocated equities, less any impairment. The bank may not 
pay you any portion of its unallocated surplus.
    (e) Exclusion of equities from capital ratios. If another Farm 
Credit institution makes an agreement to retire equities you hold in 
that institution after termination, we may require that institution to 
exclude part or all of those equities from assets and capital when the 
institution calculates its capital and net collateral ratios under 
subparts H and K of part 615 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1270  Repayment of obligations--terminating bank.

    (a) General rule. If your institution is a terminating bank, you 
must pay or make adequate provision for the payment of all outstanding 
debt obligations, and provide for your responsibility for any probable 
contingent liabilities identified.
    (b) Satisfaction of primary liability on consolidated or System-wide 
obligations. After consulting with the other Farm Credit banks, the 
Funding Corporation, and the FCSIC, you must pay or make adequate 
provision for payment of your primary liability on consolidated or 
System-wide obligations in a method that we deem acceptable. Before we 
make a final decision on your proposal and as we deem necessary, we may 
consult with the other Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and 
the FCSIC.
    (c) Satisfaction of joint and several liability and liability for 
interest on individual obligations.
    (1) You and the other Farm Credit banks must enter into an 
agreement, which is subject to our approval, covering obligations issued 
under section 4.2 of the Act and outstanding on the termination date. 
The agreement must specify how you and your successor institution will 
make adequate provision for the payment of your joint and several 
liability to holders of obligations other than those obligations on 
which you are primarily liable, in the event we make calls for payment 
under section 4.4 of the Act. You and your successor institution must 
also provide for your liability under section 4.4(a)(1) of the Act to 
pay interest on the individual obligations issued by other System banks. 
As a part of the agreement, you must also agree that your successor 
institution will provide ongoing information to the Funding Corporation 
to enable it to fulfill its funding and disclosure duties. The Funding 
Corporation may, at its option, be a party to the agreement to the 
extent necessary to fulfill its duties with respect to financing and 
disclosure.
    (2) If you and the other Farm Credit banks are unable to reach 
agreement within 90 days before the proposed termination date, we will 
specify the manner in which you will make adequate provision for the 
payment of the liabilities in question and how we will make

[[Page 85]]

joint and several calls for those obligations outstanding on the 
termination date.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision in these regulations, the 
successor institution will be jointly and severally liable for 
consolidated and System-wide debt outstanding on the termination date 
(other than the obligations on which you are primarily liable). The 
successor institution will also be liable for interest on other banks' 
individual obligations as described in section 4.4(a)(1) of the Act and 
outstanding on the termination date. The termination application must 
include evidence that the successor institution will continue to be 
liable for consolidated and System-wide debt and for interest on other 
banks' individual obligations.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1275  Retirement of equities held by other System institutions.

    (a) Retirement at option of equity holder. If your institution is a 
terminating institution, System institutions that own your equities have 
the right to require you to retire the equities on the termination date.
    (b) Value of equity holders' interests. You must retire the equities 
in accordance with the liquidation provisions in your bylaws unless we 
determine that the liquidation provisions would result in an inequitable 
distribution to stockholders. If we make such a determination, we will 
require you to distribute the equity in accordance with another method 
that we deem equitable to stockholders. Before you retire any equity, 
you must make the following adjustments to the amount of stockholder 
equity as stated in the financial statements on the termination date:
    (1) Make deductions for any taxes due to the termination that have 
not yet been recorded;
    (2) Deduct the amount of the exit fee; and
    (3) Make any adjustments described under Sec. 611.1250(c) that we 
may require as we deem appropriate.
    (c) Transfer of affiliated association's investment. As an 
alternative to equity retirement, an affiliated association that 
reaffiliates with another Farm Credit bank instead of terminating with 
its bank has the right to require the terminating bank to transfer its 
investment to its new affiliated bank when it reaffiliates. If your 
institution is a terminating bank, at the time of reaffiliation you must 
transfer the purchased and allocated equities held by the association, 
as well as its share of unallocated surplus, to the new affiliated bank. 
Calculate the association's share before deduction of the exit fee as of 
the month end preceding the reaffiliation date (or the termination date 
if it is the same as the reaffiliation date) in accordance with the 
liquidation provisions of your bylaws, unless we determine that the 
liquidation provisions would result in an inequitable distribution. If 
we make such a determination, we will require you to distribute the 
association's share of your unallocated surplus in accordance with 
another method that we deem equitable to stockholders. Before you 
distribute any unallocated surplus, you must make the following 
adjustments to stockholder equity as stated in the financial statements 
as of the month end preceding the reaffiliation date (or the termination 
date if it is the same as the reaffiliation date):
    (1) Add back any taxes due to the termination, and the exit fee; and
    (2) Make any adjustments described under Sec. 611.1250(c) that we 
may require as we deem appropriate.
    (d) Prohibition on certain affiliations. No Farm Credit institution 
may retain an equity interest otherwise prohibited by law in a successor 
institution


<R05>
Sec. 611.1280  Dissenting stockholders' rights.

    (a) Definition. A dissenting stockholder is an equity holder (other 
than a System institution) in a terminating institution on the 
termination date who either:
    (1) Was eligible to vote on the termination resolution and voted 
against termination;
    (2) Was an equity holder on the voting record date but was not 
eligible to vote; or
    (3) Became an equity holder after the voting record date.
    (b) Retirement at option of a dissenting stockholder. A dissenting 
stockholder may require a terminating institution to retire the 
stockholder's equity interest in the terminating institution.

[[Page 86]]

    (c) Value of a dissenting stockholder's interest. You must pay a 
dissenting stockholder according to the liquidation provision in your 
bylaws, except that you must pay at least par or face value for eligible 
borrower stock (as defined in section 4.9A(d)(2) of the Act). If we 
determine that the liquidation provision is inequitable to stockholders, 
we will require you to calculate their share in accordance with another 
formula that we deem equitable.
    (d) Calculation of interest of a dissenting stockholder. Before you 
retire any equity, you must make the following adjustments to the amount 
of stockholder equity as stated in the financial statements on the 
termination date:
    (1) Deduct any taxes due to the termination that you have not yet 
recorded;
    (2) Deduct the amount of the exit fee; and
    (3) Make any adjustments described under Sec. 611.1250(c) that we 
may require as we deem appropriate.
    (e) Form of payment to a dissenting stockholder. You must pay 
dissenting stockholders for their equities as follows:
    (1) Pay cash for the par or face value of purchased stock, less any 
impairment;
    (2) For equities other than purchased equities, you may:
    (i) Pay cash;
    (ii) Cause or otherwise provide for the successor institution to 
issue, on the date of termination, subordinated debt to the stockholder 
with a face value equal to the value of the remaining equities. This 
subordinated debt must have a maturity date of 7 years or less, must 
have priority in liquidation ahead of all equity, and must carry a rate 
of interest not less than the rate (at the time of termination) for debt 
of comparable maturity issued by the U.S. Treasury plus 1 percent; or
    (iii) Provide for a combination of cash and subordinated debt as 
described above.
    (f) Payment to holders of special class of stock. If you have 
adopted bylaws under Sec. 611.1210(f), you must pay a dissenting 
stockholder who owns shares of the special class of stock an amount 
equal to the lower of the par (or face) value or the value of such stock 
as determined under Sec. 611.1280(c) and (d).
    (g) Notice to equity holders. The notice to equity holders required 
in Sec. 611.1240(f) must include a form for stockholders to send back 
to you, stating their intention to exercise dissenters' rights. The 
notice must contain the following information:
    (1) A description of the rights of dissenting stockholders set forth 
in this section and the approximate value per share that a dissenting 
stockholder can expect to receive. State whether the successor 
institution will require borrowers to be stockholders or whether it will 
require stockholders to be borrowers.
    (2) A description of the current book and par value per share of 
each class of equities, and the expected book and market value of the 
stockholder's interest in the successor institution.
    (3) A statement that a stockholder must return the enclosed form to 
you within 30 days if the stockholder chooses to exercise dissenters' 
rights.
    (h) Notice to subsequent equity holders. Equity holders that acquire 
their equities after the termination vote must also receive the notice 
described in paragraph (g) of this section. You must give them at least 
5 business days to decide whether to request retirement of their stock.
    (i) Reconsideration. If a reconsideration vote is held and the 
termination is disapproved, the right of stockholders to exercise 
dissenters' rights is rescinded. If a reconsideration vote is held and 
the termination is approved, you must retire the equities of dissenting 
stockholders as if there had been no reconsideration vote.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1285  Loan refinancing by borrowers.

    (a) Disclosure of credit and loan information. At the request of a 
borrower seeking refinancing with another System institution before you 
terminate, you must give credit and loan information about the borrower 
to such institution.

[[Page 87]]

    (b) No reassignment of territory. If, at the termination date, we 
have not assigned your territory to another System institution, any 
System institution may lend in your territory, to the extent otherwise 
permitted by the Act and the regulations in this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1290  Continuation of borrower rights.

    You may not require a waiver of contractual borrower rights 
provisions as a condition of borrowing from and owning equity in the 
successor institution. Institutions that become other financing 
institutions on termination must comply with the applicable borrower 
rights provisions in the Act and part 617 of this chapter.

special advantage or favoritism for the director, any relative of the 
director, any person residing in the director's household, any business

Sec. 612.2300  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part applies to all institutions of the Farm Credit System 
as defined in section 1.2(a) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, 
(Act) (12 U.S.C. 2002(a)) including, but not limited to, associations, 
banks, service corporations chartered under section 4.25 of the Act, the 
Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit System 
Financial Assistance Corporation, the Farm Credit Leasing Services 
Corporation, and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation 
(hereinafter, institutions). The purposes of this part are to ensure 
public confidence in the Farm Credit System, to ensure the reporting of 
known or suspected criminal activity, to reduce potential losses to 
institutions, and to ensure the safety and soundness of institutions. 
This part requires that institutions use the Farm Credit Administration 
Criminal Referral Form (hereinafter FCA Referral Form) to notify the 
appropriate Federal authorities when any known or suspected Federal 
criminal violations of the type described in Sec. 612.2301 are 
discovered by institutions.
    (b) The specific referral requirements of this part apply to known 
or suspected criminal violations of the United States Code involving the 
assets, operations, or affairs of an institution. This part prescribes 
procedures for referring those violations to the proper Federal 
authorities and the Farm Credit Administration. No specific procedural 
requirements apply to the referral of violations of State or local laws.
    (c) Nothing in this part should be construed as reducing in any way 
an institution's ability to report known or suspected criminal 
activities to the appropriate investigatory or prosecuting authorities, 
whether Federal, State, or local, even when the circumstances in which a 
report is required under Sec. 612.2301 are not present.
    (d) It shall be the responsibility of each System institution to 
determine whether there appears to be a reasonable basis to conclude 
that a criminal violation has been committed and, if so, to report the 
matter to the proper law enforcement authorities for consideration of 
prosecution.
    (e) Each referral required by Sec. 612.2301(a) shall be made on the 
FCA Referral Form in accordance with the FCA Referral Form instructions 
relating to its filing and distribution.

    (a) Each institution and its board of directors shall exercise due 
diligence to ensure the discovery, appropriate investigation, and 
reporting of criminal activity. Within 30 calendar days of determining

States Code involving or affecting its assets, operations, or affairs, 
the institution shall refer such criminal violation to the appropriate 
regional offices of the United States Attorney, and the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation or the United States Secret Service or both, using the 
FCA Referral Form. A copy of the completed FCA Referral Form,

time to the Farm Credit Administration's Office of General Counsel. In 
the event that a Farm Credit bank makes a loan through a Federal land 
bank association which services the loan, the Federal land bank 
association must inform the Farm Credit bank of any known or suspected 
violation involving that loan and the Farm Credit bank shall refer the 
violation to Federal law enforcement authorities under this section. A 
report is required in circumstances where there is:
    (1) Any known or suspected criminal activity (e.g., theft, 
embezzlement), mysterious disappearance, unexplained shortage, 
misapplication, or other defalcation of property and/or funds, 
regardless of amount, where an institution employee, officer, director, 
agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of 
such an institution is suspected;

[[Page 96]]

    (2) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or 
potential loss of $5,000 or more, through false statements or other 
fraudulent means, where the institution has a substantial basis for 
identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects and the suspect(s) 
is not an institution employee, officer, director, agent, or other 
person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an 
institution;
    (3) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or 
potential loss of $25,000 or more, through false statements or other 
fraudulent means, where the institution has no substantial basis for 
identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; or
    (4) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving a financial 
transaction in which the institution was used as a conduit for such 
criminal activity (such as money laundering/structuring schemes).
    (b) In circumstances where there is a known or suspected violation 
of State or local criminal law, the institution shall notify the 
appropriate State or local law enforcement authorities.
    (c) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, the institution shall immediately notify by telephone the 
appropriate Federal law enforcement authorities and FCA offices 
specified on the FCA Referral Form upon determining that a known or 
suspected criminal violation of Federal law requiring urgent attention 
has occurred or is ongoing. Such cases include, but are not limited to, 
those where:
    (1) There is a likelihood that the suspect(s) will flee;
    (2) The magnitude or the continuation of the known or suspected 
criminal violation may imperil the institution's continued operation; or
    (3) Key institution personnel are involved.


<R05>
Sec. 612.2302  Notification of board of directors and bonding company.

    (a) The institution's board of directors shall be promptly notified 
of any criminal referral by the institution, except that if the criminal 
referral involves a member of the board of directors, discretion may be 
exercised in notifying such member of the referral.
    (b) The institution involved shall promptly make all required 
notifications under any applicable surety bond or other contract for 
protection.


<R05>
Sec. 612.2303  Institution responsibilities.

designed to ensure compliance with this part, including, but not limited 
to, adequate internal controls.

<R05>
Sec. 613.3000  Financing for farmers, ranchers, and aquatic producers or harvesters.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this subpart, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Bona fide farmer or rancher means a person owning agricultural 
land or

[[Page 97]]

engaged in the production of agricultural products, including aquatic 
products under controlled conditions.
    (2) Legal entity means any partnership, corporation, estate, trust, 
or other legal entity that is established pursuant to the laws of the 
United States, any State thereof, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
District of Columbia, or any tribal authority and is legally authorized 
to conduct a business.
    (3) Person means an individual who is a citizen of the United States 
or a foreign national who has been lawfully admitted into the United 
States either for permanent residency pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) 
or on a visa pursuant to a provision in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) that 
authorizes such individual to own property or operate or manage a 
business or a legal entity.
    (4) Producer or harvester of aquatic products means a person engaged 
in producing or harvesting aquatic products for economic gain in open 
waters under uncontrolled conditions.
    (b) Eligible borrower. Farm Credit institutions that operate under 
titles I or II of the Act may provide financing to a bona fide farmer or 
rancher, or producer or harvester of aquatic products for any 
agricultural or aquatic purpose and for other credit needs.


<R05>
Sec. 613.3005  Lending objective.

    It is the objective of each bank and association, except for banks 
for cooperatives, to provide full credit, to the extent of 
creditworthiness, to the full-time bona fide farmer (one whose primary 
business and vocation is farming, ranching, or producing or harvesting 
aquatic products); and conservative credit to less than full-time 
farmers for agricultural enterprises, and more restricted credit for 
other credit requirements as needed to ensure a sound credit package or 
to accommodate a borrower's needs as long as the total credit results in 
being primarily an agricultural loan. However, the part-time farmer who 
needs to seek off-farm employment to supplement farm income or who 
desires to supplement off-farm income by living in a rural area and is 
carrying on a valid agricultural operation, shall have availability of 
credit for mortgages, other agricultural purposes, and family needs in 
the preferred position along with full-time farmers. Loans to farmers 
shall be on an increasingly conservative basis as the emphasis moves 
away from the full-time bona fide farmer to the point where agricultural 
needs only will be financed for the applicant whose business is 
essentially other than farming. Credit shall not be extended where 
investment in agricultural assets for speculative appreciation is a 
primary factor.


<R05>
Sec. 613.3010  Financing for processing or marketing operations.

    (a) Eligible borrowers. A borrower is eligible for financing for a 
processing or marketing operation under titles I and II of the Act, only 
if the borrower meets the following requirements:
    (1) The borrower is either a bona fide farmer, rancher, or producer 
or harvester of aquatic products, or is a legal entity in which eligible 
borrowers under Sec. 613.3000(b) own more than 50 percent of the voting 
stock or equity; and
    (2) The borrower or an owner of the borrowing legal entity regularly 
produces some portion of the throughput used in the processing or 
marketing operation.
    (b) Portfolio restrictions for certain processing and marketing 
loans. Processing or marketing loans to eligible borrowers who regularly 
supply less than 20 percent of the throughput are subject to the 
following restrictions:
    (1) Bank limitation. The aggregate of such processing and marketing 
loans made by a Farm Credit bank shall not exceed 15 percent of all its 
outstanding retail loans at the end of the preceding fiscal year.
    (2) Association limitation. The aggregate of such processing and 
marketing loans made by all direct lender associations affiliated with 
the same Farm Credit bank shall not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate 
of their outstanding retail loans at the end of the preceding fiscal 
year. Each Farm Credit bank, in conjunction with all its affiliated 
direct lender associations, shall ensure that such processing or 
marketing loans are equitably allocated among its affiliated direct 
lender associations.

[[Page 98]]

    (3) Calculation of outstanding retail loans. For the purposes of 
this paragraph, ``outstanding retail loans'' includes loans, loan 
participations, and other interests in loans that are either bought 
without recourse or sold with recourse.


<R05>
Sec. 613.3020  Financing for farm-related service businesses.

    (a) Eligibility. An individual or legal entity that furnishes farm-
related services to farmers and ranchers that are directly related to 
their agricultural production is eligible to borrow from a Farm Credit 
bank or association that operates under titles I or II of the Act.
    (b) Purposes of financing. A Farm Credit Bank, agricultural credit 
bank, or direct lender association may finance:
    (1) All of the farm-related business activities of an eligible 
borrower who derives more than 50 percent of its annual income (as 
consistently measured on either a gross sales or net sales basis) from 
furnishing farm-related services that are directly related to the 
agricultural production of farmers and ranchers; or
    (2) Only the farm-related services activities of an eligible 
borrower who derives 50 percent or less of its annual income (as 
consistently measured on either a gross sales or net sales basis) from 
furnishing farm-related services that are directly related to the 
agricultural production of farmers and ranchers.
    (c) Limitation. The authority of Farm Credit banks and associations 
operating under section 1.7(a) of the Act to finance eligible farm-
related service businesses under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section is limited to necessary capital structures, equipment, and 
initial working capital.

values for the rural area where it is located, as documented by data 
from a credible, independent, and recognized national or regional 
source, such as a Federal, State, or local government agency, or an 
industry source. Housing values at or below the 75th percentile of 
values reflected in such data will be deemed moderately priced.
    (b) Eligibility. Any rural homeowner is eligible to obtain financing 
on a rural home. No borrower shall have a loan from the Farm Credit 
System on more than one rural home at any one time.
    (c) Purposes of financing. Loans may be made to rural homeowners for 
the purpose of buying, building, remodeling, improving, repairing rural 
homes, and refinancing existing indebtedness thereon.

    (3) That consider the nature and type of credit risk, amount of the 
loan, and enterprises being financed
    (h) Requirements that loan terms and conditions are appropriate for 
the loan; and
    (i) Such other requirements as are necessary for the professional 
conduct of a lending organization, including documentation for each loan 
transaction of compliance with the loan underwriting standards or the 
compensating factors or extenuating circumstances that establish 
repayment of the loan notwithstanding the failure to meet any one or 
more loan underwriting standard.

Sec. 614.4155  Interest rates.

    Loans made by each bank and direct lender association shall bear 
interest at a rate or rates as may be determined by the institution 
board. The board shall set interest rates or approve individual interest 
rate changes either on a case-by-case basis or pursuant to an interest 
rate plan within which management may establish rates. Any interest rate 
plan shall set loan-pricing policies and objectives, provide guidance 
regarding the circumstances under which management may adjust rates, and 
provide the upper and lower limits on management authority. Any interest 
rate plan adopted shall be reviewed on a continuing basis by the board, 
as well as in conjunction with its review and approval of the 
institution's operational and strategic business plan.

<R05>
Sec. 614.4160  Differential interest rate programs.

    Pursuant to policies approved by the board of directors, 
differential interest rates may be established for loans based on a 
variety of factors that may include type, purpose, amount, quality, 
funding or operating costs, or similar factors or combinations of 
factors. Differential interest rate programs should achieve equitable 
rate treatment within categories of borrowers. In the adoption of 
differential interest rate programs, institutions may consider, among 
other things, the effect that such interest rate structures will have on 
the achievement of objectives relating to the special credit needs of 
young, beginning or small farmers.

of aquatic products under title I or II of the Act; and
    (ii) Interests in participations made to farmers and ranchers and 
producers or harvesters of aquatic products under title I or II of the 
Act.
    (2) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``services'' includes:

harvesters of aquatic products under title I or II of the Act.
    (b) Farm Credit bank policies. Each Farm Credit Bank and 
Agricultural Credit Bank must adopt written policies that direct:
    (1) The board of each affiliated direct lender association to 
establish a program to provide sound and constructive credit and 
services to young, beginning, and small farmers and ranchers and 
producers or harvesters of aquatic products (YBS farmers and ranchers or 
YBS). The terms ``bona fide farmer or rancher,'' and ``producer or 
harvester of aquatic products'' are defined in Sec. 613.3000 of this 
chapter;
    (2) Each affiliated direct lender association to include in its YBS 
farmers and ranchers program provisions ensuring coordination with other 
System institutions in the territory and other governmental and private 
sources of credit;
    (3) Each affiliated direct lender association to provide, annually, 
a complete and accurate YBS farmers and ranchers operations and 
achievements report to its funding bank; and

[[Page 115]]

    (4) The bank to provide the agency a complete and accurate annual 
report summarizing the YBS program operations and achievements of its 
affiliated direct lender associations.
    (c) Direct lender association YBS programs. The board of directors 
of each direct lender association must establish a program to provide 
sound and constructive credit and services to YBS farmers and ranchers 
in its territory. Such a program must include the following minimum 
components:
    (1) A mission statement describing program objectives and specific 
means for achieving such objectives.
    (2) Annual quantitative targets for credit to YBS farmers and 
ranchers that are based on an understanding of reasonably reliable 
demographic data for the lending territory. Such targets may include:
    (i) Loan volume and loan number goals for ``young,'' ``beginning,'' 
and ``small'' farmers and ranchers in the territory;
    (ii) Percentage goals representative of the demographics for 
``young,'' ``beginning,'' and ``small'' farmers and ranchers in the 
territory;
    (iii) Percentage goals for loans made to new borrowers qualifying as

    (3) Annual qualitative YBS goals that must include efforts to:
    (i) Offer related services either directly or in coordination with 
others that are responsive to the needs of the ``young,'' ``beginning,'' 
and ``small'' farmers and ranchers in the territory;
    (ii) Take full advantage of opportunities for coordinating credit 
and services offered with other System institutions in the territory and 
other governmental and private sources of credit who offer credit and 
services to those who qualify as ``young,'' ``beginning,'' and ``small'' 
farmers and ranchers; and
    (iii) Implement effective outreach programs to attract YBS farmers 
and ranchers, which may include the use of advertising campaigns and 
educational credit and services programs beneficial to ``young,'' 
``beginning,'' and ``small'' farmers and ranchers in the territory, as 
well as an advisory committee comprised of ``young,'' ``beginning,'' and 
``small'' farmers and ranchers to provide views on how the credit and 
services of the direct lender association could best serve the credit 
and services needs of YBS farmers and ranchers.
    (4) Methods to ensure that credit and services offered to YBS 
farmers and ranchers are provided in a safe and sound manner and within 
a direct lender association's risk-bearing capacity. Such methods could 
include customized loan underwriting standards, loan guarantee programs, 
fee waiver programs, or other credit enhancement programs.
    (d) Review and approval of YBS programs. The YBS program of each 
direct lender association is subject to the review and approval of its 
funding bank. However, the funding bank's review and approval is limited 
to a determination that the YBS program contains all required components 
as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Any conclusion by the 
bank that a YBS program is incomplete must be communicated to the direct 
lender association in writing.
    (e) YBS program and the operational and strategic business plan. 
Targets and goals outlined in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this 
section must be included in each direct lender association's operational 
and strategic business plan for at least the succeeding 3 years (as set 
forth in Sec. 618.8440 of this chapter).
    (f) YBS program internal controls. Each direct lender association 
must have internal controls that establish clear lines of responsibility 
for YBS program implementation, YBS performance results, and YBS 
quarterly reporting to the association's board of directors.

Sec. 614.4200  General requirements.

    (a) Terms and conditions. (1) The terms and conditions of each loan 
made

[[Page 116]]

by a Farm Credit bank or association shall be set forth in a written 
document or documents, such as a loan agreement, promissory note, or 
other instrument(s) appropriate to the type and amount of the credit 
extension, in order to establish loan conditions and performance 
requirements. Copies of all documents executed by the borrower in 
connection with the closing of a loan made under titles I or II of the 
Act shall be provided to the borrower at the time of execution and at 
any time thereafter that the borrower requests additional copies.
    (2) The terms and conditions of all loans shall be adequately 
disclosed in writing to the borrower not later than loan closing. For 
loans made under titles I and II of the Act, the institution shall 
provide prompt written notice of the approval of the loan.
    (3) Applicants shall be provided notification of the action taken on 
each credit application in compliance with the requirements of 12 CFR 
202.9.
    (b) Security. (1) Long-term real estate mortgage loans must be 
secured by a first lien interest in real estate, except that the loans 
may be secured by a second lien interest if the institution also holds 
the first lien on the property. No funds shall be advanced, under a 
legally binding commitment or otherwise, if the outstanding loan balance 
after the advance would exceed 85 percent (or 97 percent as provided in 
section 1.10(a) of the Act) of the appraised value of the real estate, 
except that a loan on which private mortgage insurance is obtained may 
exceed 85 percent of the appraised value of the real estate to the 
extent that the loan amount in excess of 85 percent is covered by such 
insurance. The real estate that is used to satisfy the loan-to-value 
limitation must be comprised primarily of agricultural or rural 
property, including agricultural land and improvements thereto, a farm-
related business, a marketing or processing operation, a rural 
residence, or real estate used as an integral part of an aquatic 
operation.
    (2) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the lending institution may advance funds for the payment of 
taxes or insurance premiums with respect to the real estate, reschedule 
loan payments, grant partial releases of security interests in the real 
estate, and take other actions necessary to protect the lender's 
collateral position. Any action taken that results in exceeding the 
loan-to-value limitation shall be in accordance with a policy of the 
institution's board of directors and adequately documented in the loan 
file.
    (3) Short- and intermediate-term loans may be secured or unsecured 
as the documented creditworthiness of the borrower warrants.
    (4) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, a long-term, non-farm rural home loan, including a revolving 
line of credit, shall be secured by a first lien on the property, except 
that it may be secured by a second lien if the institution also holds 
the first lien on the property. A short- or intermediate-term loan on a 
rural home, including a revolving line of credit, must be secured by a 
lien on the property unless the financing is provided exclusively for 
repairs, remodeling, or other improvements to the rural home, in which 
case the loan may be secured by other property or unsecured if warranted 
by the documented creditworthiness of the borrower.
    (5) Except as provided in Sec. 614.4231, loans made under title III 
of the Act may be secured or unsecured, as appropriate for the purpose 
of the loan and the documented creditworthiness of the borrower.

borrower if the prospective borrower has a high credit rating as 
determined by the bank.
    (c) For a borrower in which a voting stockholder of the bank has a

              Subpart F_Collateral Evaluation Requirements

    Source: 59 FR 46730, Sept. 12, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 614.4240  Collateral definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    (a) Abundance of caution, when used to describe decisions to require 
collateral, means that the collateral is taken in circumstances in 
which:
    (1) It is not required by statute, regulation, or the institution's 
policies; and
    (2) A prudent lender would extend credit based on a borrower's 
income and/or other collateral, absent the real estate, and the decision 
to extend credit was, in fact, based on other sources of revenue or 
collateral.
    (b) Appraisal means a written statement independently and 
impartially prepared by a qualified appraiser setting forth an opinion 
as to the market value of an adequately described property as of a 
specific date(s), supported by the presentation and analysis of relevant 
market information.
    (c) Appraisal Foundation means the Appraisal Foundation established 
on November 30, 1987, by professional appraisal organizations, as a not-
for-profit corporation under the laws of Illinois, in order to enhance 
the quality of professional appraisals.
    (d) Appraisal Subcommittee means the Appraisal Subcommittee of the 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.
    (e) Business loan means a loan or other extension of credit to any 
corporation, general or limited partnership, business trust, joint 
venture, sole proprietorship, or other business entity (including 
entities and individuals engaged in farming enterprises).
    (f) Cost approach means the process by which an evaluator 
establishes an

[[Page 118]]

indicated value by measuring the current market cost to construct a 
reproduction of or replacement for the improvements, minus the amount of 
depreciation (physical deterioration, or functional and/or external 
obsolescence) evident in the structure from all causes, plus the market 
value of the land.
    (g) Evaluation means a study of the nature, quality, or utility of, 
interest in, or aspects of, an asset. An evaluation may take the form of 
a valuation or an appraisal.
    (h) Fee appraiser means a qualified evaluator who is not an employee 
of the party contracting for the completion of the evaluation and who 
performs an evaluation on a fee basis. For purposes of this subpart, a 
fee appraiser may include a staff evaluator from another Farm Credit 
System institution only if the employing institution is not operating 
under joint management with the contracting institution. In addition, 
for purposes of personal and intangible collateral evaluations, the term 
``fee appraiser'' includes, but is not limited to, certified public 
accountants, equipment dealers, grain buyers, livestock buyers, and 
auctioneers.
    (i) FIRREA means the Financial Institutions Recovery, Reform, and 
Enforcement Act of 1989.
    (j) Highest and best use means the reasonable and most probable use 
of the property that would result in the highest market value of vacant 
land or improved property, as of the date of valuation; or that use, 
from among reasonably probable and legally alternative uses, found to be 
physically possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and 
which results in the highest land value.
    (k) Income capitalization approach means the procedure that values 
property by measuring the present value of the expected future benefits 
of property ownership. This value is derived from either:
    (1) Capitalizing a single year's income expectancy or an annual 
average of several years' income expectancies at a market-derived 
capitalization rate that reflects a specific income pattern, return on 
investment, and change in the value of the investment; or
    (2) Discounting the annual cashflows for the holding period and the 
reversion at a specified yield rate or specified yield rates which 
reflect market behavior.
    (l) Market value means the most probable price that a property 
should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions 
requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently, 
knowledgeably, and assuming neither is under duress. Implicit in this 
definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the 
passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby:
    (1) Buyer and seller are typically motivated;
    (2) Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in 
what they consider their best interests;
    (3) A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;
    (4) Payment is made in terms of cash in United States dollars or in 
terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and
    (5) The price represents the normal consideration for the property 
sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions 
granted by anyone associated with the sale.
    (m) Personal property, for purposes of this subpart, means all 
tangible and movable property not considered real property or fixtures.
    (n) Qualified evaluator means an individual who is competent, 
reputable, impartial, and has demonstrated sufficient training and 
experience to properly evaluate property of the type that is the subject 
of the evaluation. For the purposes of this definition, the term 
``qualified evaluator'' includes an appraiser or valuator.
    (o) Real estate means an identified parcel or tract of land, 
including improvements, if any.
    (p) Real estate-related financial transactions means any transaction 
involving:
    (1) The sale, lease, purchase, investment in, or exchange of real 
property, including interests in property or the financing thereof; or
    (2) The refinancing of real property or interests in real property; 
or
    (3) The use of real property or interests in real property as 
security for a

[[Page 119]]

loan or investment, including mortgage-backed securities.
    (q) Real property means all interests, benefits, and rights inherent 
in the ownership of real estate.
    (r) Sales comparison approach means the procedure that values 
property by comparing the subject property to similar properties located 
in relatively close proximity, having similar size and utility, and 
having been recently sold in arm's-length transactions (comparable 
sales). The sales comparison approach requires the evaluator to estimate 
the degree of similarity and difference between the subject property and 
comparable sales. Such comparison shall be made on the basis of 
conditions of sale, financing terms, market conditions, location, 
physical characteristics, and income characteristics. Appropriate 
adjustments shall be made to the sales price of the comparable property 
based on the identified deficiencies or superiorities of the subject 
property to arrive at a probable price for which the subject property 
could be sold on the date of the collateral evaluation.
    (s) State certified appraiser means any individual who has satisfied 
the requirements for and has been certified as a real estate appraiser 
by a State or territory whose requirements for certification currently 
meet or exceed the minimum criteria for certification issued by the 
Appraiser Qualification Board of the Appraisal Foundation. No individual 
shall be a State certified appraiser unless such individual has achieved 
a passing grade on a suitable examination administered by a State or 
territory that is consistent with and equivalent to the Uniform State 
Certification Examination issued or endorsed by the Appraiser 
Qualification Board of the Appraisal Foundation. In addition, the 
Appraisal Subcommittee must not have issued a finding that the policies, 
practices, or procedures of the State or territory are inconsistent with 
title XI of FIRREA.
    (t) State licensed appraiser means any individual who has satisfied 
the requirements for licensing and has been licensed as a real estate 
appraiser by a State or territory in which the licensing procedures 
comply with title XI of FIRREA and in which the Appraisal Subcommittee 
has not issued a finding that the policies, practices, or procedures of 
the State or territory are inconsistent with title XI of FIRREA.
    (u) Transaction value means:
    (1) For loans or other extensions of credit, the amount of the loan, 
loan commitment, or other extensions of credit;
    (2) For sales, leases, purchases, investments in, or exchanges of 
real property, the market value of the property interest involved; and
    (3) For the pools of loans or interests in real property, the 
transaction value of the individual loans or the market value of the 
real property interests comprising the pool.
    (v) USPAP means the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice adopted by the Appraisal Foundation.
    (w) Valuation means the process of estimating a defined value of an 
identified interest or interests in a specific asset or assets as of a 
given date. A valuation results from the completion of a collateral 
evaluation that does not require an appraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 614.4245  Collateral evaluation policies.

    (a) The board of directors of each Farm Credit System institution 
that engages in lending or leasing secured by collateral shall adopt 
well-defined and effective collateral evaluation policies and standards, 
that comply with the regulations in this subpart, to ensure that 
collateral evaluations are:
    (1) Sufficiently descriptive and detailed to provide ample support 
to the institution's related credit decisions;
    (2) Performed based on criteria established for the purpose of 
determining the circumstances under which collateral evaluations will be 
required and when they will be required. Such criteria must, at a 
minimum:
    (i) Establish when an institution will require a collateral 
appraisal completed under the USPAP rather than a collateral valuation; 
and
    (ii) Take into account such factors as market trends, market 
volatility, and various types of credit, loan servicing, collection, and 
liquidation actions; and
    (3) Completed by a qualified evaluator in an unbiased manner.

[[Page 120]]

    (b) The policies and standards required by this section shall, at a 
minimum, address the criteria outlined in Sec. Sec. 614.4250 through 
614.4267 of this subpart.
    (c) A Federal land bank association shall, with the approval of its 
respective Farm Credit bank, adopt collateral evaluation policies that 
are consistent with the bank's policies and standards.
    (d) An institution's board of directors may adopt specific 
collateral evaluation requirements, consistent with the regulations in 
this subpart, for loans designated as part of a minimum information 
program.

<R05>
Sec. 614.4250  Collateral evaluation standards.

    (a) When real, personal, or intangible property is taken as security 
for a loan or is the subject of a lease, an evaluation of such property 
shall be performed in accordance with Sec. 614.4260 and the 
institutions' policies and procedures. Such a collateral evaluation 
shall be identified as either a collateral valuation or a collateral 
appraisal. Specifically, all collateral evaluations must:
    (1) Value the subject property based upon market value as defined in 
Sec. 614.4240(l);
    (2) Be presented in a written format;
    (3) Consider the purpose for which the property will be used and the 
property's highest and best use, if different from the intended use;
    (4) Be sufficiently descriptive to enable the reader to ascertain 
the reasonableness of the estimated market value and the rationale for 
the estimate;
    (5) Provide sufficient detail (including an identification and 
description of the property) and depth of analysis to reflect the 
relevant characteristics and complexity of the subject property;
    (6) Analyze and report, as appropriate, for real, intangible, and/or 
personal property, on:
    (i) The current income producing capacity of the property;
    (ii) A reasonable marketing period for the property;
    (iii) The current market conditions and trends that will affect 
projected income, to the extent such conditions will affect the value of 
the property;
    (iv) The appropriate deductions and discounts as they would apply to 
the property, including but not limited to, those based on the condition 
of the property, as well as the specialization of the operation and 
property; and
    (v) Potential liabilities, including those associated with any 
hazardous waste or other environmental concerns; and
    (7) Include in the evaluation report a certification that the 
evaluation was not based on a requested minimum valuation or specific 
valuation or approval of a loan.
    (b) For purposes of determining appraisal value as required in 
section 1.10(a) of the Act, the definition of market value and the 
requirements of this subpart shall apply.

certified or State licensed appraiser is not required for any real 
estate-related financial transaction in which any of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) The transaction value is $250,000 or less;
    (2) The transaction is a ``business loan'' as defined in Sec. 
614.4240(e) that:
    (i) Has a transaction value of $1,000,000 or less; and
    (ii) Is not dependent on income derived from the sale or cash rental 
of real estate as the primary source of repayment;
    (3) A lien on real property has been taken as collateral in an 
abundance of caution, and the application, when evaluated on the five 
basic credit factors, without considering the subject real estate, would 
support the credit decision that was based on other sources of repayment 
or collateral;
    (4) A lien on real estate is not statutorily required and has been 
taken for purposes other than the real estate's value;
    (5) Subsequent loan transactions (which include but are not limited 
to loan servicing actions, reamortizations, modifications of loan terms, 
and partial releases), provided that either:
    (i) The transaction does not involve the advancement of new loan 
funds other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; or
    (ii) There has been no obvious and material change in market 
conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens the 
adequacy of the Farm Credit System institution's real estate collateral 
protection, even with the advancement of new loan funds;
    (6) A Farm Credit System institution purchases a loan or an interest 
in a loan, pool of loans, or interests in real property, including 
mortgage-backed securities, provided that:
    (i) The appraisal prepared for each loan, pooled loan, or real 
property interest, when originated, met the standards of this subpart, 
other Federal regulations adopted pursuant to FIRREA, or the 
requirements of the government-sponsored secondary market intermediaries 
under whose auspices the interest is sold; and

[[Page 122]]

    (ii) There has been no obvious and material change in market 
conditions or physical aspects of the property that would threaten the 
Farm Credit System institution's collateral position, or
    (7) A Farm Credit System institution makes or purchases a loan 
secured by real estate, which loan is guaranteed by an agency of the 
United States Government and is supported by an appraisal that conforms 
to the requirements of the guaranteeing agency.
    To qualify for exceptions in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of 
this section from the requirements of this subpart, the institution must 
have documentation justifying the use of such exceptions in the 
applicable loan file(s). In addition, the institution must document that 
the repayment of a ``business loan'' is not dependent on income derived 
from the sale or cash rental of real estate.
    (d) FCA-required appraisals. The FCA reserves the right to require 
an appraisal under this subpart whenever it believes it is necessary to 
address safety and soundness issues.
    (e) Reciprocity. The requirements of this subpart are satisfied by 
the use of State certified or State licensed appraisers from any State 
provided that:
    (1) The appraiser is qualified to perform such appraisals;
    (2) The applicable Farm Credit System institution has established 
policies providing for such interstate appraisals; and
    (3) The applicable State appraiser licensing and certification 
agency recognizes the certification or license of the appraiser's State 
of permanent certification or licensure.

    Source: 57 FR 38247, Aug. 24, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 614.4325  Purchase and sale of interests in loans.

    (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this subpart, the following 
definitions shall apply:
    (1) Interests in loans means ownership interests in the principal 
amount, interest payments, or any aspect of a loan transaction and 
transactions involving a pool of loans, including servicing rights.
    (2) Lead lender means a lending institution having a direct 
contractual relationship with a borrower to advance funds, which 
institution sells or assigns an interest or interests in such loan to 
one or more other lenders.
    (3) Loan means any extension of credit or similar financial 
assistance of the type authorized under the Act, such as guarantees, 
letters of credit, and other similar transactions.
    (4) Participating institution means an institution that purchases a 
participation interest in a loan originated by another lender.
    (5) Sale with recourse means a sale of a loan or an interest in a 
loan in which the seller:
    (i) Retains some risk of loss from the transferred asset for any 
cause except the seller's breach of usual and customary warranties or 
representations designed to protect the purchaser against fraud or 
misrepresentation; or
    (ii) Has an obligation to make payments of principal or interest to 
any party resulting from:

[[Page 124]]

    (A) Default on the payment of principal or interest on the loan by 
the borrower or guarantor or any other deficiencies in the obligor's 
performance;
    (B) Changes in the market value of the assets after transfer;
    (C) Any contractual relationship between the seller and purchaser 
incident to the transfer that, by its terms, could continue even after 
final payment, default, or other termination of the assets transferred; 
or
    (D) Any other cause, except the retention at servicing rights alone 
shall not constitute recourse.
    (6) Subordinated participation interest means an interest in a loan 
that bears the first risk of loss, including the retention of such an 
interest when a loan is sold to a pooler certified by the Federal 
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation pursuant to title VIII of the Act, or 
an interest in a pool of subordinated participation interests purchased 
to satisfy the requirements of title VIII of the Act with respect to a 
loan sold to such a certified pooler.
    (b) Authority to purchase and sell interests in loans. Loans and 
interests in loans may only be sold in accordance with each 
institution's lending authorities, as set forth in subpart A of this 
part. No Farm Credit System institution may purchase from an institution 
that is not a Farm Credit System institution any interest in a loan, 
except for the purpose of pooling and securitizing such loans under 
title VIII of the Act, unless such an interest is a participation 
interest that qualifies under the institution's lending authority, as 
set forth in subpart A of this part, and meets the requirements of Sec. 
614.4330 of this subpart.
    (c) Policies. Each Farm Credit System institution that is authorized 
to sell or purchase interests in loans under subpart A of this part 
shall exercise that authority in accordance with a policy adopted by its 
board of directors that addresses the following matters:
    (1) The types of purchasers to which the institution is authorized 
to sell interests in loans;
    (2) The types of loans in which the institution may purchase or sell 
an interest and the types of interests which may be purchased or sold;
    (3) The underwriting standards to be applied in the purchase of 
interests in loans:
    (4) Such limitations on the aggregate principal amount of interests 
in loans that the institution may purchase from a single institution as 
are necessary to diversify risk, and such limitations on the aggregate 
amount the institution may purchase from all institutions as are 
necessary to assure that service to the territory is not impeded;
    (5) Provision for the identification and reporting of loans in which 
interests are sold or purchased;
    (6) Requirements for providing and securing in a timely manner 
adequate credit and other information needed to make an independent 
credit judgment; and
    (7) Any limitations or conditions to which sales or purchases are 
subject that the board deems appropriate, including arbitration.

interest in a loan shall, at a minimum:

    (2) Provide for the transfer of credit and other borrower 
information on a timely and continuing basis;
    (3) Provide for sharing, dividing, or assigning collateral;
    (4) Identify the nature of the interest(s) sold or purchased;
    (5) Set forth the rights and obligations of the parties and the 
terms and conditions of the sale; and
    (6) Contain any terms necessary for the appropriate administration 
of the loan and the protection of the interests of the Farm Credit 
System institution.
    (e) Independent credit judgment. Each institution that purchases an 
interest in a loan shall make a judgment on the creditworthiness of the 
borrower that is independent of the originating or lead lender and any 
intermediary seller or broker prior to the purchase of the interest and 
prior to any servicing action that alters the terms of the original 
agreement, which judgment shall not be delegated to any person(s) not 
employed by the institution. A Farm Credit System institution that 
purchases a loan or any interest therein may use information, such as 
appraisals or collateral inspections, furnished

[[Page 125]]

by the originating or lead lender, or any intermediary seller or broker; 
however, the purchasing Farm Credit System institution shall 
independently evaluate such information when exercising its independent 
credit judgment. No employee who performed a real estate appraisal on 
any collateral supporting a loan shall participate in the decision to 
purchase that loan. The independent credit judgment shall be documented 
by a credit analysis that considers factors set forth in the loan 
underwriting standards adopted pursuant to Sec. 614.4150 of this part 
and is independent of the originating institution and any intermediary 
seller or broker. The credit analysis shall consider such credit and 
other borrower information as would be required by a prudent lender and 
shall include an evaluation of the capacity and reliability of the 
servicer. Boards of directors of jointly managed institutions shall 
adopt procedures to ensure that the interests of their respective 
shareholders are protected in participation between such institutions.
    (f) Limitations. The aggregate principal amount of interests in 
loans purchased from a single lead lender and the aggregate principal 
amount of interests in loans purchased from other institutions shall not 
exceed the limits set in the institution's policy.
    (g) Sales with recourse. When a loan or interest in a loan is sold 
with recourse, it shall be accorded the following treatment:
    (1) The loan shall be considered, to the extent of the recourse, an 
extension of credit by the purchaser to the seller, as well as an 
extension of credit from the seller to the borrower(s), for the purpose 
of determining whether credit extensions to a borrower are within the 
lending limits established in subpart J of this part.
    (2) The amount of the loan subject to the recourse agreement shall 
be considered a loan sold with recourse for the purpose of computing 
permanent capital ratios.
    (h) Transactions through agents. Transactions pertaining to 
purchases of loans, including the judgement on creditworthiness, may be 
performed through an agent, provided that:
    (1) The institution establishes the necessary criteria in a written 
agency agreement that outlines, at a minimum, the scope of the agency 
relationship and obligates the agent to comply with the institution's 
underwriting standards;
    (2) The institution periodically reviews the agency relationship to 
determine if the agent's actions are in the best interest of the 
institution;
    (3) The agent must be independent of the seller or intermediate 
broker in the transaction; and
    (4) If an association's funding bank serves as its agent, the agency 
agreement must provide that:
    (i) The association can terminate the agreement upon no more than 60 
days notice to the bank;
    (ii) The association may, in its discretion, require the bank to 
purchase from the association any interest in a loan that the 
association determines does not comply with the terms of the agency 
agreement or the association's loan underwriting standards.

stock purchase requirements do not apply if a loan is designated, at the 
time it is made, for sale into a secondary market.
    (2) If a loan designated for sale under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is not sold into a secondary market during the 180-day period

with recourse.
    (iii) When an interest in a loan is sold without recourse, a

    (a) Each note is current and carries a full recourse endorsement or 
unconditional guarantee by the borrower;
    (b) The bank determines the financial condition, repayment capacity, 
and other credit factors of the loan to the original maker reasonably 
justify the credit granted by the endorser; and
    (c) The loans are fully supported by documented loan files, which 
include, at a minimum:
    (1) A credit report supporting the bank's finding that the financial 
condition, repayment capacity, and other factors of the maker of the 
notes being pledged justify the credit extended by the bank and/or 
endorser;
    (2) A certification by a bank officer designated for that purpose by 
the loan or executive committee that the financial responsibility of the 
original notemaker has been evaluated by the loan committee and the bank 
is relying primarily on each such maker for the payment of the 
obligation; and
    (3) Other credit information normally required of a borrower when 
making and administering a loan.

Sec. 614.4358  Computation of obligations.

    (a) Inclusions. The computation of total loans to each borrower for 
the purpose of computing their lending and leasing limit shall include:
    (1) The total unpaid principal of all loans and lease balances 
outstanding and the total amount of undisbursed commitments except as 
excluded by paragraph (b) of this section. This amount shall include 
loans that have been charged off on the books of the institution in 
whole or in part but have not been collected, except to the extent that 
such amounts are not legally collectible;
    (2) Purchased interests in loans, including participation interests, 
to the extent of the amount of the purchased interest, including any 
undisbursed commitment;
    (3) Loans attributed to a borrower in accordance with Sec. 
614.4359.
    (b) Exclusions. The following loans when adequately documented in 
the loan file, may be excluded from loans to a borrower subject to the 
lending and leasing limit:

[[Page 130]]

    (1) Any loan or portion of a loan that carries a full faith and 
credit performance guaranty or surety of any department, agency, bureau, 
board, commission, or establishment of the United States government, 
provided there is no evidence to suggest that the guaranty has become 
unenforceable and the institution can demonstrate that it is in 
compliance with the terms and conditions of the guaranty.
    (2) Any loan or portion of a loan guaranteed by a Farm Credit System 
institution, pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 614.4345 on guaranty 
agreements. This exclusion does not apply to the institution providing 
the guaranty.
    (3) Any loan or portion of a loan that is secured by bonds, notes, 
certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States or 
by other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the 
United States government, provided the loans are fully secured by the 
current market value of such obligations. If the market value of the 
collateral declines to below the balance of the loan, and the entire 
loan, individually, or when combined with other loans and undisbursed 
commitments to or attributed to the borrower, causes the borrower's 
total indebtedness to exceed the institution's lending limit, the 
institution shall have 5 business days to bring the loan into 
conformance before it shall be deemed to be in violation of the lending 
limit.
    (4) Interests in loans sold, including participation interests, when 
the sale agreement meets the following requirements:
    (i) The interest must be sold without recourse; and
    (ii) The agreement under which the interest is sold must provide for 
the sharing of all payments of principal, collection expenses, 
collateral proceeds, and risk of loss on a pro rata basis according to 
the percentage interest in the principal amount of the loan. Agreements 
that provide for the pro rata sharing to commence at the time of default 
or similar event, as defined in the agreement under which the interest 
is sold, shall be considered to be pro rata agreements, notwithstanding 
the fact that advances are made and payments are distributed on a basis 
other than pro rata prior to that time.
    (5) Interests in leases sold when the sale agreement provides that:
    (i) The interest sold must be:
    (A) An undivided interest in all the lease payments or the residual 
value of all the leased property; or
    (B) A fractional undivided interest in the total lease transaction;
    (ii) The interest must be sold without recourse; and
    (iii) Sharing of all lease payments must be on a pro rata basis 
according to the percentage interest in the lease payments.
    (6) Loans sold in their entirety to a pooler certified by the 
Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, if an interest in a pool of 
subordinated participation interests is purchased to satisfy the 
requirements of title VIII of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 614.4359  Attribution rules.

    (a) For the purpose of applying the lending and leasing limit to the 
indebtedness of a borrower, loans to a related borrower shall be 
combined with loans outstanding to the borrower and attributed to the 
borrower when any one of the following three conditions exist:
    (1) Liability. (i) The borrower has primary or secondary liability 
on a loan made to the related borrower. The amount of such loan 
attributable to the borrower is limited to the amount of the borrower's 
liability.
    (ii) This section does not require attribution of a guarantee taken 
out of an abundance of caution. To qualify for the abundance of caution 
exception to the requirements of this subpart, the institution must 
document in the loan file that the loan, when evaluated under the loan 
underwriting standards adopted pursuant to Sec. 614.4150 of this part 
without considering the guarantee, would support the credit decision 
under the same basic terms and conditions.
    (iii) For the banks for cooperatives and agricultural credit banks 
operating under title III authorities of the Act, look-through notes are 
exempt from

[[Page 131]]

the lending limit provisions provided they meet the criteria of Sec. 
614.4357.
    (2) Financial interdependence. The operations of a borrower and 
related borrower are financially interdependent. Financial 
interdependence exists if the borrower is the primary source of 
repayment for a related borrower's loan, or if the operations of the 
borrower and the related borrower are commingled.
    (i) The borrower shall be considered the primary source of repayment 
on the loan to the related borrower if the borrower is obligated to 
supply 50 percent or more of the related borrower's annual gross 
receipts, and reliance on the income from one another is such that, 
regardless of the solvency and liquidity of the borrower's operations, 
the debt service obligation of the related borrower could not be met if 
income flow from the borrower is interrupted or terminated. For the 
purpose of this paragraph, gross receipts include, but are not limited 
to, revenues, intercompany loans, dividends and capital contributions.
    (ii) The assets or operations of the borrower and related borrower 
are considered to be commingled if they cannot be separated without 
materially impacting the economic survival of the individual operations 
and their ability to repay their loans.
    (3) Control. The borrower directly or indirectly controls the 
related borrower. A borrower is deemed to control a related borrower if 
either paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section exist:
    (i) The borrower, directly or acting through one or more other 
persons, owns 50 percent or more of the stock of the related borrower; 
or
    (ii) The borrower, directly or acting through one or more other 
persons, owns or has the power to vote 25 percent or more of the voting 
stock of a related borrower, and meets at least one of the following 
three conditions:
    (A) The borrower shares a common directorate or management with a 
related borrower. A common directorate is deemed to exist when a 
majority of the directors, trustees, or other persons performing similar 
functions of one borrower also serves the other borrower in a like 
capacity. A common management is deemed to exist if any employee of the 
borrower holds the position of chief executive officer, chief operating 
officer, chief financial officer, or an equivalent position in the 
related borrower's organization.
    (B) The borrower controls in any manner the election of a majority 
of directors of a related borrower.
    (C) The borrower exercises or has the power to exercise a 
controlling influence over management of a related borrower's operations 
through the provisions of management placement or marketing agreements, 
or providing services such as insurance carrier or bookkeeping.
    (b) Each institution shall make provisions for appropriately 
designating loans to a related borrower that are combined with the 
borrower's loan and attributed to the borrower to ensure that loans to 
the borrower are within the lending and leasing limits.
    (c) Attribution rules table. For the purposes of applying the 
lending and leasing limit to the indebtedness of a borrower, loans to a 
related borrower shall be combined with loans outstanding to the 
borrower and attributed to the borrower when any one of three 
attribution rules are met as outlined in Table 1.

    (a) Each loan, except loans that are grandfathered under the 
provisions of Sec. 614.4361, shall be in compliance with the lending 
and leasing limit on the date the loan is made, and at all times 
thereafter. Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, 
loans which are in violation of the lending and leasing limit shall 
comply with the provisions of Sec. 615.5090 of this chapter.
    (b) Under the following conditions a loan that violates the lending 
and leasing limit shall be exempt from the provisions of Sec. 615.5090 
of this chapter:
    (1) A loan in which the total amount of principal outstanding and 
undisbursed commitments exceed the lending and leasing limit because of 
a decline in permanent capital after the loan was made.
    (2) Loans on which funds are advanced pursuant to a commitment that 
was within the lending and leasing limit at the time the commitment was 
made, even if the lending and leasing limit subsequently declines.
    (3) A loan that exceeds the lending and leasing limit as a result of 
the consolidation of the debt of two or more borrowers as a consequence 
of a merger or the acquisition of one borrower's operations by another 
borrower. Such a loan may be extended or renewed, for a period not to 
exceed 1 year from the date of such merger or acquisition, during which 
period the institution may advance and/or readvance funds not to exceed 
the greater of:
    (i) 110 percent of the advances to the borrower in the prior 
calendar year; or
    (ii) 110 percent of the average of the advances to the borrower in 
the past 3 calendar years.
    (c) For all lending and leasing limit violations except those 
exempted under Sec. 614.4360(b)(3), within 90 days of the 
identification of the violation, the institution must develop a written 
plan prescribing the specific actions that will be taken by the 
institution to bring the total amount of loans and commitments 
outstanding or attributed to that borrower within the new lending and 
leasing limit, and must document the plan in the loan file.
    (d) All leases, except those permitted under Sec. 614.4361, reading 
``effective date of this subpart'' in Sec. 614.4361(a) and ``effective 
date of these regulations'' in Sec. 614.4361(b) as ``effective date of 
this amendment,'' must comply with the lending and leasing limit on the 
date the lease is made, and at all times after that.

administrative action, including, but not limited to, monetary 
penalties, as a result of lending and leasing limit violations.

                    Programs; Right of First Refusal


<R05>
Sec. 614.4510  General.

    Direct lenders shall be responsible for the servicing of the loans 
that they make. However, loan participation agreements may designate 
specific loan servicing efforts to be accomplished by a participating 
institution. Each direct lender shall adopt loan servicing policies and 
procedures to assure that loans will be serviced fairly and equitably 
for the borrower while minimizing the risk for the lender. Procedures 
shall include specific plans that help preserve the quality of sound 
loans and that help correct credit deficiencies as they develop.
    (a) The Farm Credit Bank shall provide guidelines for the servicing 
of loans by the Federal land bank associations. The servicing may be 
accomplished either under the direct supervision of the bank or under 
delegated authority.
    (b) The servicing of loans which are participated in by Farm Credit 
System institutions shall be in accordance with Sec. 614.4325.
    (c) In the development of loan servicing policies and procedures, 
the following criteria shall be included:
    (1) Term loans. The objective shall be to provide borrowers with 
prompt and efficient service with respect to actions in such areas as 
personal liability, partial release of security, insurance requirements 
or adjustments, loan divisions or transfers, or conditional payments. 
Procedures shall provide for adequate inspections, reanalyses, 
reappraisals, controls on payment of insurance and taxes (and for 
payment when necessary), and prompt exercise of legal options to 
preserve the lender's collateral position or guard against loss. Loan 
servicing policies for rural home loans shall recognize the inherent 
differences between agricultural and rural home lending.
    (2) Operating loans. The objective shall be to service such loans to 
assure disbursement in accordance with the basis of approval, repayment 
from the sources obligated or pledged, and to minimize risk exposure to 
the lender. Procedures shall require:
    (i) The procurement of periodic operating data essential for 
maintaining control, for the proper analysis of such data, and prompt 
action as needed;
    (ii) Inspections, reappraisals, and borrower visits appropriate to 
the nature and quality of the loan; and
    (iii) Controls on insurance, margin requirements, warehousing, and 
the prompt exercise of legal options to preserve the lender's collateral 
position and guard against loss.
    (3) Legal entity loans. In addition to the foregoing servicing 
objectives for term and operating loans, procedures for servicing these 
loans shall require procurement of data on changes in ownership, 
control, and management; review of business objectives, financing 
programs, organizational structure,

[[Page 135]]

and operating methods, and appropriate analysis of such changes with 
provision for action as needed.

    (d) Denial of OFI access. A Farm Credit Bank or an agricultural 
credit bank may deny the funding request of any creditworthy OFI that 
meets the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section only when such 
request would:
    (1) Adversely affect a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit 
bank's ability to:
    (i) Achieve and maintain established or projected capital levels; or
    (ii) Raise funds in the money markets; or
    (2) Otherwise expose the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit

or aquatic operations in the chartered territory of another Farm Credit 
bank unless it notifies such bank in writing within five (5) business 
days of receiving the OFI's application for financing. Two or more Farm 
Credit banks cannot simultaneously fund the same OFI.

the throughput shall be included in the calculation that Sec. 
613.3010(b)(1) of this chapter establishes for Farm Credit Banks and 
agricultural credit banks.
    (d) The borrower rights requirements in part C of title IV of the 
Act, and the regulations in part 617 of this chapter shall apply to all

financial assistance from a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit 
bank, all State banks, trust companies, or State-chartered savings 
associations shall execute a written consent that authorizes their State 
regulators to furnish examination reports to the Farm Credit 
Administration upon its request. Any OFI that is not a depository

agricultural credit bank shall develop policies and loan underwriting 
standards that establish uniform and objective requirements to determine 
the need and amount of supplemental collateral or other credit 
enhancements that each OFI shall provide as a condition for obtaining 
funding, discount and other similar financial assistance from such Farm 
Credit bank.
    (2) The amount, type, and quality of supplemental collateral or

of risk that the OFI poses to the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural 
credit bank.

    (a) No obligation shall be purchased from or discounted for and no 
loan shall be made or other similar financial assistance extended by a 
Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank to an OFI if the amount of 
such obligation added to the aggregate liabilities of such OFI, whether 
direct or contingent (other than bona fide deposit liabilities), exceeds 
ten times the paid-in and unimpaired capital and surplus of such OFI or 
the amount of such liabilities permitted under the laws of the 
jurisdiction creating such OFI, whichever is less.
    (b) It shall be unlawful for any national bank that is indebted to 
any Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank, on paper discounted or 
purchased, to incur any additional indebtedness, if by virtue of such 
additional indebtedness its aggregate liabilities, direct or contingent,

requirements to both OFIs and Farm Credit System direct lender 
associations.
    (b) The total charges that a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit 
bank assesses an OFI through capitalization requirements, interest 
rates, and fees shall be comparable to the charges that the same Farm 
Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank imposes on its direct lender 
associations. Any variation between the overall funding costs that OFIs 
and direct lender associations are charged by the same funding bank 
shall result from differences in credit risk and administrative costs to 
the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank.
    (c) Upon request, each Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank 
must provide each OFI and OFI applicant, that has or is seeking to 
establish a funding relationship with the Farm Credit Bank or 
agricultural credit bank, a copy of its policies, procedures, loan

points.
    (d) Upon request of any OFI or OFI applicant, that has or is seeking 
to establish a funding relationship with the Farm Credit Bank or 
agricultural credit bank, the bank must explain in writing the reasons 
for any variation in the overall funding costs it charges to OFIs and 
affiliated direct lender associations. The written explanation must 
compare the cost of funds that the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural 
credit bank charges the OFIs and affiliated direct lender associations. 
When possible, the written explanation shall compare the costs of 
funding that the bank charges several OFIs and Farm Credit associations 
that are similar in

[[Page 140]]

disclose financial or confidential information about any individual Farm 
Credit association.

credit bank becomes insolvent, is in process of liquidation, or fails to 
service its loans properly, the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit 
bank may take over such loans and other assets that the OFI pledged as 
collateral. Once the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank 
exercises its remedies, it shall have the authority to make additional 
advances, to grant renewals and extensions, and to take such other 
actions as may be necessary to collect and service loans to the OFI's 
borrower. The funding Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank may

and experience with the importer indicate recourse is not necessary or 
unless appropriate guarantees or insurance plans are used.

the policies of each bank's board of directors. The policies shall 
provide a method of determining the maximum amount in dollars, by 
country, to be financed and establishing a maximum percentage of the

advance funds. The banks shall take into consideration the following 
factors:
    (1) The reputation and financial strength of the foreign importer.

conversion can be made, or the extent to which foreign currency exposure 
may be hedged by forward or future contracts.

[[Page 141]]

    (5) The reputation and financial strength of the exporter.
    (e) The banks may establish foreign trade receivable financing 
programs by which eligible parties pledge collections to the bank, and 
then may borrow from the bank up to a stated maximum percentage of the 
total amount of receivables pledged at any one time.
    (f) When financing foreign trade receivables, the banks shall take 
such precautions and obtain such credit information as necessary to 
ascertain that all parties to the transaction(s) being financed are 
reputable and capable of performing their responsibilities under the 
contract of sale.
    (g) When financing foreign trade receivables, the banks shall 
determine that all shipments are covered by maritime insurance while on 
the high seas.
    (h) Countries where credit is to be extended will be analyzed 
periodically and systematically on a centralized basis. The resulting 
country studies will be disseminated to all banks for cooperatives and 
agricultural credit banks to be used as inputs in credit grading 
decisions.

Sec. 614.4900  Foreign exchange.

    (a) Before a bank for cooperatives or an agricultural credit bank 
may engage in any financial transaction which transports monetary 
instruments from any place within the United States to or through any 
place outside the United States or to any place within the United 
States, the bank must have policies adopted by the bank's board of 
directors governing such transactions and must have established bank 
procedures to safeguard the interests of the stockholders of the bank in 
regard to such transactions.
    (b) Under policies adopted by the bank's board of directors, a bank 
for cooperatives or an agricultural credit bank may engage in currency 
exchange activities necessary to service individual transactions that 
may be financed under the regulations authorizing export, import, and 
other internationally related credit and financial services. These 
currency exchange activities shall not include any loans or commitments 
intended to finance speculative futures transactions by eligible 
borrowers in foreign currencies. The bank may engage, on behalf of the 
eligible borrowers or on its own behalf, in bona fide hedging 
transactions and positions, where such transactions or positions 
normally reduce risks in the conduct and management of international 
financial activities. The bank's policies should include established 
guidelines for:
    (1) Net overnight positions, by currency.
    (2) Maturity distribution, by currency, of foreign currency assets, 
liabilities, and foreign exchange contracts.
    (3) Outstanding contracts with individual customers and banks.
    (4) Credit approval procedures safeguarding against delivery or 
settlement risk.
    (5) Total value of outstanding contracts--spot and forward.
    (c) A bank for cooperatives or an agricultural credit bank is 
responsible for its compliance with the laws of the United States in 
regard to reporting requirements of the Department of the Treasury 
pertaining to currency exchange activities and international transfers 
of monetary instruments.
    (d) A bank for cooperatives or an agricultural credit bank engaged 
in foreign exchange trading shall have written policies describing the 
scope of trading activity authorized, delegation of authority, types of 
services offered, trading limits, reporting requirements, and internal 
accounting controls.
    (e) The bank's trading guideline policies should provide for 
reporting procedures adequate to inform management properly of trading 
activities and to facilitate detection of lack of compliance with policy 
directives.
    (f) The bank's policies shall establish foreign exchange delivery 
limits for eligible customers with relationship to the customer's 
financial capability to bear the financial risks assumed. The bank will 
be expected to maintain documentary evidence that a customer's delivery 
exposure is reasonable, and that responsible bank officers routinely 
review outstanding delivery exposure of individual customers.
    (g) The bank's personnel policies shall include written standards of 
conduct for those involved with foreign exchange activities, including 
the following which should be prohibited:
    (1) Trading with entities affiliated with the bank or with members 
of the board of directors.
    (2) Foreign exchange and deposit transactions with other bank 
employees.
    (3) Personal business relationships with foreign exchange and money 
brokers with whom the bank deals.
    (h) The bank's policies should provide detailed instructions 
regarding the need for bank officers to disclose the limits of 
responsibility and liability of the bank when it holds positions or

[[Page 143]]

executes contracts for the account of eligible parties. The bank's 
policies regarding the respective procedures should provide reasonable 
assurance that reports on trading activities are current and complete, 
and that the opportunity for concealment of unauthorized transactions is 
kept at the absolute minimum.
    (i) The banks for cooperatives and agricultural credit banks shall 
use the Funding Corporation for purposes of trading foreign exchange. 
All foreign exchange transactions shall be made by the Funding 
Corporation on behalf of the banks consistent with instructions received 
from the respective banks.
    (j) Guidelines (b) through (i) of this section will not apply if a 
bank purchases or sells foreign exchange through a commercial bank and 
has no foreign exchange risk exposure.

<R05>
Sec. 614.4930  Requirement to purchase flood insurance where available.

    (a) In general. A System institution shall not make, increase, 
extend or renew any designated loan unless the building or mobile home 
and any personal property securing the loan are covered by flood 
insurance for the term of the loan. The amount of insurance must be at 
least equal to the outstanding principal balance of the designated loan 
or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of 
property under the 1968 Act. Flood insurance coverage under the Act is 
limited to the overall value of the property securing the designated 
loan minus the value of the land on which the property is located.
    (b) Table funded loans. A System institution that acquires a loan 
from a mortgage broker or other entity through table funding shall be 
considered to be making a loan for purposes of this part.
    (c) Exemptions. The flood insurance requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section does not apply with respect to:
    (1) Any State-owned property covered under a policy of self-
insurance satisfactory to the Director of FEMA, who publishes and 
periodically revises the list of States falling within this exemption; 
or
    (2) Property securing any loan with an original principal balance of 
$5,000 or less and a repayment term of one year or less.

or renewed on or after October 4, 1996, the institution shall also 
require the escrow of all premiums and fees for any flood insurance 
required under Sec. 614.4930. The institution, or a servicer acting on 
behalf of the institution, shall deposit the flood insurance premiums on 
behalf of the borrower in an escrow account. This escrow account will be 
subject to escrow requirements adopted pursuant to section 10 of the 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2609) (RESPA), 
which generally limits the amount that may be maintained in escrow 
accounts for certain types of loans and requires escrow account 
statements for those accounts, only if the loan is otherwise subject to 
RESPA. Following receipt of a notice from the Director of FEMA or other 
provider of flood insurance that premiums are due, the institution, or a 
servicer acting on behalf of the institution, shall pay the amount owed 
to the insurance provider from the escrow account by the date when such 
premiums are due.


<R05>
Sec. 614.4940  Required use of standard flood hazard determination form.

    (a) Use of form. System institutions must use the standard flood 
hazard determination form developed by the Director of FEMA when 
determining whether the building or mobile home offered as collateral 
security for a loan is or will be located in a special flood hazard area 
in which flood insurance is available under the 1968 Act. The standard 
flood hazard determination form may be used in a printed, computerized, 
or electronic manner. A System institution may obtain the standard flood 
hazard determination form by written request to FEMA, P.O. Box 2012, 
Jessup, MD 20794-2012.

[[Page 145]]

    (b) Retention of form. System institutions shall retain a copy of 
the completed standard flood hazard determination form, in either hard 
copy or electronic form, for the period of time the institution owns the 
loan.

<R05>
Sec. 614.4945  Forced placement of flood insurance.

    If a System institution, or a servicer acting on behalf of the 
institution, determines at any time during the term of a designated 
loan, that the building or mobile home and any personal property 
securing the designated loan are not covered by flood insurance or are 
covered by flood insurance in an amount less than the amount required 
under Sec. 614.4930(a), then the institution or its servicer shall 
notify the borrower that the borrower should obtain flood insurance, at 
the borrower's expense, in an amount at least equal to the amount 
required under Sec. 614.4930(a), for the remaining term of the loan. If 
the borrower fails to obtain flood insurance within 45 days after 
notification, then the institution or its servicer shall purchase 
insurance on the borrower's behalf. The institution or its servicer may 
charge the borrower for the cost of premiums and fees incurred in 
purchasing the insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 614.4950  Determination fees.

    (a) General. Notwithstanding any Federal or State law other than the 
1973 Act, any System institution, or a servicer acting on behalf of the 
institution, may charge a reasonable fee for determining whether the 
building or mobile home securing the loan is located or will be located 
in a special flood hazard area. A determination fee may also include, 
but is not limited to, a fee for life-of-loan monitoring.
    (b) Borrower fee. The determination fee authorized by paragraph (a) 
of this section may be charged to the borrower if the determination:
    (1) Is made in connection with a making, increasing, extending, or 
renewing of the loan that is initiated by the borrower;
    (2) Reflects the Director of FEMA's revision or updating of 
floodplain areas or flood-risk zones;
    (3) Reflects the Director of FEMA's publication of a notice or 
compendium that:
    (i) Affects the area in which the building or mobile home securing 
the loan is located; or
    (ii) By determination of the Director of FEMA, may reasonably 
require a determination whether the building or mobile home securing the 
loan is located in a special flood hazard area; or
    (4) Results in the purchase of flood insurance coverage under Sec. 
614.4945.
    (c) Purchaser or transferee fee. The determination fee authorized by 
paragraph (a) of this section may be charged to the purchaser or 
transferee of a loan in the case of the sale or transfer of the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 614.4955  Notice of special flood hazards and availability of Federal disaster relief assistance.

    (a) Notice requirement. When a System institution makes, increases, 
extends, or renews a loan secured by a building or a mobile home located 
or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the institution shall 
mail or deliver a written notice containing the information specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section to the borrower and to the servicer of the 
loan. Notice is required whether or not flood insurance is available 
under the 1968 Act for the collateral securing the loan.
    (b) Contents of notice. The written notice must include the 
following information:
    (1) A warning, in a form approved by the Director of FEMA, that the 
building or the mobile home is or will be located in a special flood 
hazard area;
    (2) A description of the flood insurance purchase requirements set 
forth in section 102(b) of the 1973 Act (42 U.S.C. 4012a(b));
    (3) A statement, where applicable, that flood insurance coverage is 
available under the NFIP and also may be available from private 
insurers; and
    (4) A statement whether Federal disaster relief assistance may be 
available in the event of damage to the building or the mobile home 
caused by flooding in a Federally declared disaster.
    (c) Timing of notice. The institution shall provide the notice 
required by

[[Page 146]]

paragraph (a) of this section to the borrower within a reasonable time 
before the completion of the transaction, and to the servicer as 
promptly as practicable after the institution provides notice to the 
borrower and in any event no later than the time the institution 
provides other similar notices to the servicer concerning hazard 
insurance and taxes. Notice to the servicer may be made electronically 
or may take the form of a copy of the notice to the borrower.
    (d) Record of receipt. Each institution shall retain a record of the 
receipt of the notices by the borrower and the servicer for the period 
of time the institution owns the loan.
    (e) Alternate method of notice. Instead of providing the notice to 
the borrower required by paragraph (a) of this section, an institution 
may obtain satisfactory written assurance from a seller or lessor that, 
within a reasonable time before the completion of the sale or lease 
transaction, the seller or lessor has provided such notice to the 
purchaser or lessee. The institution shall retain a record of the 
written assurance from the seller or lessor for the period of time the 
institution owns the loan.
    (f) Use of prescribed form of notice. An institution will be 
considered to be in compliance with the requirements of this section for 
notice to the borrower by providing written notice to the borrower 
containing the language presented in appendix A to this subpart within a 
reasonable time before the completion of the transaction. The notice 
presented in appendix A to this subpart satisfies the borrower notice 
requirements of the 1968 Act.


<R05>
Sec. 614.4960  Notice of servicer's identity.

    (a) Notice requirement. When a System institution makes, increases, 
extends, renews, sells, or transfers a loan secured by a building or 
mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the 
institution shall notify the Director of FEMA (or the Director's 
designee) in writing of the identity of the servicer of the loan. The 
Director of FEMA has designated the insurance provider to receive the 
institution's notice of the servicer's identity. This notice may be 
provided electronically if electronic transmission is satisfactory to 
the Director of FEMA's designee.
    (b) Transfer of servicing rights. The institution shall notify the 
Director of FEMA (or the Director's designee) of any change in the 
servicer of a loan described in paragraph (a) of this section within 60 
days after the effective date of the change. This notice may be provided 
electronically if electronic transmission is satisfactory to the 
Director of FEMA's designee. Upon any change in the servicing of a loan 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the duty to provide notice 
under this paragraph (b) shall transfer to the transferee servicer.


<R05>
   Sec. Appendix A to Subpart S of Part 614--Sample Form of Notice of 
   Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief 
                               Assistance

    We are giving you this notice to inform you that:
    The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have 
applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.
    The area has been identified by the Director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using 
FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map or the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for the 
following community: ----------------. This area has at least a one 
percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood 
elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-
year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood 
hazard area is 26 percent (26%).
    Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the 
Director of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property 
securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you 
would like to make such a request, please contact us for further 
information.
    ------ The community in which the property securing the loan is 
located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 
Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied 
for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be 
maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew 
flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us 
to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be 
purchased through an insurance

[[Page 147]]

agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or 
through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood 
insurance also may be available from private insurers that do not 
participate in the NFIP.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must 
cover the lesser of:
    (1) The outstanding principal balance of the loan; or
    (2) The maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property 
under the NFIP.
    Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the overall 
value of the property securing the loan minus the value of the land on 
which the property is located.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in 
the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred 
in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in 
the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.
    ------ Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for 
the property securing the loan because the community in which the 
property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if 
the non-participating community has been identified for at least one 
year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in 
the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief 
assistance in the event of a Federally-declared flood disaster.

eligible collateral, the borrowing bank shall not count the assets 
securing such loan.

is in compliance with the statutory requirements for maintenance of 
collateral. Such procedures shall include provisions for:

the bank or association will be secured by a first lien or its 
equivalent on the borrower's interest in the primary real estate 
security. However, the note shall be withdrawn from collateral upon the 
expiration of 1 year from the date of the loan closing, unless, before 
the end of such period:

has been licensed to issue such policies by the appropriate state 
insurance regulatory body or bodies, has not been barred or suspended, 
and has been approved by the lending institution;
    (ii) The standard form on which the final policy was issued has been 
approved by the counsel for the lending institution;

    (iv) Personnel meeting written standards of training and experience 
in real estate title matters prescribed by the counsel for the lending 
institution certified in writing that:
    (A) They reviewed the final policy and that the policy complies with

from a security standpoint has been obtained on the primary real estate 
security for the loan.

association is a participant and involving a loan originated by another 
lender shall constitute an obligation meeting the collateral 
requirements of Sec. 615.5050(a).

<R05>
Sec. 615.5120  Purchase eligibility requirement.

    (a) Limitations. Eligibility to purchase Farm Credit Investment 
Bonds shall be limited to members and employees of the Farm Credit banks 
and associations, except any bank officers, directors, and employees who 
are involved in setting the term or rate, to retired employees who are 
beneficiaries of a pension or retirement program of the Farm Credit 
banks or associations, and to retired employees of the Farm Credit 
Administration. A member of a Farm Credit association or a bank for 
cooperatives need not be an active borrower to be eligible. A member of 
any Farm Credit institution may purchase investment bonds from any of 
the institutions in the district which offer the purchase program. 
Patrons, members, employees, or stockholder of other financing 
institutions discounting loans with a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural 
credit bank or of any legal entity which is a borrower from any Farm 
Credit institution as such are ineligible as they are not members of a 
Farm Credit institution. Stock or participation certificates shall not 
be sold merely to qualify a party for the purchase of Farm Credit 
Investment Bonds. For purposes of this section ``member'' means a 
stockholder or participation certificate holder who acquired stock or 
participation certificates to obtain a loan, to purchase stock for 
investment or to qualify for other services of the association or bank. 
A person who assumes a loan is not a member unless he becomes a 
stockholder or participation certificate holder in connection with that 
loan. Employee means a regular full-time employee of a Farm Credit bank 
or association. Retired employee means a retiree who is a direct 
beneficiary of a pension or retirement program of a Farm Credit bank or 
association or the Farm Credit Administration under civil service 
retirement.

[[Page 153]]

    (b) Form and ownership. Farm Credit Investment Bonds are registered 
bonds issued in definitive or book-entry form depending on investor 
preference. The registration used must express the actual ownership of 
an interest in the bond and will be considered by the issuing 
institution as conclusive of such ownership and interest. No designation 
of an attorney, agent, or other representative to request or receive 
payment on behalf of the owner or coowner, nor any restriction on the 
right of the owner or coowner to receive payment of the bond or 
interest, except as provided in this section may be made in the 
registration or otherwise. Registrations requested in applications for 
the purchase shall be clear, accurate, complete, and conform with one of 
the registration provisions set forth in this section, and include the 
appropriate taxpayer identifying number. Registrations requested will be 
inscribed on the face of the bond if in definitive form or on the 
confirmation of investment if in book-entry form. The following 
provisions shall apply for registration of Farm Credit Investment Bonds:
    (1) In all cases the member's name (whether a natural person, 
fiduciary, or legal entity) or employee's name must appear as owner of 
the bond.
    (2) A bond may be registered in the name of a fiduciary only if the 
fiduciary is in fact the member.
    (3) A member or employee may not use a form of registration (such as 
a gift to a minor, irrevocable trust, etc.) which would divest himself 
of ownership. However, a minor may be named as coowner or beneficiary.
    (4) If a member is a natural person, a second natural person, member 
or nonmember, may be named as coowner or beneficiary. Coownership may 
not involve a fiduciary or private organization.
    (5) In the coownership form the connective ``or'' shall serve the 
same purpose as ``joint tenants with right of survivorship.''

means a rating organization that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
recognizes as an NRSRO.
    (j) Revenue bond means an obligation of a municipal government that

by the project or enterprise to the bondholders.
    (k) Weighted average life (WAL) means the average time until the 
investor receives the principal on a security, weighted by the size of 
each principal payment and calculated under specified prepayment 
assumptions.

directors must also ensure that management complies with these policies 
and that appropriate internal controls are in place to prevent loss. 
Annually, the board of directors must review these investment policies 
and make any changes that are needed.
    (b) Investment policies. Your board's written investment policies 
must address the purposes and objectives of investments, risk tolerance, 
delegations of authority, and reporting requirements. Investment 
policies must be appropriate for the size, types, and risk 
characteristics of your investments.
    (c) Risk tolerance. Your investment policies must establish risk 
limits and diversification requirements for the various classes of 
eligible investments and for the entire investment portfolio. These 
policies must ensure that you maintain appropriate diversification of 
your investment portfolio. Risk limits must be based on your 
institutional objectives, capital position, and risk tolerance. Your 
policies must identify the types and quantity of investments that you 
will hold to achieve your objectives and control credit, market, 
liquidity, and operational risks. The policy of any association or 
service corporation that holds significant investments and each bank 
must establish risk limits for the following four types of risk.
    (1) Credit risk. Investment policies must establish:

diversification standards that limit concentrations based on a single or 
related counterparty(ies), a geographical area, industries or 
obligations with similar characteristics.
    (ii) Criteria for selecting brokers, dealers, and investment bankers 
(collectively, securities firms). You must buy and sell eligible 
investments with more than one securities firm. As part

determine whether to continue your existing relationships with them.
    (iii) Collateral margin requirements on repurchase agreements.
    (2) Market risk. Investment policies must set market risk limits for 
specific types of investments, the investment portfolio, or your 
institution. Your board of directors must establish market risk limits 
in accordance with these regulations and our other policies.
    (3) Liquidity risk. Investment policies must describe the liquidity 
characteristics of eligible investments that you will hold to meet your 
liquidity needs and institutional objectives.
    (4) Operational risk. Investment policies must address operational 
risks, including delegations of authority and internal controls in

    (d) Delegation of authority. All delegations of authority to 
specified personnel or committees must state the extent of management's 
authority and responsibilities for investments.
    (e) Internal controls. You must:
    (1) Establish appropriate internal controls to detect and prevent 
loss, fraud, embezzlement, conflicts of interest, and unauthorized 
investments.
    (2) Establish and maintain a separation of duties and supervision 
between personnel who execute investment transactions and personnel who 
approve, revaluate, and oversee investments.
    (3) Maintain management information systems that are appropriate for 
the level and complexity of your investment activities.
    (f) Securities valuation. (1) Before you purchase a security, you 
must evaluate its credit quality and its price sensitivity to changes in 
market interest rates. You must also verify the value of a security that 
you plan to purchase, other than a new issue, with a source that is 
independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty or other intermediary to 
the transaction.
    (2) You must determine the fair market value of each security in 
your portfolio and the fair market value of your whole investment 
portfolio at least monthly. You must also evaluate the credit quality 
and price sensitivity to change in market interest rates of all 
investments that you hold on an ongoing basis.
    (3) Before you sell a security, you must verify its value with a 
source that is independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty, or other 
intermediary to the transaction.
    (g) Reports to the board. Each quarter, management must report to 
the board of directors or a board committee on the performance and risk 
of each class of investments and the entire investment portfolio. These 
reports must identify all gains and losses that you incur during the 
quarter on individual securities that you sold before maturity. Reports 
must also identify potential risk exposure to changes in market interest 
rates and other factors that may affect the value of your bank's 
investment holdings. Management's report must discuss how investments 
affect your bank's overall financial condition and must evaluate whether 
the performance of the investment portfolio effectively achieves the 
board's objectives. Any deviations from the board's policies must be 
specifically identified in the report.

Sec. 615.5134  Liquidity reserve requirement.

    (a) Each Farm Credit bank must maintain a liquidity reserve, 
discounted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, sufficient 
to fund 90 days of the principal portion of maturing obligations and 
other borrowings of the bank at all times. The liquidity reserve may 
only be funded from cash, including cash due from traded but not yet 
settled debt, and the eligible investments under Sec. 615.5140. Money 
market instruments, floating, and fixed rate debt securities used to 
fund the liquidity reserve must be backed by the full faith and credit 
of the United States or rated in one of the two highest NRSRO credit 
categories. If not rated, the issuer's NRSRO credit rating, if one of 
the two highest, may be used.

[[Page 156]]

    (b) All investments that the bank holds for the purpose of meeting 
the liquidity reserve requirement of this section must be free of lien.
    (c) The liquid assets of the liquidity reserve are discounted as 
follows:
    (1) Multiply cash and overnight investments by 100 percent.
    (2) Multiply money market instruments and floating rate debt 
securities that are below the contractual cap rate by 95 percent of the 
market value.
    (3) Multiply fixed rate debt securities and floating rate debt 
securities that meet or exceed the contractual cap rate by 90 percent of 
the market value.
    (4) Multiply individual securities in diversified investment funds 
by the discounts that would apply to the securities if held separately.
    (d) Each Farm Credit bank must have a contingency plan to address 
liquidity shortfalls during market disruptions. The board of directors 
must review the plan each year, making all needed changes. Farm Credit 
banks may incorporate these requirements into their Sec. 615.5133 
investment management policies.

earnings and market values by conducting interest rate shock tests and 
simulations of multiple economic scenarios at least on a quarterly 
basis;
    (c) Explore and implement actions needed to obtain its desired risk 
management objectives;
    (d) Document the objectives that the bank is attempting to achieve

    An emergency shall be deemed to exist whenever a financial, 
economic, agricultural or national defense crisis could impede the 
normal access of Farm Credit banks to the capital markets. Whenever the 
Farm Credit Administration determines after consultations with the 
Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation that such an emergency 
exists, the Farm Credit Administration Board shall, in its sole 
discretion, adopt a resolution that:

    (b) Rating of foreign countries. Whenever the obligor or issuer of 
an eligible investment is located outside the United States, the host 
country must maintain the highest sovereign rating for political and 
economic stability by an NRSRO.

[[Page 159]]

    (c) Marketable securities. All eligible investments, except money 
market instruments, must be marketable. An eligible investment is 
marketable if you can sell it quickly at a price that closely reflects 
its fair value in an active and universally recognized secondary market.
    (d) Obligor limits. (1) You may not invest more than 20 percent of 
your total capital in eligible investments issued by any single 
institution, issuer, or obligor. This obligor limit does not apply to 
obligations, including mortgage securities, that are issued or 
guaranteed as to interest and principal by the United States, its 
agencies, instrumentalities, or corporations.
    (2) Obligor limits for your holdings in an investment company. You 
must count securities that you hold through an investment company 
towards the obligor limit of this section unless the investment 
company's holdings of the security of any one issuer do not exceed five 
(5) percent of the investment company's total portfolio.
    (e) Other investments approved by the FCA. You may purchase and hold 
other investments that we approve. Your request for our approval must 
explain the risk characteristics of the investment and your purpose and 
objectives for making the investment.

Sec. 615.5141  Stress tests for mortgage securities.

    Mortgage securities are not eligible investments unless they pass a 
stress test. You must perform stress tests to determine how interest 
rate changes will affect the cashflow and price of each mortgage 
security that you purchase and hold, except for adjustable rate 
securities that reprice at intervals of 12 months or less and are tied 
to an index. You must also use stress tests to gauge how interest rate 
fluctuations on mortgage securities affect your institution's capital 
and earnings. You may conduct the stress tests as described in either 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
    (a) Mortgage securities must comply with the following three tests 
at the time of purchase and each following quarter:
    (1) Average Life Test. The expected WAL of the instrument does not 
exceed 5 years.
    (2) Average Life Sensitivity Test. The expected WAL does not extend 
for more than 2 years, assuming an immediate and sustained parallel 
shift in the yield curve of plus 300 basis points, nor shorten for more 
than 3 years, assuming an immediate and sustained parallel shift in the 
yield curve of minus 300 basis points.
    (3) Price Sensitivity Test. The estimated change in price is not 
more than thirteen (13) percent due to an immediate and sustained 
parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus 300 basis points.
    (4) Exemption. A floating rate mortgage security is subject only to 
the price sensitivity test in paragraph (a)(3) of this section if at the 
time of purchase and each quarter thereafter it bears a rate of interest 
that is below its contractual cap.
    (b) You may use an alternative stress test to evaluate the price 
sensitivity of your mortgage securities. An alternative stress test must 
be able to measure the price sensitivity of mortgage instruments over 
different interest rate/yield curve scenarios. The methodology that you 
use to analyze mortgage securities must be appropriate for the 
complexity of the instrument's structure and cashflows. Prior to 
purchase and each quarter thereafter, you must use the stress test to 
determine that the risk in the mortgage security is within the risk 
limits of your board's investment policies. The stress test must enable 
you to determine at the time of purchase and each subsequent quarter 
that the mortgage security does not expose your capital or earnings to 
excessive risks.
    (c) You must rely on verifiable information to support all your 
assumptions, including prepayment and interest rate volatility 
assumptions, when you apply the stress tests in either paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section. You must document the basis for all assumptions 
that you use to evaluate the security and its underlying mortgages. You 
must also document all subsequent changes in your assumptions. If at any 
time after purchase, a mortgage

[[Page 160]]

security no longer complies with requirements in this section, you must 
divest it in accordance with Sec. 615.5143.

instrument over a longer period of time. An acceptable divestiture plan 
must require you to dispose of the ineligible investment as quickly as 
possible without substantial financial loss. Until you actually dispose 
of the ineligible investment, the managers of your investment portfolio 
must report at least quarterly to your board of directors about the 
status and performance of the ineligible instrument, the reasons why it 
remains ineligible, and the managers' progress in disposing of the 
investment.

information and other services needed to facilitate transactions which 
may be financed under section 3.7(b) of the Farm Credit Act Amendments

access credit and other services of the entity and shall not be made for 
earnings purposes. The business entity shall be deemed to be principally 
engaged in providing credit information to and performing such servicing 
functions for its members where such activities constitute a materially 
important line of business to its members. Also, investments must be 
made by a bank for cooperatives or agricultural credit bank for its own 
account and not on behalf of its members. The bank for cooperatives or

    (2) Preferential transfer of capital means a transfer of capital 
that is not available to all similarly situated affiliated associations.
    (3) Nonroutine transfer of capital means a transfer of capital that 
is not available in the ordinary course of business.
    (b) Considerations for preferential or nonroutine transfers of 
capital. Before authorizing a preferential or nonroutine transfer of 
capital, a bank board of directors must take into account and document 
whether:
    (1) The transfer of capital is in the best interests of all of the 
shareholders;
    (2) The bank will be able to achieve its capital adequacy and 
business plan goals after making the transfer of capital; and
    (3) The transfer of capital is the ``least cost'' alternative 
available and will enable the association to maintain sound, adequate,

    (a) The Board of Directors of each Farm Credit System institution 
shall determine the amount of total capital, core surplus, total 
surplus, and unallocated surplus needed to assure the institution's 
continued financial viability and to provide for growth necessary to 
meet the needs of its borrowers. The minimum capital standards specified 
in this part are not meant to be adopted as the optimal capital level in 
the institution's capital adequacy plan. Rather, the standards are 
intended to serve as minimum levels of capital that each institution 
must maintain to protect against the credit and other general risks 
inherent in its operations.
    (b) Each Board of Directors shall establish, adopt, and maintain a 
formal written capital adequacy plan as a part of the financial plan 
required by Sec. 618.8440 of this chapter. The plan shall include the 
capital targets that are necessary to achieve the institution's capital 
adequacy goals as well as the minimum permanent capital and surplus 
standards. The plan shall address any projected dividends, patronage 
distribution, equity requirements, or other action that may decrease the 
institution's capital or the components thereof for which minimum 
amounts are required by this part. The plan shall set forth the 
circumstances in which retirements or revolvements of stock or equities 
may occur. If the plan provides for retirement or revolvement of 
equities included in core surplus, in connection with a loan default or 
the death of a former borrower, the plan must require the institution to 
make a prior determination that such retirement or revolvement is in the 
best interest of the institution, and also require the institution to 
charge off an amount of the indebtedness on the loan equal to the amount 
of the equities that are retired or canceled. In addition to factors 
that must be considered in meeting the minimum standards, the board of 
directors shall also consider at least the following factors in 
developing the capital adequacy plan:
    (1) Capability of management and the board of directors;
    (2) Quality of operating policies, procedures, and internal 
controls;
    (3) Quality and quantity of earnings;
    (4) Asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for losses to 
absorb potential loss within the loan and lease portfolios;
    (5) Sufficiency of liquid funds;
    (6) Needs of an institution's customer base; and
    (7) Any other risk-oriented activities, such as funding and interest 
rate risks, potential obligations under joint and several liability, 
contingent and off-balance-sheet liabilities or other conditions 
warranting additional capital.

authority of the country of its organization or principal banking 
operations;
    (3) Receives deposits to a substantial extent in the regular course 
of business; and
    (4) Has the power to accept demand deposits.

    Credit conversion factor means that number by which an off-balance 
sheet item is multiplied to obtain a credit equivalent before placing 
the item in a risk-weight category.
    Credit derivative means a contract that allows one party (the 
protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of an asset or off-
balance sheet credit exposure to another party (the protection 
provider). The value of a credit derivative is dependent, at least in 
part, on the credit performance of a ``reference asset.''

on the assets, whether through subordination provisions or other credit 
enhancement techniques.
    (2) FCA reserves the right to identify other cash flows or related 
interests as credit-enhancing interest-only strips. In determining 
whether a particular interest cash flow functions as a credit-enhancing 
interest-only strip, FCA will consider the economic substance of the 
transaction.
    Credit-enhancing representations and warranties--
    (1) The term credit-enhancing representations and warranties means 
representations and warranties that:
    (i) Are made or assumed in connection with a transfer of assets 
(including loan-servicing assets), and
    (ii) Obligate an institution to protect investors from losses 
arising from credit risk in the assets transferred or loans serviced.
    (2) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties include promises 
to protect a party from losses resulting from the default or 
nonperformance of another party or from an insufficiency in the value of 
the collateral.
    (3) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties do not include:
    (i) Early-default clauses and similar warranties that permit the 
return of, or premium refund clauses covering, loans for a period not to 
exceed 120 days from the date of transfer. These warranties may cover 
only those loans that were originated within 1 year of the date of the 
transfer;
    (ii) Premium refund clauses covering assets guaranteed, in whole or 
in part, by the United States Government, a United States Government 
agency, or a United States Government-sponsored agency, provided the 
premium refund clause is for a period not to exceed 120 days from the 
date of transfer;
    (iii) Warranties that permit the return of assets in instances of 
fraud, misrepresentation, or incomplete documentation; or
    (iv) Clean-up calls if the agreements to repurchase are limited to 
10 percent or less of the original pool balance (except where loans 30 
days or more past due are repurchased).
    Deferred-tax assets that are dependent on future income or future 
events means:
    (1) Deferred-tax assets arising from deductible temporary 
differences dependent upon future income that exceed the amount of taxes 
previously paid that could be recovered through loss carrybacks if 
existing temporary differences (both deductible and taxable and 
regardless of where the related tax-deferred effects are recorded on the 
institution's balance sheet) fully reverse;
    (2) Deferred-tax assets dependent upon future income arising from 
operating loss and tax carryforwards;
    (3) Deferred-tax assets arising from temporary differences that 
could be recovered if existing temporary differences that are dependent 
upon other future events (both deductible and taxable and regardless of 
where the related tax-deferred effects are recorded on the institution's 
balance sheet) fully reverse.
    Direct credit substitute means an arrangement in which an 
institution assumes, in form or in substance, credit risk directly or 
indirectly associated with an on-or off-balance sheet asset or exposure 
that was not previously owned by the institution (third-party asset) and 
the risk assumed by the institution exceeds the pro rata share of

[[Page 165]]

the institution's interest in the third-party asset. If the institution 
has no claim on the third-party asset, then the institution's assumption 
of any credit risk is a direct credit substitute. Direct credit 
substitutes include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Financial standby letters of credit that support financial 
claims on a third party that exceed an institution's pro rata share in 
the financial claim;
    (2) Guarantees, surety arrangements, credit derivatives, and similar 
instruments backing financial claims that exceed an institution's pro 
rata share in the financial claim;
    (3) Purchased subordinated interests that absorb more than their pro 
rata share of losses from the underlying assets;
    (4) Credit derivative contracts under which the institution assumes 
more than its pro rata share of credit risk on a third-party asset or 
exposure;

financial obligations of a third party;
    (6) Purchased loan-servicing assets if the servicer is responsible 
for credit losses or if the servicer makes or assumes credit-enhancing 
representations and warranties with respect to the loans serviced. 
Servicer cash advances as defined in this section are not direct credit 
substitutes; and,
    (7) Clean-up calls on third-party assets. However, clean-up calls 
that are 10 percent or less of the original pool balance and that are 
exercisable at the option of the institution are not direct credit 
substitutes.
    Direct lender institution means an institution that extends credit 
in the form of loans or leases to eligible borrowers in its own right 
and carries such loan or lease assets on its books.
    Externally rated means that an instrument or obligation has received

debt, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that 
conveys a right to receive from or exchange cash or another financial 
instrument with another party.
    Financial standby letter of credit means a letter of credit or 
similar arrangement that represents an irrevocable obligation to a 
third-party beneficiary:
    (1) To repay money borrowed by, or advanced to, or for the account 
of, a second party (the account party); or
    (2) To make payment on behalf of the account party, in the event 
that the account party fails to fulfill its obligation to the 
beneficiary.

States Government whose obligations are fully and explicitly guaranteed 
as to the timely repayment of principal and interest by the full faith 
and credit of the United States Government.
    Government-sponsored agency means an agency, instrumentality, or 
corporation chartered or established to serve public purposes specified 
by the United States Congress but whose obligations are not explicitly 
guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, 
including but not limited to any Government-sponsored enterprise.

    Permanent capital, subject to adjustments as described in Sec. 
615.5207, includes:
    (1) Current year retained earnings;
    (2) Allocated and unallocated earnings (which, in the case of

such instrument, entry, or account as permanent capital, permanently or 
on a temporary basis, for purposes of this part.
    Qualified residential loan--
    (1) The term qualified residential loan means:
    (i) A rural home loan, as authorized by Sec. 613.3030, and
    (ii) A single-family residential loan to a bona fide farmer, 
rancher, or producer or harvester of aquatic products.
    (2) A qualified residential loan must be secured by a separate first 
lien mortgage or deed of trust on the residential property alone (not on 
any adjoining agricultural property or any other nonresidential 
property), must have been approved in accordance with prudent 
underwriting standards suitable for residential property, must not be 
past due 90 days or more or carried in nonaccrual status, and must have

[[Page 167]]

lien and the secured residential property must have a permanent right-
of-way access.
    Qualifying bilateral netting contract means a bilateral netting 
contract that meets at least the following conditions:
    (1) The contract is in writing;
    (2) The contract is not subject to a walkaway clause, defined as a 
provision that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower 
payments than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment 
at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter, even if the 
defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the 
contract;
    (3) The contract creates a single obligation either to pay or 
receive the net amount of the sum of positive and negative mark-to-
market values for all derivative contracts subject to the qualifying 
bilateral netting contract;
    (4) The institution receives a legal opinion that represents, to a

    (5) The institution establishes a procedure to monitor relevant law 
and to ensure that the contracts continue to satisfy the requirements of

    Qualifying securities firm means:
    (1) A securities firm incorporated in the United States that is a 
broker-dealer that is registered with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) and that complies with the SEC's net capital 
regulations (17 CFR 240.15c3-1); and
    (2) A securities firm incorporated in any other OECD-based country, 
if the institution is able to demonstrate that the securities firm is 
subject to supervision and regulation (covering its direct and indirect 
subsidiaries, but not necessarily its parent organizations) comparable 
to that imposed on depository institutions in OECD countries. Such 
regulation must include risk-based capital requirements comparable to 
those imposed on depository institutions under the Accord on 
International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards 
(1988, as amended in 1998) (Basel Accord).
    Recourse means an institution's retention, in form or in substance, 
of any credit risk directly or indirectly associated with an asset it 
has sold (in accordance with GAAP) that exceeds a pro rata share of the 
institution's claim on the asset. If an institution has no claim on an 
asset it has sold, then the retention of any credit risk is recourse. A 
recourse obligation typically arises when an institution transfers 
assets in a sale and retains an explicit obligation to repurchase assets 
or to absorb losses due to a default on the payment of principal or 
interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying 
obligor or some other party. Recourse may also exist implicitly if an 
institution provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual 
obligation to support assets it has sold. Recourse obligations include, 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties made on 
transferred assets;
    (2) Loan-servicing assets retained pursuant to an agreement under 
which the institution will be responsible for losses associated with the 
loans serviced. Servicer cash advances as defined in this section are 
not recourse obligations;
    (3) Retained subordinated interests that absorb more than their pro 
rata share of losses from the underlying assets;
    (4) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase, if the assets are 
not already included on the balance sheet;
    (5) Loan strips sold without contractual recourse where the maturity 
of the transferred portion of the loan is shorter than the maturity of 
the commitment under which the loan is drawn;
    (6) Credit derivatives issued that absorb more than the 
institution's pro rata share of losses from the transferred assets; and
    (7) Clean-up call on assets the institution has sold. However, 
clean-up calls that are 10 percent or less of the

[[Page 168]]

original pool balance and that are exercisable at the option of the 
institution are not recourse arrangements.
    Residual interest--
    (1) The term residual interest means any on-balance sheet asset 
that:
    (i) Represents an interest (including a beneficial interest) created 
by a transfer that qualifies as a sale (in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles) of financial assets, whether through a 
securitization or otherwise; and
    (ii) Exposes an institution to credit risk directly or indirectly 
associated with the transferred asset that exceeds a pro rata share of 
the institution's claim on the asset, whether through subordination 
provisions or other credit enhancement techniques.
    (2) Residual interests generally include credit-enhancing interest-
only strips, spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, retained 
subordinated interests (and other forms of overcollateralization), and 
similar assets that function as a credit enhancement.
    (3) Residual interests further include those exposures that, in 
substance, cause the institution to retain the credit risk of an asset 
or exposure that had qualified as a residual interest before it was 
sold.
    (4) Residual interests generally do not include interests purchased 
from a third party. However, purchased credit-enhancing interest-only 
strips are residual interests.
    Risk-adjusted asset base means the total dollar amount of the 
institution's assets adjusted in accordance with Sec. 615.5207 and 
weighted on the basis of risk in accordance with Sec. Sec. 615.5211 and 
615.5212.
    Risk participation means a participation in which the originating 
party remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount of an 
obligation (e.g., a direct credit substitute) notwithstanding that 
another party has acquired a participation in that obligation.
    Rural Business Investment Company has the definition given in 7 
U.S.C. 2009cc(14).
    Securitization means the pooling and repackaging by a special 
purpose entity or trust of assets or other credit exposures that can be 
sold to investors. Securitization includes transactions that create 
stratified credit risk positions whose performance is dependent upon an 
underlying pool of credit exposures, including loans and commitments.
    Servicer cash advance means funds that a mortgage servicer advances 
to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments, including advances made to 
cover foreclosure costs or other expenses to facilitate the timely 
collection of the loan. A servicer cash advance is not a recourse 
obligation or a direct credit substitute if:
    (1) The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is 
not subordinated to other claims on the cash flows from the underlying 
asset pool; or
    (2) For any one loan, the servicer's obligation to make 
nonreimbursable advances is contractually limited to an insignificant 
amount of the outstanding principal amount on that loan.
    Stock means stock and participation certificates.
    Term preferred stock means preferred stock with an original maturity 
of at least 5 years and on which, if cumulative, the board of directors 
has the option to defer dividends, provided that, at the beginning of 
each of the last 5 years of the term of the stock, the amount that is 
eligible to be counted as permanent capital is reduced by 20 percent of 
the original amount of the stock (net of redemptions).
    Total capital means assets minus liabilities, valued in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, except that liabilities 
do not include obligations to retire stock protected under section 4.9A 
of the Act.
    Traded position means a position retained, assumed, or issued that 
is externally rated, where there is a reasonable expectation that, in 
the near future, the rating will be relied upon by:
    (1) Unaffiliated investors to purchase the position; or
    (2) An unaffiliated third party to enter into a transaction 
involving the position, such as a purchase, loan, or repurchase 
agreement.

[[Page 169]]

    U.S. depository institution means branches (foreign and domestic) of 
federally insured banks and depository institutions chartered and 
headquartered in the 50 states of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and United States territories and possessions. 
The definition encompasses banks, mutual or stock savings banks, savings 
or building and loan associations, cooperative banks, credit unions, 
international banking facilities of domestic depository institutions, 
and U.S.-chartered depository institutions owned by foreigners. The 
definition excludes branches and agencies of foreign banks located in 
the U.S. and bank holding companies.

Sec. 615.5205  Minimum permanent capital standards.

    Each institution shall at all times maintain permanent capital at a 
level of at least 7 percent of its risk-adjusted asset base.

<R05>
Sec. 615.5206  Permanent capital ratio computation.

    (a) The institution's permanent capital ratio is determined on the 
basis of the financial statements of the institution prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles except that the 
obligations of the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation 
issued to repay banks in connection with the capital preservation and 
loss-sharing agreements described in section 6.9(e)(1) of the Act shall 
not be considered obligations of any institution subject to this 
regulation prior to their maturity.
    (b) The institution's asset base and permanent capital are computed 
using average daily balances for the most recent 3 months.
    (c) The institution's permanent capital ratio is calculated by 
dividing the institution's permanent capital, adjusted in accordance 
with Sec. 615.5207 (the numerator), by the risk-adjusted asset base 
(the denominator) as determined in Sec. 615.5210, to derive a ratio 
expressed as a percentage.
    (d) Until September 27, 2002, payments of assessments to the Farm 
Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation, and any part of the 
obligation to pay future assessments to the Farm Credit System Financial 
Assistance Corporation that is recognized as an expense on the books of 
a bank or association, shall be included in the capital of such bank or 
association for the purpose of determining its compliance with 
regulatory capital requirements, to the extent allowed by section 
6.26(c)(5)(G) of the Act. If the bank directly or indirectly passes on 
all or part of the payments to its affiliated associations pursuant to 
section 6.26(c)(5)(D) of the Act, such amounts shall be included in the 
capital of the associations and shall not be included in the capital of 
the bank. After September 27, 2002, no payments of assessments or 
obligations to pay future assessments may be included in the capital of 
the bank or association.

Sec. 615.5207  Capital adjustments and associated reductions to assets.

    For the purpose of computing the institution's permanent capital 
ratio, the following adjustments must be made prior to assigning assets 
to risk-weight categories and computing the ratio:
    (a) Where two Farm Credit System institutions have stock investments 
in each other, such reciprocal holdings must be eliminated to the extent 
of the offset. If the investments are equal in amount, each institution 
must deduct from its assets and its total capital an amount equal to the 
investment. If the investments are not equal in amount, each institution 
must deduct from its total capital and its assets an amount equal to the 
smaller investment. The elimination of reciprocal holdings required by 
this paragraph must be made prior to making the other adjustments 
required by this section.
    (b) Where a Farm Credit Bank or an agricultural credit bank is owned 
by one or more Farm Credit System institutions, the double counting of 
capital is eliminated in the following manner:
    (1) All equities of a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank 
that have been purchased by other Farm Credit institutions are 
considered to be

[[Page 170]]

permanent capital of the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank.
    (2) Each Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank and each of 
its affiliated associations may enter into an agreement that specifies, 
for the purpose of computing permanent capital only, a dollar amount 
and/or percentage allotment of the association's allocated investment 
between the bank and the association. Section 615.5208 provides 
conditions for allotment agreements or defines allotments in the absence 
of such agreements.
    (c) A Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank and a recipient, 
other than an association, of allocated earnings from such bank may 
enter into an agreement specifying a dollar amount and/or percentage 
allotment of the recipient's allocated earnings in the bank between the 
bank and the recipient. Such agreement must comply with the provisions 
of paragraph (b) of this section, except that, in the absence of an 
agreement, the allocated investment must be allotted 100 percent to the 
allocating bank and 0 percent to the recipient. All equities of the bank 
that are purchased by a recipient are considered as permanent capital of 
the issuing bank.
    (d) A bank for cooperatives and a recipient of allocated earnings 
from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying a dollar amount 
and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's allocated earnings in the 
bank between the bank and the recipient. Such agreement must comply with 
the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, except that, in the 
absence of an agreement, the allocated investment must be allotted 100 
percent to the allocating bank and 0 percent to the recipient. All 
equities of a bank that are purchased by a recipient shall be considered 
as permanent capital of the issuing bank.
    (e) Where a bank or association invests in an association to 
capitalize a loan participation interest, the investing institution must 
deduct from its total capital an amount equal to its investment in the 
participating institution.
    (f) The double counting of capital by a service corporation 
chartered under section 4.25 of the Act and its stockholder institutions 
must be eliminated by deducting an amount equal to the institution's 
investment in the service corporation from its total capital.
    (g) Each institution must deduct from its total capital an amount 
equal to all goodwill, whenever acquired.
    (h) To the extent an institution has deducted its investment in 
another Farm Credit institution from its total capital, the investment 
may be eliminated from its asset base.
    (i) Where a Farm Credit Bank and an association have an enforceable 
written agreement to share losses on specifically identified assets on a 
predetermined quantifiable basis, such assets must be counted in each 
institution's risk-adjusted asset base in the same proportion as the 
institutions have agreed to share the loss.
    (j) The permanent capital of an institution must exclude the net 
effect of all transactions covered by the definition of ``accumulated 
other comprehensive income'' contained in the Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 130, as promulgated by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board.
    (k) For purposes of calculating capital ratios under this part, 
deferred-tax assets are subject to the conditions, limitations, and 
restrictions described in Sec. 615.5209.
    (l) Capital may also need to be reduced for potential loss exposure 
on any recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual 
interests, and credit-enhancing interest-only-strips in accordance with 
Sec. 615.5210.

[70 FR 35351, June 17, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 615.5208  Allotment of allocated investments.

    (a) The following conditions apply to agreements that a Farm Credit 
Bank or agricultural credit bank enters into with an affiliated 
association pursuant to Sec. 615.5207(b)(2):
    (1) The agreement must be for a term of 1 year or longer.
    (2) The agreement must be entered into on or before its effective 
date.
    (3) The agreement may be amended according to its terms, but no more 
frequently than annually except in the event that a party to the 
agreement is merged or reorganized.
    (4) On or before the effective date of the agreement, a certified 
copy of the

[[Page 171]]

agreement, and any amendments thereto, must be sent to the field office 
of the Farm Credit Administration responsible for examining the 
institution. A copy must also be sent within 30 calendar days of 
adoption to the bank's other affiliated associations.
    (5) Unless the parties otherwise agree, if the bank and the 
association have not entered into a new agreement on or before the 
expiration of an existing agreement, the existing agreement will 
automatically be extended for another 12 months, unless either party 
notifies the Farm Credit Administration in writing of its objection to 
the extension prior to the expiration of the existing agreement.
    (b) In the absence of an agreement between a Farm Credit Bank or an 
agricultural credit bank and one or more associations, or in the event 
that an agreement expires and at least one party has timely objected to 
the continuation of the terms of its agreement, the following formula 
applies with respect to the allocated investments held by those 
associations with which there is no agreement (nonagreeing 
associations), and does not apply to the allocated investments held by 
those associations with which the bank has an agreement (agreeing 
associations):
    (1) The allotment formula must be calculated annually.
    (2) The permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or 
agricultural credit bank must be computed as of the date that the 
existing agreement terminates, using a 3-month average daily balance, 
excluding the allocated investment from nonagreeing associations but 
including any allocated investments of agreeing associations that are 
allotted to the bank under applicable allocation agreements. The 
permanent capital ratio of each nonagreeing association must be computed 
as of the same date using a 3-month average daily balance, and must be 
computed excluding its allocated investment in the bank.
    (3) If the permanent capital ratio for the Farm Credit Bank or 
agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with Sec. 
615.5208(b)(2) is 7 percent or above, the allocated investment of each 
nonagreeing association whose permanent capital ratio calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 615.5208(b)(2) is 7 percent or above must be 
allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the association.
    (4) If the permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or 
agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with Sec. 
615.5208(b)(2) is 7 percent or above, the allocated investment of each 
nonagreeing association whose capital ratio is below 7 percent must be 
allotted to the association until the association's capital ratio 
reaches 7 percent or until all of the investment is allotted to the 
association, whichever occurs first. Any remaining unallotted allocated 
investment must be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the 
association.
    (5) If the permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or 
agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with Sec. 
615.5208(b)(2) is less than 7 percent, the amount of additional capital 
needed by the bank to reach a permanent capital ratio of 7 percent must 
be determined, and an amount of the allocated investment of each 
nonagreeing association must be allotted to the Farm Credit Bank or 
agricultural credit bank, as follows:
    (i) If the total of the allocated investments of all nonagreeing 
associations is greater than the additional capital needed by the bank, 
the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association must be 
multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the amount of capital needed 
by the bank and whose denominator is the total amount of allocated 
investments of the nonagreeing associations, and such amount must be 
allotted to the bank. Next, if the permanent capital ratio of any 
nonagreeing association is less than 7 percent, a sufficient amount of 
unallotted allocated investment must then be allotted to each 
nonagreeing association, as necessary, to increase its permanent capital 
ratio to 7 percent, or until all such remaining investment is allotted 
to the association, whichever occurs first. Any unallotted allocated 
investment still remaining must be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 
50 percent to the nonagreeing association.
    (ii) If the additional capital needed by the bank is greater than 
the total of

[[Page 172]]

the allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations, all of the 
remaining allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations must be 
allotted to the bank.
    (c) If a payment or part of a payment to the Farm Credit System 
Financial Assistance Corporation pursuant to section 6.9(e)(3)(D)(ii) of 
the Act would cause a bank to fall below its minimum permanent capital 
requirement, the bank and one or more associations shall amend their 
allocation agreements to increase the allotment of the allocated 
investment to the bank sufficiently to enable the bank to make the 
payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation, 
provided that the associations would continue to meet their minimum 
permanent capital requirement. In the case of a nonagreeing association, 
the Farm Credit Administration may require a revision of the allotment 
sufficient to enable the bank to make the payment to the Farm Credit 
System Financial Assistance Corporation, provided that the association 
would continue to meet its minimum permanent capital requirement. The 
Farm Credit Administration may, at the request of one or more of the 
institutions affected, waive the requirements of this paragraph if the 
FCA deems it is in the overall best interest of the institutions 
affected.

Sec. 615.5209  Deferred-tax assets.

    For purposes of calculating capital ratios under this part, 
deferred-tax assets are subject to the conditions, limitations, and 
restrictions described in this section.
    (a) Each institution must deduct an amount of deferred-tax assets, 
net of any valuation allowance, from its assets and its total capital 
that is equal to the greater of:
    (1) The amount of deferred-tax assets that is dependent on future 
income or future events in excess of the amount that is reasonably 
expected to be realized within 1 year of the most recent calendar 
quarter-end date, based on financial projections for that year, or
    (2) The amount of deferred-tax assets that is dependent on future 
income or future events in excess of 10 percent of the amount of core 
surplus that exists before the deduction of any deferred-tax assets.
    (b) For purposes of this calculation:
    (1) The amount of deferred-tax assets that can be realized from 
taxes paid in prior carryback years and from the reversal of existing 
taxable temporary differences may not be deducted from assets and from 
equity capital.
    (2) All existing temporary differences should be assumed to fully 
reverse at the calculation date.
    (3) Projected future taxable income should not include net operating 
loss carryforwards to be used within 1 year or the amount of existing 
temporary differences expected to reverse within that year.
    (4) Financial projections must include the estimated effect of tax-
planning strategies that are expected to be implemented to minimize tax 
liabilities and realize tax benefits. Financial projections for the 
current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes that have 
occurred or are expected to occur) may be used when applying the capital 
limit at an interim date within the fiscal year.
    (5) The deferred tax effects of any unrealized holding gains and 
losses on available-for-sale debt securities may be excluded from the 
determination of the amount of deferred-tax assets that are dependent 
upon future taxable income and the calculation of the maximum allowable 
amount of such assets. If these deferred-tax effects are excluded, this 
treatment must be followed consistently over time.

Sec. 615.5210  Risk-adjusted assets.

    (a) Computation. Each asset on the institution's balance sheet and 
each off-balance-sheet item, adjusted by the appropriate credit 
conversion factor in Sec. 615.5212, is assigned to one of the risk 
categories specified in Sec. 615.5211. The aggregate dollar value of 
the assets in each category is multiplied by the percentage weight 
assigned to that category. The sum of the weighted dollar values from 
each of the risk categories comprises ``risk-adjusted assets,'' the 
denominator for computation of the permanent capital ratio.

[[Page 173]]

    (b) Ratings-based approach. (1) Under the ratings-based approach, a 
rated position in a securitization (provided it satisfies the criteria 
specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) is assigned to the 
appropriate risk-weight category based on its external rating.
    (2) Provided they satisfy the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section, the following positions qualify for the ratings-based 
approach:
    (i) Recourse obligations;
    (ii) Direct credit substitutes;
    (iii) Residual interests (other than credit-enhancing interest-only 
strips); and
    (iv) Asset-or mortgage-backed securities.
    (3) A position specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
qualifies for a ratings-based approach provided it satisfies the 
following criteria:
    (i) If the position is traded and externally rated, its long-term 
external rating must be one grade below investment grade or better 
(e.g., BB or better) or its short-term external rating must be 
investment grade or better (e.g., A-3, P-3). If the position receives 
more than one external rating, the lowest rating applies.
    (ii) If the position is not traded and is externally rated,
    (A) It must be externally rated by more than one NRSRO;
    (B) Its long-term external rating must be one grade below investment 
grade or better (e.g., BB or better) or its short-term external rating 
must be investment grade or better (e.g., A-3, P-3 or better). If the 
ratings are different, the lowest rating applies;
    (C) The ratings must be publicly available; and
    (D) The ratings must be based on the same criteria used to rate 
traded positions.
    (c) Positions in securitizations that do not qualify for a ratings-
based approach. The following positions in securitizations do not 
qualify for a ratings-based approach. They are treated as indicated.
    (1) For any residual interest that is not externally rated, the 
institution must deduct from capital and assets the face amount of the 
position (dollar-for-dollar reduction).
    (2) For any credit-enhancing interest-only strip, the institution 
must deduct from capital and assets the face amount of the position 
(dollar-for-dollar reduction).
    (3) For any position that has a long-term external rating that is 
two grades below investment grade or lower (e.g., B or lower) or a 
short-term external rating that is one grade below investment grade or 
lower (e.g., B or lower, Not Prime), the institution must deduct from 
capital and assets the face amount of the position (dollar-for-dollar 
reduction).
    (4) Any recourse obligation or direct credit substitute (e.g., a 
purchased subordinated security) that is not externally rated is risk 
weighted using the amount of the recourse obligation or direct credit 
substitute and the full amount of the assets it supports, i.e., all the 
more senior positions in the structure. This treatment is subject to the 
low-level exposure rule set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This 
amount is then placed into a risk-weight category according to the 
obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.
    (5) Any stripped mortgage-backed security or similar instrument, 
such as an interest-only strip that is not credit-enhancing or a 
principal-only strip (including such instruments guaranteed by 
Government-sponsored agencies), is assigned to the 100-percent risk-
weight category described in Sec. 615.5211(d)(7).
    (d) Senior positions not externally rated. For a position in a 
securitization that is not externally rated but is senior in all 
features to a traded position (including collateralization and 
maturity), an institution may apply a risk weight to the face amount of 
the senior position based on the traded position's external rating. This 
section will apply only if the traded position provides substantial 
credit support for the entire life of the unrated position.
    (e) Low-level exposure rule. If the maximum contractual exposure to 
loss retained or assumed by an institution in connection with a recourse 
obligation or a direct credit substitute is less than the effective 
risk-based capital requirement for the credit-enhanced assets, the risk-
based capital required

[[Page 174]]

under paragraph (c)(4) of this section is limited to the institution's 
maximum contractual exposure, less any recourse liability account 
established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
This limitation does not apply when an institution provides credit 
enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has 
sold.
    (f) Reservation of authority. The FCA may, on a case-by-case basis, 
determine the appropriate risk weight for any asset or credit equivalent 
amount that does not fit wholly within one of the risk categories set 
forth in Sec. 615.5211 or that imposes risks that are not commensurate 
with the risk weight otherwise specified in Sec. 615.5211 for the asset 
or credit equivalent. In addition, the FCA may, on a case-by-case basis, 
determine the appropriate credit conversion factor for any off-balance 
sheet item that does not fit wholly within one of the credit conversion 
factors set forth in Sec. 615.5212 or that imposes risks that are not 
commensurate with the credit conversion factor otherwise specified in 
Sec. 615.5212 for the item. In making this determination, the FCA will 
consider the similarity of the asset or off-balance sheet item to assets 
or off-balance sheet items explicitly treated in Sec. Sec. 615.5211 or 
615.5212, as well as other relevant factors.

<R05>
Sec. 615.5212  Credit conversion factors--off-balance sheet items.

    (a) The face amount of an off-balance sheet item is generally 
incorporated into risk-weighted assets in two steps. For most off-
balance sheet items, the face amount is first multiplied by a credit 
conversion factor. (In the case of direct credit substitutes and 
recourse obligations the full amount of the assets enhanced are 
multiplied by a credit conversion factor). The resultant credit 
equivalent amount is assigned to the appropriate risk-weight category 
described in Sec. 615.5211 according to the obligor or, if relevant, 
the guarantor or the collateral.
    (b) Conversion factors for various types of off-balance sheet items 
are as follows:
    (1) 0 Percent. (i) Unused commitments with an original maturity of 
14 months or less;
    (ii) Unused commitments with an original maturity greater than 14 
months if:
    (A) They are unconditionally cancellable by the institution; and
    (B) The institution has the contractual right to, and in fact does, 
make a separate credit decision based upon the borrower's current 
financial condition before each drawing under the lending arrangement.
    (2) 20 Percent. Short-term, self-liquidating, trade-related 
contingencies, including but not limited to commercial letters of 
credit.

[[Page 177]]

    (3) 50 Percent. (i) Transaction-related contingencies (e.g., bid 
bonds, performance bonds, warranties, and performance-based standby 
letters of credit related to a particular transaction).
    (ii) Unused loan commitments with an original maturity greater than 
14 months, including underwriting commitments and commercial credit 
lines.
    (iii) Revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs), note issuance 
facilities (NIFs) and other similar arrangements pursuant to which the 
institution's customer can issue short-term debt obligations in its own 
name, but for which the institution has a legally binding commitment to 
either:
    (A) Purchase the obligations its customer is unable to sell by a 
stated date; or
    (B) Advance funds to its customer if the obligations cannot be sold.
    (4) 100 Percent. (i) The full amount of the assets supported by 
direct credit substitutes and recourse obligations for which an 
institution directly or indirectly retains or assumes credit risk. For 
risk participations in such arrangements acquired by the institution, 
the full amount of assets supported by the main obligation multiplied by 
the acquiring institution's percentage share of the risk participation. 
The capital requirement under this paragraph is limited to the 
institution's maximum contractual exposure, less any recourse liability 
account established under generally accepted accounting principles.
    (ii) Acquisitions of risk participations in bankers acceptances.
    (iii) Sale and repurchase agreements, if not already included on the 
balance sheet.
    (iv) Forward agreements (i.e., contractual obligations) to purchase 
assets, including financing facilities with certain drawdown.
    (c) Credit equivalents of interest rate contracts and foreign 
exchange contracts. (1) Credit equivalents of interest rate contracts 
and foreign exchange contracts (except single-currency floating/floating 
interest rate swaps) are determined by adding the replacement cost 
(mark-to-market value, if positive) to the potential future credit 
exposure, determined by multiplying the notional principal amount by the 
following credit conversion factors as appropriate.

                        Conversion Factor Matrix
                              (In percent)

Over 1 to 5 years...................         0.5         5.0        12.0
Over 5 years........................         1.5         7.5        15.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) For any derivative contract that does not fall within one of the 
categories in the above table, the potential future credit exposure is 
to be calculated using the commodity conversion factors. The net current 
exposure for multiple derivative contracts with a single counterparty 
and subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is the net sum of 
all positive and negative mark-to-market values for each derivative 
contract. The positive sum of the net current exposure is added to the 
adjusted potential future credit exposure for the same multiple 
contracts with a single counterparty. The adjusted potential future 
credit exposure is computed as A<INF>net</INF> = (0.4 x 
A<INF>gross</INF>) + 0.6 (NGR x A<INF>gross</INF>) where:
    (i) A<INF>net</INF> is the adjusted potential future credit 
exposure;
    (ii) A<INF>gross</INF> is the sum of potential future credit 
exposures determined by multiplying the notional principal amount by the 
appropriate credit conversion factor; and
    (iii) NGR is the ratio of the net current credit exposure divided by 
the gross current credit exposure determined as the sum of only the 
positive mark-to-markets for each derivative contract with the single 
counterparty.
    (3) Credit equivalents of single-currency floating/floating interest 
rate swaps are determined by their replacement cost (mark-to-market).

Sec. 615.5230  Implementation of cooperative principles.

    (a) Voting shareholders of Farm Credit banks and associations shall 
be accorded full voting rights in accordance with cooperative 
principles.
    (1) Each voting shareholder of an association or bank for 
cooperatives must:
    (i) Have only one vote, regardless of the number of shares owned or 
the number of loans outstanding, except as otherwise required by statute 
or regulation and except as modified by paragraph (b) of this section;
    (ii) Unless regional election of directors is provided for in the 
bylaws pursuant to Sec. 615.5230(a)(3), be accorded the right to vote 
in the election of each director (except for a director that is elected 
by the other directors);
    (iii) Unless regional election of directors is provided for in the 
bylaws, or unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, be allowed to 
cumulate such votes and distribute them among the candidates in the 
shareholder's discretion.
    (2) Each voting shareholder of a Farm Credit Bank must:
    (i) Have one vote that is assigned a weight proportional to the 
number of the association's voting shareholders in a manner that does 
not discriminate against agricultural credit associations that have 
resulted from the merger or consolidation of Federal land bank 
associations and production credit associations; and
    (ii) Have the right to vote in the election of each director and be 
allowed to cumulate such votes and distribute them among the candidates 
in the shareholder's discretion, except that cumulative voting for 
directors may be eliminated if 75 percent of the associations that are 
shareholders of the Farm Credit Bank vote in favor of elimination. In a 
vote to eliminate cumulative voting, each association shall be accorded 
one vote.
    (3) The regional election of stockholder-elected directors is 
permitted under the following conditions:
    (i) A bylaw establishing regional elections is approved by a 
majority of voting shareholders, voting in person or by proxy, prior to 
implementation;
    (ii) The bylaw provides that all voting shareholders of the 
institution, whether or not they reside in the director's region, have 
the right to vote in any shareholder vote to remove each director;
    (iii) There are an approximately equal number of voting shareholders 
in each of the institution's voting regions. The regions shall be deemed 
to have an approximately equal number of voting shareholders if no 
region contains more than 25 percent more voting shareholders than in 
any other region. At least once every 3 years, the institution shall 
count the number of voting shareholders in each region and, if the 
regions do not have an approximately equal number of shareholders, shall 
adjust the regional boundaries to achieve such result; and
    (iv) An institution may provide for more than one director to 
represent a region. In such case, for purposes of determining whether 
the regions have an approximately equal number of voting shareholders, 
the number of voting shareholders in the region with more than one 
director shall be divided by the number of director positions 
representing that region, and the resulting quotient shall be the number 
that is compared to the number of voting shareholders in other regions.
    (b) Each equityholder of each institution shall be equitably treated 
in the operation of the institution.
    (1) Each issuance of preferred stock (other than preferred stock 
outstanding on October 5, 1988, and stock into which such outstanding 
stock is converted that has substantially similar preferences) shall be 
approved by a majority of the shares of each class of equities adversely 
affected by the preference, voting as a class, whether or not such 
classes are otherwise authorized to vote;
    (2) Any dividends paid to the holders of common stock and 
participation certificates shall be on a per share basis and without 
preference as to rate or

[[Page 180]]

priority of payment between classes of common stock, between classes of 
participation certificates, between classes of common stock and classes 
of participation certificates, or between holders of the same class of 
stock or participation certificates, except that any class of common 
stock or participation certificates that result from the conversion of 
allocated surplus may be subordinated to other classes of common stock 
and participation certificates in the payment of dividends.
    (3) Any patronage refunds that are paid shall be paid in accordance 
with cooperative principles, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis 
determined by the board of directors in accordance with the 
capitalization bylaws, provided that any earning pools that may be 
established for the payment of patronage shall be established on a 
rational and equitable basis that will ensure that each patron of the 
institution receives its fair share of the earnings of the institution 
and bears its fair share of the expenses of the institution.
    (4) All classes of common stock and participation certificates 
(except those resulting from a conversion of allocated surplus) must be 
accorded the same priority with respect to impairment and restoration of 
impairment and have the same rights and priority upon liquidation.
    (5) Each bank must endeavor to assure that there is a choice of at 
least two nominees for each elective office to be filled and that the 
board represents as nearly as possible all types of agriculture in the 
district. If fewer than two nominees for each position are named, the 
efforts to locate two willing nominees must be documented in the records 
of the bank and provided as part of the Annual Meeting Information 
Statement of part 620, subpart E of this chapter. The bank must also 
maintain a list of the type or types of agriculture engaged in by each 
director on its board.

this part and the total capital requirements established by the board of 
directors of the institution.
    (b) In order to qualify as permanent capital, equities issued under

disclosure statement is reviewed and cleared by FCA.
    (c) A disclosure statement must include:
    (1) All of the information required by part 620 of this chapter in

capital for the purpose of meeting the minimum permanent capital 
standards established under subpart H unless FCA notifies the

connection with the sale of equities, make any disclosure, through a 
disclosure statement or otherwise, that is inaccurate or misleading, or 
omit to make any statement needed to prevent other disclosures from 
being misleading.

associations only, an amount equal to the net investment in the bank;
    (ii) Nonqualified allocated equities (including stock) that are not 
distributed according to an established plan or practice, provided that, 
in the event that a nonqualified patronage allocation is distributed, 
other than as required by section 4.14B of the Act, or in connection 
with a loan default or the death of an equityholder whose loan has been 
repaid (to the extent provided for in the institution's capital adequacy 
plan), any remaining nonqualified allocations that were allocated in the 
same year will be excluded from core surplus.
    (iii) Perpetual common or noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 
(other than allocated stock) that is not retired according to an 
established plan or practice, provided that, in the event that stock 
held by a borrower is retired, other than as required by section 4.14B 
of the Act or in connection with a loan default to the extent provided 
for in the institution's capital plan, the remaining perpetual stock of 
the same class or series shall be excluded from core surplus;
    (iv) A capital instrument or a particular balance sheet entry or 
account that the Farm Credit Administration has determined to be the 
functional equivalent of a component of core surplus. The Farm Credit 
Administration may permit an institution to include all or a portion of 
such instrument, entry, or account as core surplus, permanently or on a 
temporary basis, for purposes of this subpart.
    (2) For associations only, other allocated equities may also be 
included in the core surplus ratio to the extent permitted by Sec. 
615.5330(b) if the following conditions are met:
    (i) The allocated equities are includible in total surplus; and
    (ii) The allocated equities, if subject to a plan or practice of 
revolvement or retirement, are not scheduled or intended to be revolved

remaining such allocated equities that were allocated in the same year 
will be excluded from core surplus.

computation of its permanent capital pursuant to Sec. 615.5207(f), (g), 
(i), and (k) shall also be made in the computation of its core surplus.

particular component, balance sheet entry, or account has 
characteristics or terms that diminish its contribution to an 
institution's ability to absorb losses, require the deduction of all or 
a portion of such component, entry, or account from total surplus.

minimum applicable surplus ratios and net collateral ratio established 
in Sec. Sec. 615.5330 and 615.5335 at or after the end of the quarter 
in which these regulations become effective and subsequently falls below 
one or more minimum requirements shall be in violation of the applicable

<R05>
Sec. 615.5350  General--Applicability.

    (a) The rules and procedures specified in this subpart are 
applicable to a proceeding to establish required minimum capital ratios 
that would otherwise be applicable to an institution under Sec. Sec. 
615.5205, 615.5330, and 615.5335. The Farm Credit Administration is 
authorized to establish such minimum capital requirements for an 
institution as the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, deems 
to be necessary or appropriate in light of the particular circumstances 
of the institution. Proceedings under this subpart also may be initiated 
to require an institution having capital ratios greater than those set 
forth in Sec. Sec. 615.5205, 615.5330, or 615.5335 to continue to 
maintain those higher ratios.
    (b) The Farm Credit Administration may require higher minimum 
capital ratios for an individual institution in view of its 
circumstances. For example, higher capital ratios may be appropriate 
for:
    (1) An institution receiving special supervisory attention;
    (2) An institution that has, or is expected to have, losses 
resulting in capital inadequacy;
    (3) An institution with significant exposure due to operational 
risk, interest rate risk, the risks from concentrations of credit, 
certain risks arising from other products, services, or related 
activities, or management's overall inability to monitor and control 
financial risks presented by concentrations of credit and related 
services activities;
    (4) An institution exposed to a high volume of, or particularly 
severe, problem loans;
    (5) An institution that is growing rapidly; or
    (6) An institution that may be adversely affected by the activities 
or condition of System institutions with which it has significant 
business relationships or in which it has significant investments.
    (7) An institution with significant exposures to declines in net 
income or in the market value of its capital due to a change in interest 
rates and/or the exercising of embedded or explicit options.

<R05>
Sec. 615.5351  Standards for determination of appropriate individual institution minimum capital ratios.

    The appropriate minimum capital ratios for an individual institution 
cannot be determined solely through the application of a rigid 
mathematical formula or wholly objective criteria. The decision is 
necessarily based in part on subjective judgment grounded in Agency 
expertise. The factors to be considered in the determination will vary 
in each case and may include, for example:
    (a) The conditions or circumstances leading to the Farm Credit 
Administration's determination that higher minimum capital ratios are 
appropriate or necessary for the institution;
    (b) The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;

[[Page 189]]

    (c) The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects 
of the institution and, if applicable, affiliated institutions;
    (d) The institution's capital, adverse assets (including nonaccrual 
and nonperforming loans), allowance for loss, and other ratios compared 
to the ratios of its peers or industry norms; and
    (e) The views of the institution's directors and senior management.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5352  Procedures.

    (a) Notice. When the Farm Credit Administration determines that 
minimum capital ratios greater than those set forth in Sec. Sec. 
615.5205, 615.5330, or 615.5335 are necessary or appropriate for a 
particular institution, the Farm Credit Administration will notify the 
institution in writing of the proposed minimum capital ratios and the 
date by which they should be reached (if applicable) and will provide an 
explanation of why the ratios proposed are considered necessary or 
appropriate for the institution.
    (b) Response. (1) The institution may respond to any or all of the 
items in the notice. The response should include any matters which the 
institution would have the Farm Credit Administration consider in 
deciding whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established 
for the institution, what those capital ratios should be, and, if 
applicable, when they should be achieved. The response must be in 
writing and delivered to the designated Farm Credit Administration 
official within 30 days after the date on which the institution received 
the notice. In its discretion, the Farm Credit Administration may extend 
the time period for good cause. The Farm Credit Administration may 
shorten the time period with the consent of the institution or when, in 
the opinion of the Farm Credit Administration, the condition of the 
institution so requires, provided that the institution is informed 
promptly of the new time period.
    (2) Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as 
may be specified by the Farm Credit Administration shall constitute a 
waiver of any objections to the proposed minimum capital ratios or the 
deadline for their achievement.
    (c) Decision. After the close of the institution's response period, 
the Farm Credit Administration will decide, based on a review of the 
institution's response and other information concerning the institution, 
whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the 
institution and, if so, the ratios and the date the requirements will 
become effective. The institution will be notified of the decision in 
writing. The notice will include an explanation of the decision, except 
for a decision not to establish individual minimum capital requirements 
for the institution.
    (d) Submission of plan. The decision may require the institution to 
develop and submit to the Farm Credit Administration, within a time 
period specified, an acceptable plan to reach the minimum capital ratios 
established for the institution by the date required.
    (e) Reconsideration based on change in circumstances. If, after the 
Farm Credit Administration's decision in paragraph (c) of this section, 
there is a change in the circumstances affecting the institution's 
capital adequacy or its ability to reach the required minimum capital 
ratios by the specified date, either the institution or the Farm Credit 
Administration may propose a change in the minimum capital ratios for 
the institution, the date when the minimums must be achieved, or the 
institution's plan (if applicable). The Farm Credit Administration may 
decline to consider proposals that are not based on a significant change 
in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous. Pending a decision on 
reconsideration, the Farm Credit Administration's original decision and 
any plan required under that decision shall continue in full force and 
effect.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5353  Relation to other actions.

    In lieu of, or in addition to, the procedures in this subpart, the 
required minimum capital ratios for an institution may be established or 
revised through a written agreement or cease and desist proceedings 
under part C of title V of the Act, or as a condition for approval of an 
application.

<R05>
Sec. 615.5354  Enforcement.

    An institution that does not have or maintain the minimum capital 
ratios applicable to it, whether required in subparts H and K of this 
part, in a decision pursuant to this subpart, in a written agreement or 
temporary or final order under part C of title V of the Act, or in a 
condition for approval of an application, or an institution that has 
failed to submit or comply with an acceptable plan to attain those 
ratios, will be subject to such administrative action or sanctions as 
the Farm Credit Administration considers appropriate. These sanctions 
may include the issuance of a capital directive pursuant to subpart M of 
this part or other enforcement action, assessment of civil money 
penalties, and/or the denial or condition of applications.

<R05>
Sec. 615.5355  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to proceedings by the Farm Credit 
Administration to issue a capital directive under sections 4.3(b) and 
4.3A(e) of the Act. A capital directive is an order issued to an 
institution that does not have or maintain capital at or greater than 
the minimum ratios set forth in Sec. Sec. 615.5205, 615.5330, and 
615.5335; or established for the institution under subpart L, by a 
written agreement under part C of title V of the Act, or as a condition 
for approval of an application. A capital directive may order the 
institution to:
    (1) Achieve the minimum capital ratios applicable to it by a 
specified date;
    (2) Adhere to a previously submitted plan to achieve the applicable 
capital ratios;
    (3) Submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the Farm Credit 
Administration describing the means and time schedule by which the 
institution shall achieve the applicable capital ratios;
    (4) Take other action, such as reduction of assets or the rate of 
growth of assets, restrictions on the payment of dividends or patronage, 
or restrictions on the retirement of stock, to achieve the applicable 
capital ratios, or reduce levels of interest rate and other risk 
exposures, or strengthen management expertise, or improve management 
information and measurement systems; or
    (5) A combination of any of these or similar actions.
    (b) A capital directive may also be issued to the board of directors 
of an institution, requiring such board to comply with the requirements 
of section 4.3A(d) of the Act prohibiting the reduction of permanent 
capital.
    (c) A capital directive issued under this rule, including a plan 
submitted under a capital directive, is enforceable in the same manner 
and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease and desist 
order which has become final as defined in section 5.25 of the Act. 
Violation of a capital directive may result in assessment of civil money 
penalties in accordance with section 5.32 of the Act.

Sec. 615.5356  Notice of intent to issue a capital directive.

    The Farm Credit Administration will notify an institution in writing 
of its intention to issue a capital directive. The notice will state:
    (a) The reasons for issuance of the capital directive;
    (b) The proposed contents of the capital directive, including the 
proposed date for achieving the minimum capital requirement; and
    (c) Any other relevant information concerning the decision to issue 
a capital directive.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5357  Response to notice.

    (a) An institution may respond to the notice by stating why a 
capital directive should not be issued and/or by proposing alternative 
contents for the capital directive or seeking other appropriate relief. 
The response shall include any information, mitigating circumstances, 
documentation, or other relevant evidence that supports its position. 
The response may include a plan for achieving the minimum capital ratios 
applicable to the institution. The

[[Page 191]]

response must be in writing and delivered to the Farm Credit 
Administration within 30 days after the date on which the institution 
received the notice. In its discretion, the Farm Credit Administration 
may extend the time period for good cause. The Farm Credit 
Administration may shorten the 30-day time period:
    (1) When, in the opinion of the Farm Credit Administration, the 
condition of the institution so requires, provided that the institution 
shall be informed promptly of the new time period;
    (2) With the consent of the institution; or
    (3) When the institution already has advised the Farm Credit 
Administration that it cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum 
capital ratios.
    (b) Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as 
may be specified by the Farm Credit Administration shall constitute a 
waiver of any objections to the proposed capital directive.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5358  Decision.

    After the closing date of the institution's response period, or 
receipt of the institution's response, if earlier, the Farm Credit 
Administration may seek additional information or clarification of the 
response. Thereafter, the Farm Credit Administration will determine 
whether or not to issue a capital directive, and if one is to be issued, 
whether it should be as originally proposed or in modified form.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5359  Issuance of a capital directive.

    (a) A capital directive will be served by delivery to the 
institution. It will include or be accompanied by a statement of reasons 
for its issuance.
    (b) A capital directive is effective immediately upon its receipt by 
the institution, or upon such later date as may be specified therein, 
and shall remain effective and enforceable until it is stayed, modified, 
or terminated by the Farm Credit Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5360  Reconsideration based on change in circumstances.

    Upon a change in circumstances, an institution may request the Farm 
Credit Administration to reconsider the terms of its capital directive 
or may propose changes in the plan to achieve the institution's 
applicable minimum capital ratios. The Farm Credit Administration also 
may take such action on its own motion. The Farm Credit Administration 
may decline to consider requests or proposals that are not based on a 
significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous. 
Pending a decision on reconsideration, the capital directive and plan 
shall continue in full force and effect.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5361  Relation to other administrative actions.

    A capital directive may be issued in addition to, or in lieu of, any 
other action authorized by law, including cease and desist proceedings, 
civil money penalties, or the conditioning or denial of applications. 
The Farm Credit Administration also may, in its discretion, take any 
action authorized by law, in lieu of a capital directive, in response to 
an institution's failure to achieve or maintain the applicable minimum 
capital ratios.

    (i) A book-entry security or security entitlement, and
    (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Farm 
Credit securities; and
    (2) The rights of any person, including a participant, against the 
Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Federal Reserve 
Banks with respect to:
    (i) A book-entry security or security entitlement, and
    (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Farm 
Credit securities.
    (b) A security interest in a security entitlement that is in favor 
of a Federal Reserve Bank from a participant and that is not recorded on 
the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to Sec. 615.5454(c)(1) of 
this subpart, is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law 
rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve 
Bank maintaining the participant's securities account is located. A 
security interest in a security entitlement that is in favor of a 
Federal Reserve Bank from a person that is not a participant, and that 
is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to Sec. 
615.5454(c)(1)of this subpart, is governed by the law determined in the 
manner specified in Sec. 615.5453 of this subpart.
    (c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph 
(b) of this section is a State that has not adopted revised Article 8 
(see 31 CFR 357.2) then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section shall be the law of that State as though revised Article 8 had 
been adopted by that State.

<R05>
Sec. 615.5453  Law governing other interests.

    (a) To the extent not inconsistent with these regulations, the law 
(not including the conflict-of-law rules) of a securities intermediary's 
jurisdiction governs:
    (1) The acquisition of a security entitlement from the securities 
intermediary;
    (2) The rights and duties of the securities intermediary and 
entitlement holder arising out of a security entitlement;
    (3) Whether the securities intermediary owes any duties to an 
adverse claimant to a security entitlement;
    (4) Whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person who 
acquires a security entitlement from the securities intermediary or a 
person who purchases a security entitlement or interest therein from an 
entitlement holder; and
    (5) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a 
security interest in a security entitlement.

[[Page 194]]

    (b) The following rules determine a ``securities intermediary's 
jurisdiction'' for purposes of this section:
    (1) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its 
entitlement holder specifies that it is governed by the law of a 
particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities 
intermediary's jurisdiction.
    (2) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its 
entitlement holder does not specify the governing law as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but expressly specifies that the 
securities account is maintained at an office in a particular 
jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's 
jurisdiction.
    (3) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its 
entitlement holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the securities 
intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the 
office identified in an account statement as the office serving the 
entitlement holder's account.
    (4) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its 
entitlement holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and an account statement does 
not identify an office serving the entitlement holder's account as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the securities 
intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the 
chief executive office of the securities intermediary.
    (c) Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section, the law (but not the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction 
in which the person creating a security interest is located governs 
whether and how the security interest may be perfected automatically or 
by filing a financing statement.
    (d) If the jurisdiction specified in paragraph (b) of this section 
is a State that has not adopted revised Article 8 (see 31 CFR 357.2), 
then the law for the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be the law of that State as though revised Article 8 had been 
adopted by that State. For purposes of the application of the matters 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal Reserve Bank 
maintaining the securities account is a clearing corporation, and the 
participant's interest in a book-entry security is a security 
entitlement.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5454  Creation of participant's security entitlement; security interests.

    (a) A participant's security entitlement is created when a Federal 
Reserve Bank indicates by book entry that a book-entry security has been 
credited to a participant's securities account.
    (b) A security interest in a security entitlement of a participant 
in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, 
including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan 
accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that 
is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is 
marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and 
perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. 
Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a security 
entitlement of a participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve 
Bank, such Federal Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, 
exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United 
States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this 
paragraph, an ``authorized representative of the United States'' is the 
official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which 
a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.
    (c)(1) The Farm Credit Banks, the Funding Corporation, and the 
Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of 
any person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security 
interest or other limited interest in favor of any person except to the 
extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to 
the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve 
Bank on whose books the interest of the participant is recorded. To the 
extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement 
with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal

[[Page 195]]

Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a security 
entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, a Farm Credit 
Bank, the Funding Corporation, or a person may be created and perfected 
by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security 
interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
security interest in a security entitlement marked on the books of a 
Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the 
securities.
    (2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of 
a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a 
security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in 
Sec. 615.5452(b) or Sec. 615.5453 of this subpart. The perfection, 
effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security 
interest are governed by that applicable law. A security interest in 
favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest 
in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under that law, 
including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of the 
security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be 
treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 615.5455  Obligations of the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation; no adverse claims.

    (a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United 
States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in Sec. 
615.5454(c)(1), for the purposes of this subpart O, the Farm Credit 
banks, the Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat 
the participant to whose securities account an interest in a book-entry 
security has been credited as the person exclusively entitled to issue a 
transfer message, to receive interest and other payments with respect 
thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect 
to such security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the 
contrary. The Federal Reserve Banks, the Farm Credit banks, and the 
Funding Corporation are not liable to a person asserting or having an 
adverse claim to a security entitlement or to a book-entry security in a 
participant's securities account, including any such claim arising as a 
result of the transfer or disposition of a book-entry security by a 
Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a transfer message that the Federal 
Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.
    (b) The obligation of the Farm Credit banks and the Funding 
Corporation to make payments (including payments of interest and 
principal) with respect to book-entry securities is discharged at the 
time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:
    (1) Interest or other payments on book-entry securities are either 
credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a funds account maintained at the 
Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the participant.
    (2) Book-entry securities are redeemed in accordance with their 
terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the 
participant's securities account in which they are maintained and by 
either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both 
principal and interest, where applicable, to a funds account at the 
Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest as 
directed by the participant. No action by the participant is required in 
connection with the redemption of a book-entry security.

Sec. 615.5456  Authority of Federal Reserve Banks.

    (a) Each Federal Reserve Bank is hereby authorized as fiscal agent

this subpart applies, in accordance with the terms of the securities 
documentation and the provisions of this subpart:

[[Page 196]]

    (1) To service and maintain book-entry securities in accounts 
established for such purposes;
    (2) To make payments of principal and interest, as directed by the 
Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation;
    (3) To effect transfer of book-entry securities between 
participants' securities accounts as directed by the participants;
    (4) To effect conversions between book-entry securities and 
definitive Farm Credit securities with respect to those securities as to 
which conversion rights are available pursuant to the applicable 
securities documentation; and
    (5) To perform such other duties as fiscal agent as may be requested 
by the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation.
    (b) Each Federal Reserve Bank may issue Operating Circulars not 
inconsistent with this subpart, governing the details of its handling of 
book-entry securities, security entitlements, and the operation of the 
Book-entry System under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5457  Withdrawal of eligible book-entry securities for conversion to definitive form.

    (a) Eligible book-entry securities may be withdrawn from the Book-
entry System by requesting delivery of like definitive Farm Credit 
securities.
    (b) A Federal Reserve Bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate 
instructions to withdraw eligible book-entry securities from book-entry 
in the Book-entry System, convert such securities into definitive Farm 
Credit securities and deliver them in accordance with such instructions.
    (c) Farm Credit securities which are to be delivered upon withdrawal 
may be issued in either registered or bearer form, to the extent

<R05>
Sec. 615.5458  Waiver of regulations.

    The Farm Credit Administration reserves the right, in the Farm 
Credit Administration's discretion, to waive any provision(s) of the 
regulations in this subpart in any case or class of cases for the 
convenience of the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation or in 
order to relieve any person(s) of unnecessary hardship, if such action 
is not inconsistent with law, does not adversely affect any substantial 
existing rights, and the Farm Credit Administration is satisfied that 
such action will not subject the Farm Credit banks and the Funding 
Corporation to any substantial expense or liability.


<R05>
Sec. 615.5459  Liability of Farm Credit banks, Funding Corporation and Federal Reserve Banks.

    The Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Federal 
Reserve Banks may rely on the information provided in a transfer message 
or other transaction documentation, and are not required to verify the 
information. The Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the 
Federal Reserve Banks shall not be liable for any action taken in

transaction documentation, or evidence submitted in support thereof.

arising under the regulations in this subpart, the Farm Credit banks and 
the Funding Corporation may require such additional evidence and a bond 
of indemnity, with or without surety, as may in the judgment of the Farm 
Credit banks and the Funding Corporation be necessary for the protection 
of the interests of the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation.
    (b) Notice of attachment for Farm Credit securities in the Book-
entry System. The interest of a debtor in a security entitlement may be 
reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the securities 
intermediary with whom the debtor's securities account is maintained, 
except where a security entitlement is maintained in the name of a 
secured party, in which case the debtor's interest may be reached by 
legal

establish whether a Federal Reserve Bank is required to honor an order 
or other notice of attachment in any particular case or class of cases.
    (c) Conversion of definitive securities into book-entry securities. 
Definitive Farm Credit securities may be converted to book-entry form in 
accordance with the terms of the applicable securities documentation and 
Federal Reserve Operating Circular.

Sec. 616.600  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
    (a) Interests in leases means ownership interests in any aspect of a 
lease transaction, including, but not limited to, servicing rights.
    (b) Lease means any contractual obligation to own and lease, or 
lease with the option to purchase, equipment or facilities used in the 
operations of persons eligible to borrow under part 613 of this chapter.
    (c) Sale with recourse means a sale of a lease or an interest in a 
lease in which the seller:
    (1) Retains some risk of loss from the transferred asset for any 
cause except the seller's breach of usual and customary warranties or 
representations designed to protect the purchaser against fraud or 
misrepresentation; or
    (2) Has an obligation to make payments to any party resulting from:
    (i) Default on the lease by the lessee or guarantor or any other 
deficiencies in the lessee's performance;
    (ii) Changes in the market value of the assets after transfer;
    (iii) Any contractual relationship between the seller and purchaser 
incident to the transfer that, by its terms, could continue even after 
final payment, default, or other termination of the assets transferred; 
or
    (iv) Any other cause, except that the retention of servicing rights 
alone shall not constitute recourse.


<R05>
Sec. 616.6100  Purchase and sale of interests in leases.

    (a) Authority to buy interests in leases. A Farm Credit System 
institution may buy leases and interests in leases.
    (b) Policies. Each Farm Credit System institution that sells or buys 
interests in leases must do so only under a policy adopted by its board 
of directors that addresses the following:
    (1) The types of leases in which the institution may buy or sell an 
interest and the types of interests which may be bought or sold;
    (2) The underwriting standards for the purchase of interests in 
leases;
    (3) Such limits on the aggregate lease payments and residual amount 
of interests in leases that the institution may buy from a single 
institution as are necessary to diversify risk, and such limits on the 
aggregate amounts the institution may buy from all institutions as are 
necessary to assure that service to the territory is not impeded;
    (4) Identification and reporting of leases in which interests are 
sold or bought;
    (5) Requirements for securing from the selling lessor in a timely 
manner adequate financial and other information about the lessee needed 
to make an independent judgment; and
    (6) Any limits or conditions to which sales or purchases are subject 
that the board considers appropriate, including arbitration.
    (c) Purchase and sale agreements. Each agreement to buy or sell an 
interest in a lease must, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify the particular lease(s) to be covered by the agreement;
    (2) Provide for the transfer of lessee information on a timely and 
continuing basis;
    (3) Identify the nature of the interest(s) sold or bought;
    (4) Specify the rights and obligations of the parties and the terms 
and conditions of the sale;
    (5) Contain any terms necessary for the appropriate administration 
of the lease, including lease servicing and monitoring of the servicer 
and authorization and conditions for action in the event of lessee 
distress or default;
    (6) Provide for a method of resolution of disagreements arising 
under the agreement;

[[Page 200]]

    (7) Specify whether the contract is assignable by either party; and
    (8) In the case of lease transactions through agents, comply with 
Sec. 614.4325(h) of this chapter, reading the term ``lease'' or 
``leases'' in place of the term ``loan'' or ``loans,'' as applicable.
    (d) Independent judgment. Each institution that buys an interest in 
a lease must make a judgment on the payment ability of the lessee that 
is independent of the originating or lead lessor and any intermediary 
seller or broker. This must occur before the purchase of the interest 
and before any servicing action that alters the terms of the original 
agreement. The institution must not delegate such judgment to any 
person(s) not employed by the institution. A Farm Credit System 
institution that buys a lease or any interest in a lease may use 
information, such as appraisals or inspections, provided by the 
originating or lead lessor, or any intermediary seller or broker; 
however, the buying Farm Credit System institution must independently 
evaluate such information when exercising its judgment. The independent 
judgment must be documented by a payment analysis that considers factors 
set forth in Sec. 616.6300. The payment analysis must consider such 
financial and other lessee information as would be required by a prudent 
lessor and must include an evaluation of the capacity and reliability of 
the servicer. Boards of directors of jointly managed institutions must 
adopt procedures to ensure the interests of their respective 
shareholders are protected in participation between such institutions.
    (e) Sales with recourse. When a lease or interest in a lease is sold 
with recourse:
    (1) For the purpose of determining the lending and leasing limit in 
subpart J of part 614 of this chapter, the lease must be considered, to 
the extent of the recourse or guaranty, a lease by the buyer to the 
seller, and in addition, the seller must aggregate the lease with other 
obligations of the lessee; and
    (2) The lease subject to the recourse agreement must be considered 
an asset sold with recourse for the purpose of computing capital ratios.
    (f) Similar entity lease transactions. The provisions of Sec. 
613.3300 of this chapter that apply to interests in loans made to 
similar entities apply to interests in leases made to similar entities. 
In applying these provisions, the term ``loan'' shall be read to include 
the term ``lease'' and the term ``principal amount'' shall be read to 
include the term ``lease amount.''


<R05>
Sec. 616.6200  Out-of-territory leasing.

    A System institution may make leases outside its chartered 
territory.


<R05>
Sec. 616.6300  Leasing policies, procedures, and underwriting standards.

    The board of each institution engaged in lease underwriting must 
adopt a written policy (or policies). Management, at the direction of 
the board, must develop procedures that reflect lease practices that 
control risk and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Any 
leasing activity must comply with the lending policies and loan 
underwriting requirements in Sec. 614.4150 of this chapter. An 
institution engaged in the making, buying, or syndicating of leases also 
must adopt written policies and procedures that address the additional 
risks associated with leasing. Written policies and procedures must 
address the following, if applicable:
    (a) Appropriateness of the lease amount, purpose, and terms and 
conditions, including the residual value established at the inception of 
the lease;
    (b) Process for estimating the leased asset's market value during 
the lease term;
    (c) Types of equipment and facilities the institution will lease;
    (d) Remarketing of leased property and associated risks;
    (e) Property tax and sales tax reporting;
    (f) Title and ownership of leased assets;
    (g) Title and licensing for motor vehicles;
    (h) Liability associated with ownership, including any environmental 
hazards or risks;
    (i) Insurance requirements for both the lessor and lessee;

[[Page 201]]

    (j) Classification of leases in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles; and
    (k) Tax treatment of lease transactions and associated risks.


<R05>
Sec. 616.6400  Documentation.

    Each institution must document that any asset it leases is within 
its statutory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 616.6500  Investment in leased assets.

    An institution may acquire property to be leased that is consistent 
with current or planned leasing programs.


<R05>
Sec. 616.6600  Leasing limit.

    All leases made by Farm Credit System institutions shall be subject 
to the lending and leasing limit in subpart J of part 614 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 616.6700  Stock purchase requirements.

    (a) Each System institution, except the Farm Credit Leasing Services 
Corporation, making an equipment lease under titles II or III of the Act 
must require the lessee to buy or own at least one share of stock or one 
participation certificate in the institution making the lease, in 
accordance with its bylaws.
    (b) The disclosure requirements of Sec. 615.5250(a) and (b) of this 
chapter apply to stock (or participation certificates) bought as a 
condition for obtaining a lease.


<R05>
Sec. 616.6800  Disclosure requirements.

    (a) Each System institution must give to each lessee a copy of all 
lease documents signed by the lessee within a reasonable time following 
lease closing.
    (b) Each System institution must make its decision on a lease 
application as soon as possible and provide prompt written notice of its 
decision to the applicant.

Sec. 617.7000  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the following terms apply:
    Adjustable rate loan means a loan where the interest rate payable

variable rate, or other similarly designated loans.
    Adverse credit decision means a credit decision where a qualified 
lender:
    (1) Decides not to make a loan to an applicant;
    (2) Approves a loan in an amount less than the applicant requested; 
or
    (3) Denies an application for restructuring.
    Applicant means any person who completes and executes a loan 
application from a qualified lender.
    Application for restructuring means a written request from a

projections, where appropriate, as required by the qualified lender to 
support a sound credit decision.
    Distressed loan means a loan that the borrower does not have the 
financial capacity to pay according to its terms, as determined by the 
qualified lender, and exhibits one or more of the following 
characteristics:
    (1) The borrower is demonstrating adverse financial and repayment 
trends.
    (2) The loan is delinquent or past due under the terms of the loan 
contract.
    (3) One or both of the factors listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of 
this section, together with inadequate collateralization, present a high

evaluator and who satisfies the standards of Sec. 614.4260, subpart F 
of this chapter, and the standards set by the qualified lender for the 
type of property to be evaluated. The independent evaluator may not be 
an employee or agent of a qualified lender or have a relationship with 
the lender or any of its officers or directors in contravention of part 
612 of this chapter.
    Interest rate means the stated contract rate of interest.
    Loan means an extension of credit made to a farmer, rancher, or

aquatic purpose and other credit needs of the borrower, including 
financing for basic processing and marketing that directly relates to 
the borrower's operations and those of other eligible farmers, ranchers, 
and producers or harvesters of aquatic products.
    Loan application means a complete oral or written request for an 
extension of credit made in accordance with a qualified lender's

2004]


<R05>
Sec. 617.7005  When may electronic communications be used in the borrower rights process?

    Qualified lenders may use, with the parties' agreement, electronic 
commerce (E-commerce), including electronic communications for borrower 
rights disclosures. Part 609 of this chapter addresses when a qualified 
lender may use E-commerce. Consistent with these rules, a qualified 
lender should interpret part 617 broadly to allow electronic 
transmissions, communications, records, and submissions. However, 
electronic communications may not be used for a notice of default, 
acceleration, repossession, foreclosure, eviction, or the right to cure 
when a borrower's primary residence secures the loan. In these 
instances, a qualified lender must use paper disclosures.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7010  May borrower rights be waived?

    (a) A qualified lender may not obtain a waiver of borrower rights, 
except as indicated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) A borrower may waive rights relating to distressed loan 
restructuring, credit reviews, and the right of first refusal when a 
loan is guaranteed by the Small Business Administration or in connection 
with a loan sale as provided in Sec. 617.7015. Waivers obtained 
pursuant to this paragraph must be voluntary and in writing. The 
document evidencing the waiver must clearly explain the rights the 
borrower is being asked to waive.
    (c) A borrower may waive all borrower rights provided for in part 
617 of these regulations in connection with a loan syndication 
transaction with non-System lenders that are otherwise not required by 
section 4.14A(a)(6) of the Act to provide borrower rights. For purposes 
of this paragraph, a ``loan syndication'' is a multi-lender transaction 
in which each member of the lending syndicate has a direct contractual 
relationship with the borrower, but does not include a transaction 
created for the primary purpose of avoiding borrower rights. Waivers 
obtained pursuant to this paragraph must be voluntary and in writing. 
The document evidencing the waiver must clearly disclose the rights the 
borrower

[[Page 204]]

is waiving. Additionally, the borrower's written waiver must contain a 
statement that the borrower was represented by legal counsel in 
connection with execution of the waiver.

2005]


<R05>
Sec. 617.7015  What happens to borrower rights when a loan is sold?

    (a) What happens when a qualified lender sells a loan to another 
qualified lender? A loan made by a qualified lender and subsequently 
sold, in whole or in part, to another qualified lender is subject to the 
borrower rights provisions of title IV of the Act.
    (b) What happens when a qualified lender sells a loan into the 
secondary market?
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
borrower rights provisions of sections 4.14, 4.14A, 4.14B, 4.14C, 4.14D, 
and 4.36 of the Act do not apply to a loan made on or after February 10, 
1996, and designated for sale into a secondary market at the time the 
loan was made.
    (2) Borrower rights apply to a loan designated for sale under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section but not sold into a secondary market 
during the 180-day period that begins on the date of designation. The 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section will subsequently apply 
on the date of sale if the loan is later sold into a secondary market.
    (c) What happens when a qualified lender sells a loan to a 
nonqualified lender?
    (1) Except for loans sold to another qualified lender or designated 
for sale into a secondary market, a qualified lender must comply with 
one of the following requirements before selling a loan or interest in a 
loan subject to borrower rights:
    (i) The qualified lender and borrower must agree to include 
provisions in the loan contract with the borrower, or a written 
modification thereto, that ensure that the buyer of the loan will be 
obligated to provide the borrower the same rights a qualified lender 
must provide; or
    (ii) The qualified lender must obtain from the borrower a signed 
written consent to the sale, which clearly states the borrower waives 
statutory borrower rights.
    (2) Before the qualified lender obtains the borrower's consent to 
the sale of the loan and the waiver of borrower rights under paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section, the qualified lender must disclose in 
writing to the borrower:
    (i) A complete description of the statutory rights the borrower will 
waive;
    (ii) Any changes in the loan terms or conditions that will occur if 
the qualified lender does not sell the loan;
    (iii) That waiving borrower rights will not become effective unless 
the qualified lender sells the loan; and
    (iv) That borrower rights will become effective again if any 
qualified lender repurchases the loan or any interest in the loan.
    (3) The consent to the loan sale and waiver of borrower rights shall 
have no effect until the qualified lender sells the loan. Borrower 
rights become effective again if any qualified lender repurchases the 
loan or any interest in the loan.
    (4) A qualified lender may not make a loan conditioned on the 
borrower consenting to the loan's sale and a waiver of borrower rights.

provide a new effective interest rate disclosure to an existing borrower 
on or before the date:
    (i) The borrower executes a new promissory note or other comparable 
evidence of indebtedness;
    (ii) The borrower purchases additional stock or participation 
certificates as a condition of obtaining new funds from the qualified 
lender; or

qualified lender as a condition of obtaining new funds.
    (2) A qualified lender is not required to provide a new effective 
interest rate disclosure when it advances new funds to an existing 
borrower if none of the conditions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
apply and the advance is made pursuant to a preexisting contract that 
specifically provides for future advances.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7110  How should a qualified lender disclose the cost of borrower stock or participation certificates?

    The cost of borrower stock or participation certificates must be 
included in the effective interest rate calculation at the time the 
stock or participation certificate is purchased in connection with a 
loan transaction. For subsequent loans to existing borrowers, only the 
cost of new stock or participation certificates, if any, purchased in 
connection with a new loan or advance of new funds must be included in 
the effective interest rate calculation for the transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7115  How should a qualified lender disclose loan origination charges?

    Any one-time charge paid by a borrower to a qualified lender in 
consideration for making a loan must be included in the effective 
interest rate as a loan origination charge. These include, but are not 
limited to, loan origination fees, application fees, and conversion 
fees. Loan origination charges also include any payments made by a 
borrower to a qualified lender to reduce the interest rate that would 
otherwise be charged, including any charges designated as ``points.''


<R05>
Sec. 617.7120  How should a qualified lender present the disclosures to a borrower?

    A qualified lender must:
    (a) Disclose the effective interest rate and other information

borrower may keep; and
    (b) Not combine the disclosures with any information not directly 
related to the information required by Sec. Sec. 617.7130 and 617.7135.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7125  How should a qualified lender determine the effective interest rate?

    (a) A qualified lender must calculate the effective interest rate on 
a loan using the discounted cash flow method showing the effect of the 
time value of money.
    (b) For all loans, the cash flow stream used for calculating the 
effective interest rate of a loan must include:
    (1) Principal and interest;
    (2) The cost of stock or participation certificates that a borrower 
is required to purchase in connection with the loan; and
    (3) Loan origination charges described in Sec. 617.7115.
    (c) A qualified lender must establish policies and procedures for 
EIR disclosures that clearly show the effect of the cost of borrower 
stock (or participation certificates) and loan origination charges on 
the interest rate of a loan. A qualified lender must also establish 
policies and procedures for determining major assumptions used in 
calculating the effective interest rate, e.g., criteria on how the cost 
of borrower stock (or participation certificates) and loan origination 
charges are assigned or allocated among multiple loans obtained by a 
borrower simultaneously.

    (4) Any limitations on the amount or frequency of adjustments; and
    (5) The specific factors that the qualified lender may take into 
account in making adjustments to the interest rate on the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7135  What subsequent disclosures must a qualified lender make to a borrower?

after the effective date of the change.
    (3) If the borrower's interest rate is not directly tied to a widely 
publicized external index, a qualified lender must send written notice 
to the borrower of the rate change within ten (10) days after the 
effective date of the change.
    (b) Notice of increase in stock purchase requirement. If a qualified 
lender increases the amount of stock (or participation certificates) a 
borrower must own during the term of a loan, the lender must send a 
written notice to the borrower at least ten (10) days prior to the 
effective date of the increase. The notice must state:
    (1) The new effective interest rate on the outstanding balance for 
the remaining term of the borrower's loan;
    (2) The date on which the new rate is effective; and
    (3) The reason for the increase in the borrower stock (or 
participation certificates) purchase requirement.

           Subpart C_Disclosure of Differential Interest Rates


<R05>
Sec. 617.7200  What disclosures must a qualified lender make to a borrower on loans offered with more than one rate of interest?

    A qualified lender that offers more than one rate of interest to 
borrowers must notify each borrower of the right to request a review of

required to notify all primary applicants. If a loan application has 
more than one primary applicant, the qualified lender may send the 
original notice to the applicant designated to receive notices and may 
send copies to all other applicants. If the qualified lender makes an 
adverse credit decision on a loan application, the notice must include:
    (a) The specific reasons for the qualified lender's decision;
    (b) A statement that the applicant may request a review of the 
decision;
    (c) A statement that a written request for review must be made 
within 30 days after the applicant receives the qualified lender's 
notice; and
    (d) A brief explanation of the process for seeking review of the 
decision, including the independent collateral evaluation review 
process, whom to contact for access to information, and the applicant's 
right to appear in person before the credit review committee (CRC).


<R05>
Sec. 617.7305  What is a CRC and who are the members?

    The board of directors of each qualified lender must establish one 
or more CRCs to review adverse credit decisions made by a qualified 
lender. The CRC may only review adverse credit decisions at the request 
of the applicant or borrower. The CRC has the ultimate decision-making 
authority on the loan or application under review. CRC members are 
selected by the board of directors of each qualified lender and must 
include at least one of the qualified lender's farmer-elected board 
members. The loan officer involved in the adverse credit decision being 
reviewed may not serve on the CRC when it reviews that loan.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7310  What is the review process of the CRC?

    (a) How will an applicant or borrower know when the CRC will 
consider the review request? The qualified lender must inform the 
applicant or borrower 15 days in advance of the CRC meeting where the 
applicant or borrower's request will be reviewed.
    (b) Who may make a personal appearance before the CRC? Each 
applicant or borrower who has requested a review may appear in person 
before the CRC. The applicant or borrower may be accompanied by counsel 
or other representative when seeking a reversal of a decision on a loan 
or an application for restructuring.
    (c) What documents may the CRC consider? An applicant or borrower 
may submit any documents or other evidence to support the information 
contained in the loan or application for restructuring. The documents 
should demonstrate that the application for a loan or restructuring 
satisfies the credit standards of the qualified lender and is an 
eligible loan or application for restructuring. Additionally, the 
applicant or borrower is entitled to a copy of each independent 
collateral evaluation used by the qualified lender.
    (d) May an applicant obtain a new collateral evaluation even if 
collateral was not a reason for the adverse credit decision? As part of 
a CRC review, an applicant may request an independent collateral 
evaluation of the agricultural real estate securing the loan or being 
offered as security, regardless of whether collateral was an identified 
reason for the adverse credit decision. The independent collateral 
evaluation may be for any interest(s) in the property securing the loan, 
except stock or participation certificates issued by the qualified 
lender and held by the applicant or borrower.
    (1) Who may conduct an independent collateral evaluation? The 
independent collateral evaluation must be conducted by an independent 
evaluator. The CRC must provide the applicant or borrower with a list of 
three independent evaluators approved by the qualified lender within 30 
days of the request for an independent collateral evaluation. The 
applicant or borrower must select and engage the services of

[[Page 208]]

an evaluator from the list. The evaluation must comply with the 
collateral evaluation requirements of part 614, subpart F, of this 
chapter. The qualified lender must provide the applicant or borrower a 
copy of part 614, subpart F, for presentation to the selected 
independent evaluator. A copy of part 614, subpart F, signed by the 
evaluator is a required exhibit in the subsequent evaluation report.
    (2) When must an applicant or borrower obtain the independent 
collateral evaluation and who pays for the evaluation? The applicant or 
borrower must enter into a contractual arrangement for evaluation 
services within 30 days of receiving the names of three approved 
independent evaluators. The contractual arrangement must be a written 
contract for services that complies with the lender's appraisal 
standards. The evaluation must be completed within a reasonable period 
of time, taking into consideration any extenuating circumstance. The 
applicant or borrower is responsible for the costs of the independent 
evaluation.
    (3) How does the CRC use an independent collateral evaluation when 
making a decision? The CRC will consider the results of any independent 
collateral evaluation before making a final determination with respect 
to the loan or restructuring, except the CRC is not required to consider 
a collateral evaluation that does not conform to the collateral 
evaluation standards described in part 614, subpart F, of this chapter.
    (e) When must the CRC issue a decision? The CRC must reach a 
decision, and it must be the final decision of the qualified lender, not 
later than 30 days after the meeting on the request under review. The 
CRC must make every reasonable effort to conduct reviews and render 
decisions in as expeditious a manner as possible. After making its 
decision, the committee must promptly notify the applicant or borrower 
in writing of the decision and the reasons for the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7315  What records must the qualified lender maintain on behalf of the CRC?

    A qualified lender must maintain a complete file of all requests for 
CRC reviews, including participation in state mediation programs, the 
minutes of each CRC meeting, and the disposition of each review by the 
CRC.

<R05>
Sec. 617.7400  What protections exist for borrowers who meet all loan obligations?

    (a) A qualified lender may not foreclose on a loan because the 
borrower failed to post additional collateral when the borrower has made 
all accrued payments of principal, interest, and penalties on the loan.
    (b) A qualified lender may not require a borrower to reduce the 
outstanding principal balance of a loan by any amount that exceeds the 
regularly scheduled principal installment when due and payable, unless:
    (1) The borrower sells or otherwise disposes of part, or all, of the 
collateral without the prior approval of the qualified lender and the 
proceeds from the sale or disposition are not applied to the loan; or
    (2) The parties agree otherwise in writing.
    (c) After a borrower has made all accrued payments of principal, 
interest, and penalties on a loan, the qualified lender may not enforce 
acceleration of the borrower's repayment schedule due to the borrower's 
untimely payment of those principal, interest, or penalty payments.
    (d) If a qualified lender places a loan in non-interest-earning 
status and this results in an adverse action being taken against the 
borrower, such as revoking any undisbursed loan commitment, the lender 
must document the change of status and promptly notify the borrower in 
writing of the action and the reasons for taking it. If the borrower was 
not delinquent on any principal, interest, or penalty payment at the 
time of such action and the borrower's request to have the loan placed 
back into accrual status is denied, the borrower may obtain a review of 
the denial before the CRC pursuant to Sec. 617.7310 of this part. The 
borrower must request this review within 30 days after receiving the 
lender's notice.

[[Page 209]]


<R05>
Sec. 617.7405  On what policies are loan restructurings based?

    Loan restructurings must be made in accordance with the policy 
adopted by the supervising bank board of directors under section 
4.14A(g) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7410  When and how does a qualified lender notify a borrower of the right to seek loan restructuring?

    (a) What are the notice requirements? When a qualified lender 
determines that a loan is, or has become, distressed, the lender must 
provide one of the following written notices to the borrower stating 
that the loan may be suitable for restructuring.
    (1) A notice stating that the loan has been identified as distressed 
and that the borrower has the right to request a restructuring of the 
loan (nonforeclosure notice).
    (2) A notice that the loan has been identified as distressed, that 
the borrower has the right to request a restructuring of the loan, and 
that the alternative to restructuring may be foreclosure (45-day 
notice). The qualified lender must provide this notice to the borrower 
no later than 45 days before the qualified lender begins foreclosure 
proceedings with respect to any loan outstanding to the borrower. This 
notice must specifically state that if the loan is restructured and the 
borrower does not perform under the restructure agreement (as described 
in Sec. 617.7410(e)), the qualified lender may initiate foreclosure 
proceedings without further notice.
    (b) What should each notice include? (1) A copy of the policy the 
qualified lender established governing the treatment of distressed 
loans; and
    (2) All materials necessary for the borrower to submit an 
application for restructuring.
    (c) What notice should a qualified lender send to a borrower who is 
a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding? The qualified lender should send a 
notice that identifies the loan as distressed and the statutory right to 
file an application for a restructuring. The notice may also restate the 
language from the automatic stay provision to emphasize that the notice 
is not intended as an attempt to collect, assess, or recover a claim.
    (d) Whom should the qualified lender notify? The qualified lender is 
required to notify all primary obligors. If the obligors identify one 
party to receive notices, the qualified lender should send the original 
notice to that person and send copies to the other obligors. For 
borrowers in a bankruptcy proceeding, the qualified lender should send 
the notice to the borrower and, if retained, the borrower's counsel.
    (e) When is a qualified lender required to send another restructure 
notice to a borrower whose loan was previously restructured? A qualified 
lender must notify a borrower of the right to file another application 
to restructure the loan if the qualified lender sent the nonforeclosure 
notice to the borrower and the borrower has performed on the previous 
restructure agreement. Performance means that a borrower has made six 
consecutive monthly payments, four consecutive quarterly payments, three 
consecutive semiannual payments, or two consecutive annual payments. 
However, a qualified lender is not required to send another notice if 
they previously sent a 45-day notice, as described in Sec. 
617.7410(a)(2), and a borrower did not perform under a restructure 
agreement, as described above.
    (f) Does the borrower have the opportunity to meet with the 
qualified lender after receiving the restructure notice? The qualified 
lender must provide any borrower to whom a notice has been sent with a 
reasonable opportunity to meet personally with a representative of the 
lender. The borrower and lender may meet to review the status of the 
loan, the financial condition of the borrower, and the suitability of 
the loan for restructuring. A meeting to discuss a loan that is in a 
non-interest-earning status may also involve developing a plan for 
restructuring, if the qualified lender determines the loan is suitable 
for restructuring.
    (g) May the qualified lender voluntarily consider restructuring for 
a borrower who did not submit a restructuring application? A qualified 
lender may, in the absence of an application for restructuring from a 
borrower, propose restructuring to an individual borrower.

[[Page 210]]


<R05>
Sec. 617.7415  How does a qualified lender decide to restructure a loan?

    (a) What criteria does a qualified lender use to evaluate an 
application for restructuring? The qualified lender should consider the 
following:
    (1) Whether the cost to the lender of restructuring the loan is 
equal to or less than the cost of foreclosure, considering all relevant 
criteria. These criteria include:
    (i) The present value of interest and principal foregone by the 
lender in carrying out the application for restructuring;
    (ii) Reasonable and necessary administrative expenses involved in 
working with the borrower to finalize and implement the application for 
restructuring;
    (iii) Whether the borrower's application for restructuring included 
a preliminary restructuring plan and cash flow analysis, taking into 
account income from all sources to be applied to the debt and all assets 
to be pledged, that show a reasonable probability that orderly debt 
retirement will occur as a result of the proposed restructuring; and
    (iv) Whether the borrower has furnished, or is willing to furnish, 
complete and current financial statements in a form acceptable to the 
qualified lender.
    (2) Whether the borrower is applying all income over and above 
necessary and reasonable living and operating expenses to the payment of 
primary obligations;
    (3) Whether the borrower has the financial capacity and the 
management skills to protect the collateral from diversion, dissipation, 
or deterioration;
    (4) Whether the borrower is capable of working out existing 
financial difficulties, taking into consideration any prior 
restructuring of the loan, reestablishing a viable operation, and 
repaying the loan on a rescheduled basis; and
    (5) In the case of a distressed loan that is not delinquent, whether 
restructuring consistent with sound lending practices may be taken to 
reasonably ensure that the loan will not have to be placed into non-
interest-earning status in the future.
    (b) What should be included in determining the cost of foreclosure? 
(1) The difference between the outstanding balance due, as provided by 
the loan documents, and the liquidation value of the loan, taking into 
consideration the borrower's repayment capacity and the liquidation 
value of the collateral used to secure the loan;
    (2) The estimated cost of maintaining a loan classified as a high-
risk asset;
    (3) The estimated cost of administrative and legal actions necessary 
to foreclose a loan and dispose of property acquired as the result of 
the foreclosure, including attorneys' fees and court costs;
    (4) The estimated cost of value changes in collateral used to secure 
a loan during the period beginning on the date of the initiation of an 
action to foreclose or liquidate the loan and ending on the date of the 
disposition of the collateral; and
    (5) All other costs incurred as the result of the foreclosure or 
liquidation of a loan.
    (c) What should the qualified lender do if the borrower and the 
qualified lender cannot agree on the financial projections used in the 
application for restructuring? If the borrower and lender are not able 
to agree on supportable or realistic financial projections, the lender 
may use benchmarks to determine the operational input costs and chattel 
security values. These benchmarks may include, but are not limited to, 
the borrower's 5-year production average; averages in the county where 
the farming operation is located, based on data from United States 
Department of Agriculture, local colleges or universities, or other 
recognized authority; and other such reasonable sources.
    (d) How does the qualified lender decide whether to restructure or 
foreclose? If a qualified lender determines the potential cost to the 
lender of restructuring the loan as proposed in the application for 
restructuring is less than or equal to the potential cost of 
foreclosure, the qualified lender must restructure the loan. If two or 
more restructuring alternatives are available, the qualified lender must 
restructure the loan using the alternative that results in the least 
cost to the lender.

[[Page 211]]

    (e) What documentation should the qualified lender retain? In the 
event that an application for restructuring is denied, a qualified 
lender must maintain sufficient documentation to demonstrate compliance 
with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7420  How will a decision on an application for restructuring be issued?

    (a) When must a qualified lender make a decision on an application 
for restructuring? Each qualified lender must provide a written decision 
on an application for restructuring and provide this decision to the 
borrower within 15 days from the conclusion of the negotiations used to 
develop the application for restructuring.
    (b) How does a qualified lender notify the borrower of the decision? 
On reaching a decision on an application for restructuring, the 
qualified lender must provide written notice in any manner that requires 
a primary obligor to acknowledge receipt of the lender's decision. In 
the case of a loan involving one or more primary obligors, the original 
notice may be provided to the primary obligor identified to receive such 
notice, with copies provided by regular mail to the other obligors.
    (c) What notice is required if the restructuring request is denied? 
When an application for restructuring is denied, the notice must 
include:
    (1) The specific reason(s) for the denial and any critical 
assumptions and relevant information on which the specific reasons are 
based, except that any confidential information shall not be disclosed;
    (2) A statement that the borrower may request a review of the 
denial;
    (3) A statement that any request for review must be made in writing 
within 7 days after receiving such notice.
    (4) A brief explanation of the process for seeking review of the 
denial, including the appraisal review process and the right to appear 
before the CRC, pursuant to Sec. 617.7310 of this part, accompanied by 
counsel or any other representative, if the borrower chooses.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7425  What type of notice should be given to a borrower before foreclosure?

    The qualified lender must send the 45-day notice, as described in 
Sec. 617.7410(a)(2), no later than 45 days before any qualified lender 
begins foreclosure proceedings. The notice informs the borrower in 
writing that the loan may be suitable for restructuring and that the 
qualified lender will review any suitable loan for possible 
restructuring. The 45-day notice must include a copy of the policy and 
the materials described in Sec. 617.7410(b). The notice must also state 
that if the loan is restructured, the borrower must perform under this 
restructure agreement. If the borrower does not perform, the qualified 
lender may initiate foreclosure.
    (a) Does the notice have to inform the borrower that foreclosure is 
possible? The notice must inform the borrower that the alternative to 
restructuring may be foreclosure. If the notice does not inform the 
borrower of potential foreclosure, then the qualified lender must send a 
second notice at least 45 days before foreclosure is initiated.
    (b) How are borrowers who are debtors in a bankruptcy proceeding 
notified? A qualified lender must restate the language from the 
automatic stay provision to emphasize that the notice is not intended to 
be an attempt to collect, assess, or recover a claim. The qualified 
lender should send the notice to the borrower and, if retained, the 
borrower's counsel.
    (c) May a qualified lender foreclose on a loan when there is a 
restructuring application on file? No qualified lender may foreclose or 
continue any foreclosure proceeding with respect to a distressed loan 
before the lender has completed consideration of any pending application 
for restructuring and CRC consideration, if applicable. This section 
does not prevent a lender from taking any action necessary to avoid the 
dissipation of assets or the diversion, dissipation, or deterioration of 
collateral if the lender has reasonable grounds to believe that such 
diversion, dissipation, or deterioration may occur.

[[Page 212]]


<R05>
Sec. 617.7430  Are institutions required to participate in state agricultural loan mediation programs?

    (a) If initiated by a borrower, System institutions must participate 
in state mediation programs certified under section 501 of the 
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 and present and explore debt 
restructuring proposals advanced in the course of such mediation. If 
provided in the certified program, System institutions may initiate 
mediation at any time.
    (b) System institutions must cooperate in good faith with requests 
for information or analysis of information made in the course of 
mediation under any loan mediation program.
    (c) No System institution may make a loan secured by a mortgage or 
lien on agricultural property to a borrower on the condition that the 
borrower waive any right under the agricultural loan mediation program 
of any state.
    (d) A state mediation may proceed at the same time as the loan 
restructuring process of Sec. 617.7415 or at any other appropriate 
time.


<R04>
            Subpart F_Distressed Loan Restructuring Directive


<R05>
Sec. 617.7500  What is a directive used for and what may it require?

    (a) A distressed loan restructuring directive is an order issued to 
a qualified lender when FCA has determined that the lender has violated 
section 4.14A of the Act.
    (b) A distressed loan restructuring directive requires the qualified 
lender to comply with the specific distressed loan restructuring 
requirements in the Act.
    (c) A distressed loan restructuring directive is enforceable in the 
same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease 
and desist order that has become final. Any violation of a distressed 
loan restructuring directive may result in FCA assessing civil money 
penalties or seeking a court order pursuant to section 5.31 or 5.32 of 
the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7505  How will the qualified lender know when FCA is considering issuing a distressed loan restructuring directive?

    When FCA intends to issue a distressed loan restructuring directive, 
it will notify the qualified lender in writing. The notice will state:
    (a) The reasons FCA intends to issue a distressed loan restructuring 
directive;
    (b) The proposed contents of the distressed loan restructuring 
directive; and
    (c) Any other relevant information.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7510  What should the qualified lender do when it receives notice of a distressed loan restructuring directive?

    (a) A qualified lender should respond to the notice by stating why 
FCA should not issue a distressed loan restructuring directive, by 
proposing changes to the directive, or by seeking other suitable relief. 
The response must include any information, documentation, or other 
relevant evidence that supports the qualified lender's position. The 
response may include a plan for achieving compliance with the distressed 
loan restructuring requirements of the Act. The response must be in 
writing and delivered to FCA within 30 days after the date on which the 
qualified lender received the notice. In its discretion, FCA may extend 
the time period for good cause. FCA may shorten the 30-day period with 
the consent of the qualified lender or when FCA determines that 
providing the full 30 days would result in a borrower not receiving 
distressed loan restructuring rights.
    (b) If the qualified lender fails to respond within 30 days or such 
other time period specified by FCA, this failure will constitute a 
waiver of any objections to the proposed distressed loan restructuring 
directive.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7515  How does the FCA decide whether to issue a directive?

    After the closing date of the qualified lender's response period, or 
following receipt of the qualified lender's response, FCA must decide if 
there is sufficient information to support the issuance of a directive 
or if additional

[[Page 213]]

information is necessary. Once FCA has received sufficient information, 
it must decide whether to issue a directive as originally proposed or as 
modified.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7520  How does the FCA issue a directive and when will it be effective?

    A distressed loan restructuring directive is effective immediately 
on receipt by the qualified lender, or on such later date as may be 
specified by FCA, and will remain effective and enforceable until it is 
stayed, modified, or terminated by FCA.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7525  May FCA use other enforcement actions?

    FCA may issue a distressed loan restructuring directive in addition 
to, or instead of, any other action allowed by law, including cease and 
desist proceedings, civil money penalties, or the granting or 
conditioning of any application or other requests by the System 
institution.


<R04>

foreclosure or a voluntary conveyance by a borrower who, as determined 
by the institution, does not have the financial resources to avoid 
foreclosure.
    Previous owner means:
    (1) The prior record owner who was a borrower from a System

<R05>
Sec. 617.7605  How should System institutions document whether the borrower had the financial resources to avoid foreclosure?

    The right of first refusal applies only to borrowers who did not

conveyance. A System institution must clearly document in its files 
whether the borrower had the resources to avoid foreclosure or voluntary 
conveyance.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7610  What should the System institution do when it decides to sell acquired agricultural real estate?

    (ii) Cannot meet all the payments, terms, and conditions of such 
lease.
    (c) Act on an offer to lease the acquired agricultural real estate

<R05>
Sec. 618.8010  Related services authorization process.

    (a) Authorities. System banks and associations may only offer 
related services that meet the criteria specified in this regulation and 
are authorized by the FCA.
    (b) New service proposals. (1) A System bank or association that 
proposes or intends to offer a related service that the FCA has not 
previously authorized must submit to the FCA, in writing, a proposal 
that includes a description of the service, a statement of how it meets 
the regulatory definition of ``related services'' in Sec. 618.8000(b), 
and the risk analysis cited in Sec. 618.8020(b)(3). The FCA will 
evaluate the proposed service based on the information submitted, and 
may also consider whether there are extenuating circumstances or other 
compelling reasons that justify the proposed service or support a 
determination that the service is not authorized. This evaluation will 
focus primarily on Systemwide issues rather than on institution or 
program-specific factors.
    (2) When authorizing a proposed related service, at its discretion, 
the FCA may impose special conditions or limitations on any related 
service or program to offer a related service.
    (3) At its discretion the FCA may, at any time during its evaluation 
of a proposed related service, publish the proposed related service in 
the Federal Register for public comment.
    (4) Within 60 days of the FCA receiving a completed proposal, 
including any additional information the FCA may require, the FCA will 
act on the request to authorize a new service. The FCA shall approve the 
request, deny the request, or publish the service for public comment in 
the Federal Register. For good cause and prior to the expiration of the 
60 days, the FCA may extend this period for an additional 60 days.
    (5) Within the time period established in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, the FCA shall notify the requesting institution of its actions. 
Following notification of the requesting institution, the FCA will 
notify all System banks and associations of its determination on the 
proposed service by bookletter or other means. If a service is not 
authorized, the reasons for denial will be included in the notifications 
to the System and the requesting institution.
    (c) Previously authorized services. (1) For related services that 
have been authorized by the FCA, any System bank or association may 
develop a program and subsequently offer the related service to eligible 
recipients, subject to any special conditions or institutional limits 
placed by the FCA. These programs will be subject to review and 
evaluation during the examination and enforcement process.
    (2) The FCA shall make available to all System banks and 
associations a list of such related services (``related

[[Page 217]]

services list'' or ``list'') and will update the list in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The list will contain the following:
    (i) A description of each related service; and
    (ii) The types of institutions authorized to offer each type of 
related service;
    (iii) Identification of any special conditions on how the related 
service may be offered. The special conditions and description of the 
service will be fully detailed in FCA's notice to System institutions 
under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (3) At least 10 business days prior to implementing a related 
service program already on the list, the System bank or association must 
notify the FCA Office of Examination field office responsible for 
examining that institution in writing and provide it with a description 
of the proposed related service program.


<R05>
Sec. 618.8015  Policy guidelines.

    (a) The board of directors of each System bank or association 
providing related services must adopt a policy addressing related 
services. The policy shall include clearly stated purposes, objectives, 
and operating parameters for offering related services and a requirement 
that each service offered be consistent with the institution's business 
plan and long-term strategic goals. Such policy shall also be subject to 
review under an appropriate internal control policy.
    (b) All related services must be offered to recipients on an 
optional basis. If the institution requires a related service as a 
condition to borrow, it must inform the recipient that the related 
service can be obtained from the institution or from any other person or 
entity offering the same or similar related services.
    (c) All fees for related services must be separately identified from 
loan interest charges and disclosed to the recipient of the service 
prior to providing or implementing the service.


<R05>
Sec. 618.8020  Feasibility requirements.

    For every related service program a System bank or association 
provides, it must document program feasibility. The feasibility analysis 
shall include the following:
    (a) Support for the determination that the related service is 
authorized; and
    (b) An overall cost-benefit analysis that demonstrates program 
feasibility, taking into consideration the following items:
    (1) An analysis of how the program relates to or promotes the 
institution's business plan and strategic goals, and whether offering 
the service is consistent with the long-term goals described in its 
capital plan;
    (2) An analysis of the expected financial returns of the program 
which, at a minimum, must include an evaluation of market, pricing, 
competition issues, and expected profitability. This analysis should 
include an explanation of how the program will contribute to the overall 
financial health of the institution; and
    (3) An analysis of the risk in the program, including:
    (i) An evaluation of the operational costs and risks involved in 
offering the program, such as management and personnel requirements, 
training requirements, and capital outlays;
    (ii) An evaluation of the financial liability that may be incurred 
as a result of offering the program and any insurance or other measures 
that are necessary to minimize these risks; and
    (iii) An evaluation of the conflicts of interest, whether real or 
perceived, that may arise as a result of offering the program and any 
steps that are necessary to eliminate or appropriately manage these 
conflicts.


<R05>
Sec. 618.8025  Feasibility reviews.

    (a) Prior to an association offering a related service program for 
the first time or offering a service that it did not offer during the 
most recently completed business cycle (generally 1 year), the board of 
directors of the funding bank must verify that the association has 
performed a feasibility analysis pursuant to Sec. 618.8020. The bank 
review is limited to a determination that the feasibility analysis is 
complete and that the analysis establishes that it is feasible for the 
association to provide the program. Any conclusion by the bank that the 
feasibility

[[Page 218]]

analysis is incomplete or fails to demonstrate program feasibility must 
be fully supported and communicated to the association in writing within 
60 days of its submission to the bank.
    (b) Prior to a service corporation offering a service for the first 
time or offering a service that it did not offer during the most 
recently completed business cycle (generally 1 year), the owners of the 
service corporation must verify that the service corporation has 
performed a feasibility analysis pursuant to Sec. 618.8020. If the 
owners all agree, one bank with a significant ownership interest can be 
delegated this responsibility.

<R05>
Sec. 618.8030  Out-of-territory related services.

    (a) System banks and associations may offer related services outside 
their chartered territories subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The System bank or association obtains consent from all 
chartered institutions currently offering the same type of service in 
the territory in which the service is to be provided; or
    (2) If no System bank or association is currently offering the same 
type of service in the territory, then the out-of-territory institution 
must obtain the consent of at least one direct lender institution 
chartered in the territory in which the related service is to be 
provided.
    (3) The consent obtained pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section shall be in the form of a written agreement with specific 
terms and conditions including timeframes.
    (b) System banks and associations providing out-of-territory 
services must fulfill all requirements of subparts A and B of this part 
618.
    (c) An institution that consents to another bank or association 
providing a related service in its chartered territory must meet the 
requirements of this section, but need not comply with the other 
requirements of subparts A and B of this part 618, unless the program 
consented to imposes a financial obligation on the consenting 
institution. If a financial obligation exists, then the consenting 
institution must comply with Sec. Sec. 618.8015, 618.8020 and 618.8025.
    (d) Service corporations must follow the requirements of this 
section in offering related services out-of-territory. A service 
corporation cannot consent to an out-of-territory institution providing 
services in its chartered territory.


<R04>
                       Subpart B_Member Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 618.8040  Authorized insurance services.

    (a) Farm Credit System banks (excluding banks for cooperatives) 
(hereinafter banks) and associations may sell to their members and 
borrowers, on an optional basis, credit or term life and credit 
disability insurance appropriate to protect the loan commitment in the 
event of death or disability of the debtors. The sale of other insurance 
necessary to protect a member's or borrower's farm or aquatic unit is 
permitted, but limited to hail and multiple-peril crop insurance, title 
insurance, and insurance necessary to protect the facilities and 
equipment of aquatic members and borrowers. A member or borrower shall 
have the option, without coercion from the bank or association, to 
accept or reject such insurance.
    (b) Bank and association board policies governing the provision of 
member insurance programs shall be established within the following 
general guidelines:
    (1) A System bank or association may provide credit or term-life or 
credit-disability insurance only to persons who have a loan or lease 
with any System bank or association, without regard to whether such 
institution is the provider. Term-life insurance coverage may continue 
after the loan has been repaid or the lease terminated, provided the 
member can reasonably be expected to borrow again within 2 years, and 
provided the continuation of insurance is not contrary to state law.
    (2) A debtor-creditor relationship is not required for the sale of 
other insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as 
purchasers are members of a System bank or association. For the purposes 
of this section, ``member'' means someone eligible to

[[Page 219]]

borrow who is a stockholder or participation certificate holder and who 
acquired stock or participation certificates to obtain a loan, for 
investment purposes, or to qualify for other services of the association 
or bank.
    (3) In making insurance available through private insurers, each 
bank shall approve the programs of more than two insurers for each type 
of insurance offered in the bank's chartered territory, provided that 
more than two insurers for each type of insurance have proposed programs 
to the bank that will, in all likelihood, have long-term viability, and 
meet the requirements of Sec. 618.8040(b)(4)(i) of this section. The 
banks shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to attract more than 
two qualified insurers for each insurance program offered to borrowers 
in all States of the bank's chartered territory. Where the bank is 
unable to approve more than two insurers, the bank shall document its 
efforts to attract additional qualified insurers for the affected 
insurance program and State. The banks may provide comparative 
information relating to costs and quality of approved programs and the 
financial condition of approved companies.
    (4) Member insurance services may be offered only if:
    (i) The insurance program has been approved by the bank or 
association from among eligible programs made available to it by 
insurers--
    (A) Meeting reasonable financial and quality of service standards 
prescribed by the bank; and
    (B) Licensed under State law to do business in the State(s) in which 
the insurance is offered:
    (ii) The bank or association has the capacity to render authorized 
insurance services in an effective and efficient manner;
    (iii) There exists the probability that the service will generate 
sufficient revenue to cover all costs;
    (iv) Rendering the insurance service will not have an adverse effect 
on the credit or other operations of the bank or association; and
    (v) In making insurance available through approved insurers, the 
board of directors of the bank or association shall make a reasonable 
and good faith effort to select and offer at least two approved insurers 
for each type of insurance made available to the members and borrowers. 
In the event that the bank or association has selected less than two 
insurers for any insurance program, such bank or association shall 
document the reasons why it is unable to offer members and borrowers 
additional insurers for the affected insurance program.
    (5) All costs to members and borrowers for insurance services 
provided shall be disclosed separately from interest charges.
    (6) Bank and association personnel shall not benefit from insurance 
sales by receipt of commissions or gifts from underwriting insurance 
companies. However, employees may participate in an incentive plan under 
which incentive compensation is provided based on the sale of insurance.
    (i) In any single year, for all employees except full-time insurance 
personnel or full-time supervisors or managers of insurance departments, 
incentive compensation attributable to sales of all types of insurance 
cannot exceed an amount equivalent to 5 percent of the recipient's 
annual base salary.
    (ii) In any single year, for full-time insurance personnel and full-
time supervisors and managers of insurance departments, incentive 
compensation for sales of credit life and similar types of insurance 
(i.e. insurance that pays on a loan or mortgage upon the death or 
disability of the debtor) cannot exceed an amount equivalent to 5 
percent of the recipient's annual base salary.
    (iii) No incentive compensation limit applies to sales of other 
insurance (crop, title, etc.) by full-time insurance personnel or full-
time supervisors or managers of insurance departments.
    (7) Term insurance may be written for the amount of coverage desired 
by the member or borrower, but in no case may the amount of term 
insurance, credit life insurance, or a combination of the two with an 
institution of the System, be in excess of total loan commitments to the 
member or borrower by the institution writing the insurance.
    (8) The banks may, only by agreement with an insurer, offer services 
traditionally furnished by insurers to

[[Page 220]]

the Farm Credit System. This shall include master marketers when 
considering the sale of Federal crop insurance. The banks shall not 
underwrite insurance, adjust claim payments or settlements, or train and 
school or service adjustors or insurance agents.
    (9) No bank or association shall, directly or indirectly, condition 
the extension of credit or provision of other service on the purchase of 
insurance sold or endorsed by a bank or association. At the time 
insurance sold or endorsed by a bank or association is offered to a 
member or borrower, a bank or association shall present a written notice 
that the service is optional. The notice shall be in prominent type and 
separately signed by the member or borrower. The bank or association 
shall explain to the member or borrower that purchase of insurance from 
the association is optional and that the member or borrower will not be 
discriminated against for obtaining the insurance elsewhere.
    (10) No bank or association shall, directly or indirectly, 
discriminate in any manner against any agent, broker, or insurer that is 
not affiliated with such bank or association, or against any party who 
purchases insurance through any such nonaffiliated insurance agent, 
broker, or insurer.
    (11) Bank supervision shall ensure that insurance services offered 
by approved insurers consistently provide members or borrowers with a 
high quality and cost-effective service as prescribed by policies of the 
bank's board of directors, but such supervision shall be without any 
coercion or suasion from any bank in favor of any agent or insurer.
    (12) Records must be maintained by banks and associations in 
sufficient detail to facilitate the review and supervision required 
herein.

ordinarily contained in published reports or press releases regarding 
any such banks or associations or their borrowers or members.

Sec. 618.8310  Lists of borrowers and stockholders.

    (a) Any System institution, for the purpose of protecting the 
security position of the institution, may provide lists of borrowers to 
buyers, warehousemen, and others who deal in produce or livestock of the 
kind that secures such loans, except to the extent such actions are 
prohibited by State laws adopted in accordance with the Food Security 
Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-198, 99 Stat. 1354. Lists of borrowers or 
stockholders shall not otherwise be released by any bank or association 
except in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b)(1) Within 7 days after receipt of a written request by a 
stockholder, each Farm Credit bank or association must provide a current 
list of its stockholders' names, addresses, and classes of stock held to 
such requesting stockholder. As a condition to providing the list, the 
bank or association may only require that the stockholder agree and 
certify in writing that the stockholder will:
    (i) Utilize the list exclusively for communicating with stockholders 
for permissible purposes; and
    (ii) Not make the list available to any person, other than the 
stockholder's attorney or accountant, without first obtaining the 
written consent of the institution.
    (2) As an alternative to receiving a list of stockholders, a 
stockholder may request the institution mail or otherwise furnish to 
each stockholder a communication for a permissible purpose on behalf of 
the requesting stockholder. This alternative may be used at

[[Page 221]]

the discretion of the requesting stockholder, provided that the 
requester agrees to defray the reasonable costs of the communication. In 
the event the requester decides to exercise this option, the institution 
must provide the requester with a written estimate of the costs of 
handling and mailing the communication as soon as practicable after 
receipt of the stockholder's request to furnish a communication. 
However, a stockholder may not exercise this option when requesting the 
list to distribute campaign material for election to the institution 
board or board committees. Farm Credit banks and associations are 
prohibited from distributing or mailing campaign material under Sec. 
611.320(e) of this chapter.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section ``permissible 
purpose'' is defined to mean matters relating to the business operations 
of the institutions. This includes matters relating to the effectiveness 
of management, the use of institution assets, the distribution by 
stockholder candidates of campaign material for election to the 
institution board or board committees, and the performance of directors 
and officers. This does not include communications involving commercial, 
social, political, or charitable causes, communications relating to the 
enforcement of a personal claim or the redress of a personal grievance, 
or proposals advocating that the bank or association violate any 
Federal, State, or local law or regulation.

credit standing, and property of borrowers and applicants for loans. 
They shall not exhibit or quote the following documents: Loan

    (3) The chairman of the presidents committees and the presidents of 
the banks may supply statistical and other impersonal information

    (A) For each of the last 3 completed fiscal years, report the total 
amount of compensation paid and the amount of each component of 
compensation paid to the institution's chief executive officer (CEO), 
naming the individual. If more than one person served in the capacity of 
CEO during any given fiscal year, individual compensation disclosures 
must be provided for each CEO.
    (B) For each of the last 3 completed fiscal years, report the 
aggregate amount of compensation paid, and the components of 
compensation paid, to all senior officers as a group, stating the number 
of officers in the group without naming them. If applicable, include in 
the aggregate the amount of compensation paid to those officers who are 
not senior officers but whose total annual compensation is among the 
five highest amounts paid by the institution for the reporting period.

[[Page 236]]

    (C) Amounts shown as ``Salary'' (column (c)) and ``Bonus'' (column 
(d)) must reflect the dollar value of salary and bonus earned by the 
senior officer during the fiscal year. Amounts contributed during the 
fiscal year by the senior officer pursuant to a plan established under 
section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, or similar plan, must be 
included in the salary column or bonus column, as appropriate. If the 
amount of salary or bonus earned during the fiscal year is not 
calculable by the time the report is prepared, the reporting institution 
must provide its best estimate of the compensation amount(s) and 
disclose that fact in a footnote to the table.
    (D) Amounts shown as ``deferred/perquisites'' (column (e)) must 
reflect the dollar value of other annual compensation not properly 
categorized as salary or bonus, including but not limited to:
    (1) Deferred compensation earned during the fiscal year, whether or 
not paid in cash; or
    (2) Perquisites and other personal benefits, including the value of 
noncash items, unless the annual aggregate value of such perquisites is 
less than $5,000. Reportable perquisites include cash and the value of 
noncash items provided by a third party to a senior officer for services 
rendered by the officer on behalf of the reporting institution.
    (E) Compensation amounts reported under the category ``Other'' 
(column (f)) shall reflect the dollar value of all other compensation 
not properly reportable in any other column. Items reported in this 
column shall be specifically identified and described in a footnote to 
the table. Such compensation includes, but is not limited to:
    (1) The amount paid to the senior officer pursuant to a plan or 
arrangement in connection with the resignation, retirement, or 
termination of such officer's employment with the institution; or
    (2) The amount of contributions by the institution on behalf of the 
senior officer to a vested or unvested defined contribution plan unless 
the plan is made available to all employees on the same basis.
    (F) Amounts displayed under ``Total'' (column (g)) shall reflect the 
sum total of amounts reported in columns (c), (d), (e), and (f).
    (ii) Provide a description of all plans pursuant to which cash or 
noncash compensation was paid or distributed during the last fiscal 
year, or is proposed to be paid or distributed in the future for 
performance during the last fiscal year, to those individuals described 
in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. The description of each plan 
must include, but not be limited to:
    (A) A summary of how the plan operates and who is covered by the 
plan;
    (B) The criteria used to determine amounts payable, including any 
performance formula or measure;
    (C) The time periods over which the measurement of compensation will 
be determined;
    (D) Payment schedules; and
    (E) Any material amendments to the plan during the last fiscal year.
    (iii) The annual report or AMIS must include a statement that 
disclosure of information on the total compensation paid during the last 
fiscal year to any senior officer or to any other officer included in 
the aggregate is available and will be disclosed to shareholders of the 
institution and shareholders of related associations (if applicable) 
upon request.
    (3) Travel, subsistence, and other related expenses. (i) Briefly 
describe your policy addressing reimbursements for travel, subsistence, 
and other related expenses as it applies to directors and senior 
officers. The report shall include a statement that a copy of the policy 
is available to shareholders of the institution and shareholders of 
related associations (if applicable) upon request.
    (ii) For each of the last 3 fiscal years, state the aggregate amount 
of reimbursement for travel, subsistence, and other related expenses for 
all directors as a group.
    (j) Transactions with senior officers and directors. (1) State the 
institution's policies, if any, on loans to and transactions with 
officers and directors of the institution.
    (2) Transactions other than loans. For each person who served as a 
senior officer or director on January 1 of the year following the fiscal 
year of which the report is filed, or at any time during the fiscal year 
just ended, describe

[[Page 237]]

briefly any transaction or series of transactions other than loans that 
occurred at any time since the last annual meeting between the 
institution and such person, any member of the immediate family of such 
person, or any organization with which such person is affiliated.
    (i) For transactions relating to the purchase or retirement of 
preferred stock issued by the institution, state the name of each senior 
officer or director that held preferred stock issued by the institution 
during the reporting period, the current amount of preferred stock held 
by the senior officer or director, the average dividend rate on the 
preferred stock currently held, and the amount of purchases and 
retirements by the individual during the reporting period.
    (ii) For all other transactions, state the name of the senior 
officer or director who entered into the transaction or whose immediate 
family member or affiliated organization entered into the transaction, 
the nature of the person's interest in the transaction, and the terms of 
the transaction. No information need be given where the purchase price, 
fees, or charges involved were determined by competitive bidding or 
where the amount involved in the transaction (including the total of all 
periodic payments) does not exceed $5,000, or the interest of the person 
arises solely as a result of his or her status as a stockholder of the 
institution and the benefit received is not a special or extra benefit 
not available to all stockholders.
    (3) Loans to senior officers and directors. (i) To the extent 
applicable, state that the institution (or in the case of an association 
that does not carry loans to its senior officers and directors on its 
books, its related bank) has had loans outstanding during the last full 
fiscal year to date to its senior officers and directors, their 
immediate family members, and any organizations with which such senior 
officers or directors are affiliated that:
    (A) Were made in the ordinary course of business; and
    (B) Were made on the same terms, including interest rate, 
amortization schedule, and collateral, as those prevailing at the time 
for comparable transactions with other persons.
    (ii) To the extent applicable, state that no loan to a senior 
officer or director, or to any organization affiliated with such person, 
or to any immediate family member who resides in the same household as 
such person or in whose loan or business operation such person has a 
material financing or legal interest, involved more than the normal risk 
of collectibility; provided that no such statement need be made with 
respect to any director or senior officer who has resigned before the 
time for filing the applicable report with the Farm Credit 
Administration (but in no case later than the actual filing), or whose 
term of office will expire or terminate no later than the date of the 
meeting of stockholders to which the report relates.
    (iii) If the conditions stated in paragraphs (j)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section do not apply to the loans of the persons or organizations 
specified therein, with respect to such loans state:
    (A) The name of the officer or director to whom the loan was made or 
to whose relative or affiliated organization the loan was made.
    (B) The largest aggregate amount of each indebtedness outstanding at 
any time during the last fiscal year.
    (C) The nature of the loan(s).

    (E) The reasons the loan does not comply with the criteria contained 
in paragraphs (j)(3)(i) and (j)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (F) If the loan does not comply with paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this 
section, the rate of interest payable on the loan and the repayment 
terms.

section, the amount past due, if any, and the reason the loan is deemed 
to involve more than a normal risk of collectibility.

following events that occurred during the past 5 years and that are 
material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any person who 
served as director or senior

similar officer was appointed by a court for the business or property of 
such person, or any partnership in which such person was a general

corporation or business association of which such person was a senior 
officer at or within 2 years before the time of such filing;
    (2) Such person was convicted in a criminal proceeding or is a named 
party in a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and 
other misdemeanors);
    (3) Such person was the subject of any order, judgment, or decree, 
not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, by any court of 
competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining or 
otherwise limiting such person from engaging in any type of business 
practice.
    (l) Relationship with qualified public accountant. (1) If a change 
or changes in qualified public accountants have taken place since the 
last annual report to shareholders or if a disagreement with a qualified 
public accountant has occurred that the institution would be required to

    (m) Financial statements. (1) Furnish financing statements and 
related footnotes that have been prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and instructions and other requirements

                       Subpart C_Quarterly Report


<R05>
Sec. 620.10  Preparing the quarterly report.

    (a) Each Farm Credit bank and direct lender association must prepare 
a quarterly report within 40 calendar days after the end of each fiscal 
quarter, except that no report need be prepared for the fiscal quarter 
that coincides with the end of the fiscal year of the institution.
    (b) The report shall contain, at a minimum, the information 
specified in Sec. 620.11 and, in addition, such other material 
information (including significant events) as is necessary to make the 
required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are 
made, not misleading.

[62 FR 15093, Mar. 31, 1997, as amended at 71 FR 76120, Dec. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 620.11  Content of quarterly report to shareholders.

    (a) General. The information required to be included in the 
quarterly report may be presented in any format deemed suitable by the 
institution, except as otherwise required by this section. The report 
must be organized in an easily understandable format and not presented 
in a manner that is misleading.
    (b) Rules for condensation. For purposes of this section, major 
captions to be provided in the financial statements are the same as 
those provided in the financial statements contained in the 
institution's annual report to shareholders, except that the financial 
statements included in the quarterly report may be condensed into major 
captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph 
and paragraph (f) of this section.
    (1) Interim balance sheets. When any major balance sheet caption is 
less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has 
not increased or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the 
preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.
    (2) Interim statements of income. When any major income statement 
caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most 
recent fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not increased or 
decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim period 
of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. 
In calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded. If 
losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the 
average loss shall be used for purposes of this test.
    (3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure 
either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying 
footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not 
misleading. Institutions may presume that users of the interim financial 
information have read or have access to the audited financial statements 
for the preceding fiscal year and the adequacy of additional disclosure 
needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. 
Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the 
disclosure contained in the most recent audited financial statements 
(such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices), 
and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or 
composition since the end of the most recent completed fiscal year may 
be omitted. However, disclosure shall be provided of events occurring 
subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal year that have a 
material impact on the institution. Disclosures should encompass, for 
example, significant changes since the end of the most recently 
completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and 
practices; estimates inherent in the preparation of financial 
statements; status of long-term contracts; capitalization, including 
significant new indebtedness or modification of existing financing 
agreements; and the reporting entity resulting from business 
combinations or dispositions.
    (4) If, during the most recent interim period presented, the 
institution entered into a business combination treated for accounting 
purposes as a pooling of interests, the interim financial statements for 
both the current year and the preceding year shall reflect the combined 
results of the pooled businesses. Supplemental disclosure of the 
separate results of the combined

[[Page 240]]

entities for periods prior to the combination shall be given, with 
appropriate comments or comparisons between the separate and 
consolidated results.
    (5) If a material business combination accounted for as a purchase 
has occurred during the current fiscal year, pro forma disclosure shall 
be made of the results of operations for the current year up to the date 
of the most recent interim balance sheet provided (and for the 
corresponding period in the preceding year) as though the companies had 
combined at the beginning of that period. This pro forma information 
shall, at a minimum, show:
    (i) Total operating income.
    (ii) Income before securities gains (losses), extraordinary items, 
and the cumulative effect of accounting changes.
    (iii) Net income.
    (6) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by 
existing accounting pronouncements for accounting changes, the 
institution shall state the date of any material accounting change and 
the reasons for making it. In addition, a statement from the persons who 
verify the institution's financial statements shall be included as an 
exhibit, indicating whether or not the change is to an alternative 
principle which in their judgment is preferable under the circumstances, 
except that no such statement need be filed when the change is made in 
response to a standard adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board which requires such change.
    (7) Any material retroactive prior period adjustment made during any 
period covered by the interim financial statements shall be disclosed, 
together with its effect upon net income and upon the balance of 
undivided profits for any prior period included. If results of 
operations for any period presented have been adjusted retroactively by 
such an item subsequent to the initial reporting of such period, similar 
disclosure of the effect of the change shall be made.
    (8) The interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all 
adjustments that are, necessary to a fair statement of the results for 
the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be 
included. Furnish any material information necessary to make the 
information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the 
results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to 
be expected for the year.
    (c) Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and 
results of operations. Discuss material changes, if any, to the 
information provided to shareholders pursuant to Sec. 620.5(g) that 
have occurred during the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) 
of this section. Such additional information as is needed to enable the 
reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results of 
operations between the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of 
this section shall be provided.
    (1) Material changes in financial condition. Discuss any material 
changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year 
to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided. If the 
interim financial statements include an interim balance sheet as of the 
corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year, any material 
changes in financial conditions from that date to the date of the most 
recent interim balance sheet provided also shall be discussed. If 
discussions of changes from both the end and the corresponding interim 
date of the preceding fiscal year are required, the discussions may be 
combined at the discretion of the institution.
    (2) Material changes in results of operations. Discuss any material 
changes in the institution's results of operations with respect to the 
most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which an income statement is 
provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding 
fiscal year. Such discussion also shall cover material changes with 
respect to that fiscal quarter and the corresponding fiscal quarter in 
the preceding fiscal year. In addition, if the institution has elected 
to provide an income statement for the 12-month period ended as of the 
date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided, the discussion 
also shall cover material changes with respect to that 12-month period 
and the 12-month period ended as of the corresponding interim balance 
sheet date of the preceding fiscal year.

[[Page 241]]

    (d) Financial statements. The following financial statements must be 
provided:
    (1) An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal 
quarter and as of the end of the preceding fiscal year. A balance sheet 
for the comparable quarter of the preceding fiscal year is optional.
    (2) Interim statements of income for the most recent fiscal quarter, 
for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end 
of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable periods for 
the previous fiscal year.
    (3) Interim statements of changes in protected borrower capital and 
at-risk capital for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal 
year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the 
comparable period for the preceding fiscal year.
    (4) For banks, interim statements of cash flows for the period 
between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most 
recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable period for the preceding 
fiscal year. For associations, interim statements of cash flows are 
optional.
    (5) State that the financial statements were prepared under the 
oversight of the audit committee.
    (e) Review by independent public accountant. The interim financial 
information need not be audited or reviewed by an independent public 
accountant prior to filing. If, however, a review of the data is made in 
accordance with the established professional standards and procedures 
for such a review, the institution may state that the independent 
accountant has performed such a review under the supervision of the 
institution's audit committee. If such a statement is made, the report 
of the independent accountant on such review must accompany the interim 
financial information.
    (f) If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by 
this subpart with respect to any item is not material, it need not be 
separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted.

required by Sec. 620.5 (j) and (k) shall be made with respect to such 
transactions or events in the annual information statement. If any 
material change in the matters disclosed in the annual report to 
shareholders pursuant to Sec. 620.5 (j) and (k) has occurred since the 
annual report to shareholders was prepared, disclosure

[[Page 243]]

shall be made of such change in the annual information statement.
    (d) Nominees. (1) For each nominee, state the nominee's name, city 
and state of residence, business address if any, age, and business 
experience during the last 5 years, including each nominee's principal 
occupation and employment during the last 5 years. List all business 
interests on whose board of directors the nominee serves or is otherwise 
employed in a position of authority, and state the principal business in 
which the business interest is engaged. Identify any family relationship 
of the nominee that would be reportable under part 612 of this chapter 
if elected to the institution's board.
    (2) If fewer than two nominees for each position are named, describe 
the efforts of the nominating committee to locate two willing nominees.
    (3) If association directors are nominated or elected by region, 
describe the regions and state the number of voting shareholders 
entitled to vote in each region.
    (4) State whether nominations will be accepted from the floor. 
Associations must accept floor nominations. Any director nominee from 
the floor must be an eligible candidate for the director position for 
which the person has been nominated.
    (i) For association directors not elected by region:
    (A) If the annual meeting is to be held in more than one session and 
paper mail or electronic mail balloting will be conducted upon the 
conclusion of all sessions, state that nominations from the floor may be 
made at any session or, if the association's bylaws so provide, state 
that nominations from the floor shall be accepted only at the first 
session.
    (B) If shareholders will not vote solely by paper mail or electronic 
mail ballot upon conclusion of all sessions, state that nominations from 
the floor may be made only at the first session.
    (ii) For association directors elected by region:
    (A) If more than one session of an annual meeting is held in a 
region, and if paper mail or electronic mail balloting will be conducted 
at the end of all sessions in a region, state that nominations from the 
floor may be made at any session in the region or, if the association's 
bylaws so provide, state that nominations from the floor shall be 
accepted only at the first session held in the region.
    (B) If shareholders will not vote solely by paper mail or electronic 
mail ballot upon conclusion of all sessions in a region, state that 
nominations from the floor may be made only at the first session held in 
the region.
    (5) For each nominee who is not an incumbent director, except a 
nominee from the floor, provide the information referred to in Sec. 
620.5(j) and (k) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If shareholders 
will vote by paper mail or electronic mail ballot upon conclusion of all 
sessions, each floor nominee must provide the information referred to in 
Sec. 620.5(j) and (k) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section in paper or 
electronic form to the Farm Credit institution within the time period 
prescribed by the institution's bylaws. If the institution's bylaws do 
not prescribe a time period, state that each floor nominee must provide 
the disclosure to the institution within 5 business days of the 
nomination. The institution must ensure that the information is provided 
to the voting shareholders by delivering the ballots for the election of 
directors in the same format as the comparable information contained in 
the information statement. If shareholders will not vote by paper mail 
or electronic mail ballot upon conclusion of all sessions, each floor 
nominee must provide the information referred to in Sec. 620.5(j) and 
(k) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section in paper or electronic form at 
the first session at which voting is held.
    (6) Each bank and association must adopt policies and procedures 
that assure a disclosure statement is prepared by each director 
candidate. No person may be a nominee for director who does not make the 
disclosures required by this subpart. Candidate disclosure information 
must be distributed or mailed with ballots or proxy ballots to all 
shareholders eligible to vote in the election. Institutions may either 
restate such information in a standard format or provide complete copies 
of candidate disclosure information.

Sec. 620.30  Audit committees.

    Each Farm Credit bank and association must establish and maintain an 
audit committee. An audit committee is established by adopting a written 
charter describing the committee's composition, authorities, and

audit committee. Each institution is responsible for providing monetary 
and nonmonetary resources to enable its audit committee to contract for 
external auditors, outside advisors, and ordinary administrative 
expenses. A two-thirds majority vote of the full board of directors is 
required to deny an audit committee's request for resources.
    (d) Duties. Each audit committee must report only to the board of 
directors. In its capacity as a committee of the board, the audit 
committee is responsible for the following:
    (1) Financial reports. Each audit committee must oversee 
management's preparation of the report to shareholders; review the 
impact of any significant accounting and auditing developments; review 
accounting policy changes relating to preparation of financial 
statements; and review annual and quarterly reports prior to release. 
After the audit committee reviews a financial policy, procedure, or 
report, it must record in its minutes its agreement or disagreement with 
the item(s) under review.
    (2) External auditors. The external auditor must report directly to 
the audit committee. Each audit committee must:
    (i) Determine the appointment, compensation, and retention of 
external auditors issuing audit reports of the institution;
    (ii) Review the external auditor's work;
    (iii) Give prior approval for any non-audit services performed by 
the external auditor, except the audit committee may not approve those 
non-

[[Page 245]]

audit services specifically prohibited by FCA regulation; and
    (iv) Comply with the auditor independence provisions of part 621 of 
this chapter.
    (3) Internal controls. Each audit committee must oversee the 
institution's system of internal controls relating to preparation of 
financial reports, including controls relating to the institution's 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any internal audit 
functions of the institution must also be subject to audit committee 
review and supervision.

compensation committee by adopting a written charter describing the 
committee's composition, authorities, and responsibilities in accordance 
with this section. All compensation committees will be required to 
maintain records of meetings, including attendance, for at least 3 
fiscal years.
    (a) Composition. Each compensation committee must consist of at 
least three members. Each committee member must be a member of the

board of directors. In its capacity as a committee of the board, the 
compensation committee is responsible for reviewing the compensation 
policies and plans for senior officers and employees. Each compensation

                    Subpart A_Purpose and Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 621.1  Purpose and applicability.

    This part sets forth accounting and reporting requirements to be 
followed by all banks, associations, and service organizations chartered 
under the Act; the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation; and, 
where specifically indicated, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage 
Corporation. The requirements set forth in this part are of both general 
and specific applicability. Certain requirements focus on areas of

[[Page 246]]

financial condition and operating performance that are of special 
importance for generating, presenting, and disclosing accurate and 
reliable information.


<R05>
Sec. 621.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    (a) Accrual basis of accounting means the accounting method in which 
expenses are recorded when incurred, whether paid or unpaid, and income 
is reported when earned, whether received or not received.
    (b) Borrowing entity means the individual(s), partnership, joint 
venture, trust, corporation, or other business entity, or any 
combination thereof, that is primarily obligated on the loan instrument.
    (c) Generally accepted accounting principles means that body of 
conventions, rules, and procedures necessary to define accepted 
accounting practices at a particular time, as promulgated by the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and other authoritative 
sources recognized as setting standards for the accounting profession in 
the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles include not 
only broad guidelines of general application but also detailed practices 
and procedures that constitute standards by which financial 
presentations are evaluated.
    (d) Generally accepted auditing standards means the standards and 
guidelines adopted by the Auditing Standards Board of the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to govern the overall 
quality of audit performance.
    (e) Institution means any bank, association, or service organization 
chartered under the Act; the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding 
Corporation, and where specifically noted, the Federal Agricultural 
Mortgage Corporation.
    (f) Loan means any extension of credit or lease that is recorded as 
an asset of a reporting institution, whether made directly or purchased 
from another lender. The term ``loan'' includes, but is not limited to:
    (1) Loans originated through direct negotiations between the 
reporting institution and a borrower;
    (2) Purchased loans or interests in loans, including participation 
interests, retained subordinated participation interests in loans sold, 
and interests in pools of subordinated participation interests that are 
held in lieu of retaining a subordinated participation interest in loans 
sold;
    (3) Contracts of sale; notes receivable; and
    (4) Other similar obligations and lease financing.
    (g) Material means the magnitude of an omission or misstatement of 
accounting information that, in light of surrounding circumstances, 
makes it probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on 
the information would have been changed or influenced by the omission or 
misstatement.
    (h) Net realizable value means the net amount the lender would 
expect to be realized from the acquisition and subsequent sale or 
disposition of a loan's underlying collateral. Generally, net realizable 
value is equal to the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less estimated costs of acquisition, completion, and disposal.
    (i) Recorded investment means the face amount of the loan increased 
or decreased by applicable accrued interest and unamortized premium, 
discount, finance charges, or acquisition costs, and may also reflect a 
previous direct write-down of the investment.

                         Subpart B_General Rules


<R05>
Sec. 621.3  Application of generally accepted accounting principles.

    Each institution shall:
    (a) Prepare and maintain, on an accrual basis, accurate and complete

<R05>
Sec. 621.4  Audit by qualified public accountant.

    (a) Each institution shall, at least annually, have its financial 
statements audited by a qualified public accountant in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards.
    (b) The qualified public accountant's opinion of each institution's 
financial statements must be included as a part of each annual report to 
shareholders. The accountant must comply with the auditor independence 
provisions of subpart E of this part.

public accountant required by paragraph (b) of this section, the 
following actions shall be taken immediately:
    (1) The institution shall prepare a brief but thorough written 
description of the scope and content of the disagreement, noting each 
point of disagreement and citing, in all cases, the specific provisions 
of generally accepted accounting principles and generally accepted 
auditing standards upon which the institution's position in the 
disagreement is based;
    (2) A copy of the institution's final description of the 
disagreement shall be given to the accountant who provided the opinion 
with which the institution disagrees;
    (3) The accountant shall have 10 business days to develop and 
provide a brief but thorough final response to the institution's 
description of the disagreement, including all items believed to be 
incorrect or incomplete, and citing, in all cases, the specific 
provisions of generally accepted accounting principles and generally 
accepted auditing standards upon which the accountant's position in the 
disagreement is based;
    (4) Both the institution's final description of the disagreement and 
the accountant's final response to it shall be included in the 
institution's annual report to shareholders directly following the 
accountant's opinion of the institution's financial statements; and
    (5) The institution shall immediately notify the Chief Examiner, 
Farm Credit Administration, of any disagreement with its accountant and 
shall furnish the Farm Credit Administration with the written 
documentation required by paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this 
section.
    (d) If an institution selects a qualified public accountant to audit 
its financial statements and provide an opinion thereon for its annual 
report who is different from the accountant whose opinion appeared in 
the institution's most recent annual report, the following items shall 
be sent to the Farm Credit Administration no later than 15 days after 
the end of the month in which the change took place and shall be 
included in the institution's annual meeting information statement and 
annual report to shareholders for the year in which the change of 
accountants took place:
    (1) The name and address of the accountant whose opinion appeared in 
the institution's most recent annual report to shareholders;
    (2) A brief but thorough statement of the reasons the accountant 
selected for the most recent annual report was not selected for the 
current annual report. If the change resulted from a disagreement with 
the accountant, the statement shall describe the institution's 
disagreement with the accountant's opinion and the accountant's final 
response to the institution's disagreement prepared pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (3) The identification of the highest ranking officer, committee of 
officers, or board of directors, as appropriate, that recommended, 
approved, or otherwise made the decision to change qualified public 
accountants.

<R05>
Sec. 621.5  Accounting for the allowance for loan losses and chargeoffs.

    Each institution shall:

[[Page 248]]

    (a) Maintain at all times an allowance for loan losses that is 
adequate to absorb all probable and estimable losses that may reasonably 
be expected to exist in the loan portfolio.
    (b) Develop, adopt, and consistently apply policies and procedures 
governing the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan 
losses which, at a minimum, conform to the rules, definitions, and 
standards set forth in this part and any other applicable requirements.
    (c) Charge-off loans, wholly or partially, as appropriate, at the 
time they are determined to be uncollectible.
    (d) Ensure that when an institution or the Farm Credit 
Administration determines that the value of a loan or other asset 
recorded on its books and records exceeds the amount that can reasonably 
be expected to be collectible, or when the documentation supporting the 
recorded asset value is inadequate, the institution shall immediately 
charge off the asset in the amount determined to be uncollectible. If 
the amount determined to be uncollectible by the institution is 
different from the amount determined to be uncollectible by the Farm 
Credit Administration, the institution shall charge off such amount as 
the Farm Credit Administration shall direct.


<R04>
           Subpart C_Loan Performance and Valuation Assessment


<R05>
Sec. 621.6  Performance categories and other property owned.

    Each institution shall employ the following practices with respect 
to categorizing high-risk loans and loan-related assets. No loan shall 
be put into more than one performance category. At a minimum, loans 
meeting the criteria for both nonaccrual and another performance 
category shall be classified as nonaccrual.
    (a) Nonaccrual loans. A loan shall be considered nonaccrual if it 
meets any of the following conditions:
    (1) Collection of any amount of outstanding principal and all past 
and future interest accruals, considered over the full term of the 
asset, is not expected;
    (2) Any portion of the loan has been charged off, except in cases 
where the prior chargeoff was taken as part of a formal restructuring of 
the loan; or
    (3) The loan is 90 days past due and is not both adequately secured 
and in process of collection.
    (i) A loan is considered adequately secured only if:
    (A) It is secured by real or personal property having a net 
realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in full; or
    (B) It is guaranteed by a financially responsible party in an amount 
sufficient to discharge the debt in full.
    (ii) A loan is considered in process of collection only if 
collection efforts are proceeding in due course and, based on a probable 
and specific event, are expected to result in the prompt repayment of 
the debt or its restoration to current status. There must be documented 
evidence that collection in full of amounts due and unpaid is expected 
to occur within a reasonable time period, not to exceed 180 days from 
the date that payment was due. The commencement of collection efforts 
through legal action, including bankruptcy or foreclosure, or through 
collection efforts not involving legal action, including ongoing 
workouts and reamortizations, do not, in and of themselves, provide 
sufficient cause to keep a loan out of nonaccrual status. If full 
collection of the debt or its restoration to current status is dependent 
upon completion of any action by the borrower, the institution must 
obtain the borrower's written agreement to complete all such actions by 
the specific dates set forth in agreement.
    (b) Formally restructured loans. A loan is considered formally 
restructured if it meets the ``troubled debt restructuring'' definition 
set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, 
Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings, as 
promulgated by the FASB.
    (c) Loans 90 days past due still accruing interest. (1) Loans 90 
days past due still accruing interest means loans that are 90 days or 
more contractually past due, and that are both adequately secured and in 
process of collection, as described in this section.
    (2) A loan shall be considered contractually past due when any 
principal

[[Page 249]]

repayment or interest payment required by the loan instrument is not 
received on or before the due date. A loan shall remain contractually 
past due until it is formally restructured or until the entire amount 
past due, including principal, accrued interest, and penalty interest 
incurred as the result of past due status, is collected or otherwise 
discharged in full.
    (d) Other property owned means any real or personal property, other 
than an interest-earning asset, that has been acquired as a result of 
full or partial liquidation of a loan, through foreclosure, deed in lieu 
of foreclosure, or other means.


<R05>
Sec. 621.7  Rule of aggregation.

    (a) When one loan to a borrower is placed in nonaccrual, an 
institution must immediately evaluate whether its other loans to that 
borrower, or related borrowers, should also be placed in nonaccrual. All 
loans on which a borrowing entity, or a component of a borrowing entity, 
is primarily obligated to the reporting institution shall be considered 
as one loan unless a review of all pertinent facts supports a reasonable 
determination that a particular loan constitutes an independent credit 
risk and such determination is adequately documented in the loan file.
    (1) A loan shall be considered an independent credit risk if a 
substantial portion of the loan is guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by a government agency.
    (2) Other loans shall be considered independent credit risks if and 
so long as:
    (i) The primary sources of repayment are independent for each loan;
    (ii) The loans are not cross-collateralized; and
    (iii) The principal obligors are different person(s) and/or 
entity(ies). Related loans will not be considered independent credit 
risks if the operations of a related borrower are so financially 
interdependent with the borrower's operations that the economic survival 
of one will materially affect the economic survival of the other, 
determined in accordance with Sec. 614.4359(a)(2) of this chapter.
    (b) If the evaluation required by paragraph (a) of this section 
results in a determination that the borrower's other loans with the 
institution do not represent an independent credit risk, and full 
collection of such loans is not expected, then all of the borrower's 
loans must be aggregated and classified as nonaccrual. If such other 
loans represent an independent credit risk and are fully collectible, 
then they may remain in their current performance category.
    (c) When an institution becomes aware that a borrower has a loan 
that has been classified nonaccrual by any other lender, the institution 
must re-evaluate the credit risk in its loan to the borrower and then 
determine whether an independent credit risk exists.

[58 FR 48786, Sept. 20, 1993, as amended at 64 FR 34519, June 28, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 621.8  Application of payments and income recognition on nonaccrual loans.

    Each institution shall employ the following practices with respect 
to application of cash payments on nonaccrual loans:
    (a) If the ultimate collectibility of the recorded investment, in 
whole or in part, is in doubt, any payment received on such loan shall 
be applied to reduce the recorded investment to the extent necessary to 
eliminate such doubt.
    (b) Once the ultimate collectibility of the recorded investment is 
no longer in doubt, payments received in cash on such loan may qualify 
for recognition as interest income if all of the following 
characteristics are met at the time the payment is received:
    (1) The loan does not have a remaining unrecovered prior chargeoff 
associated with it, except in cases where the prior chargeoff was taken 
as part of a formal restructuring of the loan;
    (2) The payment received has come from a source of repayment 
detailed in the plan of collection;
    (3) The loan, after considering the payment, is not contractually 
past due more than 90 days and is not expected to become 90 days past 
due, or a repayment pattern has been established that reasonably 
demonstrates future repayment capacity.
    (c) The institution shall employ the following practices with 
respect to

[[Page 250]]

earned but uncollected interest income on loans, leases, contracts, and 
similar assets that are determined not to be fully collectible:
    (1) Earned but uncollected interest income that was accrued in the 
current fiscal year and is determined to be uncollectible shall be 
reversed from interest income; and
    (2) Earned but uncollected interest income that was accrued in prior 
fiscal years and is determined to be uncollectible shall be charged off 
against the allowance for loan losses.


<R05>
Sec. 621.9  Reinstatement to accrual status.

    A loan may be reinstated to accrual status, when each of the 
following criteria are met:
    (a) All contractual principal and interest due on the loan is paid 
and the loan is current;
    (b) Prior chargeoffs are recovered, except for troubled debt 
restructures;
    (c) No reasonable doubt remains regarding the willingness and 
ability of the borrower to perform in accordance with the contractual 
terms of the loan agreement; and
    (d) Reinstatement is supported by a period of sustained performance 
in accordance with the contractual terms of the note and/or loan 
agreement. Sustained performance will generally be demonstrated by 6 
consecutive monthly payments, 4 consecutive quarterly payments, 3 
consecutive semi-annual payments, or 2 consecutive annual payments.


<R05>
Sec. 621.10  Monitoring of performance categories and other property owned.

    (a) Each institution shall:
    (1) Account for, report, and disclose to shareholders, investors, 
boards of directors, and the Farm Credit Administration all material 
items with respect to performance categories and other property owned in 
accordance with the rules and definitions set forth in this part and any 
other applicable requirements;
    (2) In accordance with Sec. 620.5(g)(1)(iv)(A) of this chapter, 
disclose to shareholders, investors, boards of directors, and the Farm 
Credit Administration the nature and extent of significant potential 
credit risks within the loan portfolio, or other information that could 
adversely impact performance of the loan portfolio in the near future;
    (3) Develop, adopt, and consistently apply policies and procedures 
governing performance categories and other property owned, which, at a

this part and such other requirements and procedures as may be required 
by the Farm Credit Administration;
    (4) Review the loan portfolio at least quarterly to ensure that all 
high-risk loans have been assigned the appropriate performance category; 
and
    (5) Review all high-risk loans in the loan portfolio at least 
quarterly to determine the collectibility of accrued but uncollected 
income, if any.
    (b) Measures taken to enhance the collectibility of a loan shall not 
be deemed to relieve an institution of the requirement to monitor and 
evaluate the loan for the purpose of determining its performance status.

    Source: 71 FR 76120, Dec. 20, 2006, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 621.30  General.

    Each Farm Credit institution must ensure the independence of all 
qualified public accountants conducting the institution's audit by 
establishing and maintaining policies and procedures governing the 
engagement of external auditors. The policies and procedures must 
incorporate the provisions of this subpart and Sec. 612.2260 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 621.31  Non-audit services.

financial statements.
    (a) A qualified public accountant engaged to conduct a Farm Credit 
institution's audit may not perform the following non-audit services for 
that institution:
    (1) Bookkeeping,
    (2) Financial information systems design,
    (3) Appraisal and valuation services,
    (4) Actuarial services,
    (5) Internal audit outsourcing services,
    (6) Management or human resources functions,

or administrative investigations and proceedings unrelated to external 
audit work.
    (b) A qualified public accountant engaged to conduct a Farm Credit

prohibited in this section, if the institution's audit committee pre-
approves the services and the services are fully disclosed in the annual 
report.


<R05>
Sec. 621.32  Conflicts of interest and rotation.

    (a) Conflicts of interest. (1) A Farm Credit institution may not 
engage a qualified public accountant to conduct the institution's audit

<R04>
              Subpart A_Rules Applicable to Formal Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 622.1  Scope of regulations.

    This subpart prescribes rules of practice and procedure in 
connection with any formal hearing before the Farm Credit Administration 
(FCA) that is required by the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (Act) 
or is ordered for other reasons by the FCA. In connection with any 
particular matter, reference should also be made to any special 
requirements of practice and procedure that may be contained in 
applicable provisions of the Act or the rules adopted by the FCA in 
subpart B of this part, which special requirements are controlling. The 
rules in subpart A do not apply to the informal hearings described in 
subpart C of this part, to any other informal hearing that may

[[Page 253]]

be ordered by the FCA, or to formal investigations described in subpart 
D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 622.2  Definitions.

    (a) Act means the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended. 12 U.S.C.

[51 FR 21139, June 11, 1986, as amended at 53 FR 27284, July 19, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 622.3  Appearance and practice.

    (a) Appearance before the Board or a presiding officer--(1) By 
nonattorneys. An individual may appear in his or her own behalf; a 
member of a partnership may represent the partnership; a duly authorized 
officer or other agent of a corporation, trust association or other 
entity not specifically listed herein may represent the corporation, 
trust association, or other entity; and a duly authorized officer or 
employee of any government unit, agency or authority may represent that 
unit, agency or authority. Any person appearing in a representative 
capacity shall file a written notice of appearance with the Board which 
shall contain evidence of his or her authority to act in such capacity.
    (2) By attorneys. A party may be represented by an attorney who is a 
member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any State, 
possession, territory, Commonwealth or the District of Columbia, and who 
has not been suspended or debarred from practice before the FCA in 
accordance with the provisions of part 623 of this chapter. Prior to 
appearing, an attorney representing a person in a proceeding shall file 
a written notice of appearance with the Board, which shall contain a 
declaration that he or she is currently qualified as provided by 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and is authorized to represent the 
party on whose behalf he or she acts.
    (3) Representation of multiple interests. A person shall not 
represent more than one party without informing each party of any actual 
or potential conflict of interest that may be involved in such 
representation. Such person shall file a statement with the Board 
indicating that such disclosure has been made. The presiding officer has 
authority to take protective measures at any stage of a proceeding, 
including the authority to prohibit multiple representation when deemed 
appropriate.
    (b) Summary suspension. Dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, 
contemptuous, contumacious, or other unethical or improper conduct at 
any proceeding before the Board or a presiding officer shall be grounds 
for exclusion therefrom and suspension for the duration of the 
proceeding, or other appropriate action by the Board or presiding 
officer.


<R05>
Sec. 622.4  Commencement of proceedings.

    Proceedings under this subpart are commenced by the issuance of a 
notice by the Board. Such notice shall state the time, place, and nature 
of the hearing, the name and address of the presiding officer if one has 
been designated, and a statement of the matters of fact and law 
constituting the grounds for the hearing. The matters of fact and law 
alleged in a notice may be amended by the Board at any stage of the 
proceeding and such amended notice may require an answer from the

[[Page 254]]

party or parties served and may set a new hearing date. A copy of any 
notice served by the FCA on any System association, director, officer or 
other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the 
association will also be sent to the supervisory bank.


<R05>
Sec. 622.5  Answer.

    (a) Answer is required. Unless a different period is specified by 
the Board, a party who does not wish to consent to a final order must 
file an answer within 20 days after being served with a notice that 
commences the proceeding. Any subsequent notice which contains amended 
allegations and by its terms requires an answer must similarly be 
answered within 20 days after service.
    (b) Requirements of answer; effect of failure to deny. An answer 
filed under this section shall concisely state any defenses and 
specifically admit or deny each allegation in the notice. A party who 
lacks information or knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the 
truth of any particular allegation shall so state and this shall have 
the effect of a denial. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed to be 
admitted. A party who intends in good faith to deny only a part of or to 
qualify an allegation shall specify so much of it as is true and shall 
deny only the remainder.
    (c) Admitted allegations. If a party filing an answer under this 
section elects not to contest any of the allegations of fact set forth 
in the notice, the answer shall consist of a statement admitting all of 
the allegations to be true. Such answer constitutes a waiver of hearing 
as to the facts alleged in the notice, and together with the notice will 
provide a record basis on which the presiding officer shall file with 
the Board a recommended decision in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 557. The 
recommended decision shall be served on the party, who may file 
exceptions thereto within the time provided in Sec. 622.13.
    (d) Effect of failure to answer. Failure of a party to file an 
answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a 
waiver of the party's right to appear and contest the allegations in the 
notice and authorizes the presiding officer, without further notice to 
the party, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice and to file 
with the Board a recommended decision containing such findings and 
appropriate conclusions. The Board or the presiding officer may, for 
good cause shown, permit the filing of a delayed answer after the time 
for filing and the answer has expired.


<R05>
Sec. 622.6  Opportunity for informal settlement.

    Any interested party may at any time submit to the Board for 
consideration written offers or proposals for settlement of a 
proceeding, without prejudice to the rights of the parties. No offer or 
proposal shall be admissible into evidence over the objection of any 
party in any hearing in connection with such proceeding. The foregoing 
provisions of this section shall not preclude settlement of any 
proceeding through the regular adjudicatory process by the filing of an 
answer as provided in Sec. 622.5(c), or by submission of the case to 
the presiding officer on a stipulation of facts and an agreed order.


<R05>
Sec. 622.7  Conduct of hearings.

    (a) Authority of presiding officer. All hearings governed by this 
subpart shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 
5 of title 5 of the United States Code. The presiding officer designated 
by the Board to preside at any such hearing shall have complete charge 
of the hearing, shall have the duty to conduct it in a fair and 
impartial manner and shall take all necessary action to avoid delay in 
the disposition of the proceeding. Such officer shall have all powers 
necessary to that end, including the following:
    (1) To administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) To issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, as authorized by 
law, and to revoke, quash, or modify any such subpoena;
    (3) To receive relevant evidence and to rule upon the admission of 
evidence and offers of proof;
    (4) To take or cause depositions to be taken;
    (5) To regulate the course of the hearing and the conduct of the 
parties and their counsel;

[[Page 255]]

    (6) To hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of 
issues or for any proper purpose; and
    (7) To consider and rule upon, as justice may require, all 
procedural and other motions appropriate in a proceeding under this 
subpart, except that a presiding officer shall not have power to decide 
any motion to dismiss the proceeding or other motion which results in a 
final determination of the merits of the proceeding. This power rests 
only with the Board. Without limitation on the foregoing, the presiding 
officer shall, subject to the provisions of this subpart, have all the 
authority set forth in 5 U.S.C. 556(c).
    (b) Prehearing conference. The presiding officer may, on his or her 
own initiative or at the request of any party, direct counsel for all 
parties to meet with him or her at a specified time and place prior to 
the hearing, or to submit suggestions to him or her in writing, for the 
purpose of considering any or all of the following:
    (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
    (2) Stipulations, admissions of fact and of the contents and 
authenticity of documents;
    (3) Matters of which official notice will be taken; and
    (4) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly disposition of the 
proceeding.

At the conclusion of such conference(s) the presiding officer shall 
enter an order which recites the results of the conference. Such order 
shall include the presiding officer's rulings upon matters considered at 
the conference, together with appropriate directions, if any, to the 
parties. Such order shall control the subsequent course of the 
proceeding, unless modified at the hearing for good cause shown.
    (c) Exchange of information. Thirty (30) days prior to the hearing, 
parties shall exchange a list of the names of witnesses with a general 
description of their expected testimony, and a list and one copy of all 
documents or other physical exhibits which will be introduced in 
evidence in the course of the proceeding.
    (d) Attendance at hearings. All hearings shall be private and shall 
be attended only by the parties, their counsel or authorized 
representatives, witnesses while testifying, and other persons having an 
official interest in the proceeding. However, if the Board, in its 
discretion, after fully considering the views of the party afforded the 
hearing, determines that a public hearing is necessary to protect the 
public interest, the Board may in its sole discretion order that the 
hearing be public.
    (e) Transcript of testimony. Hearings shall be recorded. A copy of 
the transcript of the testimony taken at any hearing, duly certified by 
the reporter, together with all exhibits accepted into evidence shall be 
filed with the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall promptly 
serve notice upon all parties of such filing. The parties shall make 
their own arrangements with the person recording the testimony for 
copies of the testimony and exhibits. The presiding officer shall have 
authority to correct the record sua sponte with notice to all parties 
and to rule upon motions to correct the record. In the event the hearing 
is public, transcripts will be furnished to interested persons upon 
payment of the cost thereof.
    (f) Continuances and changes or extensions of time and changes of 
place of hearing. Except as otherwise provided by law, the presiding 
officer may extend time limits prescribed by these rules or by any 
notice or order issued in the proceedings, may change the time for 
beginning any hearing, continue or adjourn a hearing from time to time, 
and/or change the location of the hearing. Prior to the appointment of a 
presiding officer and after the filing of a recommended decision 
pursuant to Sec. 622.12, the Board may grant such extensions or 
changes. Subject to the approval of the presiding officer, the parties 
may by stipulation change the time limits specified by these rules or 
any notice or order issued hereunder.
    (g) Closing of hearing. The record of the hearing shall be closed by 
an announcement to that effect by the presiding officer when the taking 
of evidence has been concluded. In the discretion of the presiding 
officer, the record may be closed as of a future date in order to permit 
the admission into the record, under circumstances

[[Page 256]]

determined by the presiding officer, of exhibits to be prepared.
    (h) Call for further evidence, oral arguments, briefs, reopening of 
hearing. The presiding officer may call for the production of further 
evidence upon any issue, may permit oral argument and submission of 
briefs at the hearing and, upon appropriate notice, may reopen any 
hearing at any time prior to the filing of his or her recommended 
decision. The Board may reopen the record at anytime permitted by law.
    (i) Order of procedure. The FCA shall open and close.
    (j) Ex parte communications. (1) No person shall make or knowingly 
cause to be made an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the 
proceeding to the presiding officer or anyone who is or may reasonably 
be expected to be involved in the decisional process.
    (2) No person who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in 
the decisional process shall make or knowingly cause to be made an ex 
parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding to any 
person.
    (3) Except as authorized by law, the presiding officer shall not 
consult anyone on any fact in issue, unless upon notice and opportunity 
for all parties to participate. The presiding officer shall not be 
responsible to, or subject to the supervision or direction of, any 
officer, employee, or agent of the FCA engaged in the performance of 
investigative or prosecuting functions. An officer, employee or agent 
engaged in the performance of such functions in any case shall not, in 
that case or a factually related case, participate or advise in the 
decision of the presiding officer, except as a witness or counsel in the 
proceedings, or as otherwise authorized by law.
    (4) If an ex parte communication is made or knowingly caused to be 
made, all such communications, and any responses, shall be placed in the 
record.
    (5) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or caused to be 
made in violation of paragraph (j) of this section, the responsible 
party may be required to show cause why such party's claim or interest 
should not be dismissed, denied, or otherwise adversely affected. To the 
extent consistent with the interests of justice, a knowing violation of 
paragraph (j) of this section may be grounds for a decision adverse to a 
party in violation.
    (6) The prohibitions against ex parte communications apply from the 
time a proceeding is noticed for hearing. However, when the person 
responsible for the communication has knowledge that the proceeding will 
be noticed, the prohibitions apply from the time such knowledge is 
acquired.


<R05>
Sec. 622.8  Rules of evidence.

    (a) Evidence. Every party shall have the right to present a case or 
defense by oral and documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, 
and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and 
true disclosure of the facts. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly 
repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
    (b) Objections. Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence 
shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon but 
no argument thereon shall be permitted, except as ordered, allowed, or 
requested by the presiding officer. Rulings on such objections and all 
other matters shall be part of the transcript. Failure to object timely 
to the admission or exclusion of evidence or to any ruling constitutes a 
waiver of such objection.
    (c) Stipulations. Independently of the orders or rulings issued as 
provided by Sec. 622.7(b), the parties may stipulate as to any relevant 
matters of fact or the authenticity of any relevant documents. Such 
stipulations may be received in evidence at the hearing, and when so 
received shall be binding on the parties with respect to the matters 
therein stipulated.
    (d) Official notice. All matters officially noticed by the presiding 
officer shall appear on the record.


<R05>
Sec. 622.9  Subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. The presiding officer or, in the event he or she is 
unavailable, the Board may issue subpoenas and subpoena duces tecum at 
the request of any party requiring the attendance of witnesses or the 
production of documents at a designated place. The person seeking the 
subpoena may be required, as a condition precedent to the

[[Page 257]]

issuance of the subpoena, to show the general relevance and reasonable 
scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. Where it appears to the 
presiding officer that a subpoena may be unreasonable, oppressive, 
excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or delay the proceeding, the 
presiding officer has discretion to refuse to issue a subpoena or to 
issue it only upon such conditions as fairness requires.
    (b) Motions to quash. Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, 
prior to the time specified therein for compliance but in no event more 
than 10 days after the date the subpoena was served, with notice to the 
party requesting the subpoena, apply to the presiding officer, or in the 
event he or she is unavailable to the Board, to quash or modify the 
subpoena, accompanying such application with a brief statement of the 
reasons therefor. The presiding officer may deny the application or, 
upon notice to the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued and 
after affording that party an opportunity to reply, may quash or modify 
the subpoena or impose reasonable conditions including, in the case of a 
subpoena duces tecum, a requirement that the party on whose behalf the 
subpoena was issued pay in advance the reasonable cost of copying and 
transporting the documentary evidence to the designated place.
    (c) Service of subpoena. A subpoena may be served upon the person 
named therein by personal service or certified mail with a return 
receipt to the last known address of the person. The fees for one day's 
attendance and mileage as specified in paragraph (d) of this section 
must be tendered at the time of service unless the subpoena is issued on 
behalf of the FCA. If personal service is made by a U.S. marshal, a 
deputy U.S. marshal, or an employee of the FCA, such service shall be 
evidenced by the return thereon. If personal service is made by any 
other person, such person shall sign an affidavit describing the manner 
in which service is made, and return such affidavit with a copy of the 
subpoena. In case of failure to make service, reasons for the failure 
shall be stated on the original subpoena. The original or a copy of the 
subpoena, bearing or accompanied by the required return, affidavit, 
statement or return receipt, shall be returned without delay to the 
presiding officer.
    (d) Attendance of witnesses. The attendance of witnesses at a 
designated place may be required from any place in any State or 
territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Witnesses 
who are subpoenaed shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid 
witnesses in the district courts of the United States. Fees required by 
this paragraph shall be paid by the party upon whose application the 
subpoena is issued.
    (e) Production of documents. The production of documents at a 
designated place may be required from any place in any State or 
territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. In lieu of 
an original document, a certified or authenticated copy may be produced. 
However, any party has the right to inspect the original document.


<R05>
Sec. 622.10  Depositions.

    (a) Application to take deposition. Any party desiring to take the 
deposition of any person shall make written application to the presiding 
officer setting forth the name and address of the witness, the subject 
matter concerning which the witness is expected to testify, its 
relevance, the time and place of the deposition, and the reasons why 
such deposition should be taken. The application may include a request 
that specified documents be produced at the deposition. A copy of the 
application shall be served on the other parties at the same time the 
application is filed with the presiding officer.
    (b) Subpoena; notice to other parties. Upon a showing that the 
testimony or other evidence sought will be material, and the taking of 
the deposition will not result in any undue burden to the witness or any 
party or undue delay of the proceedings, the presiding officer may issue 
a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum. Notice of the issuance of such 
subpoena shall be served upon all parties at least 10 days in advance of 
the date set for deposition.
    (c) Deposition by notice. The requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section may be waived by agreement of the parties and the 
witness whose testimony or documentary evidence is

[[Page 258]]

sought. Such agreement shall be embodied in a stipulation which becomes 
part of the record and may provide for the taking of depositions upon 
notice without leave of the presiding officer.
    (d) Procedure on deposition. Depositions may be taken before any 
person having the power to administer oaths. Each witness whose 
testimony is taken by deposition shall be duly sworn before any question 
is propounded. Examination and cross-examination of deponents may 
proceed as permitted at the hearing. Objections to questions or 
documents shall be in short form, stating the grounds relief upon for 
the objection. Failure to object to questions or evidence is deemed a 
waiver if the ground of the objection is one which might have been 
obviated or removed if presented at that time. The questions propounded 
and the answers thereto, together with all objections made (but not 
including argument or debate) shall be recorded by or under the 
direction of the person before whom the deposition is taken. The 
deposition shall be signed by the witness, unless the parties by 
stipulation waive the signing or the witness is physically unable to 
sign, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. The deposition shall also be 
certified as a true and complete transcript by the person recording the 
testimony. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the person 
recording the testimony shall state this fact and the reason therefor on 
the record. The person before whom the deposition is taken shall 
promptly file the transcript and all exhibits with the presiding 
officer. Interested parties shall make their own arrangements with the 
person recording the testimony for copies of the testimony and exhibits.
    (e) Introduction as evidence. Subject to appropriate rulings by the 
presiding officer on such objections and answers as were noted at the 
time the deposition was taken or as would be valid were the witness 
personally present and testifying at the hearing, the deposition or any 
part thereof may be received in evidence by the presiding officer in his 
or her discretion. Only such part of a deposition as is received in 
evidence at a hearing shall constitute a part of the record upon which a 
decision may be based.
    (f) Payment of fees. Deponents whose depositions are taken and the 
reporter taking the same shall be entitled to the same fees as are paid 
for like services in the district courts of the United States, which 
fees shall be paid by the party upon whose application the deposition is 
taken.


<R05>

should be referred to the Board. Prior to the appointment of a presiding 
officer and after a recommended decision is filed pursuant to Sec. 
622.12, the Board shall rule on motions filed by the parties.
    (e) Appeal from rulings on motions. All answers, motions, objections 
and rulings shall become part of the record. Rulings of a presiding 
officer on any motion may not be appealed to the Board prior to its 
consideration of the presiding officer's recommended decision, except by 
special permission of the Board. However, such rulings shall be 
considered by the Board in reviewing the record. Requests to the Board 
for special permission to appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer 
shall be

one or more of its members has presided at the reception of evidence,

    (2) The amount of the civil money penalty being assessed;
    (3) The date by which the civil money penalty must be paid;

    (b) Service. The notice of assessment may be served upon the 
institution or person being assessed by personal service or by certified

[[Page 262]]

receipt to the institution's or the person's last known address. Such 
service constitutes issuance of the notice.

<R05>
Sec. 622.56  Request for formal hearing on assessment.

    An institution or person being assessed may request a formal hearing

be filed in writing, within 10 days of the issuance of the notice of 
assessment, with the Chairman of the Board, FCA, 1501 Farm Credit Drive, 
McLean, VA 22102-5090.


<R05>
Sec. 622.57  Waiver of hearing; consent.

    (a) Waiver. Failure to request a hearing pursuant to Sec. 622.56 
constitutes a waiver of the opportunity for a hearing and the notice of 
assessment issued pursuant to Sec. 622.55 will constitute a final and 
unappealable order.
    (b) Consent. Any party afforded a hearing who does not appear at the 
hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative is deemed to 
have consented to the issuance of an assessment order.

[51 FR 21139, June 11, 1986, as amended at 70 FR 12585, Mar. 15, 2005]


<R05>

    (a) Time and place. An institution or person requesting a hearing 
will be informed by order of the Board of the time and place set for 
hearing.

institution or person requesting the hearing to file an answer as 
prescribed in Sec. 622.5 of subpart A. The procedures of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) and subpart A of these 
rules will apply to the hearing.

[51 FR 21139, June 11, 1986, as amended at 70 FR 12585, Mar. 15, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 622.59  Assessment order.

    (a) Consent. In the event of consent of the parties concerned to an 
assessment, or if, upon the record made at a hearing ordered under this 
subpart, the Board finds that the grounds for having assessed the 
penalty have been established, the Board may issue an order of 
assessment of civil money penalty. In its assessment order, the Board 
may reduce the amount of the penalty specified in the notice of 
assessment.
    (b) Effective date and period. An assessment order is effective 
immediately upon issuance, or upon such other date as may be specified 
therein, and will remain effective and enforceable unless it is stayed, 
modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the board or a reviewing 
court.
    (c) Service. An assessment order may be served by personal service 
or by certified mail with a return receipt to the last known address of 
the institution or person being assessed. Such service constitutes 
issuance of the order.

<R05>
Sec. 622.60  Payment of civil money penalty.

    (a) Payment date. Generally, the date designated in the notice of 
assessment for payment of the civil money penalty will be 60 days from 
the issuance of the notice. If, however, the Board finds, in a specific 
case, that the purposes of the relevant statutes would be better served 
if the 60-day period were changed, the Board may shorten or lengthen the 
period or make the civil money penalty payable immediately upon receipt 
of the notice of assessment. If a timely request for a formal hearing to 
challenge an assessment of a civil money penalty is filed, payment of 
the penalty will not be required unless and until the Board issues a 
final order of assessment following the hearing. If an assessment order 
is issued, it will specify the date by which the civil money penalty is 
to be paid or collected.
    (b) Method of payment. Checks in payment of civil money penalties 
must be made payable to the ``Farm Credit Administration.'' Upon 
collection, the FCA will forward payment for penalties described in 
Sec. 622.52(a) and (b) to the United States Department of Treasury. The 
FCA will forward payment for penalties described in Sec. 622.52(c) to 
the National Flood Mitigation Fund as required by 42 U.S.C. 4012a(f)(8).

designated FCA representative may ask questions of any witness.
    (e) Transcripts. Oral testimony, if any, and oral argument shall be 
recorded. A copy of the transcript shall be filed with the designated 
FCA representative, who shall have authority to correct the record sua 
sponte upon notice, or upon the motion of the petitioner or the 
representative of the FCA's Office of General Counsel. The designated 
FCA representative shall promptly serve notice upon the petitioner and 
the FCA's Office of General Counsel of such filing. Such parties shall 
make arrangements with the person recording the testimony or argument 
for copies of the transcript.
    (f) Closing of record. Upon the request of the petitioner or 
representative of the FCA's Office of General Counsel, the record shall 
remain open for a period of 5 business days following the hearing, 
during which time additional submissions for the record may be made. 
Thereafter, the record shall be closed.
    (g) Rules of evidence and procedure. Neither the formal rules of

informal hearing ordered under this subpart unless the Board orders that 
they apply in whole or in part.


<R05>
Sec. 622.81  Default.

    If the subject individual fails to file a petition for a hearing, or 
fails to appear at a hearing, either in person or by an attorney, or 
fails to submit a written argument where oral argument has been waived, 
the notice shall remain in effect until the information, indictment, or 
complaint is finally disposed of and the order shall remain in effect 
until terminated by the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 622.82  Decision of the Board.

designated FCA representative shall make a recommendation with findings 
and conclusions to the Board concerning the notice or order of

notify the subject individual and the FCA's Office of General Counsel 
whether the suspension or removal from office, or prohibition from 
participation in any manner in the affairs of the institution, will be 
continued, terminated, or otherwise modified. The Board's final 
decision, if adverse to the individual, shall contain a statement of the 
basis thereof. The

[[Page 265]]

Board may satisfy this requirement where it adopts the recommended 
decision of the designated FCA representative.
    (c) Guilt not an issue. In deciding upon any suspension of 
prohibition by notice, the ultimate question of the guilt or innocence 
of the individual with respect to the criminal charge that is 
outstanding will not be considered. A finding of not guilty or other 
disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Board from thereafter 
instituting removal proceedings pursuant to section 5.28 of the Act.
    (d) Effective period. A removal or prohibition by order remains in 
effect until terminated by the Board. A suspension or prohibition by 
notice remains in effect until the criminal charge is finally disposed 
of or until terminated by the Board.
    (e) Reconsideration. A suspended or removed individual may petition 
the Board to reconsider the decision any time after the expiration of a 
12-month period from the date of the decision, but no petition for 
reconsideration may be made within 12 months of a previous petition. A 
petition shall state with particularity the relief sought and the 
grounds therefor and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum and 
any other documentation the petitioner wishes to have considered. No 
hearing need be granted on the petition for reconsideration.

    The rules in this subpart apply to formal investigations initiated

enumerated in section 5.37 of the Act, to conduct examinations of System 
institutions.


<R05>
Sec. 622.103  Formal investigations are confidential.

    Information or documents obtained or testimony recorded in the 
course of a formal investigation shall be confidential and shall be 
disclosed only in accordance with the provisions of 12 CFR part 602.


<R05>
Sec. 622.104  Order to conduct formal investigation.

    A formal investigation begins with the issuance of an order by the 
Board. The order shall designate the person or persons who will conduct 
the investigation, issue, revoke, quash or modify subpoenas and 
subpoenas duces tecum, take or cause to be taken depositions, administer 
oaths, and receive affirmations as to any matter under investigation by 
the FCA. Upon application and for good cause shown, the Board may limit, 
modify, or withdraw the order at any stage of the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 622.105  Conduct of investigation.

    (a) Review of order. Any person who is compelled or requested to 
furnish testimony, documentary evidence, or other information with 
respect to any matter under formal investigation shall upon request be 
shown the order initiating such investigation.
    (b) Right to counsel. Any person who, in a formal investigation, is 
compelled to appear and testify or who appears and testifies by request 
or permission of the Board may be accompanied, represented, and advised 
by counsel. The right to be accompanied, represented, and advised by 
counsel shall mean the right of a person testifying to have an attorney 
present at all times while testifying and to have this attorney:
    (1) Advise such person before, during and after the conclusion of 
testimony;
    (2) Question such person briefly at the conclusion of testimony to 
clarify any of the answers given; and
    (3) Make summary notes during the testimony solely for the use of 
such person.

subpart.

[[Page 266]]

    (d) Exclusion. (1) Any person who has given or will give testimony, 
and counsel representing such person, may be excluded from the taking of 
testimony of any other witness in the discretion of the designated FCA 
representative conducting the investigation.
    (2) The designated FCA representative conducting the investigation 
shall report to the Board any instances where any person has been guilty 
of dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, contemptuous, contumacious or 
other unethical or improper conduct during the course of the proceeding 
or any other instance involving a violation of these rules. The Board 
may thereupon take such action as the circumstances may warrant, 
including exclusion of the offending individual or individual from 
participation in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 622.106  Service of subpoena and payment of witness fees.

    (a) Service. A subpoena may be served upon the person named therein 
by personal service or certified mail with a return receipt to the last 
known address of the person. Witnesses who are subpoenaed shall be paid 
the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the district courts 
of the United States. The fees and mileage need not be tendered at the 
time a subpoena is served.
    (b) Motions to quash. Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, 
prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event more 
than 5 days after the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the FCA 
representative authorized in the order, or if unavailable to the Board, 
to quash or modify such subpoena, accompanying such application with a 
brief statement of the reasons therefor. The FCA representative, or the 
Board, may:
    (1) Deny the application;
    (2) Quash or revoke the subpoena;
    (3) Modify the subpoena; or
    (4) Condition the granting of the application on such terms as the 
FCA representative or the Board, determines in his, her, or its 
discretion, to be just, reasonable, and proper.


<R05>
Sec. 622.107  Transcripts.

    Transcripts, if any, of an investigative proceeding shall be 
recorded by any means authorized by the designated FCA representative 
conducting the investigation. A person who has given testimony in an 
investigative proceeding (or counsel for such person) upon proper 
identification shall have the right to inspect the transcript of the 
person's testimony but may not obtain a copy if the FCA's representative 
conducting the investigation has cause to believe that the contents 
should not be disclosed.

fide and duly authorized officer or other designated representative of a 
corporation, trust, association or other entity not specifically listed

    (c) Any person transacting business with the FCA in a representative

<R05>
Sec. 623.4  Suspension and debarment.

    (a) Grounds. The Board may censure any person practicing before the 
FCA or may deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of any person 
to practice before the FCA if such person is found by the Board, after 
notice of and opportunity for hearing in the matter:
    (1) Not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others;
    (2) To be lacking in character or professional integrity;
    (3) To have engaged in any dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, 
contemptuous, contumacious or other unethical or improper conduct before 
FCA; or
    (4) To have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the 
violation of, any provision of the laws administered by the FCA or the 
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

[[Page 268]]

    (b) Automatic suspension. (1) Any person who, after being licensed 
as a professional or expert by any competent authority, has been 
convicted by a Federal or State court of a felony, or of a misdemeanor 
involving moral turpitude, personal dishonesty or breach of trust, shall 
be suspended automatically from practicing before the FCA without a 
hearing.
    (2) Any accountant, appraiser or licensed expert whose license to 
practice has been revoked in any State, possession, territory, 
Commonwealth or the District of Columbia, or who has been suspended or 
otherwise barred from practice before any Federal or State regulatory 
authority, shall be suspended automatically from practicing before the 
FCA without a hearing.
    (3) Any attorney who has been suspended or disbarred by a court of 
the United States or in any State, possession, territory, Commonwealth 
or the District of Columbia, shall be suspended automatically from 
practicing before the FCA without a hearing.
    (4) A conviction (including a judgment or order on a plea of nolo 
contendere), revocation, suspension or disbarment under paragraphs 
(b)(1), (2) and (3) of this section shall be deemed to have occurred 
when the convicting, revoking, suspending or disbarring agency or 
tribunal enters its judgment or order, regardless of whether an appeal 
is pending or could be taken.
    (5) For purposes of this section, it shall be irrelevant that any 
attorney, accountant, appraiser or licensed expert who has been 
suspended, disbarred or otherwise disqualified from practice before a 
court, regulatory authority, or in a jurisdiction continues in 
professional good standing before other courts, regulatory authorities, 
or in other jurisdictions.
    (c) Temporary suspension. (1) The Board, with due regard to the 
public interest and without preliminary hearing, by order, may 
temporarily suspend any person from appearing or practicing before it 
who by name, has been:
    (i) Permanently enjoined (whether by consent, default or summary 
judgment or after trial) by any court of competent jurisdiction or by 
the Board in a final administrative order, by reason of his or her 
misconduct in any action brought by the FCA based upon violations of, or 
aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of any law that is 
administered by the FCA or of any rule or regulation promulgated 
thereunder; or
    (ii) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction (whether by 
consent, default, upon summary judgment or after hearing) or in any 
administrative proceeding in which the FCA is a complainant and he or 
she is a party, to have willfully committed, caused, aided or abetted a 
violation of any provision of any law that is administered by the FCA, 
or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.
    (2) An order of temporary suspension shall become effective when 
served by certified mail with a return receipt directed to the last 
known business or residential address of the person involved. No order 
of temporary suspension shall be entered by the Board pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section more than 3 months after the final 
judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative proceeding 
described in paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section has become 
effective and all review or appeal procedures have been completed or are 
no longer available.
    (3) Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing 
before the FCA in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section may, 
within 30 days after service of the order of temporary suspension, 
petition the Board to lift such suspension. If no petition is received 
by the Board within 30 days, the suspension shall become permanent.
    (4) Within 30 days after the filing of a petition in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Board shall either lift the 
temporary suspension or set the matter down for hearing at a time and 
place to be designated by the Board, or both. After opportunity for 
hearing, the Board may censure the petitioner or may suspend the 
petitioner from appearing or practicing before the FCA temporarily or 
permanently. In any case in which the temporary suspension has not been 
lifted, the hearing and any other action taken pursuant to this 
paragraph shall be expedited by

[[Page 269]]

the Board in order to ensure the petitioner's right to address the 
allegations.
    (5) In any hearing held on a petition filed in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a showing that the petitioner has been 
enjoined or has been found to have committed, caused, aided or abetted 
violations as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, without 
more, may be a basis for suspension or debarment; that showing having 
been made, the burden shall then be on the petitioner to show why the 
petitioner should not be censured or be temporarily or permanently 
suspended or debarred. A petitioner will not be permitted to contest any 
findings against the petitioner or any admissions made by the petitioner 
in the judicial or administrative proceedings upon which the proposed 
censure, suspension or debarment is based. A petitioner who has 
consented to the entry of a permanent injunction or order as described 
in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, without admitting the facts set 
forth in the complaint, shall nevertheless be presumed for all purposes 
under this section to have been enjoined or ordered by reason of the 
misconduct alleged in the complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 623.5  Reinstatement.

    (a) Any person who is suspended from practicing before the FCA under 
Sec. 623.4 (a) or (c) of this part may file an application for 
reinstatement at any time. Denial of the privilege of practicing before 
the FCA shall continue unless and until the applicant has been 
reinstated by order of the Board for good cause shown.
    (b) Any person suspended under Sec. 623.4(b) shall be reinstated by 
the Board, upon appropriate application, if all of the grounds for 
application of the provisions of that paragraph are removed subsequently 
by a reversal of the conviction or termination of the suspension, 
disbarment of revocation. An application for reinstatement on any other 
grounds by any person suspended under Sec. 623.4(b) may be filed at any 
time. Such application shall state with particularity the relief 
requested and the grounds therefor and shall include supporting 
evidence, when available. The applicant shall be accorded an opportunity 
for an informal hearing in the matter, unless the applicant has waived a 
hearing in the application and, instead, has elected to have the matter 
determined on the basis of written submissions. Such hearing shall 
utilize the procedures established in part 622, subpart C. However, such 
suspension shall continue unless and until the applicant has been 
reinstated by order of the Board for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 623.6  Duty to file information concerning adverse judicial or administrative action.

    Any person appearing or practicing before the FCA who has been or is 
the subject of a conviction, suspension, debarment, license revocation, 
injunction or other finding of the kind described in Sec. 623.4 (b) or 
(c) of this part is an action not instituted by the FCA shall promptly 
file a copy of the relevant order, judgment or decree with the Board 
together with any related opinion or statement of the agency or tribunal 
involved. Any person who fails to file a copy of such an order, judgment 
or decree within 30 days after the later of the entry of the order, 
judgment or decree, or the date such person initiates practice before 
the FCA, for that reason alone may be disqualified from practicing 
before the FCA until such time as the appropriate filing shall be made, 
but neither the filing of these documents nor the failure of a person to 
file them shall in any way impair the operation of any other provision 
of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 623.7  Proceeding under this part.

    (a) Rules. All hearings required or permitted to be held under 
paragraphs (a) and (c) of Sec. 623.4 of this part shall be held before 
a presiding officer utilizing the procedures established in the rules of 
practice and procedure under part 622, subpart A.
    (b) Closed hearings. All hearings held under this part shall be 
closed to the public unless the Board directs otherwise on its own 
motion or upon the request of a party.
    (c) Collateral proceedings. Any proceeding brought under any section 
of this part shall not preclude a proceeding under any other section of 
this

part or any other part of the FCA's regulations.

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 625.1  Purpose.

    These rules implement the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 
(EAJA). The EAJA provides for the award of attorney fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (designated by the EAJA as ``adversary 
adjudications'') before Federal agencies. An eligible party may receive 
an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's position 
was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award 
unjust. The rules in this part explain how the EAJA applies to Farm 
Credit Administration (FCA) proceedings. The rules describe the parties 
eligible for awards, how such parties may apply for awards, and the 
procedures and standards that govern FCA consideration of applications.


<R05>
Sec. 625.2  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The EAJA applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the FCA 
either on its own behalf or in connection with any other agency of the 
United States that participates in or in any way is a part of the 
adversary adjudication. Adversary adjudications are:
    (1) Adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the 
FCA or other agency is presented by an attorney or other representative 
who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding; and
    (2) Enforcement proceedings under 12 U.S.C. 2261-2273.
    (b) The failure of the FCA to identify a type of proceeding as an 
adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application 
by a party who believes that the proceeding is covered by the EAJA; 
whether the proceeding is covered shall then be an issue for resolution 
in proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered and excluded from 
coverage by the EAJA, any award made will include only fees and expenses 
related to covered issues.
    (d) Proceedings under this part may be conducted by the FCA Board 
(Board) or by the presiding officer (referred to as the ``adjudicative 
officer'' in the EAJA), as defined in Sec. 622.2(f) of this chapter. If 
the Board conducts proceedings, reference to the ``presiding officer'' 
in this part shall mean the Board, in applicable context. Where the 
Board presides, the recommended decision under Sec. 625.26 of this part 
will be omitted and the Board will make a final decision on the 
application in accordance with Sec. 625.27 of this part.
    (e) If a court reviews the underlying decision of the adversary 
adjudication, an award for fees and other expenses may be made only 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(3).

[[Page 271]]


<R05>
Sec. 625.3  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award under the EAJA, an applicant must be 
a prevailing party named or admitted to the adversary adjudication for 
which an award is sought. The applicant must show that it meets all 
conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B of 
this part.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of $2 million or less;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has both a net 
worth of $7 million or less (including personal and business interests), 
and 500 or fewer employees;
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with 500 or fewer employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with 500 or fewer 
employees; and
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or organization with a net worth of $7 million or less and 
500 or fewer employees.
    (c) For eligibility purposes, the net worth and number of employees 
of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the adversary 
adjudication was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for that applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility unless 
the presiding officer determines that aggregation would be unjust and 
contrary to the purposes of the EAJA in light of the actual relationship 
between the affiliated entities.
    (1) For purposes of this part, an affiliate is:
    (i) Any individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or 
indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other 
interests of the applicant; or
    (ii) Any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly 
or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other 
interests.
    (2) The presiding officer may determine that financial relationships 
of the applicant other than those described in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section constitute special circumstances that would make an award 
unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in an adversary adjudication 
primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would 
be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.


<R05>
Sec. 625.4  Standards for awards.

    (a) If an eligible applicant prevails over the FCA in an adversary 
adjudication, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
thereof, the applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses 
incurred in the adjudication, or portion thereof, unless the position of 
the FCA over which the applicant prevailed was substantially justified.
    (b) The position of the FCA includes:
    (1) The position taken by the FCA in the adversary adjudication; and
    (2) The action or inaction of the FCA upon which the adversary 
adjudication is based.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the FCA 
must prove that its position was substantially justified before an award 
may be denied to an otherwise eligible applicant.
    (d) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the adversary adjudication or if special 
circumstances make the award sought unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 625.5  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert 
witnesses, even if

[[Page 272]]

the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to 
the applicant.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may 
exceed the highest rate at which the FCA pays expert witnesses. However, 
an award also may include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, 
agent, or expert witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or 
expert witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent, or expert witness, the presiding officer shall consider 
the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent, or expert witness is in private 
practice, his or her customary fees for similar services, or, if an 
employee of the applicant, the fully allocated costs of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily performs 
services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the adversary adjudication; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, audit, engineering 
report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party 
may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not

Sec. 625.6  Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

    (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special 
circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to 
handle certain types of proceedings), the FCA may adopt regulations 
providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $75 
per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this 
part. The FCA will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose 
under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure 
Act.
    (b) Any person may file with the FCA a petition for rulemaking to 
increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. The petition should 
identify the rate the petitioner believes the FCA should establish and 
the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should 
also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The FCA 
will respond to the petition within 90 days after it is filed, by 
initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the petition, or taking 
other appropriate action.


<R05>
Sec. 625.7  Awards against other agencies.

    If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over 
another agency of the United States that participates in or in any way 
is a part of an adversary adjudication before the FCA and that agency's 
position is not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate 
portion of the award shall be made against that agency.


<R04>
                Subpart B_Applicant Information Required


<R05>
Sec. 625.10  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and other expenses under the 
EAJA shall identify the applicant and the adversary adjudication for 
which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant 
has prevailed in the adversary adjudication. If the application is made 
on the basis of significant and discrete substantive issues on which the 
applicant prevailed, the issues must be specifically identified. The 
application also shall identify each position of the FCA or other 
agencies that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. 
Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall describe 
briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business and state 
the number of persons employed.
    (b) The application shall include a statement that the applicant's 
net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million 
(for all other applicants, including their affiliates).

[[Page 273]]

However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It states that it has 500 employees or fewer and attaches a copy 
of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an 
organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 
(26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not 
required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its 
exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's 
belief that it qualifies under such section; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) 
with 500 or fewer employees.
    (c) The application shall state the total amount of fees and other 
expenses for which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may include any other relevant matters that the 
applicant wishes the FCA to consider in determining whether and in what 
amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. The application must 
contain a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury 
that the information provided in the application and any supporting 
documents is accurate.


<R05>
Sec. 625.11  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 625.3(f)(1) of this part) as of the date when the 
adversary adjudication was initiated. The exhibit may be in any 
convenient form that provides full disclosure of the assets and 
liabilities of the applicant and its affiliates and is otherwise 
sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant qualifies under the 
standards in this part. The presiding officer may require an applicant 
to file additional information supporting its eligibility for an award.
    (b) An applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in 
any portion of the net worth exhibit and believes there are legal 
grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of 
the exhibit directly to the presiding officer in a sealed envelope 
labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' accompanied by a motion 
under Sec. 622.11 of this chapter to withhold the information from 
public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to 
be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of 
the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1)-(9), why public disclosure of the 
information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is 
not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be 
served on counsel representing the FCA, but need not be served on any 
other party to the application proceeding. If the presiding officer, or 
the FCA Board pursuant to Sec. 622.11(e) of this chapter, finds that 
the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be 
placed in the public record of the application proceeding. Otherwise, 
any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be treated in 
accordance with the FCA's procedures regarding release of information 
(12 CFR part 602).


<R05>
Sec. 625.12  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, audit, 
engineering report, test, project, or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rates at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, and the total amount paid or payable by the 
applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. 
Under Sec. 625.25 of this part, the presiding officer may require the 
applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, logs, or other substantiation 
for any fees or expenses claimed.

[[Page 274]]


<R05>
Sec. 625.13  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the adversary adjudication, or in a significant and discrete 
substantive portion thereof, but in no case later than 30 days after the 
FCA's final disposition of the adversary adjudication.
    (b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date on 
which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the adversary 
adjudication is issued or any other complete resolution of the adversary 
adjudication, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, becomes final 
and is unreviewable by the FCA, any other administrative body, or the 
courts.
    (c) If review, reconsideration, or appeal is sought or taken of an 
adversary adjudication decision as to which an applicant believes it has 
prevailed, application proceedings for any award of fees and other 
expenses shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying 
controversy.

    A prevailing party and the FCA through its counsel may agree on a 
proposed settlement of an award at any time, either in connection with a

party and the FCA counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award, 
the proposed settlement must be submitted to the presiding officer for a 
recommended decision pursuant to Sec. 625.26 of this part. If it has 
not been previously filed, the application must be submitted to the 
presiding officer along with the proposed settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 625.21  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading or document related 
to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the 
adversary adjudication in the same manner as other pleadings in the 
adversary adjudication (see Sec. Sec. 622.18 and 622.19 of this 
chapter), except as provided in Sec. 625.11(b) of this part for 
confidential financial information.


<R05>
Sec. 625.22  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service, counsel for the FCA may file an 
answer to the application. Unless the FCA counsel requests an extension 
of time for filing or a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph 
(c) of this section is filed, the presiding officer, upon a satisfactory 
showing of entitlement by the applicant, may make an award for the 
applicant's fees and other expenses under the EAJA.
    (b) The answer shall set forth any objections to the requested award 
and identify the facts relied on in support of the FCA's position. If 
the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of 
the adversary adjudication, the FCA counsel shall include with the 
answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings 
under Sec. 625.25 of this part.
    (c) If the FCA counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, 
and further extensions may be granted by the presiding officer upon 
request by the FCA counsel and the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 625.23  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the adversary adjudication, the applicant shall include with 
the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 625.25 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 625.24  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and FCA counsel 
may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is served or 
on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may 
not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the 
presiding officer determines

[[Page 275]]

that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit 
full exploration of matters raised in the comments.


<R05>
Sec. 625.25  Further proceedings.

    (a) The determination of an award shall be made on the basis of the 
written record unless the presiding officer finds that further 
proceedings are necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues 
arising from the application. Such further proceedings may be at the 
request of either the applicant or the FCA counsel, or on the presiding 
officer's own initiative, and shall be conducted as promptly as 
possible. Further proceedings may include an informal conference, oral 
argument, additional written submissions, or other actions required by 
the presiding officer, but may not include discovery or an evidentiary 
hearing with respect to the issue of whether the agency's position was 
substantially justified.
    (b) Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially 
justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, 
as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees 
and other expenses are sought.
    (c) A request that the presiding officer order further proceedings 
under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or 
the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are 
necessary to resolve the issues.


<R05>
Sec. 625.26  Recommended decision.

    The presiding officer shall file a recommended decision within 30 
days after completion of proceedings on the application, and, promptly 
upon filing, shall serve a copy of the recommended decision upon each 
party to the proceedings. The decision shall include written findings 
and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility, status as a prevailing 
party, the recommended amount of the award, if any, and an explanation 
of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the 
amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings 
on whether the FCA's position was substantially justified, whether the 
applicant unduly protracted the adversary adjudication, or whether 
special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant has sought 
an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate 
responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and 
shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.


<R05>
Sec. 625.27  Board decision.

    Following filing of the recommended decision with the Board, the 
Board shall render a final decision on the application. The Board 
maintains full discretion to uphold, reverse, remand, or alter the 
recommended decision. The Board may order further proceedings (including 
those set forth in Sec. Sec. 622.11 and 622.13 through 622.16 of this 
chapter) upon request by any party to the application proceeding or on 
its own initiative, but such proceedings may not include discovery or an 
evidentiary hearing with respect to the issue of whether the agency's 
position was substantially justified.


<R05>
Sec. 625.28  Judicial review.

    Judicial review of final FCA decisions on awards may be sought as 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).


<R05>

days of receipt of the applicant's submission and certification.

<R05>
Sec. 627.2726  Treatment by the conservator or receiver of financial assets transferred in connection with a securitization or participation.

    (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    Beneficial interest means debt or equity (or mixed) interests or 
obligations of any type issued by a special purpose entity that entitle 
their holders to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow 
from financial assets owned by the special purpose entity.
    Financial asset means cash or a contract or instrument that conveys 
to one entity a contractual right to receive cash or another financial 
instrument from another entity.
    Participation means the transfer or assignment of an undivided 
interest in all or part of a loan or a lease from a seller, known as the 
``lead'', to a buyer, known as the ``participant'', without recourse to 
the lead, pursuant to an agreement between the lead and the participant. 
Without recourse means that the participation is not subject to any 
agreement that requires the lead to repurchase the participant's 
interest or to otherwise compensate the participant due to a default on 
the underlying obligation.
    Securitization means the issuance by a special purpose entity of 
beneficial interests:
    (1) The most senior class of which at the time of issuance is rated 
in one of the four highest categories assigned to long-term debt or in 
an equivalent short-term category (within either of which there may be 
sub-categories or gradations indicating relative standing) by one or 
more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, or
    (2) Which are sold in transactions by an issuer not involving any 
public offering for purposes of section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933 
(15 U.S.C. 77d), as amended, or in transactions exempt from registration 
under such Act pursuant to Regulation S thereunder (or any successor 
regulation).
    Special purpose entity means a trust, corporation, or other entity 
demonstrably distinct from the Farm Credit institution that is primarily 
engaged in acquiring and holding (or transferring to another special 
purpose entity) financial assets, and in activities related or 
incidental thereto, in connection with the issuance by such special 
purpose entity (or by another special purpose entity that acquires 
financial assets directly or indirectly from such special purpose 
entity) of beneficial interests.
    (b) The receiver shall not, by exercise of its authority to 
repudiate contracts under Sec. 627.2725(b)(2) and (b)(14), reclaim, 
recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the 
receivership any financial assets transferred by a Farm Credit 
institution in connection with a securitization or participation, 
provided that such transfer meets all conditions for sale accounting 
treatment under generally accepted accounting principles, other than the 
``legal isolation'' condition as it applies to institutions for which 
the

[[Page 283]]

FCSIC may be appointed as receiver which is addressed by this section.
    (c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply unless the Farm 
Credit institution received adequate consideration for the transfer of 
financial assets at the time of the transfer, and the documentation 
effecting the transfer of financial assets reflects the intent of the 
parties to treat the transaction as a sale, and not as a secured 
borrowing, for accounting purposes.
    (d) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not be construed as waiving, 
limiting, or otherwise affecting the power of the receiver to disaffirm 
or repudiate any agreement imposing continuing obligations or duties 
upon the institution in receivership.
    (e) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not be construed as waiving, 
limiting or otherwise affecting the rights or powers of the receiver to 
take any action or to exercise any power not specifically limited by 
this section, including, but not limited to, any rights, powers or 
remedies of the receiver regarding transfers taken in contemplation of 
the institution's insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay, or 
defraud the institution or the creditors of such institution, or that is 
a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.
    (f) The receiver shall not seek to avoid an otherwise legally 
enforceable securitization agreement or participation agreement executed 
by a Farm Credit institution solely because such agreement does not meet 
the ``contemporaneous'' requirement of section 5.61(d) of the Act.
    (g) This section may be repealed or amended by the Farm Credit 
Administration, but any such repeal or amendment shall not apply to any 
transfers of financial assets made in connection with a securitization 
or participation that was in effect before such repeal or modification.

    (a) Upon the placing of an institution in liquidation, the receiver 
shall immediately notify every borrower who has an uninsured account 
(voluntary or involuntary) as described in Sec. 614.4513 of this 
chapter that the funds ceased earning interest when the receivership was 
instituted and will be applied against the outstanding indebtedness of 
any loans of such borrower unless, within 15 days of such notice, the 
borrower directs the receiver to otherwise apply such funds in the 
manner provided for in existing loan documents.
    (b) As soon as practicable after the receiver takes possession of 
the institution, the receiver shall notify, by first class mail, each 
holder of stock and participation certificates of the following matters:
    (1) The number of shares such holder owns;
    (2) That the stock and other equities of the institution may not be 
retired or transferred until the liquidation is completed, whereupon the 
receiver will distribute a liquidating dividend, if any, to the owners 
of such equities; and

Administration deems necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 627.2740  Creditors' claims.

    (a) The receiver shall publish promptly a notice to creditors to

90 calendar days after the first publication. The notice shall be 
republished approximately 30 days and 60 days after the first 
publication. The receiver shall promptly send, by first class mail, a 
similar notice to any creditor shown on the institution's books at the 
creditor's last address appearing thereon. Claims filed after the

[[Page 284]]

shall be disallowed, except as the receiver may approve them for full or 
partial payment from the institution's assets remaining undistributed at 
the time of approval.
    (b) The receiver shall allow any claim that is timely received and 
proved to the receiver's satisfaction. The receiver may disallow in 
whole or in part any creditor's claim or claim of security, preference, 
or priority which is not proved to the receiver's satisfaction or is not 
timely received and shall notify the claimant of the disallowance and 
reason therefor. Sending the notice of disallowance by first class mail 
to the claimant's address appearing on the proof of claim shall be 
sufficient notice. The disallowance shall be final, unless, within 30 
days after the notice of disallowance is mailed, the claimant files a 
written request for payment regardless of the disallowance. The receiver 
shall reconsider any claim upon the timely request of the claimant and 
may approve or disapprove such claim in whole or in part.
    (c) Creditors' claims that are allowed shall be paid by the receiver 
from time to time, to the extent funds are available therefor and in 
accordance with the priorities established in this subpart and in such 
manner and amounts as the receiver deems appropriate. In the event the 
institution has a claim against a creditor of the institution, the 
receiver shall offset the amount of such claim against the claim 
asserted by such creditor.
    (d) The claims of holders of notes, bonds, debentures, or other 
obligations issued by a bank under 12 U.S.C. 2153 (c) or (d) shall be 
made, if deemed necessary or appropriate, in accordance with procedures 
formulated by the Insurance Corporation. In the formulation of such 
procedures, the Insurance Corporation shall consult with the Farm Credit 
Administration.

    (k) Relationship with qualified public accountant. (1) If a change 
in the qualified public accountant who has previously examined and

<R04>
                Subpart C_Quarterly Reports to Investors


<R05>
Sec. 630.40  Contents of the quarterly report to investors.

    (a) General. The quarterly report to investors shall contain the 
information specified in this section along with any other material 
information necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the 
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The quarterly 
report must be presented in a format that is easily understandable and 
not misleading.
    (b) Rules for condensation. For purposes of this subpart, major 
captions to be provided in interim financial statements are the same as 
those provided in the financial statements contained in the annual 
report to investors, except that the financial statements included in 
the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance 
with the rules prescribed under this paragraph.
    (1) Interim balance sheets. When any major balance sheet caption is 
less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has 
not increased or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the 
preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.
    (2) Interim statements of income. When any major income statement 
caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most 
recent fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not increased or 
decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim period 
of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. 
In calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded. If 
losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the 
average loss shall be used for purposes of this test.
    (3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure 
either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying 
footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not 
misleading. It may be presumed that users of the interim financial 
information have read or have access to the audited financial statements 
for the preceding fiscal year, and the adequacy of additional disclosure 
needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. 
Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the 
disclosure contained in the most recent audited financial statements 
(such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices) 
and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or 
composition since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year may 
be omitted.
    (4) Interim reports shall disclose events that have occurred 
subsequent to the end of the most recently completed fiscal year that 
have a material impact on the System. Disclosures should encompass, for 
example, significant changes since the end of the most recently 
completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and 
practices, estimates used in the preparation of financial statements, 
status of long-term contracts, capitalization, significant new 
indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements, financial 
assistance received, significant business combinations and liquidations 
of System institutions, and terminations of System institution status. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, where material 
contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be provided even 
though a significant change since yearend may not have occurred.
    (5) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by 
existing accounting pronouncements for accounting changes, state the 
date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making it.
    (6) Any material prior period adjustment made during any period 
covered by the interim financial statements shall be disclosed, together 
with its effect upon net income and upon the balance of surplus for any 
prior period included. If results of operations for any period presented 
have been adjusted

[[Page 301]]

retroactively by such an item subsequent to the initial reporting of 
such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be 
made.
    (7) Interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all 
adjustments that are necessary to a fair statement of the results for 
the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be 
included. Furnish any material information necessary to make the 
information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the 
results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to 
be expected for the year.
    (8) If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by 
this section with respect to any item is not material, it need not be 
separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted.
    (c) Discussion and analysis of interim financial condition and 
results of operations. Discuss any material changes to the information 
disclosed to investors pursuant to Sec. 630.20(g) that have occurred 
during the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this 
section. Provide any additional information needed to enable the reader 
to assess material changes in financial condition and results of 
operations between the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) 
of this section.
    (1) Material changes in financial condition. Discuss any material 
changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year 
to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided.
    (2) Material changes in results of operations. Discuss any material 
changes in the combined results of operations of the System with respect 
to the most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which an income 
statement is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the 
preceding fiscal year. Such discussion shall also cover material changes 
with respect to the most recent fiscal quarter and the corresponding 
fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year.
    (d) Financial statements. Interim combined financial statements must 
be provided in the quarterly report to investors as set forth in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (4). Indicate that the financial statements 
were prepared under the oversight of the System Audit Committee.
    (1) An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal 
quarter and a balance sheet as of the end of the preceding fiscal year.
    (2) Interim statements of income for the most recent fiscal quarter, 
for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end 
of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable periods for 
the previous fiscal year.
    (3) Interim statements of changes in capital stock and surplus (or, 
if applicable, interim statements of changes in protected borrower 
capital and capital stock and surplus) for the period between the end of 
the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, 
and for the comparable period for the preceding fiscal year.
    (4) Interim statements of cash flows for the period between the end 
of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal 
quarter, and for the comparable period for the preceding fiscal year.
    (e) Supplemental information. The interim report shall present

insolvent means:
    (i) The assets of the Corporation are less than its obligations to 
its creditors and others; or
    (ii) The Corporation is unable to pay its debts as they fall due in 
the ordinary course of business;
    (2) There has been a substantial dissipation of the assets or 
earnings of the Corporation due to the violation of any law, rule, or 
regulation, or the conduct of an unsafe or unsound practice;
    (3) The Corporation is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact 
business;
    (4) The Corporation has committed a willful violation of a final 
cease-and-desist order issued by the Farm Credit Administration Board;

assets, or is refusing to submit its books, papers, records, assets, or 
other material relating to the affairs of the Corporation for inspection 
to any examiner or any lawful agent of the Farm Credit Administration 
Board.
    (b) In addition to the grounds set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, a receiver can be appointed for the Corporation if the Farm 
Credit Administration Board determines that the appointment of a 
conservator would not be appropriate when one of the following 
conditions exists:
    (1) The authority of the Corporation to purchase qualified loans or 
issue or guarantee loan-backed securities is suspended; or
    (2) The Corporation is classified under section 8.35 of the Act as 
within enforcement level III or IV and the alternative actions available 
under subtitle B of title VIII of the Act are not satisfactory.
    (c) In addition to the grounds set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, a conservator can be appointed for the Corporation if:
    (1) The Corporation is classified under section 8.35 of the Act as 
within enforcement level III or IV; or
    (2) The authority of the Corporation to purchase qualified loans or 
issue or guarantee loan-backed securities is suspended.

appointment, bring an action in the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia, for an order requiring the Farm Credit 
Administration Board to remove the receiver or conservator and, if the 
charter has been canceled, to rescind the cancellation of the charter. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Corporation's 
board of directors is empowered to meet subsequent to such appointment 
and authorize the filing of

the Corporation's board of directors.

Upon adoption of such resolution, the Corporation shall submit the 
resolution and proposed voluntary liquidation plan to the Farm Credit 
Administration Board for preliminary approval. The Farm Credit 
Administration Board, in its discretion, may appoint a receiver as part 
of an approved liquidation plan. If a receiver is appointed for the 
Corporation as part of a voluntary liquidation, the receivership shall 
be conducted pursuant to the regulations of this part, except to the 
extent that an approved plan of liquidation provides otherwise.
    (b) If the Farm Credit Administration Board gives preliminary 
approval to the liquidation plan, the board of directors of the 
Corporation shall submit the resolution to liquidate to the stockholders 
for a vote in accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation.
    (c) The Farm Credit Administration Board will consider final 
approval of the resolution to voluntarily liquidate and the liquidation 
plan after an affirmative stockholder vote on the resolution.

Credit Administration Board shall immediately notify the Corporation and

liquidation and appointing the receiver, all rights, privileges, and 
powers of the board of directors, officers, and employees of the 
Corporation shall be vested exclusively in the receiver. The Farm Credit 
Administration Board may cancel the charter of the Corporation on such 
date as the Farm Credit Administration Board determines is appropriate,

the receiver.

[[Page 307]]

sold, distributed, transferred, or assigned. Such activities could

resolution is approved by the stockholders of the Corporation and the 
Farm Credit Administration Board, the liquidation plan shall govern 
disposition of the equities of the Corporation as provided in Sec. 
650.52 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 650.35  Notice to stockholders.

    As soon as practicable after a receiver takes possession of the 
Corporation, the receiver shall notify, by first class mail, each holder 
of stock of the following matters:
    (a) The number of shares such holder owns;
    (b) That the stock and other equities of the Corporation may not be 
retired or transferred until the liquidation is completed, whereupon the 
receiver will distribute a liquidating dividend, if any, to the

    (c) Such other matters as the receiver or the Farm Credit 
Administration Board deems necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 650.40  Creditor claims.

thereof, to the receiver by a date specified in the notice, which shall 
be not less than 90 calendar days after the first publication. The 
notice shall be republished approximately 30 days and 60 days after the 
first publication. The receiver shall promptly send, by first class 
mail, a similar notice to any creditor shown on the Corporation's books 
at the creditor's last address appearing thereon. Claims filed after the 
specified date shall be disallowed except as the receiver may approve 
them for full or partial payment from the Corporation's assets remaining

    (b) The receiver shall allow any claim that is timely received and 
proved to the receiver's satisfaction. The receiver may disallow in 
whole or in part any creditor's claim or claim of security, preference, 
or priority that is not proved to the receiver's satisfaction or is not 
timely received and shall notify the claimant of the disallowance and 
reason therefor. Sending the notice of disallowance by first class mail 
to the claimant's address appearing on the proof of claim shall be 
sufficient notice. The disallowance shall be final unless, within 30 
days after the notice of disallowance is mailed, the claimant files a

receiver shall offset the amount of such claim against the claim 
asserted by such creditor.

Administration assessments for the costs of supervising and examining 
the Corporation, and any amounts borrowed pursuant to Sec. 
650.56(b)(3).
    (b) Administrative expenses of the Corporation, provided that such 
expenses were incurred within 60 days prior to the receiver's taking 
possession, and that such expenses shall be limited to reasonable 
expenses incurred for services actually provided by accountants,

expenses incurred by employees that were authorized and reimbursable 
under a preexisting expense reimbursement policy and that, in the

not include wages or salaries of employees of the Corporation.

[[Page 308]]

Sec. 650.50  Payment of claims.

    (a) All claims of each class described in Sec. 650.61 of this 
subpart shall be paid in full or provisions shall be made for such 
payment prior to the payment of any claim of a lesser priority. If there 
are insufficient funds to pay all claims in a class in full, 
distribution to that class will be on a pro rata basis.
    (b) Following the payment of all claims, the receiver shall 
distribute the remainder of the assets of the Corporation, if any, to 
the owners of stock and other equities in accordance with the priorities 
for impairment set forth in section 8.4(e)(3) of the Act and the bylaws 
of the Corporation.


<R05>
Sec. 650.55  Inventory, audit, and reports.

Corporation, the receiver shall take an inventory of the assets and 
liabilities as of the date possession was taken.

certified public accountant selected by the receiver.

    (b) Upon the appointment of a conservator, the Chairman of the Farm

means the conflicting interest is of sufficient magnitude or

                     Subpart A_Investment Management


<R05>
Sec. 652.1  Purpose.

    This subpart contains the Farm Credit Administration's (FCA) rules 
for governing liquidity and non-program

[[Page 312]]

investments held by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation 
(Farmer Mac). The purpose of this subpart is to ensure safety and 
soundness, continuity of funding, and appropriate use of non-program 
investments considering Farmer Mac's special status as a Government-
sponsored enterprise (GSE). The subpart contains requirements for Farmer 
Mac's board of directors to adopt policies covering such areas as 
investment management, interest rate risk, and liquidity reserves. The 
subpart also requires Farmer Mac to comply with various reporting 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 652.5  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions will apply:
    Affiliate means any entity established under authority granted to 
the Corporation under section 8.3(b)(13) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, 
as amended.
    Asset-backed securities (ABS) means investment securities that 
provide for ownership of a fractional undivided interest or collateral 
interests in specific assets of a trust that are sold and traded in the 
capital markets. For the purposes of this subpart, ABS exclude mortgage 
securities that are defined below.
    Eurodollar time deposit means a non-negotiable deposit denominated 
in United States dollars and issued by an overseas branch of a United 
States bank or by a foreign bank outside the United States.
    Farmer Mac, Corporation, you, and your means the Federal 
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and its affiliates.
    FCA, our, or we means the Farm Credit Administration.
    Final maturity means the last date on which the remaining principal 
amount of a security is due and payable (matures) to the registered 
owner. It does not mean the call date, the expected average life, the 
duration, or the weighted average maturity.
    General obligations of a state or political subdivision means:
    (1) The full faith and credit obligations of a state, the District 
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a territory or possession 
of the United States, or a political subdivision thereof that possesses 
general powers of taxation, including property taxation; or
    (2) An obligation that is unconditionally guaranteed by an obligor 
possessing general powers of taxation, including property taxation.
    Government agency means an agency or instrumentality of the United 
States Government whose obligations are fully and explicitly guaranteed 
as to the timely repayment of principal and interest by the full faith 
and credit of the United States Government.
    Government-sponsored agency means an agency, instrumentality, or 
corporation chartered or established to serve public purposes specified 
by the United States Congress but whose obligations are not explicitly 
guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, 
including but not limited to any Government-sponsored enterprise.
    Liquid investments are assets that can be promptly converted into 
cash without significant loss to the investor. A security is liquid if 
the spread between its bid price and ask price is narrow and a 
reasonable amount can be sold at those prices promptly.
    Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitment (LTSPC) is a commitment by 
Farmer Mac to purchase specified eligible loans on one or more 
undetermined future dates. In consideration for Farmer Mac's assumption 
of the credit risk on the specified loans underlying an LTSPC, Farmer 
Mac receives an annual commitment fee on the outstanding balance of 
those loans in monthly installments based on the outstanding balance of 
those loans.
    Market risk means the risk to your financial condition because the 
value of your holdings may decline if interest rates or market prices 
change. Exposure to market risk is measured by assessing the effect of 
changing rates and prices on either the earnings or economic value of an 
individual instrument, a portfolio, or the entire Corporation.
    Maturing obligations means maturing debt and other obligations that 
may be expected, such as buyouts of long-term standby purchase 
commitments or repurchases of agricultural mortgage securities.

[[Page 313]]

    Mortgage securities means securities that are either:
    (1) Pass-through securities or participation certificates that 
represent ownership of a fractional undivided interest in a specified 
pool of residential (excluding home equity loans), multifamily or 
commercial mortgages, or
    (2) A multiclass security (including collateralized mortgage 
obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits) that is backed 
by a pool of residential, multifamily or commercial real estate 
mortgages, pass-through mortgage securities, or other multiclass 
mortgage securities.
    (3) This definition does not include agricultural mortgage-backed 
securities guaranteed by Farmer Mac itself.
    Nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) means 
a rating organization that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
recognizes as an NRSRO.
    Non-program investments means investments other than those in:
    (1) ``Qualified loans'' as defined in section 8.0(9) of the Farm 
Credit Act of 1971, as amended; or
    (2) Securities collateralized by ``qualified loans.''
    Program assets means on-balance sheet ``qualified loans'' as defined 
in section 8.0(9) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended.
    Program obligations means off-balance sheet ``qualified loans'' as 
defined in section 8.0(9) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended.
    Regulatory capital means your core capital plus an allowance for 
losses and guarantee claims, as determined in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles.
    Revenue bond means an obligation of a municipal government that 
finances a specific project or enterprise, but it is not a full faith 
and credit obligation. The obligor pays a portion of the revenue 
generated by the project or enterprise to the bondholders.
    Weighted average life (WAL) means the average time until the 
investor receives the principal on a security, weighted by the size of 
each principal payment and calculated under specified prepayment 
assumptions.


<R05>
Sec. 652.10  Investment management and requirements.

    (a) Investment policies--board responsibilities. Your board of 
directors must adopt written policies for managing your non-program 
investment activities. Your board must also ensure that management 
complies with these policies and that appropriate internal controls are 
in place to prevent loss. At least annually, your board, or a designated 
subcommittee of the board, must review these investment policies. Any 
changes to the policies must be adopted by the board. You must report 
any changes to these policies to FCA's Office of Secondary Market 
Oversight within 10 business days of adoption.
    (b) Investment policies--general requirements. Your investment 
policies must address the purposes and objectives of investments, risk 
tolerance, delegations of authority, exception parameters, securities 
valuation, internal controls, and reporting requirements. Furthermore, 
the policies must address the means for reporting, and approvals needed 
for, exceptions to established policies. Investment policies must be 
sufficiently detailed, consistent with, and appropriate for the amounts, 
types, and risk characteristics of your investments.
    (c) Investment policies--risk tolerance. Your investment policies 
must establish risk limits and diversification requirements for the 
various classes of eligible investments and for the entire investment 
portfolio. These policies must ensure that you maintain prudent 
diversification of your investment portfolio. Risk limits must be based 
on the Corporation's objectives, capital position, and risk tolerance. 
Your policies must identify the types and quantity of investments that 
you will hold to achieve your objectives and control credit, market, 
liquidity, and operational risks. Your policies must establish risk 
limits for the following four types of risk:
    (1) Credit risk. Your investment policies must establish:
    (i) Credit quality standards, limits on counterparty risk, and risk 
diversification standards that limit concentrations based on a single or 
related counterparty(ies), a geographical area,

[[Page 314]]

industries or obligations with similar characteristics.
    (ii) Criteria for selecting brokers, dealers, and investment bankers 
(collectively, securities firms). You must buy and sell eligible 
investments with more than one securities firm. As part of your annual 
review of your investment policies, your board of directors, or a 
designated subcommittee of the board, must review the criteria for 
selecting securities firms. Any changes to the criteria must be approved 
by the board. Also, as part of your annual review, the board, or a 
designated subcommittee of the board, must review existing relationships 
with securities firms. In addition, the board, or a designated 
subcommittee of the board, must be notified before any changes to 
securities firms are made.
    (iii) Collateral margin requirements on repurchase agreements. You 
must regularly mark the collateral to market and ensure appropriate 
controls are maintained over collateral held.
    (2) Market risk. Your investment policies must set market risk 
limits for specific types of investments, and for the investment 
portfolio or for Farmer Mac generally. Your board of directors must 
establish market risk limits in accordance with these regulations 
(including, but not limited to, Sec. Sec. 652.15 and 652.40) and our 
other policies and guidance. You must document in the Corporation's 
records or minutes any analyses used in formulating your policies or 
amendments to the policies.
    (3) Liquidity risk. Your investment policies must describe the 
liquidity characteristics of eligible investments that you will hold to 
meet your liquidity needs and the Corporation's objectives.
    (4) Operational risk. Investment policies must address operational 
risks, including delegations of authority and internal controls in 
accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (d) Delegation of authority. All delegations of authority to 
specified personnel or committees must state the extent of management's 
authority and responsibilities for investments.
    (e) Internal controls. You must:
    (1) Establish appropriate internal controls to detect and prevent 
loss, fraud, embezzlement, conflicts of interest, and unauthorized 
investments.
    (2) Establish and maintain a separation of duties and supervision 
between personnel who execute investment transactions and personnel who 
approve, revaluate, and oversee investments.
    (3) Maintain records and management information systems that are 
appropriate for the level and complexity of your investment activities.
    (f) Securities valuations. (1) Before you purchase a security, you 
must evaluate its credit quality and price sensitivity to changes in 
market interest rates. You must also verify the value of a security that 
you plan to purchase, other than a new issue, with a source that is 
independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty, or other intermediary 
to the transaction. Your investment policies must fully address the 
extent of the prepurchase analysis that management needs to perform for 
various classes of instruments. For example, you should specifically 
describe the stress tests in Sec. 652.40 that must be performed on 
various types of mortgage securities.
    (2) At least monthly, you must determine the fair market value of 
each security in your portfolio and the fair market value of your whole 
investment portfolio. In doing so you must also evaluate the credit 
quality and price sensitivity to the change in market interest rates of 
each security in your portfolio and your whole investment portfolio.
    (3) Before you sell a security, you must verify its value with a 
source that is independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty, or other 
intermediary to the transaction.
    (g) Reports to the board of directors. At least quarterly, Farmer 
Mac's management must report to the Corporation's board of directors, or 
a designated subcommittee of the board:
    (1) On the performance and risk of each class of investments and the 
entire investment portfolio;
    (2) All gains and losses that you incur during the quarter on 
individual securities that you sold before maturity and why they were 
liquidated;
    (3) Potential risk exposure to changes in market interest rates and

[[Page 315]]

any other factors that may affect the value of your investment holdings;
    (4) How investments affect your overall financial condition;
    (5) Whether the performance of the investment portfolio effectively 
achieves the board's objectives; and
    (6) Any deviations from the board's policies. These deviations must 
be formally approved by the board of directors.


<R05>
Sec. 652.15  Interest rate risk management and requirements.

    (a) The board of directors of Farmer Mac must provide effective 
oversight (direction, controls, and supervision) to the interest rate 
risk management program and must be knowledgeable of the nature and 
level of interest rate risk taken by Farmer Mac.
    (b) The management of Farmer Mac must ensure that interest rate risk 
is properly managed on both a long-range and a day-to-day basis.
    (c) The board of directors of Farmer Mac must adopt an interest rate 
risk management policy that establishes appropriate interest rate risk 
exposure limits based on the Corporation's risk-bearing capacity and 
reporting requirements in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section. At least annually, the board of directors, or a designated 
subcommittee of the board, must review the policy. Any changes to the 
policy must be approved by the board of directors. You must report any 
changes to the policy to FCA's Office of Secondary Market Oversight 
within 10 business days of adoption.
    (d) The interest rate risk management policy must, at a minimum:
    (1) Address the purpose and objectives of interest rate risk 
management;
    (2) Identify and analyze the causes of interest rate risks within 
Farmer Mac's existing balance sheet structure;
    (3) Require Farmer Mac to measure the potential impact of these 
risks on projected earnings and market values by conducting interest 
rate shock tests and simulations of multiple economic scenarios at least 
quarterly;
    (4) Describe and implement actions needed to obtain Farmer Mac's 
desired risk management objectives;
    (5) Document the objectives that Farmer Mac is attempting to achieve 
by purchasing eligible investments that are authorized by Sec. 652.35 
of this subpart;
    (6) Require Farmer Mac to evaluate and document, at least quarterly, 
whether these investments have actually met the objectives stated under 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
    (7) Identify exception parameters and post approvals needed for any 
exceptions to the policy's requirements;
    (8) Describe delegations of authority; and
    (9) Describe reporting requirements, including exceptions to policy 
limits.
    (e) At least quarterly, Farmer Mac's management must report to the 
Corporation's board of directors, or a designated subcommittee of the 
board, describing the nature and level of interest rate risk exposure. 
Any deviations from the board's policy on interest rate risk must be 
specifically identified in the report and approved by the board, or a 
designated subcommittee of the board.


<R05>
Sec. 652.20  Liquidity reserve management and requirements.

    (a) Minimum liquidity reserve requirement. Within 24 months of this 
rule becoming effective, and thereafter, Farmer Mac must hold cash, 
eligible non-program investments under Sec. 652.35 of this subpart, 
and/or on-balance sheet securities backed by portions of Farmer Mac 
program assets (loans) that are guaranteed by the United States 
Department of Agriculture as described in section 8.0(9)(B) of the Act 
(in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section), to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund a minimum of 60 days 
of maturing obligations, interest expense, and operating expenses at all 
times. You must document your compliance with this minimum reserve 
requirement at least once each month as of the last day of the month 
using month end data. Liquid asset values must be marked to market. In 
addition, you must have the capability and information systems in place 
to be able to calculate the minimum reserve requirement on a daily 
basis.
    (b) Free of lien. All investments held for the purpose of meeting 
the liquidity reserve requirement of this section

[[Page 316]]

must be free of liens or other encumbrances.
    (c) Discounts. The amount that may be counted to meet the minimum 
liquidity reserve requirement is as follows:
    (1) For cash and overnight investments, multiply the cash and 
investments by 100 percent;
    (2) For money market instruments with maturities of 5 business days 
or less, multiply the instruments by 97 percent of market value;
    (3) For money market instruments with maturities greater than 5 
business days and floating rate debt and preferred stock securities, 
multiply the instruments and securities by 95 percent of market value;
    (4) For diversified investment funds, multiply the individual 
securities in the funds by the discounts that would apply to the 
securities if held separately;
    (5) For fixed rate debt and preferred stock securities, multiply the 
securities by 90 percent of market value;
    (6) For securities backed by Farmer Mac program assets (loans) 
guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture as described 
in section 8.0(9)(B) of the Act, multiply the securities by 75 percent; 
and
    (7) We reserve the authority to modify or determine the appropriate 
discount for any investment used to meet the minimum liquidity reserve 
requirement if the otherwise applicable discount does not accurately 
reflect the liquidity of that investment or if the investment does not 
fit wholly within one of the specified investment categories. In making 
any modification or determination, we will consider the liquidity of the 
investment as well as any other relevant factors. We will provide notice 
of at least 20 business days before any modified discounts will take 
effect.
    (d) Liquidity reserve policy--board responsibilities. Farmer Mac's 
board of directors must adopt a liquidity reserve policy. The board must 
also ensure that management uses adequate internal controls to ensure 
compliance with the liquidity reserve policy standards, limitations, and 
reporting requirements established pursuant to this paragraph and to 
paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. At least annually, the 
board of directors or a designated subcommittee of the board must review 
and validate the liquidity policy's adequacy. The board of directors 
must approve any changes to the policy. You must provide a copy of the 
revised policy to FCA's Office of Secondary Market Oversight within 10 
business days of adoption.
    (e) Liquidity reserve policy--content. Your liquidity reserve policy 
must contain at a minimum the following:
    (1) The purpose and objectives of liquidity reserves;
    (2) A listing of specific assets, debt, and arrangements that can be 
used to meet liquidity objectives;
    (3) Diversification requirements of your liquidity reserve 
portfolio;
    (4) Maturity limits and credit quality standards for non-program 
investments used to meet the minimum liquidity reserve requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section;
    (5) The minimum and target (or optimum) amounts of liquidity that 
the board believes are appropriate for Farmer Mac;
    (6) The maximum amount of non-program investments that can be held 
for meeting Farmer Mac's liquidity needs, as expressed as a percentage 
of program assets and program obligations;
    (7) Exception parameters and post approvals needed;
    (8) Delegations of authority; and
    (9) Reporting requirements.
    (f) Liquidity reserve reporting--periodic reporting requirements. At 
least quarterly, Farmer Mac's management must report to the 
Corporation's board of directors or a designated subcommittee of the 
board describing, at a minimum, liquidity reserve compliance with the 
Corporation's policy and this section. Any deviations from the board's 
liquidity reserve policy (other than requirements specified in Sec. 
652.20(e)(5)) must be specifically identified in the report and approved 
by the board of directors.
    (g) Liquidity reserve reporting--special reporting requirements. 
Farmer Mac's management must immediately report to its board of 
directors any noncompliance with board policy requirements that are 
specified in Sec. 652.20(e)(5). Farmer Mac must report, in writing, to 
FCA's Office of Secondary Market

[[Page 317]]

Oversight no later than the next business day following the discovery of 
any breach of the minimum liquidity reserve requirement at Sec. 
652.20(a).


<R05>
Sec. 652.25  Non-program investment purposes and limitation.

    (a) Farmer Mac is authorized to hold eligible non-program 
investments listed under Sec. 652.35 for the purposes of complying with 
the interest rate risk requirements of Sec. 652.15, complying with the 
liquidity reserve requirements of Sec. 652.20, and managing surplus 
short-term funds.
    (b) Non-program investments cannot exceed the greater of $1.5 
billion or thirty-five (35) percent of program assets and program 
obligations, excluding 75 percent of the program assets that are 
guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture as described 
in section 8.0(9)(B) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 652.30  Temporary regulatory waivers or modifications for extraordinary situations.

    Whenever the FCA determines that an extraordinary situation exists 
that necessitates a temporary regulatory waiver or modification, the FCA 
may, in its sole discretion:
    (a) Modify or waive the minimum liquidity reserve requirement in 
Sec. 652.20 of this subpart; and/or
    (b) Modify the amount, qualities, and types of eligible investments 
that you are authorized to hold pursuant to Sec. 652.25 of this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 652.35  Eligible non-program investments.

    (a) You may hold only the types, quantities, and qualities of non-
program investments listed in the following Non-Program Investment 
Eligibility Criteria Table. These investments must be denominated in 
United States dollars.

[[Page 318]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JY05.000


[[Page 319]]


[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JY05.001

    (b) Rating of foreign countries. Whenever the obligor or issuer of 
an eligible investment is located outside the United States, the host 
country must

[[Page 320]]

maintain the highest sovereign rating for political and economic 
stability by an NRSRO.
    (c) Marketable investments. All eligible investments, except money 
market instruments, must be readily marketable. An eligible investment 
is marketable if you can sell it promptly at a price that closely 
reflects its fair value in an active and universally recognized 
secondary market. You must evaluate and document the size and liquidity 
of the secondary market for the investment at time of purchase.
    (d) Obligor limits. (1) You may not invest more than 25 percent of 
your regulatory capital in eligible investments issued by any single 
entity, issuer or obligor. This obligor limit does not apply to 
Government-sponsored agencies or Government agencies. You may not invest 
more than 100 percent of your regulatory capital in any one Government-
sponsored agency. There are no obligor limits for Government agencies.
    (2) Obligor limits for your holdings in an investment company. You 
must count securities that you hold through an investment company 
towards the obligor limits of this section unless the investment 
company's holdings of the security of any one issuer do not exceed 5 
percent of the investment company's total portfolio.
    (e) Preferred stock and other investments approved by the FCA. (1) 
You may purchase non-program investments in preferred stock issued by 
other Farm Credit System institutions only with our written prior 
approval. You may also purchase non-program investments other than those 
listed in the Non-Program Investment Eligibility Criteria Table at 
paragraph (a) of this section only with our written prior approval.
    (2) Your request for our approval must explain the risk 
characteristics of the investment and your purpose and objectives for 
making the investment.


<R05>
Sec. 652.40  Stress tests for mortgage securities.

    (a) You must perform stress tests to determine how interest rate 
changes will affect the cashflow and price of each mortgage security 
that you purchase and hold, except for adjustable rate mortgage 
securities that reprice at intervals of 12 months or less and are tied 
to an index. You must also use stress tests to gauge how interest rate 
fluctuations on mortgage securities affect your capital and earnings. 
The stress tests must be able to measure the price sensitivity of 
mortgage instruments over different interest rate/yield curve scenarios 
and be consistent with any asset liability management and interest rate 
risk policies. The methodology that you use to analyze mortgage 
securities must be appropriate for the complexity of the instrument's 
structure and cashflows. Prior to purchase and each quarter thereafter, 
you must use the stress tests to determine that the risk in the mortgage 
securities is within the risk limits of your board's investment 
policies. The stress tests must enable you to determine at the time of 
purchase and each subsequent quarter that the mortgage security does not 
expose your capital or earnings to excessive risks.
    (b) You must rely on verifiable information to support all your 
assumptions, including prepayment and interest rate volatility 
assumptions. You must document the basis for all assumptions that you 
use to evaluate the security and its underlying mortgages. You must also 
document all subsequent changes in your assumptions. If at any time 
after purchase, a mortgage security no longer complies with requirements 
in this section, Farmer Mac's management must report to the 
Corporation's board of directors in accordance with Sec. 652.10(g).

Sec. 652.45  Divestiture of ineligible non-program investments.

    (a) Divestiture requirements--(1) Initial divestiture requirements. 
Within 6 months of this rule's effective date, you must divest of all 
ineligible non-program investments or securities unless we approve, in 
writing, a plan that authorizes you to divest the instruments over a 
longer period of time. An acceptable plan generally would require you to 
divest of the ineligible investments or securities as quickly as 
possible without substantial financial loss.
    (2) Subsequent divestiture requirements. Subsequent to the initial 
divestiture

[[Page 321]]

period set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must divest of 
an ineligible non-program investment or security within 6 months unless 
we approve, in writing, a plan that authorizes you to divest the 
instrument over a longer period of time. An acceptable plan generally 
would require you to divest of the ineligible investment or security as 
quickly as possible without substantial financial loss.
    (b) Reporting requirements. Until you divest of the ineligible non-
program investment or security, you must report at least quarterly to 
your board of directors and to FCA's Office of Secondary Market 
Oversight about the status and performance of the ineligible instrument, 
the reasons why it remains ineligible, and the manager's progress in 
divesting of the investment.

<R05>
Sec. 652.65  Risk-based capital stress test.

    You will perform the risk-based capital stress test as described in 
summary form below and as described in detail in Appendix A to this 
subpart. The risk-based capital stress test spreadsheet is also 
available electronically at http://www.fca.gov. The risk-based capital 
stress test has five components:
    (a) Data requirements. You will use the following data to implement 
the risk-based capital stress test.
    (1) You will use Corporation loan-level data to implement the credit 
risk component of the risk-based capital stress test.
    (2) You will use Call Report data as the basis for Corporation data 
over the 10-year stress period supplemented with your interest rate risk 
measurements and tax data.
    (3) You will use other data, including the 10-year Constant Maturity 
Treasury (CMT) rate and the applicable Internal Revenue Service 
corporate income tax schedule, as further described in Appendix A to 
this subpart.
    (b) Credit risk. The credit risk part estimates loan losses during a 
period of sustained economic stress.
    (1) For each loan in the Farmer Mac I portfolio, you will determine 
a default probability by using the logit functions specified in Appendix 
A to this subpart with each of the following variables:
    (i) Borrower's debt-to-asset ratio at loan origination;
    (ii) Loan-to-value ratio at origination, which is the loan amount 
divided by the value of the property;
    (iii) Debt-service-coverage ratio at origination, which is the 
borrower's net income (on- and off-farm) plus depreciation, capital 
lease payments, and interest, less living expenses and income taxes, 
divided by the total term debt payments;
    (iv) The origination loan balance stated in 1997 dollars based on 
the consumer price index; and,
    (v) The worst-case percentage change in farmland values (23.52 
percent).
    (2) You will then calculate the loss rate by multiplying the default 
probability for each loan by the estimated loss-severity rate, which is 
the average loss of the defaulted loans in the data set (20.9 percent).
    (3) You will calculate losses by multiplying the loss rate by the 
origination loan balances stated in 1997 dollars.
    (4) You will adjust the losses for loan seasoning, based on the 
number of years since loan origination, according to the functions in 
Appendix A to this subpart.
    (5) The losses must be applied in the risk-based capital stress test 
as specified in Appendix A to this subpart.
    (c) Interest rate risk. (1) During the first year of the stress 
period, you will adjust interest rates for two scenarios, an increase in 
rates and a decrease in rates. You must determine your risk-based 
capital level based on whichever scenario would require more capital.
    (2) You will calculate the interest rate stress based on changes to 
the quarterly average of the 10-year CMT. The starting rate is the 3-
month average of the most recent CMT monthly rate series. To calculate 
the change in the starting rate, determine the average yield of the 
preceding 12 monthly 10-year CMT rates. Then increase and decrease the 
starting rate by:
    (i) 50 percent of the 12-month average if the average rate is less 
than 12 percent; or
    (ii) 600 basis points if the 12-month average rate is equal to or 
higher than 12 percent.
    (3) Following the first year of the stress period, interest rates 
remain at the new level for the remainder of the stress period.
    (4) You will apply the interest rate changes scenario as indicated 
in Appendix A to this subpart.
    (5) You may use other interest rate indices in addition to the 10-
year CMT subject to our concurrence, but in no event can your risk-based 
capital level

[[Page 323]]

be less than that determined by using only the 10-year CMT.
    (d) Cashflow generator. (1) You must adjust your financial 
statements based on the credit risk inputs and interest rate risk inputs 
described above to generate pro forma financial statements for each year 
of the 10-year stress test. The cashflow generator produces these 
financial statements. You may use the cashflow generator spreadsheet 
that is described in Appendix A to this subpart and available 
electronically at http://www.fca.gov. You may also use any reliable 
cashflow program that can develop or produce pro forma financial 
statements using generally accepted accounting principles and widely 
recognized financial modeling methods, subject to our concurrence. You 
may disaggregate financial data to any greater degree than that 
specified in Appendix A to this subpart, subject to our concurrence.
    (2) You must use model assumptions to generate financial statements 
over the 10-year stress period. The major assumption is that cashflows 
generated by the risk-based capital stress test are based on a steady-
state scenario. To implement a steady-state scenario, when on- and off-
balance sheet assets and liabilities amortize or are paid down, you must 
replace them with similar assets and liabilities. Replace amortized 
assets from discontinued loan programs with current loan programs. In 
general, keep assets with small balances in constant proportions to key 
program assets.
    (3) You must simulate annual pro forma balance sheets and income 
statements in the risk-based capital stress test using Farmer Mac's 
starting position, the credit risk and interest rate risk components, 
resulting cashflow outputs, current operating strategies and policies, 
and other inputs as shown in Appendix A to this subpart and the 
electronic spreadsheet available at http://www.fca.gov.
    (e) Calculation of capital requirement. The calculations that you 
must use to solve for the starting regulatory capital amount are shown 
in Appendix A to this subpart and in the electronic spreadsheet 
available at http://www.fca.gov.

                            1.0 Introduction

    a. Appendix A provides details about the risk-based capital stress 
test (stress test) for Farmer Mac. The stress test calculates the risk-
based capital level required by statute under stipulated conditions of 
credit risk and interest rate risk. The stress test uses loan-level data 
from Farmer Mac's agricultural mortgage portfolio or proxy data as 
described in section 4.1 d.(3) below, as well as

[[Page 325]]

quarterly Call Report and related information to generate pro forma 
financial statements and calculate a risk-based capital requirement. The 
stress test also uses historic agricultural real estate mortgage 
performance data, relevant economic variables, and other inputs in its 
calculations of Farmer Mac's capital needs over a 10-year period.
    b. Appendix A establishes the requirements for all components of the 
stress test. The key components of the stress test are: Specifications 
of credit risk, interest rate risk, the cashflow generator, and the 
capital calculation. Linkages among the components ensure that the 
measures of credit and interest rate risk pass into the cashflow 
generator. The linkages also transfer cashflows through the financial 
statements to represent values of assets, liabilities, and equity 
capital. The 10-year projection is designed to reflect a steady state in 
the scope and composition of Farmer Mac's assets.

                             2.0 Credit Risk

    Loan loss rates are determined by applying loss-frequency and loss-
severity equations to Farmer Mac loan-level data. From these equations, 
you must calculate loan losses under stressful economic conditions 
assuming Farmer Mac's portfolio remains at a ``steady state.'' Steady 
state assumes the underlying characteristics and risks of Farmer Mac's 
portfolio remain constant over the 10 years of the stress test. Loss 
rates are computed from estimated dollar losses for use in the stress 
test. The loan volume subject to loss throughout the stress test is then 
multiplied by the loss rate. Lastly, the stress test allocates losses to 
each of the 10 years assuming a time pattern for loss occurrence as 
discussed in section 4.3, ``Risk Measures.''

               2.1 Loss-Frequency and Loss-Severity Models

    a. Credit risks are modeled in the stress test using historical time 
series loan-level data to measure the frequency and severity of losses 
on agricultural mortgage loans. The model relates loss frequency and 
severity to loan-level characteristics and economic conditions through 
appropriately specified regression equations to account explicitly for 
the effects of these characteristics on loan losses. Loan losses for 
Farmer Mac are estimated from the resulting loss-frequency equation 
combined with the loss-severity factor by substituting the respective 
values of Farmer Mac's loan-level data or proxy data as described in 
section 4.1 d.(3) below, and applying stressful economic inputs.
    b. The loss-frequency equation and loss-severity factor were 
estimated from historical agricultural real estate mortgage loan data 
from the Farm Credit Bank of Texas (FCBT). Due to Farmer Mac's 
relatively short history, its own loan-level data are insufficiently 
developed for use in estimating the default frequency equation and loss-
severity factor. In the future, however, expansions in both the scope 
and historic length of Farmer Mac's lending operations may support the 
use of its data in estimating the relationships.
    c. To estimate the equations, the data used included FCBT loans, 
which satisfied three of the four underwriting standards Farmer Mac 
currently uses (estimation data). The four standards specify: (1) The 
debt-to-assets ratio (D/A) must be less than 0.50, (2) the loan-to-value 
ratio (LTV) must be less than 0.70, (3) the debt-service-coverage ratio 
(DSCR) must exceed 1.25, (4) and the current ratio (current assets 
divided by current liabilities) must exceed 1.0. Furthermore, the D/A 
and LTV ratios were restricted to be less than or equal to 0.85.
    d. Several limitations in the FCBT loan-level data affect 
construction of the loss-frequency equation. The data contained loans 
that were originated between 1979 and 1992, but there were virtually no 
losses during the early years of the sample period. As a result, losses 
attributable to specific loans are only available from 1986 through 
1992. In addition, no prepayment information was available in the data.
    e. The FCBT data used for estimation also included as performing 
loans, those loans that were re-amortized, paid in full, or merged with 
a new loan. Including these loans may lead to an understatement of loss-
frequency probabilities if some of the re-amortized, paid, or merged 
loans experience default or incur losses. In contrast, when the loans 
that are re-amortized, paid in full, or merged are excluded from the 
analysis, the loss-frequency rates are overstated if a higher proportion 
of loans that are re-amortized, paid in full, or combined (merged) into 
a new loan are non-default loans compared to live loans.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Excluding loans with defaults, 11,527 loans were active and 
7,515 loans were paid in full, re-amortized or merged as of 1992. A t-
test\2\ of the differences in the means for the group of defaulted loans 
and active loans indicated that active loans had significantly higher D/
A and LTV ratios, and lower current ratios than defaulted loans where 
loss occurred. These results indicate that, on average, active loans 
have potentially higher risk than loans that were re-amortized, paid in 
full, or merged.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    f. The structure of the historical FCBT data supports estimation of 
loss frequency based on origination information and economic conditions. 
Under an origination year approach, each observation is used only once 
in estimating loan default. The underwriting variables at origination 
and economic factors occurring over the life of the loan are then used 
to estimate loan-loss frequency.

[[Page 326]]

    g. The final loss-frequency equation is based on origination year 
data and represents a lifetime loss-frequency model. The final equation 
for loss frequency is:

p = 1/(1+exp(-(BX))

Where:

BX = (-12.62738) + 1.91259 [middot] X<INF>1</INF> + (-0.33830) [middot] 
X<INF>2</INF> / (1 + 0.0413299)<SUP>Periods</SUP> + (-0.19596) [middot] 
X<INF>3</INF> + 4.55390 [middot] (1-exp((-0.00538178) [middot] 
X<INF>4</INF>) + 2.49482 [middot] X<INF>5</INF>

Where:

<bullet<ls-thn-eq> p is the probability that a loan defaults and has 
positive losses (Pr (Y=1 [bond] x));
<bullet<ls-thn-eq> X<INF>1</INF> is the LTV ratio at loan origination 
raised to the power 5.3914596; \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Loss probability is likely to be more sensitive to changes in 
LTV at higher values of LTV. The power function provides a continuous 
relationship between LTV and defaults.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<bullet<ls-thn-eq> X<INF>2</INF> is the largest annual percentage 
decline in FCBT farmland values during the life of the loan dampened 
with a factor of 0.0413299 per year; \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The dampening function reflects the declining effect that the 
maximum land value decline has on the probability of default when it 
occurs later in a loan's life.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<bullet<ls-thn-eq> X<INF>3</INF> is the DSCR at loan origination;
<bullet<ls-thn-eq> X<INF>4</INF> is 1 minus the exponential of the 
product of negative 0.00538178 and the original loan balance in 1997 
dollars expressed in thousands; and
<bullet<ls-thn-eq> X<INF>5</INF> is the D/A ratio at loan origination.

    h. The estimated logit coefficients and p-values are: \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The nonlinear parameters for the variable transformations were 
simultaneously estimated using SAS version 8e NLIN procedure. The NLIN 
procedure produces estimates of the parameters of a nonlinear 
transformation for LTV, dampening factor, and loan-size variables. To 
implement the NLIN procedure, the loss-frequency equation and its 
variables are declared and initial parameter values supplied. The NLIN 
procedure is an iterative process that uses the initial parameter values 
as the starting values for the first iteration and continues to iterate 
until acceptable parameters are solved. The initial values for the power 
function and dampening function are based on the proposed rule. The 
procedure for the initial values for the size variable parameter is 
provided in an Excel spreadsheet posted at http://www.fca.gov. The 
Gauss-Newton method is the selected iterative solving process. As 
described in the preamble, the loss-frequency function for the nonlinear 
model is the negative of the log-likelihood function, thus producing 
maximum likelihood estimates. In order to obtain statistical properties 
for the loss-frequency equation and verify the logistic coefficients, 
the estimates for the nonlinear transformations are applied to the FCBT 
data and the loss-frequency model is re-estimated using the SAS Logistic 
procedure. The SAS procedures, output reports and Excel spreadsheet used 
to estimate the parameters of the loss-frequency equation are located on 
the Web site http://www.fca.gov.

X5: D/A ratio...........................         2.49482         <0.0000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    i. The low p-values on each coefficient indicate a highly 
significant relationship between the probability ratio of loan-loss 
frequency and the respective independent variables. Other goodness-of-
fit indicators are:

Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value................       0.1718
Max-rescaled R\2\..........................................       0.2015
Concordant.................................................        85.2%
Disconcordant..............................................        12.0%
Tied.......................................................         2.8%
 

    j. These variables have logical relationships to the incidence of 
loan default and loss, as evidenced by the findings of numerous credit-
scoring studies in agricultural finance.\5\ Each of the variable 
coefficients has directional relationships that appropriately capture 
credit risk from underwriting variables and, therefore, the incidence of 
loan-loss frequency. The frequency of loan loss was found to differ 
significantly across all of the loan characteristics and lending 
conditions. Farmland values represent an appropriate variable for 
capturing the effects of exogenous economic factors. It is commonly 
accepted that farmland values at any point in time reflect the 
discounted present value of expected returns to the land.\6\ Thus,

[[Page 327]]

changes in land values, as expressed in the loss-frequency equation, 
represent the combined effects of the level and growth rates of farm 
income, interest rates, and inflationary expectations--each of which is 
accounted for in the discounted, present value process.

which the stress test is conducted, using either submitted data or proxy 
data as described in section 4.1 d.(3) below. For the variable 
X<INF>2</INF>, the stressful input value from the benchmark loss 
experience is -23.52 percent. You must apply this input to all Farmer 
Mac loans subject to loss to calculate loss frequency under stressful 
economic conditions.\7\ The maximum land value decline from the 
benchmark loss experience is the simple average of annual land value 
changes for Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota for the years 1984 and 
1985.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ On- and off-balance sheet Farmer Mac I agricultural mortgage 
program assets booked after the 1996 Act amendments are subject to the 
loss calculation.
    \8\ While the worst-case losses, based on origination year, occurred 
during 1983 and 1984, this benchmark was determined using annual land 
value changes that occurred 2 years later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    l. Forecasting with data outside the range of the estimation data 
requires special treatment for implementation. While the estimation data 
embody Farmer Mac values for various loan characteristics, the maximum 
farmland price decline experienced in Texas was -16.69 percent, a value 
below the benchmark experience of -23.52 percent. To control for this 
effect, you must apply a procedure that restricts the slope of all the 
independent variables to that observed at the maximum land value decline 
observed in the estimation data. Essentially, you must approximate the 
slope of the loss-frequency equation at the point -16.69 percent in 
order to adjust the probability of loan default and loss occurrence for 
data beyond the range in the estimating data. The adjustment procedure 
is shown in step 4 of section 2.3 entitled, ``Example Calculation of 
Dollar Loss on One Loan.''
    m. Loss severity was not found to vary systematically and was 
considered constant across the tested loan characteristics and lending 
conditions. Thus, the simple weighted average by loss volume of 20.9 
percent is used in the stress test.\9\ You must multiply loss severity 
with the probability estimate computed from the loss-frequency equation 
to determine the loss rate for a loan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ We calculated the weighted-average loss severity from the 
estimation data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    n. Using original loan balance results in estimated probabilities of 
loss frequency over the entire life of a loan. To account for loan 
seasoning, you must reduce the loan-loss exposure by the cumulative 
probability of loss already experienced by each loan as discussed in 
section 2.2 entitled, ``Loan-Seasoning Adjustment.'' This subtraction is 
based on loan age and reduces the loss estimated by the loss-frequency 
and loss-severity equations. The result is an age-adjusted lifetime 
dollar loss that can be used in subsequent calculations of loss rates as 
discussed in section 2.4, ``Calculation of Loss Rates for Use in the 
Stress Test.''

                      2.2 Loan-Seasoning Adjustment

    a. You must use the seasoning function supplied by FCA to adjust the 
calculated probability of loss for each Farmer Mac loan for the 
cumulative loss exposure already experienced based on the age of each 
loan. The seasoning function is based on the same data used to determine 
the loss-frequency equation and an assumed average life of 14 years for 
agricultural mortgages. If we determine that the relationship between 
the loss experience in Farmer Mac's portfolio over time and the 
seasoning function can be improved, we may augment or replace the 
seasoning function.
    b. The seasoning function is parameterized as a beta distribution 
with parameters of p = 4.288 and q = 5.3185.\10\ How the loan-seasoning 
distribution is used is shown in Step 7 of section 2.3, ``Example 
Calculation of Dollar Loss on One Loan.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ We estimated the loan-seasoning distribution from portfolio 
aggregate charge-off rates from the estimation data. To do so, we 
arrayed all defaulting loans where loss occurred according to the time 
from origination to default. Then, a beta distribution, [beta](p, q), 
was fit to the estimation data scaled to the maximum time a loan 
survived (14 years).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

           2.3 Example Calculation of Dollar Loss on One Loan

    Here is an example of the calculation of the dollar losses for an 
individual loan with the following characteristics and input values: 
\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ In the examples presented we rounded the numbers, but the 
example calculation is based on a larger number of significant digits. 
The stress test uses additional digits carried at the default precision 
of the software.

Loan Origination Year......................................         1996
Loan Origination Balance...................................   $1,250,000
LTV at Origination.........................................          0.5
D/A at Origination.........................................          0.5
DSCR at Origination........................................       1.3984

[[Page 328]]

 
Maximum Percentage Land Price Decline (MAX)................       -23.52
 

    Step 1: Convert 1996 Origination Value to 1997 dollar value (LOAN) 
based on the consumer price index and transform as follows:
$1,278,500 = $1,250,000 [middot] 1.0228
0.998972 = 1 - exp((-.00538178) [middot] $1,278,500 / 1000)
    Step 2: Calculate the default probabilities using -16.64 percent and 
-16.74 percent land value declines as follows: \12\

    \12\ This process facilitates the approximation of slope needed to 
adjust the loss probabilities for land value declines greater than 
observed in the estimation data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where:

Z<INF>1</INF> = (-12.62738) + 1.91259 [middot] LTV<SUP>5.3914596</SUP> - 
0.33830 [middot] (-16.6439443) - 0.19596 [middot] DSCR + 4.55390 
[middot] 0.998972 + 2.49482 [middot] DA = (-1.428509)
Default Loss Frequency at (-16.64%) =

1 / 1 + exp<SUP>-(-1.428509)</SUP> = 0.19333111
And

Z<INF>1</INF> = (-12.62738) + 1.91259 [middot] LTV<SUP>5.3914596</SUP> - 
0.33830 [middot] (-16.7439443) - 0.19596 [middot] DSCR + 4.55390 
[middot] 0.998972 + 2.49482 [middot] DA = (-1.394679)

Loss Frequency Probability at (-16.74%) =
1 / 1 + exp<SUP>-(-1.394679)</SUP> = 0.19866189

    Step 3: Calculate the slope adjustment. You must calculate slope by 
subtracting the difference between ``Loss-Frequency Probability at -
16.64 percent'' and ``Loss-Frequency Probability at -16.74 percent'' and 
dividing by -0.1 (the difference between -16.64 percent and -16.74 
percent) as follows:

0.05330776 = (0.19333111 - 0.19866189) / -0.1

    Step 4: Make the linear adjustment. You make the adjustment by 
increasing the loss-frequency probability where the dampened stressed 
farmland value input is less than -16.69 percent to reflect the stressed 
farmland value input, appropriately discounted. As discussed previously, 
the stressed land value input is discounted to reflect the declining 
effect that the maximum land value decline has on the probability of 
default when it occurs later in a loan's life.\13\ The linear adjustment 
is the difference between -16.69 percent land value decline and the 
adjusted stressed maximum land value decline input of -23.52 multiplied 
by the slope estimated in Step 3 as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ The dampened period is the number of years from the beginning 
of the origination year to the current year (i.e., January 1, 1996 to 
January 1, 2000 is 4 years).

Loss Frequency at -16.69 percent =
Z<INF>1</INF> = (-12.62738) + (1.91259)(LTV<SUP>5.3914596</SUP>) - 
(0.33830)(-16.6939443) - (0.19596)(DSCR) + (4.55390)(0.998972) + 
(2.49482)(DA) = -1.411594
And

1 / 1 + exp<SUP>-(-1.411594)</SUP> = 0.19598279
Dampened Maximum Land Price Decline = (-20.00248544) = (-
23.52)(1.0413299)<SUP>-4</SUP>
Slope Adjustment = 0.17637092 = 0.053312247 [middot] (-16.6939443 - (-
20.00248544))
Loan Default Probability = 0.37235371 = 0.19598279 + 0.17637092

    Step 5: Multiply loan default probability times the average severity 
of 0.209 as follows:
0.077821926 = 0.37235371 [middot] 0.209

    Step 6: Multiply the loss rate times the origination loan balance as 
follows:

$97,277 = $1,250,000 [middot] 0.077821926

    Step 7: Adjust the origination based dollar losses for 4 years of 
loan seasoning as follows:

$81,987 = $97,277 - $97,277 [middot] (0.157178762) \14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ The age of adjustment of 0.157178762 is determined from the 
beta distribution for a 4-year-old loan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        2.4 Calculation of Loss Rates for Use in the Stress Test

    a. You must compute the loss rates by state as the dollar weighted 
average seasoned loss rates from the Cash Window and Standby loan 
portfolios by state. The spreadsheet entitled, ``Credit Loss 
Module.XLS'' can be used for these calculations. This spreadsheet is 
available for download on our Web site, www.fca.gov, or will be provided 
upon request. The blended loss rates for each state are copied from the 
``Credit Loss Module'' to the stress test spreadsheet for determining 
Farmer Mac's regulatory capital requirement.
    b. The stress test use of the blended loss rates is further 
discussed in section 4.3, ``Risk Measures.''

                         3.0 Interest Rate Risk

    The stress test explicitly accounts for Farmer Mac's vulnerability 
to interest rate risk from the movement in interest rates specified in 
the statute. The stress test considers Farmer Mac's interest rate risk 
position through the current structure of its balance sheet, reported 
interest rate risk shock-test results,\15\ and other financial 
activities. The stress test calculates the effect of interest rate risk 
exposure through market value changes of interest-bearing assets, 
liabilities, and off-balance sheet transactions, and thereby the effects 
to equity capital. The stress test also captures this exposure through 
the cashflows on rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. We discuss how 
to calculate the dollar impact of interest rate risk in section 4.6, 
``Balance Sheets.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See paragraph c. of section 4.1 entitled, ``Data Inputs,'' for 
a description of the interest rate risk shock-reporting requirement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 329]]

         3.1 Process for Calculating the Interest Rate Movement

    a. The stress test uses the 10-year Constant Maturity Treasury (10-
year CMT) released by the Federal Reserve in HR. 15, ``Selected Interest 
Rates.'' The stress test uses the 10-year CMT to generate earnings 
yields on assets, expense rates on liabilities, and changes in the 
market value of assets and liabilities. For stress test purposes, the 
starting rate for the 10-year CMT is the 3-month average of the most 
recent monthly rate series published by the Federal Reserve. The 3-month 
average is calculated by summing the latest monthly series of the 10-
year CMT and dividing by three. For instance, you would calculate the 
initial rate on June 30, 1999, as:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                10-year
                                                                  CMT
                          Month end                             monthly
                                                                 series
------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/1999......................................................       5.18
05/1999......................................................       5.54
06/1999......................................................       5.90
Average......................................................       5.54
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    b. The amount by which the stress test shocks the initial rate up 
and down is determined by calculating the 12-month average of the 10-
year CMT monthly series. If the resulting average is less than 12 
percent, the stress test shocks the initial rate by an amount determined 
by multiplying the 12-month average rate by 50 percent. However, if the 
average is greater than or equal to 12 percent, the stress test shocks 
the initial rate by 600 basis points. For example, determine the amount 
by which to increase and decrease the initial rate for June 30, 1999, as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                10-year
                                                                  CMT
                          Month end                             monthly
                                                                 series
------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/1998......................................................       5.46
08/1998......................................................       5.34
09/1998......................................................       4.81
10/1998......................................................       4.53
11/1998......................................................       4.83
12/1998......................................................       4.65
01/1999......................................................       4.72
02/1999......................................................       5.00
03/1999......................................................       5.23
04/1999......................................................       5.18
05/1999......................................................       5.54
06/1999......................................................       5.90
12-Month Average.............................................       5.10
------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Calculation of shock amount
------------------------------------------------------------------------
12-Month Average Less than 12%................  Yes.
12-Month Average..............................  5.10.
Multiply the 12-Month Average by..............  50%.
Shock in basis points equals..................  255.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    c. You must run the stress test for two separate changes in interest 
rates: (i) An immediate increase in the initial rate by the shock 
amount; and (ii) immediate decrease in the initial rate by the shock 
amount. The stress test then holds the changed interest rate constant 
for the remainder of the 10-year stress period. For example, at June 30, 
1999, the stress test would be run for an immediate and sustained (for 
10 years) upward movement in interest rates to 8.09 percent (5.54 
percent plus 255 basis points) and also for an immediate and sustained 
(for 10 years) downward movement in interest rates to 2.99 percent (5.54 
percent minus 255 basis points). The movement in interest rates that 
results in the greatest need for capital is then used to determine 
Farmer Mac's risk-based capital requirement.

                4.0 Elements Used in Generating Cashflows

    a. This section describes the elements that are required for 
implementation of the stress test and assessment of Farmer Mac capital 
performance through time. An Excel spreadsheet named FAMC RBCST, 
available at http://www.fca.gov, contains the stress test, including the 
cashflow generator. The spreadsheet contains the following seven 
worksheets:
    (1) Data Input;
    (2) Assumptions and Relationships;
    (3) Risk Measures (credit risk and interest rate risk);
    (4) Loan and Cash Flow Accounts;
    (5) Income Statements;
    (6) Balance Sheets; and
    (7) Capital.
    b. Each of the components is described in further detail below with 
references where appropriate to the specific worksheets within the Excel 
spreadsheet. The stress test may be generally described as a set of 
linked financial statements that evolve over a period of 10 years using 
generally accepted accounting conventions and specified sets of stressed 
inputs. The stress test uses the initial financial condition of Farmer 
Mac, including earnings and funding relationships, and the credit and 
interest rate stressed inputs to calculate Farmer Mac's capital 
performance through time. The stress test then subjects the initial 
financial conditions to the first period set of credit and interest rate 
risk stresses, generates cashflows by asset and liability category, 
performs necessary accounting postings into relevant accounts, and 
generates an income statement associated with the first interval of 
time. The stress test then uses the income statement to update the 
balance sheet for the end of period 1 (beginning of period 2). All 
necessary capital calculations for that point in time are then 
performed.
    c. The beginning of the period 2 balance sheet then serves as the 
departure point for the second income cycle. The second period's 
cashflows and resulting income statement

[[Page 330]]

are generated in similar fashion as the first period's except all inputs 
(i.e., the periodic loan losses, portfolio balance by category, and 
liability balances) are updated appropriately to reflect conditions at 
that point in time. The process evolves forward for a period of 10 years 
with each pair of balance sheets linked by an intervening set of 
cashflow and income statements. In this and the following sections, 
additional details are provided about the specification of the income-
generating model to be used by Farmer Mac in calculating the risk-based 
capital requirement.

                             4.1 Data Inputs

    The stress test requires the initial financial statement conditions 
and income generating relationships for Farmer Mac. The worksheet named 
``Data Inputs'' contains the complete data inputs and the data form used 
in the stress test. The stress test uses these data and various 
assumptions to calculate pro forma financial statements. For stress test 
purposes, Farmer Mac is required to supply:
    a. Call Report Schedules RC: Balance Sheet and RI: Income Statement. 
These schedules form the starting financial position for the stress 
test. In addition, the stress test calculates basic financial 
relationships and assumptions used in generating pro forma annual 
financial statements over the 10-year stress period. Financial 
relationships and assumptions are in section 4.2, ``Assumptions and 
Relationships.''
    b. Cashflow Data for Asset and Liability Account Categories. The 
necessary cashflow data for the spreadsheet-based stress test are book 
value, weighted average yield, weighted average maturity, conditional 
prepayment rate, weighted average amortization, and weighted average 
guarantee fees. The spreadsheet uses this cashflow information to 
generate starting and ending account balances, interest earnings, 
guarantee fees, and interest expense. Each asset and liability account 
category identified in this data requirement is discussed in section 
4.2, ``Assumptions and Relationships.''
    c. Interest Rate Risk Measurement Results. The stress test uses the 
results from Farmer Mac's interest rate risk model to represent changes 
in the market value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet 
positions during upward and downward instantaneous shocks in interest 
rates of 300, 250, 200, 150, and 100 basis points. The stress test uses 
these data to calculate a schedule of estimated effective durations 
representing the market value effects from a change in interest rates. 
The stress test uses a linear interpolation of the duration schedule to 
relate a change in interest rates to a change in the market value of 
equity. This calculation is described in section 4.4 entitled, ``Loan 
and Cashflow Accounts,'' and is illustrated in the referenced worksheet 
of the stress test.
    d. Loan-Level Data for all Farmer Mac I Program Assets.
    (1) The stress test requires loan-level data for all Farmer Mac I 
program assets to determine lifetime age-adjusted loss rates. The 
specific loan data fields required for running the credit risk component 
are:

                  Farmer Mac I Program Loan Data Fields

    (2) From the loan-level data, you must identify the geographic 
distribution by state of Farmer Mac's loan portfolio and enter the 
current loan balance for each state in the ``Data Inputs'' worksheet. 
The lifetime age-adjustment of origination year loss rates was discussed 
in section 2.0, ``Credit Risk.'' The lifetime age-adjusted loss rates 
are entered in the ``Risk Measures'' worksheet of the stress test. The 
stress test application of the loss rates is discussed in section 4.3, 
``Risk Measures.''
    (3) Under certain circumstances, described below, you must 
substitute the following data proxies for the variables LTV, DSCR, and 
D/A: LTV = 0.70, DSCR = 1.25, and D/A = 0.50. The substitution must be 
done whenever any of these data are missing, i.e., cells are blank, or 
one or more of the conditions in the following table is true.

    In addition, the following loan data adjustments must be made in 
response to the situations listed below:

 loan data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Application of proxy data recognizes that underwriting data on
  seasoned Standby loans are not reviewed by Farmer Mac in favor of
  other criteria and frequently not origination data.

    Further, because it would not be possible to compile an exhaustive 
list of loan data anomalies, FCA reserves the authority to require an 
explanation on other data anomalies it identifies and to apply the loan 
data proxies on such cases until the anomaly is adequately addressed by 
the Corporation.
    e. Other Data Requirements. Other data elements are taxes paid over 
the previous 2 years, the corporate tax schedule, selected line items 
from Schedule RS-C of the Call Report, and 10-year CMT information as 
discussed in section 3.1 entitled, ``Process for Calculating the 
Interest Rate Movement.'' The stress test uses the corporate tax 
schedule and previous taxes paid to determine the appropriate amount of 
taxes, including available loss carry-backs and loss carry-forwards. 
Three line items found in sections Part II.2.a. and 2.b. of Call Report 
Schedule RS-C Capital Calculation must also be entered in the ``Data 
Inputs'' sheet. The two line items found in Part II.2.a. contain the 
dollar volume off-balance sheet assets relating to the Farmer Mac I and 
II programs. The off-balance sheet program asset dollar volumes are used 
to calculate the operating expense regression on a quarterly basis. The 
single-line item found in Part II.2.b. provides the amount of other off-
balance sheet obligations and is presented in the balance sheet section 
of the stress test for purposes of completeness. The 10-year CMT 
quarterly average of the monthly series and the 12-month average of the 
monthly series must be entered in the ``Data Inputs'' sheet. These two 
data elements are used to determine the starting interest rate and the 
level of the interest rate shock applied in the stress test.

                    4.2 Assumptions and Relationships

    a. The stress test assumptions are summarized on the worksheet 
called ``Assumptions and Relationships.'' Some of the entries on this 
page are direct user entries. Other entries are relationships generated 
from data supplied by Farmer Mac or other sources as discussed in 
section 4.1, ``Data Inputs.'' After current financial data are entered, 
the user selects the date for running the stress test. This action 
causes the stress test to identify and select the appropriate data from 
the ``Data Inputs'' worksheet. The next section highlights the degree of 
disaggregation needed to maintain reasonably representative financial 
characterizations of Farmer Mac in the stress test. Several specific 
assumptions are established about the future relationships of account 
balances and how they evolve.
    b. From the data and assumptions, the stress test computes pro forma 
financial statements for 10 years. The stress test must be run as a 
``steady state'' with regard to program balances, and where possible, 
will use information gleaned from recent financial statements and other 
data supplied by Farmer Mac to establish earnings and cost

[[Page 332]]

relationships on major program assets that are applied forward in time. 
As documented in the stress test, entries of ``1'' imply no growth and/
or no change in account balances or proportions relative to initial 
conditions with the exception of pre-1996 loan volume being transferred 
to post-1996 loan volume. The interest rate risk and credit loss 
components are applied to the stress test through time. The individual 
sections of that worksheet are:
    (1) Elements related to cashflows, earnings rates, and disposition 
of discontinued program assets.
    (A) The stress test accounts for earnings rates by asset class and 
cost rates on funding. The stress test aggregates investments into the 
categories of: Cash and money market securities; commercial paper; 
certificates of deposit; agency mortgage-backed securities and 
collateralized mortgage obligations; and other investments. With FCA's 
concurrence, Farmer Mac is permitted to further disaggregate these 
categories. Similarly, we may require new categories for future 
activities to be added to the stress test. Loan items requiring separate 
accounts include the following:
    (i) Farmer Mac I program assets post-1996 Act;
    (ii) Farmer Mac I program assets post-1996 Act Swap balances;
    (iii) Farmer Mac I program assets pre-1996 Act;
    (iv) Farmer Mac I AgVantage securities;
    (v) Loans held for securitization; and
    (vi) Farmer Mac II program assets.
    (B) The stress test also uses data elements related to amortization 
and prepayment experience to calculate and process the implied rates at 
which asset and liability balances terminate or ``roll off'' through 
time. Further, for each category, the stress test has the capacity to 
track account balances that are expected to change through time for each 
of the above categories. For purposes of the stress test, all assets are 
assumed to maintain a ``steady state'' with the implication that any 
principal balances retired or prepaid are replaced with new balances. 
The exceptions are that expiring pre-1996 Act program assets are 
replaced with post-1996 Act program assets.
    (2) Elements related to other balance sheet assumptions through 
time. As well as interest earning assets, the other categories of the 
balance sheet that are modeled through time include interest receivable, 
guarantee fees receivable, prepaid expenses, accrued interest payable, 
accounts payable, accrued expenses, reserves for losses (loans held and 
guaranteed securities), and other off-balance sheet obligations. The 
stress test is consistent with Farmer Mac's existing reporting 
categories and practices. If reporting practices change substantially, 
the above list will be adjusted accordingly. The stress test has the 
capacity to have the balances in each of these accounts determined based 
upon existing relationships to other earning accounts, to keep their 
balances either in constant proportions of loan or security accounts, or 
to evolve according to a user-selected rule. For purposes of the stress 
test, these accounts are to remain constant relative to the proportions 
of their associated balance sheet accounts that generated the accrued 
balances.
    (3) Elements related to income and expense assumptions. Several 
other parameters that are required to generate pro forma financial 
statements may not be easily captured from historic data or may have 
characteristics that suggest that they be individually supplied. These 
parameters are the gain on agricultural mortgage-backed securities 
(AMBS) sales, miscellaneous income, operating expenses, reserve 
requirement, and guarantee fees.
    (A) The stress test applies the actual weighted average gain rate on 
sales of AMBS over the most recent 3 years to the dollar amount of AMBS 
sold during the most recent four quarters in order to estimate gain on 
sale of AMBS over the stress period.
    (B) The stress test assumes miscellaneous income at a level equal to 
the average of the most recent 3-year's actual miscellaneous income as a 
percent of the sum of; cash, investments, guaranteed securities, and 
loans held for investment.
    (C) Operating costs are determined in the model using weighted 
moving average of operating expenses as a percentage of the sum of on-
balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet program activities over the 
previous four quarters inclusive of the current submission date. The 
share will then be applied forward to the balances of the same 
categories throughout the 10-year period of the RBCST model. As 
additional data accumulate, the specification will be re-examined and 
modified if we deem changing the specification results in a more 
appropriate representation of operating expenses.
    (D) The reserve requirement as a fraction of loan assets can also be 
specified. However, the stress test is run with the reserve requirement 
set to zero. Setting the parameter to zero causes the stress test to 
calculate a risk-based capital level that is comparable to regulatory 
capital, which includes reserves. Thus, the risk-based capital 
requirement contains the regulatory capital required, including 
reserves. The amount of total capital that is allocated to the reserve 
account is determined by GAAP. The stress test applies quarterly updates 
of the weighted average guarantee rates for post-1996 Farmer Mac I 
assets, pre-1996 Farmer Mac I assets, and Farmer Mac II assets.
    (4) Elements related to earnings rates and funding costs.

[[Page 333]]

    (A) The stress test can accommodate numerous specifications of 
earnings and funding costs. In general, both relationships are tied to 
the 10-year CMT interest rate. Specifically, each investment account, 
each loan item, and each liability account can be specified as fixed 
rate, or fixed spread to the 10-year CMT with initial rates determined 
by actual data. The stress test calculates specific spreads (weighted 
average yield less initial 10-year CMT) by category from the weighted 
average yield data supplied by Farmer Mac as described earlier. For 
example, the fixed spread for Farmer Mac I program post-1996 Act 
mortgages is calculated as follows:

Fixed Spread = Weighted Average Yield less 10-year CMT 0.014 = 0.0694--
          0.0554

    (B) The resulting fixed spread of 1.40 percent is then added to the 
10-year CMT when it is shocked to determine the new yield. For instance, 
if the 10-year CMT is shocked upward by 300 basis points, the yield on 
Farmer Mac I program post-1996 Act loans would change as follows:

Yield = Fixed Spread + 10-year CMT .0994 = .014 + .0854

    (C) The adjusted yield is then used for income calculations when 
generating pro forma financial statements. All fixed-spread asset and 
liability classes are computed in an identical manner using starting 
yields provided as data inputs from Farmer Mac. The fixed-yield option 
holds the starting yield data constant for the entire 10-year stress 
test period. You must run the stress test using the fixed-spread option 
for all accounts except for discontinued program activities, such as 
Farmer Mac I program loans made before the 1996 Act. For discontinued 
loans, the fixed-rate specification must be used if the loans are 
primarily fixed-rate mortgages.
    (5) Elements related to interest rate shock test. As described 
earlier, the interest rate shock test is implemented as a single set of 
forward interest rates. The stress test applies the up-rate scenario and 
down-rate scenario separately. The stress test also uses the results of 
Farmer Mac's shock test, as described in paragraph c. of section 4.1, 
``Data Inputs,'' to calculate the impact on equity from a stressful 
change in interest rates as discussed in section 3.0 titled, ``Interest 
Rate Risk.'' The stress test uses a schedule relating a change in 
interest rates to a change in the market value of equity. For instance, 
if interest rates are shocked upward so that the percentage change is 
262 basis points, the linearly interpolated effective estimated duration 
of equity is -6.7405 years given Farmer Mac's interest rate measurement 
results at 250 and 300 basis points of -6.7316 and 76.7688 years, 
respectively found on the effective duration schedule. The stress test 
uses the linearly interpolated estimated effective duration for equity 
to calculate the market value change by multiplying duration by the base 
value of equity before any rate change from Farmer Mac's interest rate 
risk measurement results with the percentage change in interest rates.

                            4.3 Risk Measures

    a. This section describes the elements of the stress test in the 
worksheet named ``Risk Measures'' that reflect the interest rate shock 
and credit loss requirements of the stress test.
    b. As described in section 3.1, the stress test applies the 
statutory interest rate shock to the initial 10-year CMT rate. It then 
generates a series of fixed annual interest rates for the 10-year stress 
period that serve as indices for earnings yields and cost of funds rates 
used in the stress test. (See the ``Risk Measures'' worksheet for the 
resulting interest rate series used in the stress test.)
    c. The Credit Loss Module's state-level loss rates, as described in 
section 2.4 entitled, ``Calculation of Loss Rates for Use in the Stress 
Test,'' are entered into the ``Risk Measures'' worksheet and applied to 
the loan balances that exist in each state. The distribution of loan 
balances by state is used to allocate new loans that replace loan 
products that roll off the balance sheet through time. The loss rates 
are applied both to the initial volume and to new loan volume that 
replaces expiring loans. The total life of loan losses that are expected 
at origination are then allocated through time based on a set of user 
entries describing the time-path of losses.
    d. The loss rates estimated in the credit risk component of the 
stress test are based on an origination year concept, adjusted for loan 
seasoning. All losses arising from loans originated in a particular year 
are expressed as lifetime age-adjusted losses irrespective of when the 
losses actually occur. The fraction of the origination year loss rates 
that must be used to allocate losses through time are 43 percent to year 
1, 17 percent to year 2, 11.66 percent to year 3, and 4.03 percent for 
the remaining years. The total allocated losses in any year are 
expressed as a percent of loan volume in that year to reflect the 
conversion to exposure year.

                     4.4 Loan and Cashflow Accounts

    The worksheet labeled ``Loan and Cashflow Data'' contains the 
categorized loan data and cashflow accounting relationships that are 
used in the stress test to generate projections of Farmer Mac's 
performance and condition. As can be seen in the worksheet, the steady-
state formulation results in account balances that remain constant 
except for the effects of discontinued programs. For assets with 
maturities under 1 year, the results are

[[Page 334]]

reported for convenience as though they matured only one time per year 
with the additional convention that the earnings/cost rates are 
annualized. For the pre-1996 Act assets, maturing balances are added 
back to post-1996 Act account balances. The liability accounts are used 
to satisfy the accounting identity, which requires assets to equal 
liabilities plus owner equity. In addition to the replacement of 
maturities under a steady state, liabilities are increased to reflect 
net losses or decreased to reflect resulting net gains. Adjustments must 
be made to the long- and short-term debt accounts to maintain the same 
relative proportions as existed at the beginning period from which the 
stress test is run. The primary receivable and payable accounts are also 
maintained on this worksheet, as is a summary balance of the volume of 
loans subject to credit losses.

                          4.5 Income Statements

    a. Information related to income performance through time is 
contained on the worksheet named ``Income Statements.'' Information from 
the first period balance sheet is used in conjunction with the earnings 
and cost-spread relationships from Farmer Mac supplied data to generate 
the first period's income statement. The same set of accounts is 
maintained in this worksheet as ``Loan and Cashflow Accounts'' for 
consistency in reporting each annual period of the 10-year stress period 
of the test. The income from each interest-bearing account is 
calculated, as are costs of interest-bearing liabilities. In each case, 
these entries are the associated interest rate for that period 
multiplied by the account balances.
    b. The credit losses described in section 2.0, ``Credit Risk,'' are 
transmitted through the provision account, as is any change needed to 
re-establish the target reserve balance. For determining risk-based 
capital, the reserve target is set to zero as previously indicated in 
section 4.2. Under the income tax section, it must first be determined 
whether it is appropriate to carry forward tax losses or recapture tax 
credits. The tax section then establishes the appropriate income tax 
liability that permits the calculation of final net income (loss), which 
is credited (debited) to the retained earnings account.

                           4.6 Balance Sheets

    a. The worksheet named ``Balance Sheets'' is used to construct pro 
forma balance sheets from which the capital calculations can be 
performed. As can be seen in the Excel spreadsheet, the worksheet is 
organized to correspond to Farmer Mac's normal reporting practices. 
Asset accounts are built from the initial financial statement 
conditions, and loan and cashflow accounts. Liability accounts including 
the reserve account are likewise built from the previous period's 
results to balance the asset and equity positions. The equity section 
uses initial conditions and standard accounts to monitor equity through 
time. The equity section maintains separate categories for increments to 
paid-in-capital and retained earnings and for mark-to-market effects of 
changes in account values. The process described below in the 
``Capital'' worksheet uses the initial retained earnings and paid-in-
capital account to test for the change in initial capital that permits 
conformance to the statutory requirements. Therefore, these accounts 
must be maintained separately for test solution purposes.
    b. The market valuation changes due to interest rate movements must 
be computed utilizing the linearly interpolated schedule of estimated 
equity effects due to changes in interest rates, contained in the 
``Assumptions & Relationships'' worksheet. The stress test calculates 
the dollar change in the market value of equity by multiplying the base 
value of equity before any rate change from Farmer Mac's interest rate 
risk measurement results, the linearly interpolated estimated effective 
duration of equity, and the percentage change in interest rates. In 
addition, the earnings effect of the measured dollar change in the 
market value of equity is estimated by multiplying the dollar change by 
the blended cost of funds rate found on the ``Assumptions & 
Relationships'' worksheet. Next, divide by 2 the computed earnings 
effect to approximate the impact as a theoretical shock in the interest 
rates that occurs at the mid-point of the income cycle from period t 
<INF>0</INF> to period t <INF>1</INF>. The measured dollar change in the 
market value of equity and related earnings effect are then adjusted to 
reflect any tax-related benefits. Tax adjustments are determined by 
including the measured dollar change in the market value of equity and 
the earnings effect in the tax calculations found in the ``Income 
Statements'' worksheet. This approach ensures that the value of equity 
reflects the economic loss or gain in value of Farmer Mac's capital 
position from a change in interest rates and reflects any immediate tax 
benefits that Farmer Mac could realize. Any tax benefits in the module 
are posted through the income statement by adjusting the net taxes due 
before calculating final net income. Final net income is posted to 
accumulated unretained earnings in the shareholders' equity portion of 
the balance sheet. The tax section is also described in section 4.5 
entitled, ``Income Statements.''
    c. After one cycle of income has been calculated, the balance sheet 
as of the end of the income period is then generated. The ``Balance 
Sheet'' worksheet shows the periodic pro forma balance sheets in a 
format convenient to track capital shifts through time.

[[Page 335]]

    d. The stress test considers Farmer Mac's balance sheet as subject 
to interest rate risk and, therefore, the capital position reflects 
mark-to-market changes in the value of equity. This approach ensures 
that the stress test captures interest rate risk in a meaningful way by 
addressing explicitly the loss or gain in value resulting from the 
change in interest rates required by the statute.

                               4.7 Capital

    The ``Capital'' worksheet contains the results of the required 
capital calculations as described below, and provides a method to 
calculate the level of initial capital that would permit Farmer Mac to 
maintain positive capital throughout the 10-year stress test period.

                         5.0 Capital Calculation

    a. The stress test computes regulatory capital as the sum of the 
following:
    (1) The par value of outstanding common stock;
    (2) The par value of outstanding preferred stock;
    (3) Paid-in capital;
    (4) Retained earnings; and
    (5) Reserve for loan and guarantee losses.
    b. Inclusion of the reserve account in regulatory capital is an 
important difference compared to minimum capital as defined by the 
statute. Therefore, the calculation of reserves in the stress test is 
also important because reserves are reduced by loan and guarantee 
losses. The reserve account is linked to the income statement through 
the provision for loan-loss expense (provision). Provision expense 
reflects the amount of current income necessary to rebuild the reserve 
account to acceptable levels after loan losses reduce the account or as 
a result of increases in the level of risky mortgage positions, both on- 
and off-balance sheet. Provision reversals represent reductions in the 
reserve levels due to reduced risk of loan losses or loan volume of 
risky mortgage positions. The liabilities section of the ``Balance 
Sheets'' worksheet also includes separate line items to disaggregate the 
Guarantee and commitment obligation related to the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45) Guarantor's Accounting 
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect 
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This item is disaggregated to 
permit accurate calculation of regulatory capital post-adoption of FIN 
45. When calculating the stress test, the reserve is maintained at zero 
to result in a risk-based capital requirement that includes reserves, 
thereby making the requirement comparable to the statutory definition of 
regulatory capital. By setting the reserve requirement to zero, the 
capital position includes all financial resources Farmer Mac has at its 
disposal to withstand risk.

                        5.1 Method of Calculation

    a. Risk-based capital is calculated in the stress test as the 
minimum initial capital that would permit Farmer Mac to remain solvent 
for the ensuing 10 years. To this amount, an additional 30 percent is 
added to account for managerial and operational risks not reflected in 
the specific components of the stress test.
    b. The relationship between the solvency constraint (i.e., future 
capital position not less than zero) and the risk-based capital 
requirement reflects the appropriate earnings and funding cost rates 
that may vary through time based on initial conditions. Therefore, the 
minimum capital at a future point in time cannot be directly used to 
determine the risk-based capital requirement. To calculate the risk-
based capital requirement, the stress test includes a section to solve 
for the minimum initial capital value that results in a minimum capital 
level over the 10 years of zero at the point in time that it would 
actually occur. In solving for initial capital, it is assumed that 
reductions or additions to the initial capital accounts are made in the 
retained earnings accounts, and balanced in the debt accounts at terms 
proportionate to initial balances (same relative proportion of long- and 
short-term debt at existing initial rates). Because the initial capital 
position affects the earnings, and hence capital positions and 
appropriate discount rates through time, the initial and future capital 
are simultaneously determined and must be solved iteratively. The 
resulting minimum initial capital from the stress test is then reported 
on the ``Capital'' worksheet of the stress test. The ``Capital'' 
worksheet includes an element that uses Excel's ``solver'' or ``goal 
seek'' capability to calculate the minimum initial capital that, when 
added (subtracted) from initial capital and replaced with debt, results 
in a minimum capital balance over the following 10 years of zero.

    (b) Administration means the National Credit Union Administration.
    (c) Board means the Board of the National Credit Union 
Administration.
    (d) Credit Union means a credit union chartered under the Federal 
Credit Union Act or, as the context permits, under the laws of any 
State.
    (e)(1) Insolvency. A credit union will be determined to be insolvent 
when the total amount of its shares exceeds the present cash value of 
its assets after providing for liabilities unless:
    (i) It is determined by the Board that the facts that caused the 
deficient share-asset ratio no longer exist; and
    (ii) The likelihood of further depreciation of the share-asset ratio 
is not probable; and
    (iii) The return of the share-asset ratio to its normal limits 
within a reasonable time for the credit union concerned is probable; and
    (iv) The probability of a further potential loss to the insurance 
fund is negligible.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the following definitions are 
used:
    (i) Cash value of assets. Recorded value will be considered the cash 
value of any asset account providing accepted accounting principles and 
practices are followed and the provisions of law, regulation, and bylaws

    (ii) Liabilities. Recorded liabilities which are due and payable, 
excluding shares of members and non-members, are considered liabilities.
    (f) Paid-in and unimpaired capital and surplus means shares plus 
post-closing, undivided earnings. This does not include regular reserves 
or special reserves required by law, regulation or special agreement 
between the credit union and its regulator or share insurer. ``Paid-in 
and unimpaired capital and surplus'' for purposes of the Central 
Liquidity Facility is defined in Sec. 725.2(o) of this chapter.
    (g) Regional Director means the representative of the Administration 
in the designated geographical area in which the office of the Federal 
credit union is located.

unimpaired capital and surplus,'' as defined in paragraph (f) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 701.3  Member inspection of credit union books, records, and minutes.

    (a) Member inspection rights. A group of members of a Federal credit 
union has the right, upon submission of a petition to the credit union 
as described in paragraph (b) of this section, to inspect and copy 
nonconfidential portions of the credit union's:
    (1) Accounting books and records; and
    (2) Minutes of the proceedings of the credit union's members, board 
of directors, and committees of directors.
    (b) Petition for inspection. The petition must describe the 
particular records to be inspected and state a proper purpose for the 
inspection, that is, a purpose related to the protection of the members' 
financial interests in the credit union. The petition must state that 
the petitioners as a whole, or certain named petitioners, agree to pay 
the direct and reasonable costs associated with search and duplication 
of requested material. The petition must also state that the inspection 
is not desired for any purpose other than the stated purpose; that the 
members signing the petition will not sell or offer

[[Page 343]]

for sale any information obtained from the credit union; and that the 
members signing the petition have not within five years preceding the 
signature date sold or offered for sale any information acquired from 
the credit union or aided or abetted any person in procuring any 
information from the credit union for purposes of sale. The petition 
must name one member, and one alternate member, who will represent the 
petitioners on issues such as inspection procedures, costs, and 
potential disputes. At least one percent of the credit union's members, 
with a minimum of 20 members and a maximum of 500 members, must sign the 
petition. Each member who signs the petition must have been a member of 
the credit union for at least 180 days at the time the petitioners 
submit the petition to the credit union.
    (c) Inspection procedures. (1) A Federal credit union must respond 
to petitioners within 14 days of receiving a petition. In its response, 
a credit union must inform petitioners either that it will provide 
inspection of the requested material and, if so, when, or, if a credit 
union is going to withhold all or part of the requested material, it 
must inform petitioners what part of the requested material it intends 
to withhold and the reasons for withholding the requested material. As 
soon as possible after receiving a petition, a credit union must 
schedule inspection and copying of nonconfidential requested material it 
determines petitioners may inspect and copy.
    (2) Inspection may be made in person or by agent or attorney and at 
any reasonable time or times. The credit union may, at its option, skip 
inspection and deliver copies of requested documents directly to the 
petitioners. Member inspection rights under this section are in addition 
to any other member inspection rights afforded by the credit union's 
charter or bylaws or other Federal law or Federal regulation.
    (3) If the credit union denies inspection because the petitioners 
have failed to obtain the minimum number of valid signatures, the credit 
union must inform the petitioners which signatures were not valid and 
why.
    (d) Confidential books, records, and minutes. Members do not have 
the right to inspect any portion of the books, records, or minutes of a 
Federal credit union if:
    (1) Federal law or regulation prohibits disclosure of that portion;
    (2) The publication of that portion could cause the credit union 
predictable and substantial financial harm;
    (3) That portion contains nonpublic personal information as defined 
in Sec. 716.3 of this part; or
    (4) That portion contains information about credit union employees 
or officials the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
    (e) Costs. A Federal credit union may charge petitioners the direct 
and reasonable costs associated with search and duplication. The credit 
union may not charge for other costs, including indirect costs or 
attorney's fees.
    (f) Dispute resolution. (1) In the event of a dispute between a 
federal credit union and its members concerning a petition for 
inspection or the associated costs, either party may submit the dispute 
to the regional director. The regional director, after obtaining the 
views of both parties, will direct the credit union either to withhold 
the disputed materials or to make them available for member inspection 
and copying. The regional director may place conditions upon release. 
The decision of the regional director is a final agency decision and is 
not appealable to the Board.
    (2) The regional director has the discretion to refer any dispute to 
the credit union's supervisory committee for review and resolution. If 
petitioners are not satisfied with the supervisory committee's response, 
they may resubmit the dispute to the regional director.

Sec. 701.6  Fees paid by Federal credit unions.

    (a) Basis for assessment. Each calendar year or as otherwise 
directed by the Board, each Federal credit union shall

[[Page 344]]

pay to the Administration for the current National Credit Union 
Administration fiscal year (January 1 to December 31) an operating fee 
in accordance with a schedule as fixed from time to time by the National 
Credit Union Administration Board based on the total assets of each 
Federal credit union as of December 31 of the preceding year or as 
otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Coverage. The operating fee shall be paid by each Federal credit 
union engaged in operations as of January 1 of each calendar year, 
except as otherwise provided by this paragraph.
    (1) New charters. A newly chartered Federal credit union will not 
pay an operating fee until the year following the first full calendar 
year after the date chartered.
    (2) Conversions. A state chartered credit union that converts to 
Federal charter will pay an operating fee in the year following the 
conversion. Federal credit unions converting to state charter will not 
receive a refund of the operating fee paid to the Administration in the 
year in which the conversion takes place.
    (3) Mergers. A continuing Federal credit union that has merged with 
another credit union will pay an operating fee in the following year 
based on the combined total assets of the merged credit union and the 
continuing Federal credit union as of December 31 of the year in which 
the merger took place. For purposes of this requirement, a purchase and 
assumption transaction wherein the continuing Federal credit union 
purchases all or essentially all of the assets of another credit union 
shall be deemed a merger. Federal credit unions merging with other 
Federal or state credit unions will not receive a refund of the 
operating fee paid to the Administration in the year in which the merger 
took place.
    (4) Liquidations. A Federal credit union placed in liquidation will 
not pay any operating fee after the date of liquidation.
    (c) Notification. Each Federal credit union shall be notified at 
least 30 days in advance of the schedule of fees to be paid. A Federal 
credit union may submit written comments to the Board for consideration 
regarding the existing fee schedule. Any subsequent revision to the 
schedule shall be provided to each Federal credit union at least 15 days 
before payment is due.
    (d) Assessment of Administrative Fee and Interest for Delinquent 
Payment. Each Federal credit union shall pay to the Administration an 
administrative fee, the costs of collection, and interest on any 
delinquent payment of its operating fee. A payment will be considered 
delinquent if it is postmarked later than the date stated in the notice 
to the credit union provided under Sec. 701.6(c). The National Credit 
Union Administration may waive or abate charges or collection of 
interest if circumstances warrant.
    (1) The administrative fee for a delinquent payment shall be an 
amount fixed from time to time by the National Credit Union 
Administration Board and based upon the administrative costs of such 
delinquent payments to the Administration in the preceding year.
    (2) The costs of collection shall be the actual hours expended by 
Administration personnel multiplied by the average hourly salary and 
benefits costs of such personnel as determined by the National Credit 
Union Administration Board.
    (3) The interest rate charged on any delinquent payment shall be the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury Tax and Loan Rate in effect on the date 
when the payment is due as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (4) If a credit union makes a combined payment of its operating fee 
and its share insurance deposit as provided in Sec. 741.4 of this 
chapter and such payment is delinquent, only one administrative fee will 
be charged and interest will be charged on the total combined payment.

Sec. Sec. 701.7-701.13  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 701.14  Change in official or senior executive officer in credit unions that are newly chartered or are in troubled condition.

    (a) Statement of scope and purpose. Section 212 of the Federal 
Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1790a) sets forth conditions under which a 
credit union must notify NCUA in writing of any proposed changes in its 
board of directors, committee members or senior executive staff. The 
regulation only applies in cases of newly chartered credit unions and 
credit unions in troubled condition.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Committee member means any individual who serves as an official 
of the credit union in the capacity of a credit committee member or 
supervisory committee member.
    (2) Senior executive officer means a credit union's chief executive 
officer (typically this individual holds the title of president or 
treasurer/manager), any assistant chief executive officer (e.g., any 
assistant president, any vice president or any assistant treasurer/
manager) and the chief financial officer (controller). The term ``senior 
executive officer'' also includes employees of an entity, such as a 
consulting firm, hired to perform the functions of positions covered by 
the regulation.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for 
corporate credit unions, ``troubled condition'' means any insured credit 
union that has one or a combination of the following conditions:
    (i) Has been assigned
    (A) A 4 or 5 Camel composite rating by the NCUA in the case of a 
federal credit union, or
    (B) An equivalent 4 or 5 Camel composite rating by the state 
supervisor in the case of a federally insured, state-chartered credit 
union, or
    (C) A 4 or 5 Camel composite rating by NCUA based on core workpapers 
received from the state supervisor in the case of a federally insured, 
state-chartered credit union in a state that does ot use the Camel 
system. In this case, the state supervisor will be notified in writing 
by the Regional Director in the Region in which the credit union is 
located that the credit union has been designated by NCUA as a troubled 
institution;
    (ii) Has been granted assistance as outlined under sections 208 or 
216 of the Federal Credit Union Act.
    (4) In the case of a corporate credit union, ``troubled condition'' 
means any insured corporate credit union that has one or a combination 
of the following conditions:
    (i) Has been assigned
    (A) A 4 or 5 Corporate Risk Information System (CRIS) rating by NCUA 
in either the Financial Risk or Risk Management composites, in the case 
of a federal corporate credit union, or
    (B) An equivalent 4 or 5 CRIS rating in either the Financial Risk or 
Risk Management composites by the state supervisor in the case of a 
federally insured, state-chartered corporate credit union in a state 
that has adopted the CRIS system, or an equivalent 4 or 5 CAMEL 
composite rating by the state supervisor in the case of a federally 
insured, state-chartered corporate credit union in a state that uses the 
CAMEL system, or
    (C) A 4 or 5 CRIS rating in either the Financial Risk or Risk 
Management composites by NCUA based on core workpapers received from the 
state supervisor in the case of a federally insured, state-chartered 
credit union in a state that does not use either the CRIS or CAMEL 
system. In this case, the state supervisor will be notified in writing 
by the Director of the Office of Corporate Credit Unions that the 
corporate credit union has been designated by NCUA as a troubled 
institution;
    (ii) Has been granted assistance as outlined under sections 208 or 
216 of the Federal Credit Union Act.
    (c) Procedures for Notice of Proposed Change in Official or Senior 
Executive Officer--(1) Prior Notice Requirement. An insured credit union 
must give NCUA written notice at least 30 days before the effective date 
of any addition or replacement of a member of the board of directors or 
committee member or the employment or change in responsibilities of any 
individual to a position of senior executive officer if:

[[Page 346]]

    (i) The credit union has been chartered for less than two years; or
    (ii) The credit union meets the definition of troubled condition in 
paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section.
    (2) Waiver of Prior Notice--(i) Waiver requests. Parties may 
petition the appropriate Regional Director for a waiver of the prior 
notice required under this section. Waiver may be granted if it is found 
that delay could harm the credit union or the public interest.
    (ii) Automatic waiver. In the case of the election of a new member 
of the board of directors or credit committee member at a meeting of the 
members of a federally insured credit union, the prior 30-day notice is 
automatically waived and the individual may immediately begin serving, 
provided that a complete notice is filed with the appropriate Regional 
Director within 48 hours of the election. If NCUA disapproves a director 
or credit committee member, the board of directors of the credit union 
may appoint its own alternate, to serve until the next annual meeting, 
contingent on NCUA approval.
    (iii) Effect on disapproval authority. A waiver does not affect the 
authority of NCUA to issue a Notice of Disapproval within 30 days of the 
waiver or within 30 days of any subsequent required notice.
    (3) Filing procedures--(i) Where to file. Notices will be filed with 
the appropriate Regional Director or, in the case of a corporate credit 
union, with the Director of the Office of Corporate Credit Unions. All 
references to Regional Director will, for corporate credit unions, mean 
the Director of Office of Corporate Credit Unions. State-chartered 
federally insured credit unions will also file a copy of the notice with 
their state supervisor.
    (ii) Contents. The notice must contain information about the 
competence, experience, character, or integrity of the individual on 
whose behalf the notice is submitted. The Regional Director or his or 
her designee may require additional information. The information 
submitted must include the identity, personal history, business 
background, and experience of the individual, including material 
business activities and affiliations during the past five years, and a 
description of any material pending legal or administrative proceedings 
in which the individual is a party and any criminal indictment or 
conviction of the individual by a state or federal court. Each 
individual on whose behalf the notice is filed must attest to the 
validity of the information filed. At the option of the individual, the 
information may be forwarded to the Regional Director by the individual; 
however, in such cases, the credit union must file a notice to that 
effect.
    (iii) Processing. Within ten calendar days after receiving the 
notice, the Regional Director will inform the credit union either that 
the notice is complete or that additional, specified information is 
needed and must be submitted within 30 calendar days. If the initial 
notice is complete, the Regional Director will issue a written decision 
of approval or disapproval to the individual and the credit union within 
30 calendar days of receipt of the notice. If the initial notice is not 
complete, the Regional Director will issue a written decision within 30 
calendar days of receipt of the original notice plus the amount of time 
the credit union takes to provide the requested additional information. 
If the additional information is not submitted within 30 calendar days 
of the Regional Director's request, the Regional Director may either 
disapprove the proposed individual or review the notice based on the 
information provided. If the credit union and the individual have 
submitted all requested information and the Regional Director has not 
issued a written decision within the applicable time period, the 
individual is approved.
    (d) Commencement of Service. A proposed director, committee member, 
or senior executive officer may begin service after the end of the 30-
day period or any other additional period as provided under paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section, unless the NCUA disapproves the notice 
before the end of the period.
    (e) Notice of disapproval. NCUA may disapprove the individual's 
serving as a director, committee member or senior executive officer if 
it finds that the competence, experience, character, or integrity of the 
individual with respect

[[Page 347]]

to whom a notice under this section is submitted indicates that it would 
not be in the best interests of the members of the credit union or of 
the public to permit the individual to be employed by, or associated 
with, the credit union. The Notice of Disapproval will advise the 
parties of their rights of appeal pursuant to 12 CFR part 747 subpart J, 
of NCUA's Regulations.

Sec. Sec. 701.15-701.18  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 701.19  Benefits for employees of Federal credit unions.

    (a) General authority. A federal credit union may provide employee 
benefits, including retirement benefits, to its employees and officers 
who are compensated in conformance with the Act and the bylaws, 
individually or collectively with other credit unions. The kind and 
amount of these benefits must be reasonable given the federal credit 
union's size, financial condition, and the duties of the employees.
    (b) Plan trustees and custodians. Where a federal credit union is 
the benefit plan trustee or custodian, the plan must be authorized and 
maintained in accordance with the provisions of part 724 of this 
chapter. Where the benefit plan trustee or custodian is a party other 
than a federal credit union, the benefit plan must be maintained in 
accordance with applicable laws governing employee benefit plans, 
including any applicable rules and regulations issued by the Secretary 
of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, or any other federal or state 
authority exercising jurisdiction over the plan.
    (c) Investment authority. A federal credit union investing to fund 
an employee benefit plan obligation is not subject to the investment 
limitations of the Act and part 703 or, as applicable, part 704, of this 
chapter and may purchase an investment that would otherwise be 
impermissible if the investment is directly related to the federal 
credit union's obligation or potential obligation under the employee 
benefit plan and the federal credit union holds the investment only for 
as long as it has an actual or potential obligation under the employee 
benefit plan.
    (d) Defined benefit plans. Under paragraph (c) of this section, a 
federal credit union may invest to fund a defined benefit plan if the 
investment meets the conditions provided in that paragraph. If a federal 
credit union invests to fund a defined benefit plan that is not subject 
to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of part 4 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, it should diversify its 
investment portfolio to minimize the risk of large losses unless it is 
clearly prudent not to do so under the circumstances.
    (e) Liability insurance. No federal credit union may occupy the 
position of a fiduciary, as defined in the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 and the rules and regulations issued by the 
Secretary of Labor, unless it has obtained appropriate liability 
insurance as described and permitted by Section 410(b) of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
    (f) Definitions. For this section, defined benefit plan has the same 
meaning as in 29 U.S.C. 1002(35) and employee benefit plan has the same 
meaning as in 29 U.S.C. 1002(3).

<R05>
Sec. 701.20  Suretyship and guaranty.

    (a) Scope. This section authorizes a federal credit union to enter 
into a suretyship or guaranty agreement as an incidental powers 
activity. This section does not apply to the guaranty of public deposits 
or the assumption of liability for member accounts.
    (b) Definitions. A suretyship binds a federal credit union with its 
principal to pay or perform an obligation to a third person. Under a 
guaranty agreement, a federal credit union agrees to satisfy the 
obligation of the principal only if the principal fails to pay or 
perform. The principal is the person primarily liable, for whose 
performance of his obligation the surety or guarantor has become bound.
    (c) Requirements. The suretyship or guaranty agreement must be for 
the benefit of a principal that is a member and is subject to the 
following conditions:

[[Page 348]]

    (1) The federal credit union limits its obligations under the 
agreement to a fixed dollar amount and a specified duration;
    (2) The federal credit union's performance under the agreement 
creates an authorized loan that complies with the applicable lending 
regulations, including the limitations on loans to one member or 
associated members or officials for purposes of Sec. Sec. 701.21(c)(5), 
(d); 723.2 and 723.8; and
    (3) The federal credit union obtains a segregated deposit from the 
member that is sufficient in amount to cover the federal credit union's 
total potential liability.
    (d) Collateral. A segregated deposit under this section includes 
collateral:
    (1) In which the federal credit union has perfected its security 
interest (for example, if the collateral is a printed security, the 
federal credit union must have obtained physical control of the 
security, and, if the collateral is a book entry security, the federal 
credit union must have properly recorded its security interest); and
    (2) That has a market value, at the close of each business day, 
equal to 100 percent of the federal credit union's total potential 
liability and is composed of:
    (i) Cash;
    (ii) Obligations of the United States or its agencies;
    (iii) Obligations fully guaranteed by the United States or its 
agencies as to principal and interest; or
    (iv) Notes, drafts, or bills of exchange or banker's acceptances 
that are eligible for rediscount or purchase by a Federal Reserve Bank; 
or
    (3) That has a market value equal to 110 percent of the federal 
credit union's total potential liability and is composed of:
    (i) Real estate, the value of which is established by a signed 
appraisal or evaluation in accordance with part 722 of this chapter. In 
determining the value of the collateral, the federal credit union must 
factor in the value of any existing senior mortgages, liens or other 
encumbrances on the property except those held by the principal to the 
suretyship or guaranty agreement; or
    (ii) Marketable securities that the federal credit union is 
authorized to invest in. The federal credit union must ensure that the 
value of the security is 110 percent of the obligation at all times 
during the term of the agreement.

Sec. 701.21  Loans to members and lines of credit to members.

    (a) Statement of scope and purpose. Section 701.21 complements the 
provisions of section 107(5) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 
1757(5)) authorizing Federal credit unions to make loans to members and 
issue lines of credit (including credit cards) to members. Section 
107(5) of the Act contains limitations on matters such as loan maturity, 
rate of interest, security, and prepayment penalties. Section 701.21 
interprets and implements those provisions. In addition, Sec. 701.21 
states the NCUA Board's intent concerning preemption of state laws, and 
expands the authority of Federal credit unions to enforce due-on-sale 
clauses in real property loans. Also, while Sec. 701.21 generally 
applies to Federal credit unions only, its provisions may be used by 
state-chartered credit unions with respect to alternative mortgage 
transactions in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 3801 et seq., and certain 
provisions apply to loans made by federally insured state-chartered 
credit unions as specified in Sec. 741.203 of this chapter. Part 722 of 
this chapter sets forth requirements for appraisals for certain real 
estate secured loans made under Sec. 701.21 and any other applicable 
lending authority. Finally, it is noted that Sec. 701.21 does not apply 
to loans by Federal credit unions to other credit unions (although 
certain statutory limitations in section 107 of the Act apply), nor to 
loans to credit union organizations which are governed by section 
107(5)(D) of the Act and part 712 of this chapter.
    (b) Relation to other laws--(1) Preemption of state laws. Section 
701.21 is promulgated pursuant to the NCUA's Board's exclusive authority 
as set forth in section 107(5) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C 
1757(5)) to regulate the rates, terms of repayment and other conditions 
of Federal credit

[[Page 349]]

union loans and lines of credit (including credit cards) to members. 
This exercise of the Board's authority preempts any state law purporting 
to limit or affect:
    (i)(A) Rates of interest and amounts of finance charges, including:
    (1) The frequency or the increments by which a variable interest 
rate may be changed;
    (2) The index to which a variable interest rate may be tied;
    (3) The manner or timing of notifying the borrower of a change in 
interest rate;
    (4) The authority to increase the interest rate on an existing 
balance;
    (B) Late charges; and
    (C) Closing costs, application, origination, or other fees;
    (ii) Terms of repayment, including:
    (A) The maturity of loans and lines of credit;
    (B) The amount, uniformity, and frequency of payments, including the 
accrual of unpaid interest if payments are insufficient to pay all 
interest due;
    (C) Balloon payments; and
    (D) Prepayment limits;
    (iii) Conditions related to:
    (A) The amount of the loan or line of credit;
    (B) The purpose of the loan or line of credit;
    (C) The type or amount of security and the relation of the value of 
the security to the amount of the loan or line of credit;
    (D) Eligible borrowers; and
    (E) The imposition and enforcement of liens on the shares of 
borrowers and accommodation parties.
    (2) Matters not preempted. Except as provided by paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, it is not the Board's intent to preempt state laws that do 
not affect rates, terms of repayment and other conditions described 
above concerning loans and lines of credit, for example:
    (i) Insurance laws;
    (ii) Laws related to transfer of and security interests in real and 
personal property (see, however, paragraph (g)(6) of this section 
concerning the use and exercise of due-on-sale clauses);
    (iii) Conditions related to:
    (A) Collection costs and attorneys' fees;
    (B) Requirements that consumer lending documents be in ``plain 
language;'' and
    (C) The circumstances in which a borrower may be declared in default 
and may cure default.
    (3) Other Federal law. Except as provided by paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, it is not the Board's intent to preempt state laws 
affecting aspects of credit transactions that are primarily regulated by 
Federal law other than the Federal Credit Union Act, for example, state 
laws concering credit cost disclosure requirements, credit 
discrimination, credit reporting practices, unfair credit practices, and 
debt collection practices. Applicability of state law in these instances 
should be determined pursuant to the preemption standards of the 
relevant Federal law and regulations.
    (4) Examination and enforcement. Except as otherwise agreed by the 
NCUA Board, the Board retains exclusive examination and administrative 
enforcement jurisdiction over Federal credit unions. Violations of 
Federal or applicable state laws related to the lending activities of a 
Federal credit union should be referred to the appropriate NCUA regional 
office.
    (5) Definition of State law. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this 
section ``state law'' means the constitution, laws, regulations and 
judicial decisions of any state, the District of Columbia, the several 
territories and possessions of the United States, and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico.
    (c) General rules--(1) Scope. The following general rules apply to 
all loans to members and, where indicated, all lines of credit 
(including credit cards) to members, except as otherwise provided in the 
remaining provisions of Sec. 701.21.
    (2) Written policies. The board of directors of each Federal credit 
union shall establish written policies for loans and lines of credit 
consistent with the relevant provisions of the Act, NCUA's regulations, 
and other applicable laws and regulations.
    (3) Credit applications and overdrafts. Consistent with policies 
established by the board of directors, the credit committee or loan 
officer shall ensure that a credit application is kept on file for

[[Page 350]]

each borrower supporting the decision to make a loan or establish a line 
of credit. A credit union may advance money to a member to cover an 
account deficit without having a credit application from the borrower on 
file if the credit union has a written overdraft policy. The policy 
must: set a cap on the total dollar amount of all overdrafts the credit 
union will honor consistent with the credit union's ability to absorb 
losses; establish a time limit not to exceed forty-five calendar days 
for a member either to deposit funds or obtain an approved loan from the 
credit union to cover each overdraft; limit the dollar amount of 
overdrafts the credit union will honor per member; and establish the fee 
and interest rate, if any, the credit union will charge members for 
honoring overdrafts.
    (4) Maturity. The maturity of a loan to a member may not exceed 15 
years. Lines of credit are not subject to a statutory or regulatory 
maturity limit. Amortization of line of credit balances and the type and 
amount of security on any line of credit shall be as determined by 
contract between the Federal credit union and the member/borrower.
    (5) Ten percent limit. No loan or line of credit advance may be made 
to any member if such loan or advance would cause that member to be 
indebted to the Federal credit union upon loans and advances made to the 
member in an aggregate amount exceeding 10% of the credit union's total 
unimpaired capital and surplus. In the case of member business loans as 
defined in Sec. 723.1 of this chapter, additional limitations apply as 
set forth in Sec. 723.8 and 723.9 of this chapter.
    (6) Early payment. A member may repay a loan, or outstanding balance 
on a line of credit, prior to maturity in whole or in part on any 
business day without penalty.
    (7) Loan interest rates--(i) General. Except when the Board 
establishes a higher maximum rate, federal credit unions may not extend 
credit to members at rates exceeding 15 percent per year on the unpaid 
balance inclusive of all finance charges. Federal credit unions may use 
variable rates of interest but only if the effective rate over the term 
of a loan or line of credit does not exceed the maximum permissible 
rate.
    (ii) Temporary rates. (A) At least every 18 months, the Board will 
determine if federal credit unions may extend credit to members at an 
interest rate exceeding 15 percent. After consultation with appropriate 
congressional committees, the Department of Treasury, and other federal 
financial institution regulatory agencies, the Board may establish a 
rate exceeding the 15 percent per year rate, if it determines money 
market interest rates have risen over the preceding six-month period and 
prevailing interest rate levels threaten the safety and soundness of 
individual federal credit unions as evidenced by adverse trends in 
liquidity, capital, earnings, and growth.
    (B) When the Board establishes a higher maximum rate, the Board will 
provide notice to federal credit unions of the adjusted rate by issuing 
a Letter to Federal Credit Unions, as well as providing information in 
other NCUA publications and in a statement for the press.
    (C) Federal credit unions may continue to charge rates exceeding the 
established maximum rate only on existing loans or lines of credit made 
before the effective date of any lowering of the maximum rate.
    (8)(i) Except as otherwise provided herein, no official or employee 
of a Federal credit union, or immediate family member of an official or 
employee of a Federal credit union, may receive, directly or indirectly, 
any commission, fee, or other compensation in connection with any loan 
made by the credit union.
    (ii) For the purposes of this section:
    Compensation includes non monetary items, except those of nominal 
value.
    Immediate family member means a spouse or other family member living 
in the same household.
    Loan includes line of credit.
    Official means any member of the board of directors or a volunteer 
committee.
    Person means an individual or an organization.
    Senior management employee means the credit union's chief executive 
officer (typically, this individual holds the

[[Page 351]]

title of President or Treasurer/Manager), any assistant chief executive 
officers (e.g., Assistant President, Vice President, or Assistant 
Treasurer/Manager), and the chief financial officer (Comptroller).
    Volunteer official means an official of a credit union who does not 
receive compensation from the credit union solely for his or her service 
as an official.
    (iii) This section does not prohibit:
    (A) Payment, by a Federal credit union, of salary to employees;
    (B) Payment, by a Federal credit union, of an incentive or bonus to 
an employee based on the credit union's overall financial performance;
    (C) Payment, by a Federal credit union, of an incentive or bonus to 
an employee, other than a senior management employee, in connection with 
a loan or loans made by the credit union, provided that the board of 
directors of the credit union establishes written policies and internal 
controls in connection with such incentive or bonus and monitors 
compliance with such policies and controls at least annually.
    (D) Receipt of compensation from a person outside a Federal credit 
union by a volunteer official or non senior management employee of the 
credit union, or an immediate family member of a volunteer official or 
employee of the credit union, for a service or activity performed 
outside the credit union, provided that no referral has been made by the 
credit union or the official, employee, or family member.
    (d) Loans and lines of credit to officials--(1) Purpose. Sections 
107(5)(A) (iv) and (v) of the Act require the approval of the board of 
directors of the Federal credit union in any case where the aggregate of 
loans to an official and loans on which the official serves as endorser 
or guarantor exceeds $20,000 plus pledged shares. This paragraph 
implements the requirement by establishing procedures for determining 
whether board of directors's approval is required. The section also 
prohibits preferential treatment of officials.
    (2) Official. An ``official'' is any member of the board of 
directors, credit committee or supervisory committee.
    (3) Initial approval. All applications for loans or lines of credit 
on which an official will be either a direct obligor or an endorser, 
cosigner or guarantor shall be initially acted upon by either the board 
of directors, the credit committee or a loan officer, as specified in 
the Federal credit union's bylaws.
    (4) Board of Directors' review. The board of directors shall, in any 
case, review and approve or deny an application on which an official is 
a direct obligor, or endorser, cosigner or guarantor if the following 
computation produces a total in excess of $20,000:
    (i) Add:
    (A) The amount of the current application.
    (B) The outstanding balances of loans, including the used portion of 
an approved line of credit, extended to or endorsed, cosigned or 
guaranteed by the official.
    (C) The total unused portion of approved lines of credit extended to 
or endorsed, cosigned or guaranteed by the official.
    (ii) From the above total subtract:
    (A) The amount of shares pledged by the official on loans or lines 
of credit extended to or endorsed, cosigned or guaranteed by the 
official.
    (B) The amount of shares to be pledged by the official on the loan 
or line of credit applied for.
    (5) Nonpreferential treatment. The rates, terms and conditions on 
any loan or line of credit either made to, or endorsed or guaranteed 
by--
    (i) An official,
    (ii) An immediate family member of an official, or
    (iii) Any individual having a common ownership, investment or other 
pecuniary interest in a business enterprise with an official or with an 
immediate family member of an official,

shall not be more favorable than the rates, terms and conditions for 
comparable loans or lines of credit to other credit union members. 
``Immediate family member'' means a spouse or other family member living 
in the same household.
    (e) Insured, Guaranteed and Advance Commitment Loans. A loan 
secured, in full or in part, by the insurance or guarantee of, or with 
an advance commitment to purchase the loan, in full or in part, by the 
Federal Government, a State government or any agency of

[[Page 352]]

either, may be made for the maturity and under the terms and conditions, 
including rate of interest, specified in the law, regulations or program 
under which the insurance, guarantee or commitment is provided.
    (f) 20-Year Loans. (1) Notwithstanding the general 15-year maturity 
limit on loans to members, a federal credit union may make loans with 
maturities of up to 20 years in the case of:
    (i) A loan to finance the purchase of a mobile home if the mobile 
home will be used as the member-borrower's residence and the loan is 
secured by a first lien on the mobile home, and the mobile home meets 
the requirements for the home mortgage interest deduction under the 
Internal Revenue Code,
    (ii) A second mortgage loan (or a nonpurchase money first mortgage 
loan in the case of a residence on which there is no existing first 
mortgage) if the loan is secured by a residential dwelling which is the 
residence of the member-borrower, and
    (iii) A loan to finance the repair, alteration, or improvement of a 
residential dwelling which is the residence of the member-borrower.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (f), mobile home may include a 
recreational vehicle, house trailer or boat.
    (g) Long-Term Mortgage Loans.--(1) Authority. A federal credit union 
may make residential real estate loans to members, including loans 
secured by manufactured homes permanently affixed to the land, with 
maturities of up to 40 years, or such longer period as may be permitted 
by the NCUA Board on a case-by-case basis, subject to the conditions of 
this paragraph (g).
    (2) Statutory limits. The loan shall be made on a one to four family 
dwelling that is or will be the principal residence of the member-
borrower and the loan shall be secured by a perfected first lien in 
favor of the credit union on such dwelling (or a perfected first 
security interest in the case of either a residential cooperative or a 
leasehold or ground rent estate).
    (3) Loan application. The loan application shall be a completed 
standard Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration, 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal National Mortgage 
Association or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation/Federal National 
Mortgage Association application form. In lieu of use of a standard 
application the Federal credit union may have a current attorney's 
opinion on file stating that the forms in use meet the requirements of 
applicable Federal, state and local laws.
    (4) Security instrument and note. The security instrument and note 
shall be executed on the most current version of the FHA, VA, FHLMC, 
FNMA, or FHLMC/FNMA Uniform Instruments for the jurisdiction in which 
the property is located. No prepayment penalty shall be allowed, 
although a Federal credit union may require that any partial prepayments 
be made on the date monthly installments are due and be in the amount of 
that part of one or more monthly installments that would be applicable 
to principal. In lieu of use of a standard security instrument and note, 
the Federal credit union may have a current attorney's opinion on file 
stating that the security instrument and note in use meet the 
requirements of applicable Federal, state and local laws.
    (5) First lien, territorial limits. The loan shall be secured by a 
perfected first lien or first security interest in favor of the credit 
union supported by a properly executed and recorded security instrument. 
No loan shall be secured by a residence located outside the United 
States of America, its territories and possessions, or the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico.
    (6) Due-on-sale clauses. (i) Except as otherwise provided herein, 
the exercise of a due-on-sale clause by a Federal credit union is 
governed exclusively by section 341 of Pub. L. 97-320 and by any 
regulations issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board implementing 
section 341.
    (ii) In the case of a contract involving a long-term (greater than 
fifteen years), fixed rate first mortgage loan which was made or 
assumed, including a transfer of the liened property subject to the 
loan, during the period beginning on the date a State adopted a 
constitutional provision or statute prohibiting the exercise of due-on-
sale clauses, or the date on which the highest court of such state has 
rendered a decision (or if the highest court has not

[[Page 353]]

so decided, the date on which the next highest court has rendered a 
decision resulting in a final judgment if such decision applies 
statewide) prohibiting such exercise, and ending on October 15, 1982, a 
Federal credit union may exercise a due-on-sale clause in the case of a 
transfer which occurs on or after November 18, 1982, unless exercise of 
the due-on-sale clause would be based on any of the following:
    (A) The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the 
lender's security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of 
rights of occupancy in the property;
    (B) The creation of a purchase money security interest for household 
appliances;
    (C) A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death 
of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;
    (D) The granting of a leasehold interest of 3 years or less not 
containing an option to purchase;
    (E) A transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;
    (F) A transfer where the spouse or children of the borrower become 
an owner of the property;
    (G) A transfer resulting from a decree of a dissolution of marriage, 
a legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement 
agreement, by which the spouse of the borrower becomes an owner of the 
property;
    (H) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is 
and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of 
rights of occupancy in the property; or
    (I) Any other transfer or disposition described in regulations 
promulgated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
    (7) Assumption of real estate loans by nonmembers. A Federal credit 
union may permit a nonmember to assume a member's mortgage loan in 
conjunction with the nonmember's purchase of the member's principal 
residence, provided that the nonmember assumes only the remaining unpaid 
balance of the loan, the terms of the loan remain unchanged, and there 
is no extension of the original maturity date specified in the loan 
agreement with the member. An assumption is impermissible if the 
original loan was made with the intent of having a nonmember assume the 
loan.
    (h) Third-party servicing of indirect vehicle loans. (1) A 
federally-insured credit union must not acquire any vehicle loan, or any 
interest in a vehicle loan, serviced by a third-party servicer if the 
aggregate amount of vehicle loans and interests in vehicle loans 
serviced by that third-party servicer and its affiliates would exceed:
    (i) 50 percent of the credit union's net worth during the initial 
thirty months of that third-party servicing relationship; or
    (ii) 100 percent of the credit union's net worth after the initial 
thirty months of that third-party servicing relationship.
    (2) Regional directors may grant a waiver of the limits in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section to permit greater limits upon written application 
by a credit union. In determining whether to grant or deny a waiver, a 
regional director will consider:
    (i) The credit union's understanding of the third-party servicer's 
organization, business model, financial health, and the related program 
risks;
    (ii) The credit union's due diligence in monitoring and protecting 
against program risks;
    (iii) If contracts between the credit union and the third-party 
servicer grant the credit union sufficient control over the servicer's 
actions and provide for replacing an inadequate servicer; and
    (iv) Other factors relevant to safety and soundness.
    (3) A regional director will provide a written determination on a 
waiver request within 45 calendar days after receipt of the request; 
however, the 45-day period will not begin until the requesting credit 
union has submitted all necessary information to the regional director. 
If the regional director does not provide a written determination within 
the 45-day period the request is deemed denied. A credit union may 
appeal any part of the determination to the NCUA Board. Appeals must be

CFR 202.2(f) (Regulation B), which is as follows:

    An oral or written request for an extension of credit that is made 
in accordance with procedures established by a creditor for the type of 
credit requested;

    (2) Dwelling carries the meaning of that term as defined in 42 
U.S.C. 3602(b) (Fair Housing Act), which is as follows: ``Any building, 
structure, or portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or 
intended for occupancy as, a residence by one or more families, and any 
vacant land which is offered for sale or lease for the construction or 
location thereon of any building, structure, or portion thereof''; and
    (3) Real estate-related loan means any loan for which application is 
made to finance or refinance the purchase, construction, improvement, 
repair, or maintenance of a dwelling.
    (b) Nondiscrimination in Lending. (1) A Federal credit union may not 
deny a real estate-related loan, nor may it discriminate in setting or 
exercising its rights pursuant to the terms or conditions of such a 
loan, nor may it discourage an application for such a loan, on the basis 
of the race, color, national origin, religion, sex, handicap, or 
familial status (having children under the age of 18) of:
    (i) Any applicant or joint applicant;
    (ii) Any person associated, in connection with a real estate-related

real estate-related loan is requested.

which has the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, 
national origin, religion,

[[Page 360]]

sex, handicap, or familial status (having children under the age of 18). 
Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this provision appear in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (3) Consideration of any of the following factors in connection with 
a real estate-related loan is not necessary to a Federal credit union's 
business, generally has a discriminatory effect, and is therefore 
prohibited:
    (i) The age or location of the dwelling;
    (ii) Zip code of the applicant's current residence;
    (iii) Previous home ownership;
    (iv) The age or location of dwellings in the neighborhood of the 
dwelling;

dwelling.

Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this provision appear in

origin, religion, sex, handicap, or familial status (having children 
under the age of 18) of:
    (i) Any applicant or joint applicant;
    (ii) Any person associated, in connection with a real estate-related

know that the appraisal is based upon consideration of a criterion which 
has the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national 
origin, religion, sex, handicap, or familial status (having children 
under the age of 18). Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this 
provision appear in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (3) A Federal credit union may not rely upon an appraisal that it 
knows or should know is based upon consideration of any of the following 
criteria, for such criteria generally have a discriminatory effect, and 
are not necessary to a Federal credit union's business:
    (i) The age or location of the dwelling;
    (ii) The age or location of dwellings in the neighborhood of the 
dwelling;
    (iii) The income level of the residents in the neighborhood of the

such factor(s). Guidelines concerning the consideration of location 
factors appear in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

requesting member/applicant, a copy of the appraisal used in connection

shall be available for a period of 25 months after the applicant has 
received notice from the Federal credit union of the action taken by the 
Federal credit union on the real estate-related loan application.
    (d) Nondiscrimination in advertising. No federal credit union may 
engage in any form of advertising of real estate-related loans that 
indicates the credit union discriminates on the basis of race, color, 
religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status in 
violation of the Fair Housing Act. Advertisements must not contain any 
words, symbols, models or other forms of communication that suggest a 
discriminatory preference or policy of exclusion in violation of the 
Fair Housing Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.
    (1) Advertising notice of nondiscrimination compliance. Any federal 
credit union that advertises real estate-related loans must prominently 
indicate in such advertisement, in a manner appropriate to the 
advertising medium

[[Page 361]]

and format used, that the credit union makes such loans without regard 
to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial 
status.
    (i) With respect to written and visual advertisements, a credit 
union may satisfy the notice requirement by including in the 
advertisement a copy of the logotype, with the legend ``Equal Housing 
Lender,'' from the poster described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section 
or a copy of the logotype, with the legend ``Equal Housing

    (ii) With respect to oral advertisements, a credit union may satisfy 
the notice requirement by a spoken statement that the credit union is an 
``Equal Housing Lender'' or an ``Equal Opportunity Lender.''
    (iii) When an oral advertisement is used in conjunction with a 
written or visual advertisement, the use of either of the methods 
specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section will satisfy 
the notice requirement.
    (iv) A credit union may use any other method reasonably calculated 
to satisfy the notice requirement.
    (2) Lobby notice of nondiscrimination. Every federal credit union 
that engages in real estate-related lending must display a notice of 
nondiscrimination. The notice must be placed in the public lobby of the 
credit union and in the public area of each office where such loans are 
made and must be clearly visible to the general public. The notice must 
incorporate either a facsimile of the logotype and language appearing in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section or the logotype and language appearing 
at 24 CFR 110.25(a). Posters containing the logotype and language 
appearing in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may be obtained from the 
regional offices of the National Credit Union Administration.
    (3) Logotype and notice of nondiscrimination compliance. The 
logotype and text of the notice required in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section shall be as follows:

    (e) Guidelines. (1) Compliance with the Fair Housing Act is achieved 
when each loan applicant's creditworthiness is evaluated on an 
individual basis, without presuming that the applicant has certain 
characteristics of a group.

[[Page 363]]

If certain lending policies or procedures do presume group 
characteristics, they may violate the Fair Housing Act, even though the 
characteristics are not based upon race, color, sex, national origin, 
religion, handicap, or familial status. Such a violation occurs when 
otherwise facially nondiscriminatory lending procedures (either general 
lending policies or specific criteria used in reviewing loan 
applications) have the effect of making real estate-related loans 
unavailable or less available on the basis of race, color, sex, national 
origin, religion, handicap, or familial status. Note, however, that a 
policy or criterion which has a discriminatory effect is not a violation 
of the Fair Housing Act if its use achieves a legitimate business 
necessity which cannot be achieved by using less discriminatory 
standards. It is also important to note that the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act and Regulation B prohibit discrimination, either per se 
or in effect, on the basis of the applicant's age, marital status, 
receipt of public assistance, or the exercise of any rights under the 
Consumer Credit Protection Act.
    (2) Paragraph (b)(3) of this section prohibits consideration of 
certain factors because of their likely discriminatory effect and 
because they are not necessary to make sound real estate-related loans. 
For purposes of clarification, the prohibited use of location factors in 
this section is intended to prevent abandonment of areas in which a 
Federal credit union's members live or want to live. It is not intended 
to require loans in those areas that are geographically remote from the 
FCU's main or branch offices or that contravene the parameters of a 
Federal credit union's charter. Further, this prohibition does not 
preclude requiring a borrower to obtain flood insurance protection 
pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act and part 760 of NCUA's 
Rules and Regulations, nor does it preclude involvement with Federal or 
state housing insurance programs which provide for lower interest rates 
for the purchase of homes in certain urban or rural areas. Also, the 
legitimate use of location factors in an appraisal does not constitute a 
violation of the provision of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, which 
prohibits consideration of location of the dwelling. Finally, the 
prohibited use of prior home ownership does not preclude a Federal 
credit union from considering an applicant's payment history on a loan 
which was made to obtain a home. Such action entails consideration of 
the payment record on a previous loan in determining creditworthiness; 
it does not entail consideration of prior home ownership.
    (3)(i) Paragraph (c)(3) of this section prohibits consideration of 
the age or location of a dwelling in a real estate-related loan 
appraisal. These restrictions are intended to prohibit the use of 
unfounded or unsubstantiated assumptions regarding the effect upon loan 
risk of the age of a dwelling or the physical or economic 
characteristics of an area. Appraisals should be based on the present 
market value of the property offered as security (including 
consideration of specific improvements to be made by the borrower) and 
the likelihood that the property will retain an adequate value over the 
term of the loan.
    (ii) The term ``age of the dwelling'' does not encompass structural 
soundness. In addition, the age of the dwelling may be used by an 
appraiser as a basis for conducting further inspections of certain 
structural aspects of the dwelling. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section 
does, however, prohibit an unsubstantiated determination that a house 
over X years in age is not structurally sound.
    (iii) With respect to location factors, paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section recognizes that there may be location factors which may be 
considered in an appraisal, and requires that the use of any such 
factors be specifically documented in the appraisal. These factors will 
most often be those location factors which may negatively affect the 
short range future value (up to 3-5 years) of a property. Factors which 
in some cases may cause the market value of a property to decline are 
recent zoning changes or a significant number of abandoned homes in the 
immediate vicinity of the property. However, not all zoning changes will 
cause a decline in property values, and proximity to abandoned buildings 
may not

[[Page 364]]

affect the market value of a property because the cause of abandonment 
is unrelated to high risk. Proper considerations include the condition 
and utility of the improvement and various physical factors such as 
street conditions, amenities such as parks and recreation areas, 
availability of public utilities and municipal services, and exposure to 
flooding and land faults.

Sec. 701.32  Payment on shares by public units and nonmembers.

    (a) Authority. A Federal credit union may, to the extent permitted 
under Section 107(6) of the Act and this section, receive payments on 
shares, (regular shares, share certificates, and share draft accounts) 
from public units and political subdivisions thereof (as those terms are 
defined in Sec. 745.1) and nonmember credit unions, and to the extent 
permitted under the Act, this section and Sec. 701.34, receive payments 
on shares (regular shares, share certificates, and share draft accounts) 
from other nonmembers.
    (b) Limitations. (1) Unless a greater amount has been approved by 
the Regional Director, the maximum amount of all public unit and 
nonmember shares shall not, at any given time, exceed 20% of the total 
shares of the federal credit union or $1.5 million, whichever is 
greater.
    (2) Before accepting any public unit or nonmember shares in excess 
of 20% of total shares, the board of directors must adopt a specific 
written plan concerning the intended use of these shares and forward a 
copy of the plan to the Regional Director. The plan must include:
    (i) A statement of the credit union's needs, sources and intended 
uses of public unit and nonmember shares;
    (ii) Provision for matching maturities of public unit and nonmember 
shares with corresponding assets, or justification for any mismatch; and
    (iii) Provision for adequate income spread between public unit and 
nonmember shares and corresponding assets.
    (3) A federal credit union seeking an exemption from the limits of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section must submit to the Regional Director a 
written request including:
    (i) The new maximum level of public unit and nonmember shares 
requested, either as a dollar amount or a percentage of total shares;
    (ii) The current plan adopted by the credit union's board of 
directors concerning the use of new public unit and nonmember shares;
    (iii) A copy of the credit union's latest financial statement; and
    (iv) A copy of the credit union's loan and investment policies.
    (4) Where the financial condition and management of the credit union 
are sound and the credit union's plan for the funds is reasonable, there 
will be a presumption in favor of granting the request. When granted, 
exemptions will normally be for a two-year period. The Regional Director 
will provide a written explanation for an exemption that is granted for 
a lesser time period.
    (5) The Regional Director will provide a written determination on an 
exemption request within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request. 
The 30 day period will not begin to run until all necessary information 
has been submitted to the Regional Director. All denials may be appealed 
to the NCUA Board in a timely manner. Appeals should be submitted 
through the Regional Director.
    (6) Upon expiration of an exemption, nonmember shares currently in 
the credit union in excess of the limits established pursuant to (b)(1) 
of this section will continue to be insured by the National Credit Union 
Insurance Fund within applicable limits. No new shares in excess of the 
limits established pursuant to (b)(1) of this section shall be accepted. 
Existing share certificates in excess of the limits established pursuant 
to (b)(1) of this section may remain in the credit union only until 
maturity.
    (c) The limitations herein do not apply to accounts maintained in 
accordance with Sec. 701.37 (Treasury Tax and Loan Depositaries; 
Depositaries and Financial Agents of the Government) and matching funds 
required by Sec. 705.7(b) (Community Development Revolving Loan Program 
for Credit Unions). Once a loan granted pursuant

[[Page 365]]

to part 705 is repaid, nonmember share deposits accepted to meet the 
matching requirement are subject to this section.

Sec. 701.33  Reimbursement, insurance, and indemnification of officials and employees.

    (a) Official. An official is a person who is or was a member of the 
board of directors, credit committee or supervisory committee, or other 
volunteer committee established by the board of directors.
    (b) Compensation. (1) Only one board officer, if any, may be 
compensated as an officer of the board. The bylaws must specify the 
officer to be compensated, if any, as well as the specific duties of 
each of the board officers. No other official may receive compensation 
for performing the duties or responsibilities of the board or committee 
position to which the person has been elected or appointed.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term compensation specifically 
excludes:
    (i) Payment (by reimbursement to an official or direct credit union 
payment to a third party) for reasonable and proper costs incurred by an 
official in carrying out the responsibilities of the position to which 
that person has been elected or appointed, if the payment is determined 
by the board of directors to be necessary or appropriate in order to 
carry out the official business of the credit union, and is in 
accordance with written policies and procedures, including documentation 
requirements, established by the board of directors. Such payments may 
include the payment of travel costs for officials and one guest per 
official;
    (ii) Provision of reasonable health, accident and related types of 
personal insurance protection, supplied for officials at the expense of 
the credit union: Provided, that such insurance protection must exclude 
life insurance; must be limited to areas of risk, including accidental 
death and dismemberment, to which the official is exposed by reason of 
carrying out the duties or responsibilities of the official's credit 
union position; must cease immediately upon the insured person's leaving 
office, without providing residual benefits other than from pending 
claims, if any; except that a credit union must comply with federal and 
state laws providing departing officials the right to maintain health 
insurance coverage at their own expense and
    (iii) Indemnification and related insurance consistent with 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Indemnification. (1) A Federal credit union may indemnify its 
officials and current and former employees for expenses reasonably 
incurred in connection with judicial or administrative proceedings to 
which they are or may become parties by reason of the performance of 
their official duties.
    (2) Indemnification shall be consistent either with the standards 
applicable to credit unions generally in the state in which the 
principal or home office of the credit union is located, or with the 
relevant provisions of the Model Business Corporation Act. A Federal 
credit union that elects to provide indemnification shall specify 
whether it will follow the relevant state law or the Model Business 
Corporation Act. Indemnification and the method of indemnification may 
be provided for by charter or bylaw amendment, contract or board 
resolution, consistent with the procedural requirements of the 
applicable state law or the Model Business Corporation Act, as 
specified. A charter or bylaw amendment must be approved by the National 
Credit Union Administration.
    (3) A Federal credit union may purchase and maintain insurance on 
behalf of its officials and employees against any liability asserted 
against them and expenses incurred by them in their official capacities 
and arising out of the performance of their official duties to the 
extent such insurance is permitted by the applicable state law or the 
Model Business Corporation Act.
    (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, a 
federal credit union may not indemnify a dual employee for duties 
performed for any employer other than the federal credit union. For 
purposes of this subsection, a dual employee is a federal credit

[[Page 366]]

union employee who also performs work functions for another entity as 
part of a sharing arrangement between the federal credit union and the 
other entity.

Sec. 701.34  Designation of low income status; Acceptance of secondary capital accounts by low-income designated credit unions.

    (a) Designation of low-income status. (1) Section 107(6) of the 
Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1757(6)) authorizes federal credit 
unions serving predominantly low-income members to receive shares, share 
drafts and share certificates from nonmembers. In order to utilize this 
authority, a federal credit union must receive a low-income designation 
from its Regional Director. The designation may be removed by the 
Regional Director upon notice to the federal credit union if the 
definitions set forth in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section are 
no longer met. Removals may be appealed to the NCUA Board within 60 
days. Appeals should be submitted through the Regional Director.
    (2) The term low-income members shall mean those members who make 
less than 80 percent of the average for all wage earners as established 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or those members whose annual 
household income falls at or below 80 percent of the median household 
income for the nation as established by the Census Bureau or those 
members otherwise defined as low-income members as determined by order 
of the NCUA Board.
    (i) In documenting its low-income membership, a credit union that 
serves a geographic area where a majority of residents fall at or below 
the annual income standard is presumed to be serving predominantly low-
income members. In applying the standards, Regional Directors shall make 
allowances for geographical areas with higher costs of living. The 
following is the exclusive list of geographic areas with the 
differentials to be used:

 
                                                                 Percent
 
Hawaii.........................................................       40
Alaska.........................................................       36
Washington, DC.................................................       19
Boston.........................................................       17
San Diego......................................................       15
Los Angeles....................................................       14
New York.......................................................       13
San Francisco..................................................       13
Seattle........................................................       10
Chicago........................................................        7
Philadelphia...................................................        7
 

    (ii) The term low-income member also includes those members who are 
enrolled as full-time or part-time students in a college, university, 
high school, or vocational school.
    (3) The term predominantly is defined as a simple majority.
    (b) Acceptance of secondary capital accounts by low-income 
designated credit unions. A federal credit union having a designation of 
low-income status pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may accept 
secondary capital accounts from nonnatural person members and nonnatural 
person nonmembers subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Secondary capital plan. Before accepting secondary capital, a 
low-income credit union (``LICU'') shall adopt, and forward to the 
appropriate NCUA Regional Director for approval, a written ``Secondary 
Capital Plan'' that, at a minimum:
    (i) States the maximum aggregate amount of uninsured secondary 
capital the LICU plans to accept;
    (ii) Identifies the purpose for which the aggregate secondary 
capital will be used, and how it will be repaid;
    (iii) Explains how the LICU will provide for liquidity to repay 
secondary capital upon maturity of the accounts;
    (iv) Demonstrates that the planned uses of secondary capital conform 
to the LICU's strategic plan, business plan and budget; and
    (v) Includes supporting pro forma financial statements, including 
any off-balance sheet items, covering a minimum of the next two years.
    (2) Decision on plan. If a LICU is not notified within 45 days of 
receipt of a Secondary Capital Plan that the plan is approved or 
disapproved, the LICU may proceed to accept secondary capital accounts 
pursuant to the plan.

[[Page 367]]

    (3) Nonshare account. The secondary capital account must be 
established as an uninsured secondary capital account or other form of 
non-share account.
    (4) Minimum maturity. The maturity of the secondary capital account 
must be a minimum of five years.
    (5) Uninsured account. The secondary capital account will not be 
insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or any 
governmental or private entity.
    (6) Subordination of claim. The secondary capital account investor's 
claim against the LICU must be subordinate to all other claims including 
those of shareholders, creditors and the National Credit Union Share 
Insurance Fund.
    (7) Availability to cover losses. Funds deposited into a secondary 
capital account, including interest accrued and paid into the secondary 
capital account, must be available to cover operating losses realized by 
the LICU that exceed its net available reserves (exclusive of secondary 
capital and allowance accounts for loan and lease losses), and to the 
extent funds are so used, the LICU must not restore or replenish the 
account under any circumstances. The LICU may, in lieu of paying 
interest into the secondary capital account, pay accrued interest 
directly to the investor or into a separate account from which the 
secondary capital investor may make withdrawals. Losses must be 
distributed pro-rata among all secondary capital accounts held by the 
LICU at the time the losses are realized.
    (8) Security. The secondary capital account may not be pledged or 
provided by the account investor as security on a loan or other 
obligation with the LICU or any other party.
    (9) Merger or dissolution. In the event of merger or other voluntary 
dissolution of the LICU, other than merger into another LICU, the 
secondary capital accounts will be closed and paid out to the account 
investor to the extent they are not needed to cover losses at the time 
of merger or dissolution.
    (10) Contract agreement. A secondary capital account contract 
agreement must be executed by an authorized representative of the 
account investor and of the LICU reflecting the terms and conditions 
mandated by this section and any other terms and conditions not 
inconsistent with this section.
    (11) Disclosure and acknowledgement. An authorized representative of 
the LICU and of the secondary capital account investor each must execute 
a ``Disclosure and Acknowledgment'' as set forth in the Appendix to this 
section at the time of entering into the account agreement. The LICU 
must retain an original of the account agreement and the ``Disclosure 
and Acknowledgment'' for the term of the agreement, and a copy must be 
provided to the account investor.
    (12) Prompt corrective action. As provided in Sec. Sec. 
702.204(b)(11), 702.304(b) and 702.305(b) of this chapter, the NCUA 
Board may prohibit a LICU classified ``critically undercapitalized'' or, 
if ``new,'' as ``moderately capitalized'', ``marginally capitalized'', 
``minimally capitalized'' or ``uncapitalized'', as the case may be, from 
paying principal, dividends or interest on its uninsured secondary 
capital accounts established after August 7, 2000, except that unpaid 
dividends or interest will continue to accrue under the terms of the 
account to the extent permitted by law.
    (c) Accounting treatment; Recognition of net worth value of 
accounts--(1) Equity account. A LICU that issues secondary capital 
accounts pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section must record the funds 
on its balance sheet in an equity account entitled ``uninsured secondary 
capital account.''
    (2) Schedule for recognizing net worth value. For accounts with 
remaining maturities of less than five years, the LICU must reflect the 
net worth value of the accounts in its financial statement in accordance 
with the following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Net worth
                                                               value of
                     Remaining maturity                        original
                                                               balance
                                                              (percent)

One to less than two years.................................           20
Less than one year.........................................            0
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 368]]

    (3) Financial statement. The LICU must reflect the full amount of 
the secondary capital on deposit in a footnote to its financial 
statement.
    (d) Redemption of secondary capital. With the written approval of 
the appropriate Regional Director, secondary capital that is not 
recognized as net worth under paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
(``discounted secondary capital'' recategorized as subordinated debt) 
may be redeemed according to the remaining maturity schedule in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (1) Request to redeem secondary capital. A request for approval to 
redeem discounted secondary capital may be submitted in writing at any 
time, must specify the increment(s) to be redeemed and the schedule for 
redeeming all any part of each eligible increment, and must demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of the appropriate Regional Director that:
    (i) The LICU will have a post-redemption net worth classification of 
``adequately capitalized'' under part 702 of this chapter;
    (ii) The discounted secondary capital has been on deposit at least 
two years;
    (iii) The discounted secondary capital will not be needed to cover 
losses prior to final maturity of the account;
    (iv) The LICU's books and records are current and reconciled;
    (v) The proposed redemption will not jeopardize other current 
sources of funding, if any, to the LICU; and
    (vi) The request to redeem is authorized by resolution of the LICU's 
board of directors.
    (2) Decision on request. A request to redeem discounted secondary 
capital may be granted in whole or in part. If a LICU is not notified 
within 45 days of receipt of a request for approval to redeem secondary 
capital that its request is either granted or denied, the LICU may 
proceed to redeem secondary capital accounts as proposed.
    (3) Schedule for redeeming secondary capital.

                        Appendix to Sec. 701.34

    A LICU that is authorized to accept uninsured secondary capital 
accounts and each investor in such an account shall execute and date the 
following ``Disclosure and Acknowledgment'' form, a signed original of 
which must be retained by the credit union:

                      Disclosure and Acknowledgment

    [Name of CU] and [Name of investor] hereby acknowledge and agree 
that [Name of investor] has committed [amount of funds] to a secondary 
capital account with [name of credit union] under the following terms 
and conditions:
    1. Term. The funds committed to the secondary capital account are 
committed for a period of ---- years.
    2. Redemption prior to maturity. Subject to the conditions set forth 
in 12 CFR 701.34, the funds committed to the secondary capital account 
are redeemable prior to maturity only at the option of the LICU and only 
with the prior approval of the appropriate regional director.
    3. Uninsured, non-share account. The secondary capital account is 
not a share account and the funds committed to the secondary capital 
account are not insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance 
Fund or any other governmental or private entity.
    4. Prepayment risk. Redemption of U.S.C. prior to the account's 
original maturity date may expose the account investor to the risk of 
being unable to reinvest the repaid funds at the same rate of interest 
for the balance of the period remaining until the original maturity 
date. The investor acknowledges that it understands and assumes 
responsibility for prepayment risk associated with the [name of credit 
union]'s redemption of the investor's U.S.C. account prior to the 
original maturity date.
    5. Availability to cover losses. The funds committed to the 
secondary capital account and any interest paid into the account may be 
used by [name of credit union] to cover any and all operating losses 
that exceed the credit union's net worth exclusive of allowance accounts 
for loan losses, and in the event the funds are so used, (name of credit 
union) will under no circumstances restore or replenish those funds to 
[name of institutional investor]. Dividends are not considered operating 
losses and are not eligible to be paid out of secondary capital.

[[Page 369]]

    6. Accrued interest. By initialing below, [name of credit union] and 
[name of institutional investor] agree that accrued interest will be:

----Paid into and become part of the secondary capital account;
----Paid directly to the investor;
----Paid into a separate account from which the investor may make 
          withdrawals; or
----Any combination of the above provided the details are specified and 
          agreed to in writing.

    7. Subordination of claims. In the event of liquidation of [name of 
credit union], the funds committed to the secondary capital account will 
be subordinate to all other claims on the assets of the credit union, 
including claims of member shareholders, creditors and the National 
Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.
    8. Prompt Corrective Action. Under certain net worth classifications 
(see 12 CFR 702.204(b)(11), 702.304(b) and 702.305(b), as the case may 
be), the NCUA Board may prohibit [name of credit union] from paying 
principal, dividends or interest on its uninsured secondary capital 
accounts established after August 7, 2000, except that unpaid dividends 
or interest will continue to accrue under the terms of the account to 
the extent permitted by law.

Sec. 701.35  Share, share draft, and share certificate accounts.

    (a) Federal credit unions may offer share, share draft, and share 
certificate accounts in accordance with section 107(6) of the Act (12 
U.S.C. 1757(6)) and the board of directors may declare dividends on such 
accounts as provided in section 117 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1763).
    (b) A Federal credit union shall accurately represent the terms and 
conditions of its share, share draft, and share certificate accounts in 
all advertising, disclosures, or agreements, whether written or oral
    (c) A Federal credit union may, consistent with this section, parts 
707 and 740 of this subchapter, other federal law, and its contractual 
obligations, determine the types of fees or charges and other matters 
affecting the opening, maintaining and closing of a share, share draft 
or share certificate account. State laws regulating such activities are 
not applicable to federal credit unions.
    (d) For purposes of this section, ``state law'' means the 
constitution, statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions of any 
state, the District of Columbia, the several territories and possessions 
of the United States, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

Sec. 701.36  FCU ownership of fixed assets.

    (a) Investment in Fixed Assets. (1) No Federal credit union with 
$1,000,000 or more in assets may invest in any fixed assets if the 
investment would cause the aggregate of all such investments to exceed 
five percent of the credit union's shares and retained earnings.
    (2) The NCUA may waive the prohibition in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (i) A Federal credit union desiring a waiver must submit a written 
request to the NCUA regional office having jurisdiction over the 
geographical area in which the credit union's main office is located. 
The request must describe in detail the contemplated investment and the 
need for the investment. The request must also indicate the approximate 
aggregate amount of fixed assets, as a percentage of shares and retained 
earnings, that the credit union would hold after the investment.
    (ii) The regional director will inform the requesting credit union, 
in writing, of the date the request was received and of any additional 
documentation that the regional director might require in support of the 
waiver request.
    (iii) The regional director will approve or disapprove the waiver 
request in writing within 45 days after receipt of the request and all 
necessary supporting documentation. If the regional director approves 
the waiver, the regional director will establish an alternative limit on 
aggregate investments

[[Page 370]]

in fixed assets, either as a dollar limit or as a percentage of the 
credit union's shares and retained earnings. Unless otherwise specified 
by the regional director, the credit union may make future acquisition 
of fixed assets only if the aggregate all of such future investments in 
fixed assets does not exceed an additional one percent of the shares and 
retained earnings of the credit union over the amount approved by the 
regional director.
    (iv) If the regional director does not notify the credit union of 
the action taken on its request within 45 calendar days of the receipt 
of the waiver request or the receipt of additional requested supporting 
information, whichever occurs later, the credit union may proceed with 
its proposed investment in fixed assets. The investment, and any future 
investments in fixed assets, must not cause the credit union to exceed 
the aggregate investment limit described in its waiver request.
    (b) Premises Not Currently Used To Transact Credit Union Business. 
(1) When a Federal credit union acquires premises for future expansion 
and does not fully occupy the space within one year, the credit union 
must have a board resolution in place by the end of that year with 
definitive plans for full occupation. Premises are fully occupied when 
the credit union, or a combination of the credit union, CUSOs, or 
vendors, use the entire space on a full-time basis. CUSOs and vendors 
must be using the space primarily to support the credit union or to 
serve the credit union's members. The credit union must make any plans 
for full occupation available to an NCUA examiner upon request.
    (2) When a Federal credit union acquires premises for future 
expansion, the credit union must partially occupy the premises within a 
reasonable period, not to exceed three years. Premises are partially 
occupied when the credit union is using some part of the space on a 
full-time basis. The NCUA may waive this partial occupation requirement 
in writing upon written request. The request must be made within 30 
months after the property is acquired.
    (3) A Federal credit union must make diligent efforts to dispose of 
abandoned premises and any other real property not intended for use in 
the conduct of credit union business. The credit union must seek fair 
market value for the property, and record its efforts to dispose of 
abandoned premises. After premises have been abandoned for four years, 
the credit union must publicly advertise the property for sale. Unless 
otherwise approved in writing by the NCUA, the credit union must 
complete the sale within five years of abandonment.
    (c) Prohibited Transactions. (1) Without the prior written approval 
of the NCUA, no federal credit union may invest in premises through an 
acquisition or a lease of one year or longer from any of the following:
    (i) A director, member of the credit committee or supervisory 
committee, or senior management employee of the federal credit union, or 
immediate family member of any such individual.
    (ii) A corporation in which any director, member of the credit 
committee or supervisory committee, official, or senior management 
employee, or immediate family members of any such individual, is an 
officer or director, or has a stock interest of 10 percent or more.
    (iii) A partnership, limited liability company, or other entity in 
which any director, member of the credit committee or supervisory 
committee, or senior management employee, or immediate family members of 
any such individual, is a general partner, or a limited partner or 
entity member with an interest of 10 percent or more.
    (2) The prohibition contained in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
also applies to a lease from any other employee if the employee is 
directly involved in investments in fixed assets unless the board of 
directors determines that the employee's involvement does not present a 
conflict of interest.
    (3) All transactions with business associates or family members not 
specifically prohibited by this paragraph (c) must be conducted at arm's 
length and in the interest of the credit union.
    (d) Regulatory Flexibility Program. Federal credit unions that 
qualify for the Regulatory Flexibility Program provided for in part 742 
of this chapter are exempt from the five percent limitation described in 
paragraph (a) of

[[Page 371]]

this section. For Federal credit unions eligible for the Regulatory 
Flexibility Program that subsequently lose eligibility:
    (1) Section 742.8 of this chapter provides that NCUA may require the 
credit union to divest any existing fixed assets for substantive safety 
and soundness reasons; and
    (2) The credit union may not make any new investments in fixed 
assets if, after the investment, the credit union's total investments in 
fixed assets would exceed the five percent limitation described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The regional director may waive this 
prohibition to allow for new investments.
    (e) Definitions--As used in this section:
    (1) Abandoned premises means real property previously used to 
transact credit union business but no longer used for that purpose and 
real property originally acquired for future expansion for which the 
credit union no longer contemplates such use.
    (2) Fixed assets means premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment.
    (3) Furniture, fixtures, and equipment means all office furnishings, 
office machines, computer hardware and software, automated terminals, 
and heating and cooling equipment.
    (4) Investments in fixed assets means:
    (i) Any investment in improved or unimproved real property which is 
being used or is intended to be used as premises;
    (ii) Any leasehold improvement on premises;
    (iii) The aggregate of all capital and operating lease payments on 
fixed assets, without discounting commitments for future payments to 
present value; and
    (iv) Any investment in furniture, fixtures and equipment.
    (5) Immediate family member means a spouse or other family members 
living in the same household.
    (6) Premises means any office, branch office, suboffice, service 
center, parking lot, other facility, or real estate where the credit 
union transacts or will transact business.
    (7) Senior management employee means the credit union's chief 
executive officer (typically this individual holds the title of 
President or Treasurer/Manager), any assistant chief executive officers 
(e.g., Assistant President, Vice President or Assistant Treasurer/
Manager) and the chief financial officer (Comptroller).
    (8) Shares means regular shares, share drafts, share certificates, 
other savings.
    (9) Retained earnings means undivided earnings, regular reserve, 
reserve for contingencies, supplemental reserves, reserve for losses, 
and other appropriations from undivided earnings as designated by 
management or the Administration.

Pt. 701, App. A  Statutory lien.

    (a) Definitions. Within this section, each of the following terms 
has the meaning prescribed below:
    (1) Except as otherwise provided by law or except as otherwise 
provided by federal law is a qualifying phrase referring to a federal 
and/or state law, as the case may be, which supersedes a requirement of 
this section. It is the responsibility of the credit union to ascertain 
whether such statutory or case law exists and is applicable;
    (2) Impress means to attach to a member's account and is the act 
which makes the lien enforceable against that account;
    (3) Member means any member who is primarily, secondarily or 
otherwise responsible for an outstanding financial obligation to the 
credit union, including without limitation an obligor, maker, co-maker, 
guarantor, co-signer, endorser, surety or accommodation party;
    (4) Notice means written notice to a member disclosing, in plain 
language, that the credit union has the right to impress and enforce a 
statutory lien against the member's shares and dividends in the event of 
failure to satisfy a financial obligation, and may enforce the right 
without further notice to the member. Such notice must be given at the 
time, or at any time before, the member incurs the financial obligation;
    (5) Statutory lien means the right granted by section 107(11) of the 
Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1757(11), to a federal credit union 
to establish a right in or claim to a member's shares and dividends 
equal to the amount of that member's outstanding financial obligation to 
the credit union, as that amount varies from time to time.
    (b) Superior claim. Except as otherwise provided by law, a statutory 
lien gives the federal credit union priority over other creditors when 
claims are asserted against a member's account(s).
    (c) Impressing a statutory lien. Except as otherwise provided by 
federal law, a credit union can impress a statutory lien on a member's

account agreement(s) or other account opening documentation; or
    (2) Loan documents. In the case of a loan, by giving notice thereof 
in a loan document signed or otherwise acknowledged by the member(s); or
    (3) By-Law or policy. Through a duly adopted credit union by-law or 
policy of the board of directors, of which the member is given notice.
    (d) Enforcing a statutory lien--(1) Application of funds. Except as 
otherwise provided by federal law, a federal credit union may enforce 
its statutory lien against a member's account(s) by debiting funds in 
the account and applying them to the extent of any of the member's 
outstanding financial obligations to the credit union.
    (2) Default required. A federal credit union may enforce its 
statutory lien against a member's account(s) only when the member fails 
to satisfy an outstanding financial obligation due and payable to the 
credit union.
    (3) Neither judgment nor set-off required. A federal credit union 
need not obtain a court judgment on the member's debt, nor exercise the 
equitable right of set-off, prior to enforcing its statutory lien 
against the member's account.

<R05>
        Sec. Appendix A to Part 701--Federal Credit Union Bylaws

                              Introduction

    A. Effective date. After consideration of public comment, the 
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Board adopted these Bylaws 
and incorporated them as Appendix A to Part 701 of NCUA's regulations on 
November 30, 2007. Unless a federal credit union has adopted bylaws 
before November 30, 2007, it must adopt these revised bylaws.
    B. Adoption of all or part of these bylaws. Although federal credit 
unions may retain any previously approved version of the bylaws, the 
NCUA Board encourages federal credit unions to adopt the revised bylaws 
because it believes they provide greater clarity and flexibility for 
credit unions and their officials and members. Federal credit unions may 
also adopt portions of the revised bylaws and retain the remainder of 
previously approved bylaws, but the NCUA Board cautions federal credit 
unions to be extremely careful. Federal credit unions must be careful 
because they run the risk of having inconsistent or conflicting 
provisions because of the various options the revised bylaws provide as 
well as other revisions in the text.
    C. Bylaw amendments. 1. The FCU Bylaws contain several provisions 
allowing FCU boards to select from an option or range of options and 
fill in a blank. Changes to ``fill-in-the-blank'' provisions are, in 
fact, changes to the FCU's bylaws and require a two-thirds vote of the 
board. As long as the FCU selects from the permissible options for 
completing the blank, the FCU need not submit the change for NCUA 
approval using the process outlined below.
    2. Federal credit unions continue to have the flexibility to request 
other bylaw amendments if the need arises. NCUA must approve any bylaw 
amendments; federal credit unions may no longer adopt amendments from 
the ``Standard Bylaw Amendments'' booklet because the 1999 revisions to 
the bylaws included sufficient flexibility to make the separate list of 
standard bylaw amendments superfluous. Thus, NCUA no longer 
differentiates between ``standard'' and ``nonstandard'' bylaw 
amendments.
    3. The procedure for approval of bylaw amendments is as follows:
    a. The federal credit union wishing to adopt a bylaw amendment must 
file a request with its regional director.
    b. The request must include the section of the bylaws to be amended; 
the reason for or purpose of the amendment, including an explanation of 
why the amendment is desirable and what it will accomplish for the 
credit union; and the specific, proposed wording of the amendment.
    c. After review by the regional director and consultation within the 
agency, the regional director will advise the credit union if a proposed 
amendment is approved.
    4. Federal credit unions considering an amendment may find it useful 
to review the bylaws section of the agency Web site, which includes 
Office of General Counsel opinions about proposed bylaw amendments. 
Opinions issued after April 2006 will include the language of approved 
amendments. Even if an amendment has been previously approved, the 
credit union must submit a proposed amendment to NCUA for review under 
the procedure listed above to ensure the amendment is identical. Credit 
unions requesting previously approved amendments will receive notice of 
the regional office's decision within 15 business days of the receipt of 
the request.
    D. The nature of the bylaws. 1. The Federal Credit Union Act 
requires the NCUA Board to prepare bylaws for federal credit unions. 12 
U.S.C. 1758. The bylaws address a broad range of matters concerning a 
credit union's organization and governance, the relationship of the 
credit union to its members, and

[[Page 374]]

the procedures and rules a credit union follows. The bylaws supplement 
the broad provisions of: A federal credit union's charter, which 
establishes the existence of a federal credit union; the Federal Credit 
Union Act, which establishes the powers of federal credit unions; and 
NCUA regulations, which implement the Federal Credit Union Act. As a 
legal matter, a federal credit union's bylaws must conform to and cannot 
be inconsistent with any provision of its charter, the Federal Credit 
Union Act, NCUA regulations or other laws or regulations applicable to 
its operations.
    2. NCUA expects federal credit unions and their members will make 
every effort to resolve bylaw disputes using the credit union's internal 
member complaint resolution process. If a bylaw dispute cannot be 
resolved internally, however, credit union officials or members should 
contact the regional office with jurisdiction for the credit union for 
assistance in resolving the dispute.
    3. NCUA has discretion to take administrative actions when a credit 
union is not in compliance with its bylaws. If a potential violation is 
identified, NCUA will carefully consider all of the facts and 
circumstances in deciding whether to take enforcement action. NCUA will 
not take action against minor or technical violations, but emphasizes 
that it retains discretion to enforce the bylaws in appropriate cases, 
such as safety and soundness concerns or threats to fundamental, 
material credit union member rights.

              Federal Credit Union, Charter No.------------

      (A corporation chartered under the laws of the United States)

                        Article I. Name--Purposes

    Section 1. Name. The name of this credit union is as stated in 
Section 1 of the charter (approved organization certificate) of this 
credit union.
    Section 2. Purposes. This credit union is a member-owned, 
democratically operated, not-for-profit organization managed by a 
volunteer board of directors, with the specified mission of meeting the 
credit and savings needs of consumers, especially persons of modest 
means. The purpose of this credit union is to promote thrift among its 
members by affording them an opportunity to accumulate their savings and 
to create for them a source of credit for provident or productive 
purposes. The credit union may add business as one of its purposes by 
placing a comma after ``provident'' and inserting ``business.''

                Article II. Qualifications for Membership

    Section 1. Field of membership. The field of membership of this 
credit union is limited to that stated in Section 5 of its charter.
    Section 2. Membership application procedures. Applications for 
membership from persons eligible for membership under Section 5 of the 
charter must be signed by the applicant on forms approved by the board. 
The applicant is admitted to membership after approval of an application 
by a majority of the directors, a majority of the members of a duly 
authorized executive committee, or by a membership officer, and after 
subscription to at least one share of this credit union and the payment 
of the initial installment, and the payment of a uniform entrance fee if 
required by the board. If a person whose membership application is 
denied makes a written request, the credit union must explain the 
reasons for the denial in writing.
    Section 3. Maintenance of membership share required. A member who 
withdraws all shareholdings or fails to comply with the time 
requirements for restoring his or her account balance to par value in 
Article III, Section 3, ceases to be a member. By resolution, the board 
may require persons readmitted to membership to pay another entrance 
fee.
    Section 4. Continuation of membership. Once a member becomes a 
member that person may remain a member until the person or organization 
chooses to withdraw or is expelled in accordance with the Act and 
Article XIV of these bylaws. A member who is disruptive to credit union 
operations may be subject to limitations on services and access to 
credit

[[Page 375]]

union facilities. A credit union that wishes to restrict services to 
members no longer within the field of membership should specify the 
restrictions in this section.
    Staff commentary on qualifications for membership:
    Entrance fee--FCUs may not vary the entrance fee among different 
classes of members because the Act requires a uniform fee. FCUs may, 
however, eliminate the entrance fee for all applicants.

                     Article III. Shares of Members

    Section 1. Par value. The par value of each share will be $------. 
Subscriptions to shares are payable at the time of subscription, or in 
installments of at least $------ per month.
    Section 2. Cap on shares held by one person. The board may 
establish, by resolution, the maximum amount of shares that any one 
member may hold.
    Section 3. Time periods for payment and maintenance of membership 
share. A member who fails to complete payment of one share within ------ 
of admission to membership, or within ------ from the increase in the 
par value of shares, or a member who reduces the share balance below the 
par value of one share and does not increase the balance to at least the 
par value of one share within ------ of the reduction will be terminated 
from membership.
    Section 4. Transferability. Shares may only be transferred from one 
member to another by an instrument in a form as the board may prescribe. 
Shares that accrue credits for unpaid dividends retain those credits 
when transferred.
    Section 5. Withdrawals. Money paid in on shares or installments of 
shares may be withdrawn as provided in these bylaws or regulation on any 
day when payment on shares may be made, provided, however, that
    (a) The board has the right, at any time, to require members to give 
up to 60 days written notice of intention to withdraw the whole or any 
part of the amounts paid in by them.
    (b) Reserved.
    (c) No member may withdraw any shareholdings below the amount of the 
member's primary or contingent liability to the credit union if the 
member is delinquent as a borrower, or if borrowers for whom the member 
is comaker, endorser, or guarantor are delinquent, without the written 
approval of the credit committee or loan officer. Coverage of overdrafts 
under an overdraft protection policy does not constitute delinquency for 
purposes of this paragraph. Shares issued in an irrevocable trust as 
provided in Section 6 of this article are not subject to withdrawal 
restrictions except as stated in the trust agreement.
    (d) The share account of a deceased member (other than one held in 
joint tenancy with another member) may be continued until the close of 
the dividend period in which the administration of the deceased's estate 
is completed.
    (e) The board will have the right, at any time, to impose a fee for 
excessive share withdrawals from regular share accounts. The number of 
withdrawals not subject to a fee and the amount of the fee will be 
established by board resolution and will be subject to regulations 
applicable to the advertising and disclosure of terms and conditions on 
member accounts.
    Section 6. Trusts. Shares may be issued in a revocable or 
irrevocable trust, subject to the following:
    When shares are issued in a revocable trust, the settlor must be a 
member of this credit union in his or her own right. When shares are 
issued in an irrevocable trust, either the settlor or the beneficiary 
must be a member of this credit union. The name of the beneficiary must 
be stated in both a revocable and irrevocable trust. For purposes of 
this section, shares issued pursuant to a pension plan authorized by the 
rules and regulations will be treated as an irrevocable trust unless 
otherwise indicated in the rules and regulations.
    Section 7. Joint accounts and membership requirements. Select one 
option and check the box corresponding to that option.
    -- Option A--Separate account not required to establish membership
    Owners of a joint account may both be members of the credit union 
without opening separate accounts. For joint membership, both owners are 
required to fulfill all of the membership requirements including each 
member purchasing and maintaining at least one share in the account.
    -- Option B--Separate account required to establish membership
    Each member must purchase and maintain at least one share in a share 
account that names the member as the sole or primary owner. Being named 
as a joint owner of a joint account is insufficient to establish 
membership.
    Staff commentary on shares:
    i. Installments--FCUs may insert zero for the number of 
installments. The FCU Act allows membership upon the payment of the 
initial installment of a membership share, but NCUA no longer views this 
provision as requiring FCUs to offer the option of paying for the 
membership share in installments.
    ii. Par value--FCUs may establish differing par values for different 
classes of members or types of accounts, provided this action does not 
violate any federal, state or local antidiscrimination laws. For 
example, an FCU may want to establish a higher par value for recent 
credit union members, without requiring long-time members to bring their 
accounts up to the new par value. A differing par value may also be 
permissible

[[Page 376]]

for different types of accounts, such as requiring a higher par value 
for a member with only a share draft account. If a credit union adopts 
differing par values, all of the possible par values should be stated in 
Section 1.
    iii. Reduction in share balance below par value--When a member's 
account balance falls below the par value, Section 3 requires FCUs to 
allow members a minimum time period to restore their account balance to 
the par value before membership is terminated. FCUs may not delete this 
requirement or delete references to this requirement in Article II, 
Section 3.

                     Article IV. Meetings of Members

    Section 1. Annual meeting. The annual meeting of the members must be 
held [insert time for annual meeting, for example, ``during the month of 
March/on the third Saturday of April/ no later than March 31''], in the 
county in which any office of the credit union is located or within a 
radius of 100 miles of an office, at the time and place as the board 
determines and announces in the notice of the annual meeting.
    Section 2. Notice of meetings required. a. At least 30 but no more 
than 75 days before the date of any annual meeting or at least 7 days 
before the date of any special meeting of the members, the secretary 
must give written notice to each member. Notice may be by written notice 
delivered in person or by mail to the member's address, or, for members 
who have opted to receive statements and notices electronically, by 
electronic mail. Notice of the annual meeting may be given by posting 
the notice in a conspicuous place in the office of this credit union 
where it may be read by the members, at least 30 days before the 
meeting, if the annual meeting is to be held during the same month as 
that of the previous annual meeting and if this credit union maintains 
an office that is readily accessible to members where regular business 
hours are maintained. Any meeting of the members, whether annual or 
special, may be held without prior notice, at any place or time, if all 
the members entitled to vote, who are not present at the meeting, waive 
notice in writing, before, during, or after the meeting.
    b. Notice of any special meeting must state the purpose for which it 
is to be held, and no business other than that related to this purpose 
may be transacted at the meeting.
    Section 3. Special meetings. a. Special meetings of the members may 
be called by the chair or the board of directors upon a majority vote, 
or by the supervisory committee as provided in these bylaws. The chair 
must call a special meeting, meaning the meeting must be held, within 30 
days of the receipt of a written request of 25 members or 5% of the 
members as of the date of the request, whichever number is larger. 
However, a request of no more than 750 members may be required to call a 
special meeting.
    b. The notice of a special meeting must be given as provided in 
Section 2 of this article. Special meetings may be held at any location 
permitted for the annual meeting.
    Section 4. Items of business for annual meeting and rules of order 
for annual and special meetings. The suggested order of business at 
annual meetings of members is--
    (a) Ascertainment that a quorum is present.
    (b) Reading and approval or correction of the minutes of the last 
meeting.
    (c) Report of directors, if there is one. For credit unions 
participating in the Community Development Revolving Loan Program, the 
directors must report on the credit union's progress on providing needed 
community services, if required by NCUA Regulations.
    (d) Report of the financial officer or the chief management 
official.
    (e) Report of the credit committee, if there is one.
    (f) Report of the supervisory committee, as required by Section 115 
of the Act.
    (g) Unfinished business.
    (h) New business other than elections.
    (i) Elections, as required by Section 111 of the Act.
    (j) Adjournment.
    k. To the extent consistent with these bylaws, all meetings of the 
members will be conducted according to ------------. The order of 
business for the annual meeting may vary from the suggested order, 
provided it includes all required items and complies with the rules of 
procedure adopted by the credit union.
    The credit union must fill in the blank with one of the following 
authorities, noting the edition to be used: Democratic Rules of Order, 
The Modern Rules of Order, Robert's Rules of Order, or Sturgis' Standard 
Code of Parliamentary Procedure.
    Section 5. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided, 15 members 
constitute a quorum at annual or special meetings. If no quorum is 
present, an adjournment may be taken to a date at least 7 but not more 
than 14 days thereafter. The members present at any adjourned meeting 
will constitute a quorum, regardless of the number of members present. 
The same notice must be given for the adjourned meeting as is prescribed 
in Section 2 of this article for the original meeting, except that the 
notice must be given at least 5 days before the date of the meeting as 
fixed in the adjournment.

                          Article V. Elections

    The Credit Union must select one of the four voting options. This 
may be done by printing the credit union's bylaws with the option 
selected or retaining this copy and checking the

[[Page 377]]

box of the option selected. All options continue with Section 3 of this 
article.

  Option A1--In-Person Elections; Nominating Committee and Nominations 
                               From Floor

    Section 1. Nomination procedures. At least 30 days before each 
annual meeting, the chair will appoint a nominating committee of three 
or more members. It is the duty of the nominating committee to nominate

vacancy, for which elections are being held, and to determine that the 
members nominated are agreeable to the placing of their names in 
nomination and will accept office if elected.
    Section 2. Election procedures. After the nominations of the 
nominating committee have been placed before the members, the chair 
calls for nominations from the floor. When nominations are closed, the 
chair appoints the tellers, ballots are distributed, the vote is taken

determined by plurality vote and will be by ballot except where there is 
only one nominee for the office.

Option A2--In-Person Elections; Nominating Committee and Nominations by

submitted by the nominating committee with the written notice to all 
eligible members. Each nominee by petition must submit a similar 
statement of qualifications and biographical data with the petition. The

petition. In all cases, the period for receiving nominations by petition 
must extend at least 30 days from the date that the petition requirement 
and the list of nominating committee's nominees are mailed to all 
members. To be effective, nominations by petition must be accompanied by 
a signed certificate from the nominee or nominees stating that they are

vote and will be by ballot except where there is only one nominee for 
each position to be filled.
    b. If sufficient nominations are made by the nominating committee or 
by petition to provide at least as many nominees as positions to be 
filled, nominations cannot be made from the floor. In the event 
nominations from the floor are permitted and result in more nominees 
than positions to be filled, when nominations have been closed, the 
chair appoints the tellers, ballots are distributed, the vote is taken 
and tallied by the tellers, and the results announced. When the number 
of nominees equals the number of positions to be filled, the chair may 
take a voice vote or declare each nominee elected by general consent or 
acclamation at the annual meeting.

    Staff commentary on the election process:
    i. Eligibility Requirements: The Act and the FCU Bylaws contain the 
only eligibility requirements for membership on an FCU's board of 
directors, which are as follows:
    (a) The individual must be a member of the FCU before distribution 
of ballots;

[[Page 381]]

    (b) the individual cannot have been convicted of a crime involving 
dishonesty or breach of trust unless the NCUA Board has waived the 
prohibition for the conviction; and
    (c) the individual meets the minimum age requirement established 
under Article V, Section 7 of the FCU Bylaws.
    Anyone meeting the three eligibility requirements may run for a seat 
on the board of directors if properly nominated. It is the nominating 
committee's duty to ascertain that all nominated candidates, including 
those nominated by petition, meet the eligibility requirements.
    ii. Nomination Criteria for Nominating Committee: The FCU Act and 
the FCU Bylaws do not prohibit a board of directors from establishing 
reasonable criteria, in addition to the eligibility requirements, for a 
nominating committee to follow in making its nominations, such as 
financial experience, years of membership, or conflict of interest 
provisions. The board's nomination criteria, however, applies only to 
individuals nominated by the nominating committee; they cannot be 
imposed on individuals who meet the eligibility requirements and are 
properly nominated from the floor or by petition.
    iii. Candidates' Names on Ballots: When producing an election 
ballot, the FCU's secretary may order the names of the candidates on the 
ballot using any method for selection provided it is random and used 
consistently from year to year so as to avoid manipulation or 
favoritism.
    iv. Secret Ballots: An FCU must establish an election process that 
assures members their votes remain confidential and secret from all 
interested parties. If the election process does not separate the 
member's identity from the ballot, FCUs should use a third-party teller 
that has sole control over completed ballots. If the ballots are 
designed so that members' identities remain secret and are not disclosed 
on the ballot, FCUs may use election tellers from the FCU. In any case, 
FCU employees, officials, and members must not have access to ballots 
identifying members or to information that links members' votes to their 
identities.
    v. Plurality Voting: At least one nominee must be nominated for each 
vacant seat. When there are more nominees than seats open for election, 
the nominees who receive the greatest number of votes are elected to the 
vacant seats.
    vi. Minimum Age Requirement: The age the board selects may not be 
greater than the age of majority under the state law applicable to the 
credit union.

                     Article VI. Board of Directors

    Section 1. Number of members. The board consists of ------members, 
all of whom must be members of this credit union. The number of 
directors may be changed to an odd number not fewer than 5 nor more than 
15 by resolution of the board. No reduction in the number of directors 
may be made unless corresponding vacancies exist as a result of deaths, 
resignations, expiration of terms of office, or other actions provided 
by these bylaws. A copy of the resolution of the board covering any 
increase or decrease in the number of directors must be filed with the 
official copy of the bylaws of this credit union.
    Section 2. Composition of board. ------(Fill in the number, which 
may be zero) directors or committee members may be a paid employee of 
the credit union. ------(Fill in the number, which may be zero) 
immediate family members of a director or committee member may be a paid 
employee of the credit union. In no case may employees, family members, 
or employees and family members constitute a majority of the board. The 
board may appoint a management official who ------(may or may not) be a 
member of the board and one or more assistant management officials who 
------(may or may not) be a member of the board. If the management 
official or assistant management official is permitted to serve on the 
board, he or she may not serve as the chair.
    Section 3. Terms of office. Regular terms of office for directors 
must be for periods of either 2 or 3 years as the board determines. All 
regular terms must be for the same number of years and until the

may be conducted using audio or video teleconference methods. The chair, 
or in the chair's absence the ranking vice chair, may call a special 
meeting of the board at any time and must do so upon written request of 
a majority of the directors then holding office. Unless the board

members of this credit union. The number of members of the credit 
committee must be an odd number and may be changed to not fewer than 3

provided by these bylaws. A copy of the resolution of the board covering 
any increase or decrease in the number of committee members must be 
filed with the official copy of the bylaws of this credit union.
    Section 2. Terms of office. Regular terms of office for elected

member of the committee may be appointed as a loan officer. Each loan 
officer must furnish to the committee a record of each approved or not

application or request, and this record becomes a part of the records of 
the committee. All applications or requests not approved by a loan 
officer must be acted upon by the committee. No individual may disburse 
funds of this credit union for any application or share withdrawal which 
the individual has approved as a loan officer.

resolution, prescribe.
    Section 6. Credit committee duties. For each loan or line of credit, 
the credit committee or loan officer must inquire into the character and 
financial condition of the applicant and the applicant's sureties, if 
any, to ascertain their ability to repay fully and promptly the 
obligations incurred by them and to determine whether the loan or line 
of credit will be of probable benefit to the borrower. The credit 
committee and its appointed loan officers should endeavor diligently to 
assist applicants in solving their financial problems.
    Section 7. Unapproved loans prohibited. No loan or line of credit 
may be made unless approved by the committee or a loan officer in

    Section 8. Lending procedures. Subject to the limits imposed by 
applicable law and regulations, these bylaws, and the general policies 
of the board, the credit committee, or a loan officer, determines the 
security, if any, required for each application and the terms of 
repayment. The security furnished must be adequate in quality and 
character and consistent with sound lending practices. When funds are 
not available to make all the loans and lines of credit for which there 
are applications, preference should be given, in all cases, to the 
smaller applications if the need and credit factors are nearly equal.

        Article VIII. Option 2 Loan Officers (No Credit Committee)

    Section 1. Records of loan officer; prohibition on loan officer 
disbursing funds. Each loan officer must maintain a record of each 
approved or not approved transaction within 7 days of the filing of the

probable benefit to the borrower. The loan officers should endeavor 
diligently to assist applicants in solving their financial problems.

may be made unless approved by a loan officer in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.

loan officer determines the security if any required for each 
application and the terms of repayment. The security furnished must be 
adequate in quality and character and consistent with sound lending 
practices. When funds are not available to make all the loans and lines 
of credit for which there are applications, preference should be given, 
in all cases, to the applications for lesser amounts if the need and 
credit factors are nearly equal.

                    Article IX. Supervisory Committee

    Section 1. Appointment and membership. The supervisory committee is 
appointed by the board from among the members of this credit union, one 
of whom may be a director other than the financial officer or the 
compensated officer of the board. The board determines the number of 
members on the committee, which may not be fewer than 3 nor more than 5. 
No member of the credit committee, if applicable, or any employee of 
this credit union may be appointed to the committee. Regular terms of 
committee members are for periods of 1, 2, or 3 years as the board 
determines: Provided, however, that all regular terms are for the same

approximately an equal number of regular terms expires at each annual 
meeting.

committee members choose from among their number a chair and a 
secretary. The secretary of the supervisory committee prepares,

committee makes, or causes to be made, the audits, and prepares and 
submits the written reports required by the Act and regulations. The 
committee may employ and use clerical and auditing assistance required 
to carry out its responsibilities prescribed by this article, and may 
request the board to provide compensation for this assistance. It will 
prepare and forward to the Administration required reports.
    b. If all director positions become vacant simultaneously, the 
supervisory committee immediately assumes the role of the board of 
directors. The supervisory committee acting as the board must generally 
call and hold a special meeting to elect a board that will serve until 
the next annual meeting. The special meeting must occur at least 7 but 
no more than 14 days after all director positions became vacant, and 
candidates for the board at the special meeting may be nominated by 
petition or from the floor. However, if the next annual meeting has been 
scheduled and

[[Page 386]]

will occur within 45 days after all the director positions become 
vacant, the supervisory committee may decide to forego the special 
meeting and continue serving as the board until the election of new 
directors at the annual meeting.
    c. If the next annual meeting has not been scheduled, but the month 
and day of the previous year's meeting plus 7 days falls within 45 days 
after all the director positions become vacant, the supervisory 
committee acting as the board may decide to forego the special meeting 
to elect new directors. In this case, the supervisory committee must 
schedule the annual meeting within 7 days before or after the month and 
day of the previous annual meeting and continue to serve as the board 
until directors are elected at the annual meeting.
    d. The supervisory committee acting as the board may not act on 
policy matters. However, directors elected at a special meeting have the 
same powers as directors elected at the annual meeting.
    Section 4. Verification of accounts. The supervisory committee will 
cause the verification of the accounts of members with the records of 
the financial officer from time to time and not less frequently than as 
required by the Act and regulations. The committee must maintain a 
record of this verification.
    Section 5. Powers of supervisory committee--removal of directors and 
credit committee members. By unanimous vote, the supervisory committee 
may suspend until the next meeting of the members any director, board 
officer, or member of the credit committee. In the event of any 
suspension, the supervisory committee must call a special meeting of the 
members to act on the suspension, which meeting must be held not fewer 
than 7 nor more than 14 days after the suspension. The chair of the 
committee acts as chair of the meeting unless the members select another 
person to act as chair.
    Section 6. Powers of supervisory committee--special meetings. By the 
affirmative vote of a majority of its members, the supervisory committee 
may call a special meeting of the members to consider any violation of 
the provisions of the Act, the regulations, or of the charter or the 
bylaws of this credit union, or to consider any practice of this credit 
union which the committee deems to be unsafe or unauthorized.

                     Article X. Organization Meeting

    Section 1. Initial meeting. When application is made for a federal 
credit union charter, the subscribers to the organization certificate 
must meet for the purpose of electing a board of directors and a credit 
committee, if applicable. Failure to commence operations within 60 days 
following receipt of the approved organization certificate is cause for 
revocation of the charter unless a request for an extension of time has 
been submitted to and approved by the Regional Director.
    Section 2. Election of directors and credit committee. The 
subscribers elect a chair and a secretary for the meeting. The 
subscribers then elect from their number, or from those eligible to 
become members of this credit union, a board of directors and a credit 
committee, if applicable, all to hold office until the first annual 
meeting of the members and until the election and qualification of their 
respective successors. If not already a member, every person elected 
under this section or appointed under Section 3 of this article, must 
qualify within 30 days by becoming a member. If any person elected as a 
director or committee member or appointed as a supervisory committee 
member does not qualify as a member within 30 days of election or 
appointment, the office will automatically become vacant and be filled 
by the board.
    Section 3. Election of board officers. Promptly following the 
elections held under the provisions of Section 2 of this article, the 
board must meet and elect the board officers who will hold office until 
the first meeting of the board of directors following the first annual 
meeting of the members and until the election and qualification of their 
respective successors. The board also appoints a supervisory committee 
at this meeting as provided in Article IX, Section 1, of these bylaws 
and a credit committee, if applicable. The members so appointed hold 
office until the first regular meeting of the board following the first 
annual meeting of the members and until the appointment and 
qualification of their respective successors.

given the opportunity to be heard. A member also may be expelled under a 
nonparticipation policy adopted by the board of directors and provided 
to each member in accordance with the Act. Expulsion or withdrawal will 
not operate to relieve a member of any liability to this credit union. 
All amounts paid in on shares by expelled or withdrawing members, before 
their expulsion or withdrawal, will be paid to them in the order of 
their withdrawal or expulsion, but only as funds become available and 
only after deducting any amounts due to this credit union.

affirmative vote of a majority of the members present at a special 
meeting called for the purpose, but only after an opportunity has been

removal of all directors, the supervisory committee immediately becomes 
the temporary board of directors and must follow the procedures in 
Article IX, Section 3.
    Section 4. Conflicts of interest prohibited. No director, committee 
member, officer, agent, or employee of this credit union may participate 
in any manner, directly or indirectly, in the deliberation upon or the

<R05>
Sec. 702.1  Authority, purpose, scope and other supervisory authority.

    (a) Authority. Subparts A, B and C of this part and subpart L of 
part 747 of this chapter are issued by the National Credit Union 
Administration pursuant to section 216 of the Federal Credit Union Act 
(FCUA), 12 U.S.C. 1790d (section 1790d), as added by section 301 of the 
Credit Union Membership Access Act, Pub. L. No. 105-219, 112 Stat. 913 
(1998). Subpart D of this part is issued pursuant to FCUA section 120, 
12 U.S.C. 1766.
    (b) Purpose. The express purpose of prompt corrective action under 
section 1790d is to resolve the problems of federally-insured credit 
unions at the least possible long-term loss to the National Credit Union 
Share Insurance Fund. This part carries out the purpose of prompt 
corrective action by establishing a framework of mandatory and 
discretionary supervisory actions, applicable according to a credit 
union's net worth ratio, designed primarily to restore and improve the 
net worth of federally-insured credit unions.
    (c) Scope. This part implements the provisions of section 1790d as 
they apply to federally-insured credit unions, whether federally- or 
state-chartered; to such credit unions defined as ``new'' pursuant to 
section 1790d(b)(2); and to such credit unions defined as ``complex'' 
pursuant to section 1790d(d). Certain of these provisions also apply to 
officers and directors of federally-insured credit unions. This part 
does not apply to corporate credit unions. Procedures for issuing, 
reviewing and enforcing orders and directives issued under this part are 
set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter, 12 CFR 747.2001 et 
seq.
    (d) Other supervisory authority. Neither Sec. 1790d nor this part 
in any way limits the authority of the NCUA Board or appropriate State 
official under any other provision of law to take additional supervisory 
actions to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, or 
violations of applicable law or regulations. Action taken under this 
part may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition 
to any other enforcement action available to the NCUA Board or 
appropriate State official, including issuance of cease and desist 
orders, orders of prohibition, suspension and removal, or assessment of 
civil money penalties, or any other actions authorized by law.

defined by 12 U.S.C. 1783.
    (f) Net worth means the retained earnings balance of the credit 
union at quarter end as determined under generally accepted accounting 
principles. Retained earnings consists of undivided earnings, regular 
reserves, and any other appropriations designated by management or

appropriations of undivided earnings are included in net worth. For low 
income-designated credit unions, net worth also includes secondary 
capital accounts that are uninsured and subordinate to all other claims, 
including claims of creditors, shareholders and the NCUSIF. For any 
credit union, net worth does not include the allowance for loan and 
lease losses account.
    (g) Net worth ratio means the ratio of the net worth of the credit 
union (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section

[[Page 390]]

the three calendar months of the calendar quarter; or
    (iii) Average daily balance. The average daily balance over the 
calendar quarter; or
    (iv) Quarter-end balance. The quarter-end balance of the calendar 
quarter as reported on the credit union's Call Report.
    (2) For each quarter, a credit union must elect a measure of total 
assets from paragraph (k)(1) of this section to apply for all purposes 
under this part except Sec. Sec. 702.103 through 702.108 [risk-based 
net worth requirement].
    (l) Weighted-average life means the weighted-average time to the 
return of a dollar of principal, calculated by multiplying each portion 
of principal received by the time at which it is expected to be received 
(based on a reasonable and supportable estimate of that time), and then

                   Subpart A_Net Worth Classification


<R05>
Sec. 702.101  Measures and effective date of net worth classification.

    (a) Net worth measures. For purposes of this part, a credit union 
must determine its net worth category classification at the end of each 
calendar quarter using two measures:
    (1) The net worth ratio as defined in Sec. 702.2(g); and
    (2) If determined to be applicable under Sec. 702.103, a risk-based 
net worth requirement.
    (b) Effective date of net worth classification. For purposes of this 
part, the effective date of a federally-insured credit union's net worth 
category classification shall be the most recent to occur of:
    (1) Quarter-end effective date. The last day of the calendar month 
following the end of the calendar quarter; or
    (2) Corrected net worth category. The date the credit union received 
subsequent written notice from NCUA or, if State-chartered, from the 
appropriate State official, of a decline in net worth category due to 
correction of an error or misstatement in the credit union's most recent 
Call Report; or
    (3) Reclassification to lower category. The date the credit union 
received written notice from NCUA or, if State-chartered, the 
appropriate State official, of reclassification on safety and soundness 
grounds as provided under Sec. Sec. 702.102(b) or 702.302(d).
    (c) Notice to NCUA by filing Call Report. (1) Other than by filing a 
Call Report, a federally-insured credit union need not notify the NCUA 
Board of a change in its net worth ratio that places the credit union in 
a lower net worth category;
    (2) Failure to timely file a Call Report as required under this 
section in no way alters the effective date of a change in net worth 
classification under this paragraph (b) of this section, or the affected 
credit union's corresponding legal obligations under this part.

<R05>
Sec. 702.102  Statutory net worth categories.

    (a) Net worth categories. Except for credit unions defined as 
``new'' under subpart B of this part, a federally-insured credit union 
shall be classified (Table 1)--
    (1) Well capitalized if it has a net worth ratio of seven percent 
(7%) or greater and also meets any applicable risk-based net worth 
requirement under Sec. Sec. 702.103 through 702.108; or
    (2) Adequately capitalized if it has a net worth ratio of six 
percent (6%) or more but less than seven percent (7%), and also meets 
any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under Sec. Sec. 702.103 
through 702.108 below; or
    (3) Undercapitalized if it has a net worth ratio of four percent 
(4%) or more but less than six percent (6%), or fails to meet any 
applicable risk-based net worth requirement under Sec. Sec. 702.103 
through 702.108; or
    (4) Significantly undercapitalized if it
    (i) Has a net worth ratio of two percent (2%) or more but less than 
four percent (4%); or
    (ii) Has a net worth ratio of four percent (4%) or more but less 
than five percent (5%), and either--
    (A) Fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within 
the time prescribed in Sec. 702.206; or
    (B) Materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan 
approved by the NCUA Board; or
    (5) Critically undercapitalized if it has a net worth ratio of less 
than two percent (2%).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29NO02.065

    (b) Reclassification based on supervisory criteria other than net 
worth. The NCUA Board may reclassify a ``well capitalized'' credit union 
as ``adequately capitalized'' and may require an ``adequately 
capitalized'' or ``undercapitalized'' credit union to comply with 
certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if it were in 
the next lower net worth category (each of such actions hereinafter 
referred to generally as ``reclassification'') in the following 
circumstances:
    (1) Unsafe or unsound condition. The NCUA Board has determined, 
after notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to Sec. 747.2003 of 
this chapter, that the credit union is in an unsafe or unsound 
condition; or
    (2) Unsafe or unsound practice. The NCUA Board has determined, after 
notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to Sec. 747.2003 of this 
chapter, that the credit union has not corrected a material unsafe or 
unsound practice of which it was, or should have been, aware.

[[Page 392]]

    (c) Non-delegation. The NCUA Board may not delegate its authority to 
reclassify a credit union under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Consultation with State officials. The NCUA Board shall consult 
and seek to work cooperatively with the appropriate State official 
before reclassifying a federally-insured State-chartered credit union 
under paragraph (b) of this section, and shall promptly notify the 
appropriate State official of its decision to reclassify.

the credit union meets both of the following criteria as reflected its 
most recent Call Report:
    (a) Minimum asset size. Its quarter-end total assets exceed ten 
million dollars ($10,000,000); and
    (b) Minimum RBNW calculation. Its risk-based net worth requirement 
as calculated under Sec. 702.106 exceeds six percent (6%).

        Subpart B_Mandatory and Discretionary Supervisory Actions


<R05>
Sec. 702.201  Prompt corrective action for ``adequately capitalized'' credit unions.

    (a) Earnings retention. Beginning the effective date of 
classification as ``adequately capitalized'' or lower, a federally-
insured credit union must increase the dollar amount of its net worth 
quarterly either in the current quarter, or on average over the current 
and three preceding quarters, by an amount equivalent to at least 1/10th 
percent (0.1%) of its total assets, and must quarterly transfer that 
amount (or more by choice) from undivided earnings to its regular 
reserve account until it is ``well capitalized.''
    (b) Decrease in retention. Upon written application received no 
later than 14 days before the quarter end, the NCUA Board, on a case-by-
case basis, may permit a credit union to increase the dollar amount of 
its net worth and quarterly transfer an amount that is less than the 
amount required under paragraph (a) of this section, to the extent the 
NCUA Board determines that such lesser amount--
    (1) Is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares; and
    (2) Would further the purpose of this part.
    (c) Decrease by FISCU. The NCUA Board shall consult and seek to work 
cooperatively with the appropriate State official before permitting a 
federally-insured State-chartered credit union to decrease its earnings 
retention under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Periodic review. A decision under paragraph (b) of this section 
to permit a credit union to decrease its earnings retention is subject 
to quarterly review and revocation except when the credit union is 
operating under an approved net worth restoration plan that provides for 
decreasing its earnings retention as provided under paragraph (b).

[67 FR 71091, Nov. 29, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 702.202  Prompt corrective action for ``undercapitalized'' credit unions.

    (a) Mandatory supervisory actions by credit union. A federally-
insured credit union which is ``undercapitalized'' must--

[[Page 403]]

    (1) Earnings retention. Increase net worth and transfer earnings to 
its regular reserve account in accordance with Sec. 702.201;
    (2) Submit net worth restoration plan. Submit a net worth 
restoration plan pursuant to Sec. 702.206, provided however, that a 
credit union in this category having a net worth ratio of less than five 
percent (5%) which fails to timely submit such a plan, or which 
materially fails to implement an approved plan, is classified 
``significantly undercapitalized'' pursuant to Sec. 702.102(a)(4)(ii) 
above;
    (3) Restrict increase in assets. Beginning the effective date of 
classification as ``undercapitalized'' or lower, not permit the credit 
union's assets to increase beyond its total assets (per Sec. 702.2(j)) 
for the preceding quarter unless--
    (i) Plan approved. The NCUA Board has approved a net worth 
restoration plan which provides for an increase in total assets and--
    (A) The assets of the credit union are increasing consistent with 
the approved plan; and
    (B) The credit union is implementing steps to increase the net worth 
ratio consistent with the approved plan;
    (ii) Plan not approved. The NCUA Board has not approved a net worth 
restoration plan and total assets of the credit union are increasing 
because of increases since quarter-end in balances of:
    (A) Total accounts receivable and accrued income on loans and 
investments; or
    (B) Total cash and cash equivalents; or
    (C) Total loans outstanding, not to exceed the sum of total assets 
(per Sec. 702.2(j)) plus the quarter-end balance of unused commitments 
to lend and unused lines of credit provided however that a credit union 
which increases a balance as permitted under paragraphs (A), (B) or (C) 
cannot offer rates on shares in excess of prevailing rates on shares in 
its relevant market area, and cannot open new branches;
    (4) Restrict member business loans. Beginning the effective date of 
classification as ``undercapitalized'' or lower, not increase the total 
dollar amount of member business loans (defined as loans outstanding and 
unused commitments to lend) as of the preceding quarter-end unless it is 
granted an exception under 12 U.S.C. 1757a(b).
    (b) ``Second tier'' discretionary supervisory actions by NCUA. 
Subject to the applicable procedures for issuing, reviewing and 
enforcing directives set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter, 
the NCUA Board may, by directive, take one or more of the following 
actions with respect to an ``undercapitalized'' credit union having a 
net worth ratio of less than five percent (5%), or a director, officer 
or employee of such a credit union, if it determines that those actions 
are necessary to carry out the purpose of this part:
    (1) Requiring prior approval for acquisitions, branching, new lines 
of business. Prohibit a credit union from, directly or indirectly, 
acquiring any interest in any business entity or financial institution, 
establishing or acquiring any additional branch office, or engaging in 
any new line of business, unless the NCUA Board has approved the credit 
union's net worth restoration plan, the credit union is implementing its 
plan, and the NCUA Board determines that the proposed action is 
consistent with and will further the objectives of that plan;
    (2) Restricting transactions with and ownership of CUSO. Restrict 
the credit union's transactions with a CUSO, or require the credit union 
to reduce or divest its ownership interest in a CUSO;
    (3) Restricting dividends paid. Restrict the dividend rates the 
credit union pays on shares to the prevailing rates paid on comparable 
accounts and maturities in the relevant market area, as determined by 
the NCUA Board, except that dividend rates already declared on shares 
acquired before imposing a restriction under this paragraph may not be 
retroactively restricted;
    (4) Prohibiting or reducing asset growth. Prohibit any growth in the 
credit union's assets or in a category of assets, or require the credit 
union to reduce its assets or a category of assets;
    (5) Alter, reduce or terminate activity. Require the credit union or 
its CUSO

[[Page 404]]

to alter, reduce, or terminate any activity which poses excessive risk 
to the credit union;
    (6) Prohibiting nonmember deposits. Prohibit the credit union from 
accepting all or certain nonmember deposits;
    (7) Dismissing director or senior executive officer. Require the 
credit union to dismiss from office any director or senior executive 
officer, provided however, that a dismissal under this clause shall not 
be construed to be a formal administrative action for removal under 12 
U.S.C. 1786(g);
    (8) Employing qualified senior executive officer. Require the credit 
union to employ qualified senior executive officers (who, if the NCUA 
Board so specifies, shall be subject to its approval); and
    (9) Other action to carry out prompt corrective action. Restrict or 
require such other action by the credit union as the NCUA Board 
determines will carry out the purpose of this part better than any of 
the actions prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section.
    (c) ``First tier'' application of discretionary supervisory actions. 
An ``undercapitalized'' credit union having a net worth ratio of five 
percent (5%) or more, or which is classified ``undercapitalized'' by 
reason of failing to satisfy a risk-based net worth requirement under 
Sec. 702.105 or 702.106, is subject to the discretionary supervisory 
actions in paragraph (b) of this section if it fails to comply with any 
mandatory supervisory action in paragraph (a) of this section or fails 
to timely implement an approved net worth restoration plan under Sec. 
702.206, including meeting its prescribed steps to increase its net 
worth ratio.

[65 FR 8584, Feb. 18, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 71092, Nov. 29, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 702.203  Prompt corrective action for ``significantly undercapitalized'' credit unions.

    (a) Mandatory supervisory actions by credit union. A federally-
insured credit union which is ``significantly undercapitalized'' must--
    (1) Earnings retention. Increase net worth and transfer earnings to 
its regular reserve account in accordance with Sec. 702.201;
    (2) Submit net worth restoration plan. Submit a net worth 
restoration plan pursuant to Sec. 702.206;
    (3) Restrict increase in assets. Not permit the credit union's total 
assets to increase except as provided in Sec. 702.202(a)(3) and
    (4) Restrict member business loans. Not increase the total dollar 
amount of member business loans (defined as loans outstanding and unused 
commitments to lend) as provided in Sec. 702.202(a)(4).
    (b) Discretionary supervisory actions by NCUA. Subject to the 
applicable procedures for issuing, reviewing and enforcing directives 
set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter, the NCUA Board may, 
by directive, take one or more of the following actions with respect to 
any ``significantly undercapitalized'' credit union, or a director, 
officer or employee of such credit union, if it determines that those 
actions are necessary to carry out the purpose of this part:
    (1) Requiring prior approval for acquisitions, branching, new lines 
of business. Prohibit a credit union from, directly or indirectly, 
acquiring any interest in any business entity or financial institution, 
establishing or acquiring any additional branch office, or engaging in 
any new line of business, except as provided in Sec. 702.202(b)(1);
    (2) Restricting transactions with and ownership of CUSO. Restrict 
the credit union's transactions with a CUSO, or require the credit union 
to divest or reduce its ownership interest in a CUSO;
    (3) Restricting dividends paid. Restrict the dividend rates that the 
credit union pays on shares as provided in Sec. 702.202(b)(3);
    (4) Prohibiting or reducing asset growth. Prohibit any growth in the 
credit union's assets or in a category of assets, or require the credit 
union to reduce assets or a category of assets;
    (5) Alter, reduce or terminate activity. Require the credit union or 
its CUSO(s) to alter, reduce, or terminate any activity which poses 
excessive risk to the credit union;
    (6) Prohibiting nonmember deposits. Prohibit the credit union from 
accepting all or certain nonmember deposits;

[[Page 405]]

    (7) New election of directors. Order a new election of the credit 
union's board of directors;
    (8) Dismissing director or senior executive officer. Require the 
credit union to dismiss from office any director or senior executive 
officer, provided however, that a dismissal under this clause shall not 
be construed to be a formal administrative action for removal under 12 
U.S.C. 1786(g);
    (9) Employing qualified senior executive officer. Require the credit 
union to employ qualified senior executive officers (who, if the NCUA 
Board so specifies, shall be subject to its approval);
    (10) Restricting senior executive officers' compensation. Except 
with the prior written approval of the NCUA Board, limit compensation to 
any senior executive officer to that officer's average rate of 
compensation (excluding bonuses and profit sharing) during the four (4) 
calendar quarters preceding the effective date of classification of the 
credit union as ``significantly undercapitalized,'' and prohibit payment 
of a bonus or profit share to such officer;
    (11) Other actions to carry out prompt corrective action. Restrict 
or require such other action by the credit union as the NCUA Board 
determines will carry out the purpose of this part better than any of 
the actions prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (10) of this 
section; and
    (12) Requiring merger. Require the credit union to merge with 
another financial institution if one or more grounds exist for placing 
the credit union into conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
1786(h)(1)(F), or into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
1787(a)(3)(A)(i).
    (c) Discretionary conservatorship or liquidation if no prospect of 
becoming ``adequately capitalized.'' Notwithstanding any other actions 
required or permitted to be taken under this section, when a credit 
union becomes ``significantly undercapitalized'' (including by 
reclassification under section 702.102(b) above), the NCUA Board may 
place the credit union into conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
1786(h)(1)(F), or into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
1787(a)(3)(A)(i), provided that the credit union has no reasonable 
prospect of becoming ``adequately capitalized.''

    (iii) Other corrective action. Take other corrective action, in lieu 
of conservatorship or liquidation, to better

[[Page 407]]

achieve the purpose of this part, provided that the NCUA Board documents 
why such action in lieu of conservatorship or liquidation would do so, 
provided however, that other corrective action may consist, in whole or 
in part, of complying with the quarterly timetable of steps and meeting 
the quarterly net worth targets prescribed in an approved net worth 
restoration plan.
    (2) Renewal of other corrective action. A determination by the NCUA 
Board to take other corrective action in lieu of conservatorship or 
liquidation under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section shall expire 
after an effective period ending no later than 180 calendar days after 
the determination is made, and the credit union shall be immediately 
placed into conservatorship or liquidation under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) 
and (ii), unless the NCUA Board makes a new determination under 
paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section before the end of the effective 
period of the prior determination;
    (3) Mandatory liquidation after 18 months--(i) Generally. 
Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the NCUA 
Board must place a credit union into liquidation if it remains 
``critically undercapitalized'' for a full calendar quarter, on a 
monthly average basis, following a period of 18 months from the 
effective date the credit union was first classified ``critically 
undercapitalized.''
    (ii) Exception. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, 
the NCUA Board may continue to take other corrective action in lieu of 
liquidation if it certifies that the credit union--
    (A) Has been in substantial compliance with an approved net worth 
restoration plan requiring consistent improvement in net worth since the 
date the net worth restoration plan was approved;
    (B) Has positive net income or has an upward trend in earnings that 
the NCUA Board projects as sustainable; and
    (C) Is viable and not expected to fail.
    (iii) Review of exception. The NCUA Board shall, at least quarterly, 
review the certification of an exception to liquidation under paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section and shall either--
    (A) Recertify the credit union if it continues to satisfy the 
criteria of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section; or
    (B) Promptly place the credit union into liquidation, pursuant to 12 
U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(ii), if it fails to satisfy the criteria of 
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (4) Nondelegation. The NCUA Board may not delegate its authority 
under paragraph (c) of this section, unless the credit union has less 
than $5,000,000 in total assets. A credit union shall have a right of 
direct appeal to the NCUA Board of any decision made by delegated 
authority under this section within ten (10) calendar days of the date 
of that decision.
    (d) Mandatory liquidation of insolvent federal credit union. In lieu 
of paragraph (c) of this section, a ``critically undercapitalized'' 
federal credit union that has a net worth ratio of less than zero 
percent (0%) may be placed into liquidation on grounds of insolvency 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(1)(A).

Sec. 702.205  Consultation with State officials on proposed prompt corrective action.

    (a) Consultation on proposed conservatorship or liquidation. Before 
placing a federally-insured State-chartered credit union into 
conservatorship (pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(h)(1)(F) or (G)) or 
liquidation (pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)) as permitted or required 
under subparts B or C of this part to facilitate prompt corrective 
action--
    (1) The NCUA Board shall seek the views of the appropriate State 
official (as defined in Sec. 702.2(b), and give him or her an 
opportunity to take the proposed action;
    (2) The NCUA Board shall, upon timely request of the appropriate 
State official, promptly provide him or her with a written statement of 
the reasons for the proposed conservatorship or liquidation, and 
reasonable time to respond to that statement; and
    (3) If the appropriate State official makes a timely written 
response that disagrees with the proposed conservatorship or liquidation 
and gives reasons for that disagreement, the NCUA Board shall not place 
the credit

[[Page 408]]

union into conservatorship or liquidation unless it first considers the 
views of the appropriate State official and determines that--
    (i) The NCUSIF faces a significant risk of loss if the credit union 
is not placed into conservatorship or liquidation; and
    (ii) Conservatorship or liquidation is necessary either to reduce 
the risk of loss, or to reduce the expected loss, to the NCUSIF with 
respect to the credit union.
    (b) Nondelegation. The NCUA Board may not delegate any determination 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (c) Consultation on proposed discretionary action. The NCUA Board 
shall consult and seek to work cooperatively with the appropriate State 
official before taking any discretionary supervisory action under 
Sec. Sec. 702.202(b), 702.203(b), 702.204(b), 702.304(b) and 702.305(b) 
with respect to a federally-insured State-chartered credit union; shall 
provide prompt notice of its decision to the appropriate State official; 
and shall allow the appropriate State official to take the proposed 
action independently or jointly with NCUA.

<R05>
Sec. 702.206  Net worth restoration plans.

    (a) Schedule for filing--(1) Generally. A federally-insured credit 
union shall file a written net worth restoration plan (NWRP) with the 
appropriate Regional Director and, if State-chartered, the appropriate 
State official, within 45 calendar days of the effective date of 
classification as either ``undercapitalized,'' ``significantly 
undercapitalized'' or ``critically undercapitalized,'' unless the NCUA 
Board notifies the credit union in writing that its NWRP is to be filed 
within a different period.
    (2) Exception. An otherwise ``adequately capitalized'' credit union 
that is reclassified ``undercapitalized'' on safety and soundness 
grounds under Sec. 702.102(b) is not required to submit a NWRP solely 
due to the reclassification, unless the NCUA Board notifies the credit 
union that it must submit an NWRP.
    (3) Filing of additional plan. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, a credit union that has already submitted and is operating 
under a NWRP approved under this section is not required to submit an 
additional NWRP due to a change in net worth category (including by 
reclassification under Sec. 702.102(b)), unless the NCUA Board notifies 
the credit union that it must submit a new NWRP. A credit union that is 
notified to submit a new or revised NWRP shall file the NWRP in writing 
with the appropriate Regional Director within 30 calendar days of 
receiving such notice, unless the NCUA Board notifies the credit union 
in writing that the NWRP is to be filed within a different period.
    (4) Failure to timely file plan. When a credit union fails to timely 
file an NWRP pursuant to this paragraph, the NCUA Board shall promptly 
notify the credit union that it has failed to file an NWRP and that it 
has 15 calendar days from receipt of that notice within which to file an 
NWRP.
    (b) Assistance to small credit unions. Upon timely request by a 
credit union having total assets of less than $10 million (regardless 
how long it has been in operation), the NCUA Board shall provide 
assistance in preparing an NWRP required to be filed under paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (c) Contents of NWRP. An NWRP must--
    (1) Specify--
    (i) A quarterly timetable of steps the credit union will take to 
increase its net worth ratio so that it becomes ``adequately 
capitalized'' by the end of the term of the NWRP, and to remain so for 
four (4) consecutive calendar quarters. If ``complex,'' the credit union 
is subject to a risk-based net worth requirement that may require a net 
worth ratio higher than six percent (6%) to become ``adequately 
capitalized'';
    (ii) The projected amount of earnings to be transferred to the 
regular reserve account in each quarter of the term of the NWRP as 
required under Sec. 702.201(a), or as permitted under Sec. 702.201(b);
    (iii) How the credit union will comply with the mandatory and any 
discretionary supervisory actions imposed on it by the NCUA Board under 
this subpart;

[[Page 409]]

    (iv) The types and levels of activities in which the credit union 
will engage; and
    (v) If reclassified to a lower category under Sec. 702.102(b), the 
steps the credit union will take to correct the unsafe or unsound 
practice(s) or condition(s);
    (2) Include pro forma financial statements, including any off-
balance sheet items, covering a minimum of the next two years; and
    (3) Contain such other information as the NCUA Board has required.
    (d) Criteria for approval of NWRP. The NCUA Board shall not accept a 
NWRP plan unless it--
    (1) Complies with paragraph (c) of this section;
    (2) Is based on realistic assumptions, and is likely to succeed in 
restoring the credit union's net worth; and (3) Would not unreasonably 
increase the credit union's exposure to risk (including credit risk, 
interest-rate risk, and other types of risk).
    (e) Consideration of regulatory capital. To minimize possible long-
term losses to the NCUSIF while the credit union takes steps to become 
``adequately capitalized,'' the NCUA Board shall, in evaluating an NWRP 
under this section, consider the type and amount of any form of 
regulatory capital which may become established by NCUA regulation, or 
authorized by State law and recognized by NCUA, which the credit union 
holds, but which is not included in its net worth.
    (f) Review of NWRP--(1) Notice of decision. Within 45 calendar days 
after receiving an NWRP under this part, the NCUA Board shall notify the 
credit union in writing whether the NWRP has been approved, and shall 
provide reasons for its decision in the event of disapproval.
    (2) Delayed decision. If no decision is made within the time 
prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the NWRP is deemed 
approved.
    (3) Consultation with State officials. In the case of an NWRP 
submitted by a federally-insured State-chartered credit union (whether 
an original, new, additional, revised or amended NWRP), the NCUA Board 
shall, when evaluating the NWRP, seek and consider the views of the 
appropriate State official, and provide prompt notice of its decision to 
the appropriate State official.
    (g) NWRP not approved (1) Submission of revised NWRP. If an NWRP is 
rejected by the NCUA Board, the credit union shall submit a revised NWRP 
within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of disapproval, unless it is 
notified in writing by the NCUA Board that the revised NWRP is to be 
filed within a different period.
    (2) Notice of decision on revised NWRP. Within 30 calendar days 
after receiving a revised NWRP under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, 
the NCUA Board shall notify the credit union in writing whether the 
revised NWRP is approved. The Board may extend the time within which 
notice of its decision shall be provided.
    (3) Disapproval of reclassified credit union's NWRP. A credit union 
which has been classified ``significantly undercapitalized'' under Sec. 
702.102(a)(4)(ii) shall remain so classified pending NCUA Board approval 
of a new or revised NWRP.
    (h) Amendment of NWRP. A credit union that is operating under an 
approved NWRP may, after prior written notice to, and approval by the 
NCUA Board, amend its NWRP to reflect a change in circumstance. Pending 
approval of an amended NWRP, the credit union shall implement the NWRP 
as originally approved.
    (i) Publication. An NWRP need not be published to be enforceable 
because publication would be contrary to the public interest.

<R04>
  Subpart C_Alternative Prompt Corrective Action for New Credit Unions


<R05>
Sec. 702.301  Scope and definition.

    (a) Scope. This subpart C applies in lieu of subpart B of this part 
exclusively to credit unions defined in paragraph (b) of this section as 
``new'' pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1790d(b)(2).
    (b) New credit union defined. A ``new'' credit union for purposes of 
this subpart is a federally-insured credit union that both has been in 
operation for less than ten (10) years and has total assets

[[Page 410]]

of not more than $10 million. A credit union which exceeds $10 million 
in total assets may become ``new'' if its total assets subsequently 
decline below $10 million while it is still in operation for less than 
10 years.
    (c) Effect of spin-offs. A credit union formed as the result of a 
``spin-off'' of a group from the field of membership of an existing 
credit union is deemed to be in operation since the effective date of 
the ``spin-off.'' A credit union whose total assets decline below $10 
million because a group within its field of membership has been ``spun-
off'' is deemed ``new'' if it has been in operation less than 10 years.
    (d) Actions to evade prompt corrective action. If the NCUA Board 
determines that a credit union was formed, or was reduced in asset size 
as a result of a ``spin-off,'' or was merged, primarily to qualify as 
``new'' under this subpart, the credit union shall be deemed subject to 
prompt corrective action under subpart A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 702.302  Net worth categories for new credit unions.

    (a) Net worth measures. For purposes of this part, a new credit 
union must determine its net worth category classification quarterly 
according to its net worth ratio as defined in Sec. 702.2(g).
    (b) Effective date of net worth classification of new credit union. 
For purposes of subpart C, the effective date of a new federally-insured 
credit union's classification within a net worth category in paragraph 
(c) of this section shall be determined as provided in Sec. 702.101(b); 
and written notice to the NCUA Board of a decline in net worth category 
in paragraph (c) of this section shall be given as required by section 
702.101(c).
    (c) Net worth categories. A federally-insured credit union defined 
as ``new'' under this section shall be classified (Table 6)--
    (1) Well capitalized if it has a net worth ratio of seven percent 
(7%) or greater;
    (2) Adequately capitalized if it has a net worth ratio of six 
percent (6%) or more but less than seven percent (7%);
    (3) Moderately capitalized if it has a net worth ratio of three and 
one-half percent (3.5%) or more but less than six percent (6%);
    (4) Marginally capitalized if it has a net worth ratio of two 
percent (2%) or more but less than three and one-half percent (3.5%);
    (5) Minimally capitalized if it has a net worth ratio of zero 
percent (0%) or greater but less than two percent (2%); and
    (6) Uncapitalized if it has a net worth ratio of less than zero 
percent (0%) (e.g., a deficit in retained earnings).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29NO02.071

    (d) Reclassification based on supervisory criteria other than net 
worth. Subject to Sec. 702.102(b) and (c), the NCUA Board may 
reclassify a ``well capitalized,'' ``adequately capitalized'' or 
``moderately capitalized'' new credit union to the next lower net worth 
category (each of such actions is hereinafter referred to generally as 
``reclassification'') in either of the circumstances prescribed in Sec. 
702.102(b).
    (e) Consultation with State officials. The NCUA Board shall consult 
and seek to work cooperatively with the

[[Page 411]]

appropriate State official before reclassifying a federally-insured 
State-chartered credit union under paragraph (d) of this section, and 
shall promptly notify the appropriate State official of its decision to 
reclassify.

[65 FR 8584, Feb. 18, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 44974, July 20, 2000; 65 
FR 55439, Sept. 14, 2000; 67 FR 71092, Nov. 29, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 702.303  Prompt corrective action for ``adequately capitalized'' new credit unions.

    Beginning on the effective date of classification, an ``adequately 
capitalized'' new credit union must increase the dollar amount of its 
net worth by the amount reflected in its approved initial or revised 
business plan in accordance with Sec. 702.304(a)(2), or in the absence 
of such a plan, in accordance with Sec. 702.201, and quarterly transfer 
that amount from undivided earnings to its regular reserve account, 
until it is ``well capitalized.''

[67 FR 71092, Nov. 29, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 702.304  Prompt corrective action for ``moderately capitalized,'' ``marginally capitalized'' or ``minimally capitalized'' new credit unions.

    (a) Mandatory supervisory actions by new credit union. Beginning on 
the date of classification as ``moderately capitalized,'' ``marginally 
capitalized'' or minimally capitalized'' (including by reclassification 
under Sec. 702.302(d)), a new credit union must--
    (1) Earnings retention. Increase the dollar amount of its net worth 
by the amount reflected in its approved initial or revised business plan 
and quarterly transfer that amount from undivided earnings to its 
regular reserve account;
    (2) Submit revised business plan. Submit a revised business plan 
within the time provided by Sec. 702.306 if the credit union either:
    (i) Has not increased its net worth ratio consistent with its then-
present approved business plan;
    (ii) Has no then-present approved business plan; or
    (iii) Has failed to comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; 
and
    (3) Restrict member business loans. Not increase the total dollar 
amount of member business loans (defined as loans outstanding and unused 
commitments to lend) as of the preceding quarter-end unless it is 
granted an exception under 12 U.S.C. 1757a(b).
    (b) Discretionary supervisory actions by NCUA. Subject to the 
applicable procedures set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter 
for issuing, reviewing and enforcing directives, the NCUA Board may, by 
directive, take one or more of the actions prescribed in Sec. 
702.204(b) if the credit union's net worth ratio has not increased 
consistent with its then-present business plan, or the credit union has 
failed to undertake any mandatory supervisory action prescribed in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Discretionary conservatorship or liquidation. Notwithstanding 
any other actions required or permitted to be taken under this section, 
the NCUA Board may place a new credit union which is ``moderately 
capitalized,'' ``marginally capitalized'' or ``minimally capitalized'' 
(including by reclassification under Sec. 702.302(d)) into 
conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(h)(1)(F), or into liquidation 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(i), provided that the credit union 
has no reasonable prospect of becoming ``adequately capitalized.''

[65 FR 8584, Feb. 18, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 71093, Nov. 29, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 702.305  Prompt corrective action for ``uncapitalized'' new credit unions.

    (a) Mandatory supervisory actions by new credit union. Beginning on 
the effective date of classification as ``uncapitalized,'' a new credit 
union must--
    (1) Earnings retention. Increase the dollar amount of its net worth 
by the amount reflected in the credit union's approved initial or 
revised business plan;
    (2) Submit revised business plan. Submit a revised business plan 
within the time provided by Sec. 702.306, providing for alternative 
means of funding the credit union's earnings deficit, if the credit 
union either:
    (i) Has not increased its net worth ratio consistent with its then-
present approved business plan;
    (ii) Has no then-present approved business plan; or

[[Page 412]]

    (iii) Has failed to comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; 
and
    (3) Restrict member business loans. Not increase the total dollar 
amount of member business loans as provided in Sec. 702.304(a)(3).
    (b) Discretionary supervisory actions by NCUA. Subject to the 
procedures set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter for 
issuing, reviewing and enforcing directives, the NCUA Board may, by 
directive, take one or more of the actions prescribed in Sec. 
702.204(b) if the credit union's net worth ratio has not increased 
consistent with its then-present business plan, or the credit union has 
failed to undertake any mandatory supervisory action prescribed in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Mandatory liquidation or conservatorship. Notwithstanding any 
other actions required or permitted to be taken under this section, the 
NCUA Board--
    (1) Plan not submitted. May place into liquidation pursuant to 12 
U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(ii), or conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
1786(h)(1)(F), an ``uncapitalized'' new credit union which fails to 
submit a revised business plan within the time provided under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section; or
    (2) Plan rejected, approved, implemented. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, must place into liquidation pursuant 
to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(ii), or conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
1786(h)(1)(F), an ``uncapitalized'' new credit union that remains 
``uncapitalized'' one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the later 
of:
    (i) The effective date of classification as ``uncapitalized''; or
    (ii) The last day of the calendar month following expiration of the 
time period provided in the credit union's initial business plan 
(approved at the time its charter was granted) to remain 
``uncapitalized,'' regardless whether a revised business plan was 
rejected, approved or implemented.
    (3) Exception. The NCUA Board may decline to place a new credit 
union into liquidation or conservatorship as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section if the credit union documents to the NCUA Board 
why it is viable and has a reasonable prospect of becoming ``adequately 
capitalized.''
    (d) Mandatory liquidation of ``uncapitalized'' federal credit union. 
In lieu of paragraph (c) of this section, an ``uncapitalized'' federal 
credit union may be placed into liquidation on grounds of insolvency 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(1)(A).

<R05>
Sec. 702.306  Revised business plans for new credit unions.

    (a) Schedule for filing--(1) Generally. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a new credit union classified 
``moderately capitalized'' or lower must file a written revised business 
plan (RBP) with the appropriate Regional Director and, if State-
chartered, with the appropriate State official, within 30 calendar days 
of either:
    (i) The last of the calendar month following the end of the calendar 
quarter that the credit union's net worth ratio has not increased 
consistent with its the-present approved business plan;
    (ii) The effective date of classification as less than ``adequately 
capitalized'' if the credit union has no then-present approved business 
plan; or
    (iii) The effective date of classification as less than ``adequately 
capitalized'' if the credit union has increased the total amount of 
member business loans in violation of Sec. 702.304(a)(3).
    (2) Exception. The NCUA Board may notify the credit union in writing 
that its RBP is to be filed within a different period or that it is not 
necessary to file an RBP.
    (3) Failure to timely file plan. When a new credit union fails to 
file an RBP as provided under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this 
section, the NCUA Board shall promptly notify the credit union that it 
has failed to file an RBP and that it has 15 calendar days from receipt 
of that notice within which to do so.
    (b) Contents of revised business plan. A new credit union's RBP 
must, at a minimum--
    (1) Address changes, since the new credit union's current business 
plan was approved, in any of the business plan elements required for 
charter approval under Chapter 1, section IV.D. of

[[Page 413]]

NCUA's Chartering and Field of Membership Manual (IRPS 99-1), 63 FR 
71998, 72019 (Dec. 30, 1998), or its successor(s), or for State-
chartered credit unions under applicable State law;
    (2) Establish a timetable of quarterly targets for net worth during 
each year in which the RBP is in effect so that the credit union becomes 
``adequately capitalized'' by the time it no longer qualifies as ``new'' 
per Sec. 702.301(b);
    (3) Specify the projected amount of earnings to be transferred 
quarterly to its regular reserve as provided under Sec. 702.304(a)(1) 
or 702.305(a)(1);
    (4) Explain how the new credit union will comply with the mandatory 
and discretionary supervisory actions imposed on it by the NCUA Board 
under this subpart;
    (5) Specify the types and levels of activities in which the new 
credit union will engage;
    (6) In the case of a new credit union reclassified to a lower 
category under Sec. 702.302(d), specify the steps the credit union will 
take to correct the unsafe or unsound condition or practice; and
    (7) Include such other information as the NCUA Board may require.
    (c) Criteria for approval. The NCUA Board shall not approve a new 
credit union's RBP unless it--
    (1) Addresses the items enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) Is based on realistic assumptions, and is likely to succeed in 
building the credit union's net worth; and
    (3) Would not unreasonably increase the credit union's exposure to 
risk (including credit risk, interest-rate risk, and other types of 
risk).
    (d) Consideration of regulatory capital. To minimize possible long-
term losses to the NCUSIF while the credit union takes steps to become 
``adequately capitalized,'' the NCUA Board shall, in evaluating an RBP 
under this section, consider the type and amount of any form of 
regulatory capital which may become established by NCUA regulation, or 
authorized by State law and recognized by NCUA, which the credit union 
holds, but which is not included in its net worth.
    (e) Review of revised business plan--(1) Notice of decision. Within 
30 calendar days after receiving an RBP under this section, the NCUA 
Board shall notify the credit union in writing whether its RBP is 
approved, and shall provide reasons for its decision in the event of 
disapproval. The NCUA Board may extend the time within which notice of 
its decision shall be provided.
    (2) Delayed decision. If no decision is made within the time 
prescribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the RBP is deemed 
approved.
    (3) Consultation with State officials. When evaluating an RBP 
submitted by a federally-insured State-chartered new credit union 
(whether an original, new or additional RBP), the NCUA Board shall seek 
and consider the views of the appropriate State official, and provide 
prompt notice of its decision to the appropriate State official.
    (f) Plan not approved--(1) Submission of new revised plan. If an RBP 
is rejected by the NCUA Board, the new credit union shall submit a new 
RBP within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of disapproval of its 
initial RBP, unless it is notified in writing by the NCUA Board that the 
new RBP is to be filed within a different period.
    (2) Notice of decision on revised plan. Within 30 calendar days 
after receiving an RBP under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the NCUA 
Board shall notify the credit union in writing whether the new RBP is 
approved. The Board may extend the time within which notice of its 
decision shall be provided.
    (g) Amendment of plan. A credit union that has filed an approved RBP 
may, after prior written notice to and approval by the NCUA Board, amend 
it to reflect a change in circumstance. Pending approval of an amended 
RBP, the new credit union shall implement its existing RBP as originally 
approved.
    (h) Publication. An RBP need not be published to be enforceable 
because publication would be contrary to the public interest.

Sec. 702.307  Incentives for new credit unions.

    (a) Assistance in revising business plans. Upon timely request by a 
credit union having total assets of less than $10 million (regardless 
how long it has been in operation), the NCUA Board shall provide 
assistance in preparing a

[[Page 414]]

revised business plan required to be filed under Sec. 702.306.
    (b) Assistance. Management training and other assistance to new 
credit unions will be provided in accordance with policies approved by

                           Subpart D_Reserves


<R05>
Sec. 702.401  Reserves.

    (a) Special reserve. Each federally-insured credit union shall 
establish and maintain such reserves as may be required by the FCUA, by 
state law, by regulation, or in special cases by the NCUA Board or 
appropriate State official.
    (b) Regular reserve. Each federally-insured credit union shall 
establish and maintain a regular reserve account for the purpose of 
absorbing losses that exceed undivided earnings and other appropriations 
of undivided earnings, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. 
Earnings required to be transferred annually to a credit union's regular 
reserve under subparts B or C of this part shall be held in this 
account.
    (c) Charges to regular reserve after depleting undivided earnings. 
The board of directors of a federally-insured credit union may authorize 
losses to be charged to the regular reserve after first depleting the 
balance of the undivided earnings account and other reserves, provided 
that the authorization states the amount and provides an explanation of 
the need for the charge, and either--
    (1) The charge will not cause the credit union's net worth 
classification to fall below ``adequately capitalized'' under subparts B 
or C of this part; or
    (2) If the charge will cause the net worth classification to fall 
below ``adequately capitalized,'' the appropriate Regional Director and, 
if State-chartered, the appropriate State official, have given written 
approval (in an NWRP or otherwise) for the charge.
    (d) Transfers to regular reserve. The transfer of earnings to a 
federally-insured credit union's regular reserve account when required 
under subparts B or C of this part must occur after charges for loan or 
other losses are addressed as provided in paragraph (c) of this section 
and Sec. 702.402(d), but before payment of any dividends to members.

<R05>
Sec. 702.402  Full and fair disclosure of financial condition.

    (a) Full and fair disclosure defined. ``Full and fair disclosure'' 
is the level of disclosure which a prudent person would provide to a 
member of a federally-insured credit union, to NCUA, or, at the 
discretion of the board of directors, to creditors to fairly inform them 
of the financial condition and the results of operations of the credit 
union.
    (b) Full and fair disclosure implemented. The financial statements 
of a federally-insured credit union shall provide for full and fair 
disclosure of all assets, liabilities, and members' equity, including 
such valuation (allowance) accounts as may be necessary to present 
fairly the financial condition; and all income and expenses necessary to 
present fairly the statement of income for the reporting period.
    (c) Declaration of officials. The Statement of Financial Condition, 
when presented to members, to creditors or to the NCUA, shall contain a 
dual declaration by the treasurer and the chief executive officer, or in 
the latter's absence, by any other officer designated by the board of 
directors of the reporting credit union to make such declaration, that 
the report and related financial statements are true and correct to the 
best of their knowledge and belief and present fairly the financial 
condition and the statement of income for the period covered.
    (d) Charges for loan losses. Full and fair disclosure demands that a 
credit union properly address charges for loan losses as follows:
    (1) Charges for loan losses shall be made in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP);
    (2) The allowance for loan and lease losses (ALL) established for 
loans must fairly present the probable losses for all categories of 
loans and the proper valuation of loans. The valuation allowance must 
encompass specifically

[[Page 415]]

identified loans, as well as estimated losses inherent in the loan 
portfolio, such as loans and pools of loans for which losses have been 
incurred but are not identifiable on a specific loan-by-loan basis;
    (3) Adjustments to the valuation ALL will be recorded in the expense 
account ``Provision for Loan and Lease Losses'';
    (4) The maintenance of an ALL shall not affect the requirement to 
transfer earnings to a credit union's regular reserve when required 
under subparts B or C of this part; and
    (5) At a minimum, adjustments to the ALL shall be made prior to the 
distribution or posting of any dividend to the accounts of members.


<R05>
Sec. 702.403  Payment of dividends.

    (a) Restriction on dividends. Dividends shall be available only from 
undivided earnings, if any.
    (b) Payment of dividends if undivided earnings depleted. The board 
of directors of a ``well capitalized'' federally-insured credit union 
that has depleted the balance of its undivided earnings account may 
authorize a transfer of funds from the credit union's regular reserve 
account to undivided earnings to pay dividends, provided that either--
    (1) The payment of dividends will not cause the credit union's net 
worth classification to fall below ``adequately capitalized'' under 
subpart B or C of this part; or
    (2) If the payment of dividends will cause the net worth 
classification to fall below ``adequately capitalized,'' the appropriate 
Regional Director and, if State-chartered, the appropriate State 
official, have given prior written approval (in an NWRP or otherwise) to 
pay a dividend.

which can result from dealing with a single or related issuers, lack of 
geographic distribution, holding obligations with similar 
characteristics like maturities and indexes, holding bonds having the 
same trustee, and holding securitized loans having the same originator, 
packager, or guarantor;
    (g) Who has investment authority and the extent of that authority. 
Those with authority must be qualified by education or experience to

    (b) A Federal credit union must maintain documentation for each 
investment transaction for as long as it holds the investment and until

a broker-dealer as long as the broker-dealer is registered as a broker-

Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) or is a depository 
institution whose broker-dealer activities are regulated by a Federal or 
State regulatory agency.

    (3) If the broker-dealer is acting as the Federal credit union's 
counterparty, the ability of the broker-dealer and its subsidiaries or 
affiliates to fulfill commitments, as evidenced by capital strength, 
liquidity, and operating results. The Federal credit union should 
consider current financial data, annual reports, reports of nationally-
recognized statistical rating organizations, relevant disclosure 
documents, and other sources of financial information.
    (c) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply 
when the

[[Page 421]]

certificate directly from a bank, credit union, or other depository 
institution.

agreement that requires the safekeeper to exercise, at least, ordinary 
care.
    (b) Any safekeeper used by a Federal credit union must be regulated 
and supervised by either the Securities and Exchange Commission, a 
Federal or State depository institution regulatory agency, or a State 
trust company regulatory agency.
    (c) A Federal credit union must obtain and reconcile monthly a 
statement of purchased investments and repurchase collateral held in 
safekeeping.
    (d) Annually, the Federal credit union must analyze the ability of 
the safekeeper to fulfill its custodial responsibilities, as evidenced

credit union should consider current financial data, annual reports, 
reports of nationally-recognized statistical rating organizations, 
relevant disclosure documents, and other sources of financial 
information.

member of the committee must receive a copy of the report, and each 
member of the board must receive a summary of the information in the 
report.


<R05>
Sec. 703.11  Valuing securities.

    (a) Before purchasing or selling a security, a Federal credit union 
must obtain either price quotations on the security from at least two 
broker-dealers or a price quotation on the security from an industry-
recognized information provider. This requirement to obtain price 
quotations does not apply to new issues purchased at par or at original 
issue discount.
    (b) At least monthly, a Federal credit union must determine the fair 
value of each security it holds. It may determine fair value by

    (c) At least annually, the Federal credit union's supervisory 
committee or its external auditor must independently assess the

    (i) Has a long-term, senior, unsecured debt rating from a 
nationally-recognized statistical rating organization of AA- (or 
equivalent) or better at the time of the transaction, and the contract 
between the counterparty and the Federal credit union specifies that if 
the long-term, senior, unsecured debt rating declines below AA- (or 
equivalent) then the counterparty agrees to post collateral with an 
independent party in an amount fully securing the value of the option; 
or
    (ii) Posts collateral with an independent party in an amount fully 
securing the value of the option if the counterparty does not have a 
long-term, senior unsecured debt rating from a nationally-recognized 
statistical rating organization.

equivalent and outstanding debt with a short-term rating, if any, no 
lower than A-1 or its equivalent;

Sec. 703.16  Prohibited investments.

    (a) Derivatives. A Federal credit union may not purchase or sell 
financial derivatives, such as futures, options, interest rate swaps, or

SMBS except as described in paragraphs (1) and (3) below.
    (1) A Federal credit union may invest in and hold exchangeable 
collateralized mortgage obligations (exchangeable CMOs) representing 
beneficial ownership interests in one or more interest-only classes of a 
CMO (IO CMOs) or principal-only classes of a CMO (PO CMOs), but only if:
    (i) At the time of purchase, the ratio of the market price to the 
remaining principal balance is between .8 and 1.2, meaning that the 
discount or premium of the market price to par must be less than 20 
points;
    (ii) The offering circular or other official information available 
at the time of purchase indicates that the notional principal on each 
underlying IO CMO should decline at the same rate as the principal on 
one or more of the underlying non-IO CMOs, and that the principal on 
each underlying PO CMO should decline at the same rate as the principal, 
or notional principal, on one or more of the underlying non-PO CMOs; and
    (iii) The credit union staff has the expertise dealing with 
exchangeable CMOs to apply the conditions in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) A Federal credit union that invests in an exchangeable CMO may 
exercise the exchange option only if all of the underlying CMOs are 
permissible investments for that credit union.
    (3) A Federal credit union may accept an exchangeable CMO 
representing beneficial ownership interests in one or more IO CMOs or PO 
CMOs as an asset associated with an investment repurchase transaction or 
as collateral in a securities lending transaction. When the exchangeable 
CMO is associated with one of these two transactions, it need not 
conform to the conditions in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.

that the proposed investment will reduce its interest rate risk;
    (iii) After purchase, the Federal credit union evaluates the 
investment at least quarterly to determine whether or not it actually 
has reduced the interest rate risk; and
    (iv) The Federal credit union accounts for the investment consistent

    (b) All grandfathered investments are subject to the valuation and 
monitoring requirements of Sec. Sec. 703.10, 703.11, and 703.12 of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 703.19  Investment pilot program.

number of Federal credit unions to engage in investment activities 
prohibited by this part but permitted by the Act.

Sec. 704.1  Scope.

    (a) This part establishes special rules for all federally insured 
corporate credit unions. Non federally insured corporate credit unions 
must agree, by written contract, to both adhere to the requirements of 
this part and submit to examinations, as determined by NCUA, as a 
condition of receiving shares or deposits from federally insured credit 
unions. This part grants certain additional authorities to federal 
corporate credit unions. Except to the extent that they are inconsistent 
with this part, other provisions of NCUA's Rules and Regulations (12 CFR 
chapter VII) and the Federal Credit Union Act apply to federally 
chartered corporate credit unions and federally insured state-chartered 
corporate credit unions to the same extent that they apply to other 
federally chartered and federally insured state-chartered credit unions, 
respectively.
    (b) The Board has the authority to issue orders which vary from this 
part. This authority is provided under Section 120(a) of the Federal 
Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1766(a). Requests by state-chartered 
corporate credit unions for waivers to this part and for expansions of 
authority under Appendix B of this part must be approved by the state 
regulator before being submitted to NCUA.


<R05>
Sec. 704.2  Definitions.

    Adjusted trading means any method or transaction whereby a corporate 
credit union sells a security to a vendor at a price above its current 
market price and simultaneously purchases or commits to purchase from 
the vendor another security at a price above its current market price.
    Asset-backed security (ABS) means a security that is primarily 
serviced by the cashflows of a discrete pool of receivables or other 
financial assets, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert 
into cash within a finite time period plus any rights or other assets 
designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to 
the securityholders. This definition excludes mortgage related 
securities.
    Capital means the sum of a corporate credit union's retained 
earnings, paid-in capital, and membership capital.
    Capital ratio means the corporate credit union's capital divided by 
its moving daily average net assets.
    Collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) means a multi-class 
mortgage related security.
    Core capital means the corporate credit union's retained earnings 
and paid-in capital.
    Core capital ratio means the corporate credit union's core capital 
divided by its moving daily average net assets.
    Corporate credit union means an organization that:
    (1) Is chartered under Federal or state law as a credit union;
    (2) Receives shares from and provides loan services to credit 
unions;
    (3) Is operated primarily for the purpose of serving other credit 
unions;
    (4) Is designated by NCUA as a corporate credit union;
    (5) Limits natural person members to the minimum required by state 
or federal law to charter and operate the credit union; and
    (6) Does not condition the eligibility of any credit union to become 
a member on that credit union's membership in any other organization.
    Daily average net assets means the average of net assets calculated 
for each day during the period.
    Derivatives means any derivative instrument as defined under 
generally

[[Page 428]]

accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
    Dollar roll means the purchase or sale of a mortgage backed security 
to a counterparty with an agreement to resell or repurchase a 
substantially identical security at a future date and at a specified 
price.
    Embedded option means a characteristic of certain assets and 
liabilities which gives the issuer of the instrument the ability to 
change the features such as final maturity, rate, principal amount and 
average life. Options include, but are not limited to, calls, caps, and 
prepayment options.
    Exchangeable collateralized mortgage obligation means a class of a 
collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) that, at the time of purchase, 
represents beneficial ownership interests in a combination of two or 
more underlying classes of the same CMO structure. The holder of an 
exchangeable CMO may pay a fee and take delivery of the underlying 
classes of the CMO.
    Fair value means the amount at which an instrument could be 
exchanged in a current, arms-length transaction between willing parties, 
as opposed to a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in 
active markets are the best evidence of fair value. If a quoted market 
price in an active market is not available, fair value may be estimated 
using a valuation technique that is reasonable and supportable, a quoted 
market price in an active market for a similar instrument, or a current 
appraised value. Examples of valuation techniques include the present 
value of estimated future cash flows, option-pricing models, and option-
adjusted spread models. Valuation techniques should incorporate 
assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of 
values, future revenues, and future expenses, including assumptions 
about interest rates, default, prepayment, and volatility.
    Federal funds transaction means a short-term or open-ended unsecured 
transfer of immediately available funds by one depository institution to 
another depository institution or entity.

transaction in which a corporate credit union purchases a security from 
one of its member credit unions under agreement by that member credit 
union to repurchase the same security at a specified time in the future. 
The corporate credit union then sells that same security, on the same 
day, to a third party, under agreement to repurchase it on the same date 
on which the corporate credit union is obligated to return the security 
to its member credit union.
    Membership capital means funds contributed by members that: are 
adjustable balance with a minimum withdrawal notice of 3 years or are 
term certificates with a minimum term of 3 years; are available to cover 
losses that exceed retained earnings and paid-in capital; are not 
insured by the NCUSIF or other share or deposit insurers; and cannot be 
pledged against borrowings.
    Mortgage related security means a security as defined in section 
3(a)(41) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(41), 
e.g., a privately-issued security backed by mortgages secured by real 
estate upon which is located a dwelling, mixed residential and 
commercial structure, residential manufactured home, or commercial 
structure that is rated in one of the two highest rating categories by 
at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
    Moving daily average net assets means the average of daily average 
net assets for the month being measured and the previous 11 months.

    Net assets means total assets less Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) 
stock

[[Page 429]]

subscriptions, CLF loans guaranteed by the NCUSIF, U.S. Central CLF 
certificates, and member reverse repurchase transactions. For its own 
account, a corporate credit union's payables under reverse repurchase 
agreements and receivables under repurchase agreements may be netted out 
if the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) conditions for 
offsetting are met.
    Net economic value (NEV) means the fair value of assets minus the 
fair value of liabilities. All fair value calculations must include the 
value of forward settlements and embedded options. The amortized portion 
of membership capital and paid-in capital, which do not qualify as 
capital, are treated as liabilities for purposes of this calculation. 
The NEV ratio is calculated by dividing NEV by the fair value of assets.
    Obligor means the primary party obligated to repay an investment, 
e.g., the issuer of a security, the taker of a deposit, or the borrower 
of funds in a federal funds transaction. Obligor does not include an 
originator of receivables underlying an asset-backed security, the 
servicer of such receivables, or an insurer of an investment.
    Official means any director or committee member.
    Paid-in capital means accounts or other interests of a corporate 
credit union that: are perpetual, non-cumulative dividend accounts; are 
available to cover losses that exceed retained earnings; are not insured 
by the NCUSIF or other share or deposit insurers; and cannot be pledged 
against borrowings.
    Pair-off transaction means a security purchase transaction that is 
closed out or sold at, or prior to, the settlement or expiration date.
    Quoted market price means a recent sales price or a price based on 
current bid and asked quotations.
    Regular-way settlement means delivery of a security from a seller to 
a buyer within the time frame that the securities industry has 
established for immediate delivery of that type of security. For 
example, regular-way settlement of a Treasury security includes 
settlement on the trade date (``cash''), the business day following the 
trade date (``regular way''), and the second business day following the

Sec. 704.3  Corporate credit union capital.

    (a) Capital plan. A corporate credit union must develop and ensure 
implementation of written short- and long-term capital goals, 
objectives, and strategies which provide for the building of capital 
consistent with regulatory requirements, the maintenance of sufficient 
capital to support the risk exposures that may arise from current and 
projected activities, and the periodic review and reassessment of the 
capital position of the corporate credit union.
    (b) Requirements for membership capital--(1) Form. Membership 
capital funds may be in the form of a term certificate or an adjusted 
balance account.
    (2) Disclosure. The terms and conditions of a membership capital 
account must be disclosed to the recorded owner of the account at the 
time the account is opened and at least annually thereafter.
    (i) The initial disclosure must be signed by either all of the 
directors of the member credit union or, if authorized by board 
resolution, the chair and secretary of the board; and
    (ii) The annual disclosure notice must be signed by the chair of the 
corporate credit union. The chair must sign a statement that certifies 
that the notice has been sent to member credit unions with membership 
capital accounts. The certification must be maintained in the corporate 
credit union's files and be available for examiner review.
    (3) Three-year remaining maturity. When a membership capital account 
has been placed on notice or has a remaining maturity of less than three 
years, the amount of the account that can be considered membership 
capital is reduced by a constant monthly amortization that ensures 
membership capital is fully amortized one year before the date of 
maturity or one year before the end of the notice period. The full 
balance of a membership capital account being amortized, not just the 
remaining non-amortized portion, is available to absorb losses in excess 
of the sum of retained earnings and paid-in capital until the funds are 
released by the corporate credit union at the time of maturity or the 
conclusion of the notice period.
    (4) Release. Membership capital may not be released due solely to 
the merger, charter conversion or liquidation of a member credit union. 
In the event of a merger, the membership capital transfers to the 
continuing credit union. In the event of a charter conversion, the 
membership capital transfers to the new institution. In the event of 
liquidation, the membership capital may be released to facilitate the 
payout of shares with the prior written approval of the OCCU Director.
    (5) Sale. A member may sell its membership capital to another member 
in the corporate credit union's field of

[[Page 431]]

membership, subject to the corporate credit union's approval.
    (6) Liquidation. In the event of liquidation of a corporate credit 
union, membership capital is payable only after satisfaction of all 
liabilities of the liquidation estate, including uninsured share 
obligations to shareholders and the National Credit Union Share 
Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), but excluding paid-in capital.
    (7) Merger. In the event of a merger of a corporate credit union, 
membership capital transfers to the continuing corporate credit union. 
The minimum three-year notice period for withdrawal of membership 
capital remains in effect.
    (8) Adjusted balance accounts:
    (i) May be adjusted no more frequently than once every six months; 
and
    (ii) Must be adjusted in relation to a measure, e.g., one percent of 
a member credit union's assets, established and disclosed at the time 
the account is opened without regard to any minimum withdrawal period. 
If the measure is other than assets, the corporate credit union must 
address the measure's permanency characteristics in its capital plan.
    (iii) Notice of withdrawal. Upon written notice of intent to 
withdraw membership capital, the balance of the account will be frozen 
(no further adjustments) until the conclusion of the notice period.
    (9) Grandfathering. Membership capital issued before the effective 
date of this regulation is exempt from the limitation of Sec. 
704.3(b)(8)(i).
    (c) Requirements for paid-in capital--(1) Disclosure. The terms and 
conditions of any paid-in capital instrument must be disclosed to the 
recorded owner of the instrument at the time the instrument is created 
and must be signed by either all of the directors of the member credit 
union or, if authorized by board resolution, the chair and secretary of 
the board.
    (2) Release. Paid-in capital may not be released due solely to the 
merger, charter conversion or liquidation of a member credit union. In 
the event of a merger, the paid-in capital transfers to the continuing 
credit union. In the event of a charter conversion, the paid-in capital 
transfers to the new institution. In the event of liquidation, the paid-
in capital may be released to facilitate the payout of shares with the 
prior written approval of the OCCU Director.
    (3) Callability. Paid-in capital accounts are callable on a pro-rata 
basis across an issuance class only at the option of the corporate 
credit union and only if the corporate credit union meets its minimum 
level of required capital and NEV ratios after the funds are called.
    (4) Liquidation. In the event of liquidation of the corporate credit 
union, paid-in capital is payable only after satisfaction of all 
liabilities of the liquidation estate, including uninsured share 
obligations to shareholders, the NCUSIF, and membership capital holders.
    (5) Merger. In the event of a merger of a corporate credit union, 
paid-in capital shall transfer to the continuing corporate credit union.
    (6) Paid-in capital. Paid-in capital includes both member and 
nonmember paid-in capital.
    (i) Member paid-in capital means paid-in capital that is held by the 
corporate credit union's members. A corporate credit union may not 
condition membership, services, or prices for services on a credit 
union's ownership of paid-in capital.
    (ii) Nonmember paid-in capital means paid-in capital that is not 
held by the corporate credit union's members.
    (7) Grandfathering. A corporate credit union's authority to include 
paid-in capital as a component of capital is governed by the regulation 
in effect at the time the paid-in capital was issued. When a 
grandfathered paid-in capital instrument has a remaining maturity of 
less than 3 years, the amount that may be considered paid-in capital is 
reduced by a constant monthly amortization that ensures the paid-in 
capital is fully amortized 1 year before the date of maturity. The full 
balance of grandfathered paid-in capital being amortized, not just the 
remaining non-amortized portion, is available to absorb losses in excess 
of retained earnings until the funds are released by the corporate 
credit union at maturity.

[[Page 432]]

    (d) Capital ratio. A corporate credit union will maintain a minimum 
capital ratio of 4 percent, except as otherwise provided in this part. A 
corporate credit union must calculate its capital ratio at least 
monthly.
    (e) Individual capital ratio requirement--(1) When significant 
circumstances or events warrant, the OCCU Director may require a 
different minimum capital ratio for an individual corporate credit union 
based on its circumstances. Factors that may warrant a different minimum 
capital ratio include, but are not limited to:
    (i) An expectation that the corporate credit union has or 
anticipates losses resulting in capital inadequacy;
    (ii) Significant exposure exists, unsupported by adequate capital or 
risk management processes, due to credit, liquidity, market, fiduciary, 
operational, and similar types of risks;
    (iii) A merger has been approved; or
    (iv) An emergency exists because of a natural disaster.
    (2) When the OCCU Director determines that a different minimum 
capital ratio is necessary or appropriate for a particular corporate 
credit union, he or she will notify the corporate credit union in 
writing of the proposed capital ratio and the date by which the capital 
ratio must be reached. The OCCU Director also will provide an 
explanation of why the proposed capital ratio is considered necessary or 
appropriate.
    (3)(i) The corporate credit union may respond to any or all of the 
items in the notice. The response must be in writing and delivered to 
the OCCU Director within 30 calendar days after the date on which the 
corporate credit union received the notice. The OCCU Director may 
shorten the time period when, in its opinion, the condition of the 
corporate credit union so requires, provided that the corporate credit 
union is informed promptly of the new time period, or with the consent 
of the corporate credit union. In its discretion, the OCCU Director may 
extend the time period for good cause.
    (ii) Failure to respond within 30 calendar days or such other time 
period as may be specified by the OCCU Director shall constitute a 
waiver of any objections to any item in the notice. Failure to address 
any item in a response shall constitute a waiver of any objection to 
that item.
    (iii) After the close of the corporate credit union's response 
period, the OCCU Director will decide, based on a review of the 
corporate credit union's response and other information concerning the 
corporate credit union, whether a different minimum capital ratio should 
be established for the corporate credit union and, if so, the capital 
ratio and the date the requirement must be reached. The corporate credit 
union will be notified of the decision in writing. The notice will 
include an explanation of the decision, except for a decision not to 
establish a different minimum capital ratio for the corporate credit 
union.
    (f) Failure to maintain minimum capital ratio requirement. When a 
corporate credit union's capital ratio falls below the minimum required 
by paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, or Appendix B to this part, as 
applicable, operating management of the corporate credit union must 
notify its board of directors, supervisory committee, and the OCCU 
Director within 10 calendar days.
    (g) Capital restoration plan. (1) A corporate credit union must 
submit a plan to restore and maintain its capital ratio at the minimum 
requirement when either of the following conditions exist:
    (i) The capital ratio falls below the minimum requirement and is not 
restored to the minimum requirement by the next month end; or
    (ii) Regardless of whether the capital ratio is restored by the next 
month end, the capital ratio falls below the minimum requirement for 
three months in any 12-month period.
    (2) The capital restoration plan must, at a minimum, include the 
following:
    (i) Reasons why the capital ratio fell below the minimum 
requirement;
    (ii) Descriptions of steps to be taken to restore the capital ratio 
to the minimum requirement within specific time frames;
    (iii) Actions to be taken to maintain the capital ratio at the 
minimum required level and increase it thereafter;
    (iv) Balance sheet and income projections, including assumptions, 
for the

[[Page 433]]

current calendar year and one additional calendar year; and
    (v) Certification from the board of directors that it will follow 
the proposed plan if approved by the OCCU Director.
    (3) The capital restoration plan must be submitted to the OCCU 
Director within 30 calendar days of the occurrence. The OCCU Director 
will respond to the corporate credit union regarding the adequacy of the 
plan within 45 calendar days of its receipt.
    (h) Capital directive. (1) If a corporate credit union fails to 
submit a capital restoration plan; or the plan submitted is not deemed 
adequate to either restore capital or restore capital within a 
reasonable time; or the credit union fails to implement its approved 
capital restoration plan, NCUA may issue a capital directive.
    (2) A capital directive may order a corporate credit union to:
    (i) Achieve adequate capitalization within a specified time frame by 
taking any action deemed necessary, including but not limited to the 
following:
    (A) Increase the amount of capital to specific levels;
    (B) Reduce dividends;
    (C) Limit receipt of deposits to those made to existing accounts;
    (D) Cease or limit issuance of new accounts or any or all classes of 
accounts;
    (E) Cease or limit lending or making a particular type or category 
of loans;
    (F) Cease or limit the purchase of specified investments;
    (G) Limit operational expenditures to specified levels;
    (H) Increase and maintain liquid assets at specified levels; and
    (I) Restrict or suspend expanded authorities issued under Appendix B 
of this part.
    (ii) Adhere to a previously submitted plan to achieve adequate 
capitalization.
    (iii) Submit and adhere to a capital plan acceptable to NCUA 
describing the means and a time schedule by which the corporate credit 
union shall achieve adequate capitalization.
    (iv) Meet with NCUA.
    (v) Take a combination of these actions.
    (3) Prior to issuing a capital directive, NCUA will notify a 
corporate credit union in writing of its intention to issue a capital 
directive.
    (i) The notice will state:
    (A) The reasons for the issuance of the directive; and
    (B) The proposed content of the directive.
    (ii) A corporate credit union must respond in writing within 30 
calendar days of receipt of the notice stating that it either concurs or 
disagrees with the notice. If it disagrees with the notice, it must 
state the reasons why the directive should not be issued and/or propose 
alternative contents for the directive. The response should include all 
matters that the corporate credit union wishes to be considered. For 
good cause, including the following conditions, the response time may be 
shortened or lengthened:
    (A) When the condition of the corporate requires, and the corporate 
credit union is notified of the shortened response period in the notice;
    (B) With the consent of the corporate credit union; or
    (C) When the corporate credit union already has advised NCUA that it 
cannot or will not achieve adequate capitalization.
    (iii) Failure to respond within 30 calendar days, or another time 
period specified in the notice, shall constitute a waiver of any 
objections to the proposed directive.
    (4) After the closing date of the corporate credit union's response 
period, or the receipt of the response, if earlier, NCUA shall consider 
the response and may seek additional information or clarification. Based 
on the information provided during the response period, NCUA will 
determine whether or not to issue a capital directive and, if issued, 
the form it should take.
    (5) Upon issuance, a capital directive and a statement of the 
reasons for its issuance will be delivered to the corporate credit 
union. A directive is effective immediately upon receipt by the 
corporate credit union, or upon such later date as may be specified 
therein, and shall remain effective and enforceable until it is stayed, 
modified, or terminated by NCUA.

[[Page 434]]

    (6) A capital directive may be issued in addition to, or in lieu of, 
any other action authorized by law in response to a corporate credit 
union's failure to achieve or maintain the applicable minimum capital 
ratios.
    (7) Upon a change in circumstances, a corporate credit union may 
request reconsideration of the terms of the directive. Requests that are 
not based on a significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or 
frivolous will not be considered. Pending a decision on reconsideration, 
the directive shall continue in full force and effect.
    (i) Earnings retention requirement. A corporate credit union must 
increase retained earnings if the prior month-end retained earnings 
ratio is less than 2 percent.
    (1) Its retained earnings must increase:
    (i) During the current month, by an amount equal to or greater than 
the monthly earnings retention amount; or
    (ii) During the current and prior two months, by an amount equal to 
or greater than the quarterly earnings retention amount.
    (2) Earnings retention amounts are calculated as follows:
    (i) The monthly earnings retention amount is determined by 
multiplying the earnings retention factor by the prior month-end moving 
daily average net assets; and
    (ii) The quarterly earnings retention amount is determined by 
multiplying the earnings retention factor by moving daily average net 
assets for each of the prior three month-ends.
    (3) The earnings retention factor is determined as follows:
    (i) If the prior month-end retained earnings ratio is less than 2 
percent and the core capital ratio is less than 3 percent, the earnings 
retention factor is .15 percent per annum; or
    (ii) If the prior month-end retained earnings ratio is less than 2 
percent and the core capital ratio is equal to or greater than 3 
percent, the earnings retention factor is .10 percent per annum.
    (4) The OCCU Director may approve a decrease to the earnings 
retention amount if it is determined a lesser amount is necessary to 
avoid a significant adverse impact upon a corporate credit union.
    (5) Operating management of the corporate credit union must notify 
its board of directors, supervisory committee, the OCCU Director and, if 
applicable, the state regulator within 10 calendar days of determining 
that the retained earnings ratio has declined below 2 percent. If the 
decline in the retained earnings ratio is due, in full or in part, to a 
decline in the dollar amount of retained earnings and the retained 
earnings ratio is not restored to at least 2 percent by the next month 
end, a retained earnings action plan is required to be submitted within 
30 calendar days.
    (6) The retained earnings action plan must be submitted to the OCCU 
Director and, if applicable, the state regulator and, at a minimum, 
include the following:
    (i) Reasons why the dollar amount of retained earnings has 
decreased;
    (ii) Description of actions to be taken to increase the dollar 
amount of retained earnings within specific time frames; and
    (iii) Monthly balance sheet and income projections, including 
assumptions, for the next 12-month period.

receive pecuniary consideration in connection with the making of an 
investment or deposit by the corporate credit union. Employee 
compensation is exempt from this prohibition. All transactions not 
specifically prohibited by this paragraph must be conducted at arm's 
length and in the interest of the corporate credit union.
    (j) Grandfathering. A corporate credit union's authority to hold an 
investment is governed by the regulation in effect at the time of 
purchase. However, all grandfathered investments are subject to the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 704.8 and 704.9.

Sec. 704.6  Credit risk management.

    (a) Policies. A corporate credit union must operate according to a 
credit risk management policy that is commensurate with the investment 
risks and activities it undertakes. The policy must address at a 
minimum:
    (1) The approval process associated with credit limits;
    (2) Due diligence analysis requirements;
    (3) Maximum credit limits with each obligor and transaction 
counterparty, set as a percentage of capital. In addition to addressing 
deposits and securities, limits with transaction counterparties must 
address aggregate exposures of all transactions including, but not 
limited to, repurchase agreements, securities lending, and forward 
settlement of purchases or sales of investments; and
    (4) Concentrations of credit risk (e.g., originator of receivables, 
insurer, industry type, sector type, and geographic).
    (b) Exemption. The requirements of this section do not apply to 
investments that are issued or fully guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by the U.S. government or its agencies or enterprises 
(excluding subordinated debt) or are fully insured (including 
accumulated interest) by the NCUSIF or Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.
    (c) Concentration limits--(1) General rule. The aggregate of all 
investments in any single obligor is limited to 50 percent of capital or 
$5 million, whichever is greater.
    (2) Exceptions. Exceptions to the general rule are:
    (i) Aggregate investments in repurchase and securities lending 
agreements with any one counterparty are limited to 200 percent of 
capital;
    (ii) Investments in corporate CUSOs are subject to the limitations 
of Sec. 704.11; and
    (iii) Aggregate investments in corporate credit unions are not 
subject to the limitations of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) For purposes of measurement, each new credit transaction must be 
evaluated in terms of the corporate credit union's capital at the time 
of the transaction. An investment that fails a requirement of this 
section because of a subsequent reduction in capital will be deemed 
nonconforming. A corporate credit union is required to exercise 
reasonable efforts to bring nonconforming investments into conformity 
within 90 calendar days. Investments that remain nonconforming for 90 
calendar days will be deemed to fail a requirement of this section and 
the corporate credit union will have to comply with Sec. 704.10.
    (d) Credit ratings. (1) All investments, other than in a corporate 
credit union or CUSO, must have an applicable credit rating from at 
least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO).
    (2) At the time of purchase, investments with long-term ratings must 
be rated no lower than AA- (or equivalent) and investments with short-
term ratings must be rated no lower than A-1 (or equivalent).
    (3) Any rating(s) relied upon to meet the requirements of this part 
must be identified at the time of purchase and must be monitored for as 
long as the corporate owns the investment.

[[Page 438]]

    (4) When two or more ratings are relied upon to meet the 
requirements of this part at the time of purchase, the board or an 
appropriate committee must place on the Sec. 704.6(e)(1) investment 
watch list any investment for which a rating is downgraded below the 
minimum rating requirements of this part.
    (5) Investments are subject to the requirements of Sec. 704.10 if:
    (i) One rating was relied upon to meet the requirements of this part 
and that rating is downgraded below the minimum rating requirements of 
this part; or
    (ii) Two or more ratings were relied upon to meet the requirements 
of this part and at least two of those ratings are downgraded below the 
minimum rating requirements of this part.
    (e) Reporting and documentation. (1) At least annually, a written 
evaluation of each credit limit with each obligor or transaction 
counterparty must be prepared and formally approved by the board or an 
appropriate committee. At least monthly, the board or an appropriate 
committee must receive an investment watch list of existing and/or 
potential credit problems and summary credit exposure reports, which 
demonstrate compliance with the corporate credit union's risk management 
policies.
    (2) At a minimum, the corporate credit union must maintain:
    (i) A justification for each approved credit limit;
    (ii) Disclosure documents, if any, for all instruments held in 
portfolio. Documents for an instrument that has been sold must be 
retained until completion of the next NCUA examination; and
    (iii) The latest available financial reports, industry analyses, 
internal and external analyst evaluations, and rating agency information 
sufficient to support each approved credit limit.

<R05>
Sec. 704.7  Lending.

    (a) Policies. A corporate credit union must operate according to a 
lending policy which addresses, at a minimum:
    (1) Loan types and limits;
    (2) Required documentation and collateral; and
    (3) Analysis and monitoring standards.
    (b) General. Each loan or line of credit limit will be determined 
after analyzing the financial and operational soundness of the borrower 
and the ability of the borrower to repay the loan.
    (c) Loans to members--(1) Credit unions. (i) The maximum aggregate 
amount in unsecured loans and lines of credit to any one member credit 
union, excluding pass-through and guaranteed loans from the CLF and the 
NCUSIF, must not exceed 50 percent of capital.
    (ii) The maximum aggregate amount in secured loans and lines of 
credit to any one member credit union, excluding those secured by shares 
or marketable securities and member reverse repurchase transactions, 
must not exceed 100 percent of capital.
    (2) Corporate CUSOs. Any loan or line of credit must comply with 
Sec. 704.11.
    (3) Other members. The maximum aggregate amount of loans and lines 
of credit to any other one member must not exceed 15 percent of the 
corporate credit union's capital plus pledged shares.
    (d) Loans to nonmembers--(1) Credit unions. A loan to a nonmember 
credit union, other than through a loan participation with another 
corporate credit union, is only permissible if the loan is for an 
overdraft related to the providing of correspondent services pursuant to 
Sec. 704.12. Generally, such a loan will have a maturity of one 
business day.
    (2) Corporate CUSOs. Any loan or line of credit must comply with 
Sec. 704.11.
    (e) Member business loan rule. Loans, lines of credit and letters of 
credit to:
    (1) Member credit unions are exempt from part 723 of this chapter;
    (2) Corporate CUSOs are not subject to part 723 of this chapter.
    (3) Other members not excluded under Sec. 723.1(b) of this chapter 
must comply with part 723 of this chapter unless the loan or line of 
credit is fully guaranteed by a credit union or fully secured by U.S. 
Treasury or agency securities. Those guaranteed and secured loans must 
comply with the aggregate limits of Sec. 723.16 but are exempt from the 
other requirements of part 723.
    (f) Participation loans with other corporate credit unions. A 
corporate credit

[[Page 439]]

union is permitted to participate in a loan with another corporate 
credit union provided the corporate retains an interest of at least 5 
percent of the face amount of the loan and a master participation loan 
agreement is in place before the purchase or the sale of a 
participation. A participating corporate credit union must exercise the 
same due diligence as if it were the originating corporate credit union.
    (g) Prepayment penalties. If provided for in the loan contract, a 
corporate credit union is authorized to assess prepayment penalties on 
loans.

[62 FR 12938, Mar. 19, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 57365, Oct. 25, 1999;

<R05>
Sec. 704.8  Asset and liability management.

    (a) Policies. A corporate credit union must operate according to a 
written asset and liability management policy which addresses, at a 
minimum:
    (1) The purpose and objectives of the corporate credit union's asset 
and liability activities;
    (2) The maximum allowable percentage decline in net economic value 
(NEV), compared to base case NEV;
    (3) The minimum allowable NEV ratio;
    (4) Policy limits and specific test parameters for the interest rate 
sensitivity analysis requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section; and
    (5) The modeling of indexes that serve as references in financial 
instrument coupon formulas; and
    (6) The tests that will be used, prior to purchase, to estimate the 
impact of investments on the percentage decline in NEV, compared to base 
case NEV. The most recent NEV analysis, as determined under paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section may be used as a basis of estimation.
    (b) Asset and liability management committee (ALCO). A corporate 
credit union's ALCO must have at least one member who is also a member 
of the board of directors. The ALCO must review asset and liability 
management reports on at least a monthly basis. These reports must 
address compliance with Federal Credit Union Act, NCUA Rules and 
Regulations (12 CFR chapter VII), and all related risk management 
policies.
    (c) Penalty for early withdrawals. A corporate credit union that 
permits early certificate/share withdrawals must assess market-based 
penalties sufficient to cover the estimated replacement cost of the 
certificate/share redeemed. This means the minimum penalty must be 
reasonably related to the rate that the corporate credit union would be 
required to offer to attract funds for a similar term with similar 
characteristics.
    (d) Interest rate sensitivity analysis. (1) A corporate credit union 
must:
    (i) Evaluate the risk in its balance sheet by measuring, at least 
quarterly, the impact of an instantaneous, permanent, and parallel shock 
in the yield curve of plus and minus 100, 200, and 300 basis points on 
its NEV and NEV ratio. If the base case NEV ratio falls below 3 percent 
at the last testing date, these tests must be calculated at least 
monthly until the base case NEV ratio again exceeds 3 percent;
    (ii) Limit its risk exposure to levels that do not result in a base 
case NEV ratio or any NEV ratio resulting from the tests set forth in 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section below 2 percent; and
    (iii) Limit its risk exposures to levels that do not result in a 
decline in NEV of more than 15 percent.
    (2) A corporate credit union must assess annually if it should 
conduct periodic additional tests to address market factors that may 
materially impact that corporate credit union's NEV. These factors 
should include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve;
    (ii) Adjustments to prepayment projections used for amortizing 
securities to consider the impact of significantly faster/slower 
prepayment speeds;
    (iii) Adjustments to the market spread assumptions for non Treasury 
instruments to consider the impact of widening spreads; and
    (iv) Adjustments to volatility assumptions to consider the impact 
that changing volatilities have on embedded option values.
    (e) Regulatory violations. If a corporate credit union's decline in 
NEV, base case NEV ratio or any NEV ratio

[[Page 440]]

resulting from the tests set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section violates the limits established by this rule and is not brought 
into compliance within 10 calendar days, operating management of the 
corporate credit union must immediately report the information to the 
board of directors, supervisory committee, and the OCCU Director. If any 
violation persists for 30 calendar days, the corporate credit union must 
submit a detailed, written action plan to the OCCU Director that sets 
forth the time needed and means by which it intends to correct the 
violation. If the OCCU Director determines that the plan is 
unacceptable, the corporate credit union must immediately restructure 
the balance sheet to bring the exposure back within compliance or adhere 
to an alternative course of action determined by the OCCU Director.
    (f) Policy violations. If a corporate credit union's decline in NEV, 
base case NEV ratio, or any NEV ratio resulting from the tests set forth 
in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section violates the limits established 
by its board, it must determine how it will bring the exposure within 
policy limits. The disclosure to the board of the violation must occur 
no later than its next regularly scheduled board meeting.

<R05>
Sec. 704.9  Liquidity management.

    (a) General. In the management of liquidity, a corporate credit 
union must:
    (1) Evaluate the potential liquidity needs of its membership in a 
variety of economic scenarios;
    (2) Regularly monitor sources of internal and external liquidity;
    (3) Demonstrate that the accounting classification of investment 
securities is consistent with its ability to meet potential liquidity 
demands; and
    (4) Develop a contingency funding plan that addresses alternative 
funding strategies in successively deteriorating liquidity scenarios. 
The plan must:
    (i) List all sources of liquidity, by category and amount, that are 
available to service an immediate outflow of funds in various liquidity 
scenarios;
    (ii) Analyze the impact that potential changes in fair value will 
have on the disposition of assets in a variety of interest rate 
scenarios; and
    (iii) Be reviewed by the board or an appropriate committee no less 
frequently than annually or as market or business conditions dictate.
    (b) Borrowing. A corporate credit union may borrow up to 10 times 
capital or 50 percent of shares (excluding shares created by the use of 
member reverse repurchase agreements) and capital, whichever is greater. 
CLF borrowings and borrowed funds created by the use of member reverse 
repurchase agreements are excluded from this limit. The corporate credit 
union must demonstrate that sufficient contingent sources of liquidity 
remain available.


<R05>
Sec. 704.10  Investment action plan.

    (a) Any corporate credit union in possession of an investment, 
including a derivative, that fails to meet a requirement of this part 
must, within 30 calendar days of the failure, report the failed 
investment to its board of directors, supervisory committee and the OCCU 
Director. If the corporate credit union does not sell the failed 
investment, and the investment continues to fail to meet a requirement 
of this part, the corporate credit union must, within 30 calendar days 
of the failure, provide to the OCCU Director a written action plan that 
addresses:
    (1) The investment's characteristics and risks;
    (2) The process to obtain and adequately evaluate the investment's 
market pricing, cash flows, and risk;
    (3) How the investment fits into the credit union's asset and 
liability management strategy;
    (4) The impact that either holding or selling the investment will 
have on the corporate credit union's earnings, liquidity, and capital in 
different interest rate environments; and
    (5) The likelihood that the investment may again pass the 
requirements of this part.
    (b) The OCCU Director may require, for safety and soundness reasons, 
a shorter time period for plan development than that set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

[[Page 441]]

    (c) If the plan described in paragraph (a) of this section is not 
approved by the OCCU Director, the credit union must adhere to the OCCU 
Director's directed course of action.

<R05>
Sec. 704.11  Corporate Credit Union Service Organizations (Corporate CUSOs).

    (a) A corporate CUSO is an entity that:
    (1) Is at least partly owned by a corporate credit union;
    (2) Primarily serves credit unions;
    (3) Restricts its services to those related to the normal course of 
business of credit unions; and
    (4) Is structured as a corporation, limited liability company, or 
limited partnership under state law.
    (b) Investment and loan limitations. (1) The aggregate of all 
investments in member and nonmember corporate CUSOs must not exceed 15 
percent of a corporate credit union's capital.
    (2) The aggregate of all investments in and loans to member and 
nonmember corporate CUSOs must not exceed 30 percent of a corporate 
credit union's capital. A corporate credit union may lend to member and 
nonmember corporate CUSOs an additional 15 percent of capital if the 
loan is collateralized by assets in which the corporate has a perfected 
security interest under state law.
    (3) If the limitations in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section are reached or exceeded because of the profitability of the CUSO 
and the related GAAP valuation of the investment under the equity method 
without an additional cash outlay by the corporate, divestiture is not 
required. A corporate credit union may continue to invest up to the 
regulatory limit without regard to the increase in the GAAP valuation 
resulting from the corporate CUSO's profitability.
    (c) Due diligence. A corporate credit union must comply with the due 
diligence requirements of Sec. Sec. 723.5 and 723.6(f) through (j) of 
this chapter for all loans to corporate CUSOs. This requirement does not 
apply to loans excluded under Sec. 723.1(b).
    (d) Separate entity. (1) A corporate CUSO must be operated as an 
entity separate from a corporate credit union.
    (2) A corporate credit union investing in or lending to a corporate 
CUSO must obtain a written legal opinion that concludes the corporate 
CUSO is organized and operated in a manner that the corporate credit 
union will not reasonably be held liable for the obligations of the 
corporate CUSO. This opinion must address factors that have led courts 
to ``pierce the corporate veil,'' such as inadequate capitalization, 
lack of corporate identity, common boards of directors and employees, 
control of one entity over another, and lack of separate books and 
records.
    (e) Prohibited activities. A corporate credit union may not use this 
authority to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of another 
depository financial institution or to invest in shares, stocks, or 
obligations of an insurance company, trade association, liquidity 
facility, or similar organization.
    (f) An official of a corporate credit union which has invested in or 
loaned to a corporate CUSO may not receive, either directly or 
indirectly, any salary, commission, investment income, or other income, 
compensation, or consideration from the corporate CUSO. This prohibition 
also extends to immediate family members of officials.
    (g) Prior to making an investment in or loan to a corporate CUSO, a 
corporate credit union must obtain a written agreement that the 
corporate CUSO will:
    (1) Follow GAAP;
    (2) Provide financial statements to the corporate credit union at 
least quarterly;
    (3) Obtain an annual CPA opinion audit and provide a copy to the 
corporate credit union. A wholly owned or majority owned CUSO is not 
required to obtain a separate annual audit if it is included in the 
corporate credit union's annual consolidated audit; and
    (4) Allow the auditor, board of directors, and NCUA complete access 
to its books, records, and any other pertinent documentation.
    (h) Corporate credit union authority to invest in or loan to a CUSO 
is limited to that provided in this section. A

[[Page 442]]

corporate credit union is not authorized to invest in or loan to a CUSO 
under part 712 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 704.12  Permissible services.

    (a) Preapproved services. A corporate credit union may provide to 
members the preapproved services set out in this section. NCUA may at 
any time, based upon supervisory, legal, or safety and soundness 
reasons, limit or prohibit any preapproved service. The specific 
activities listed within each preapproved category are provided as 
illustrations of activities permissible under the particular category, 
not as an exclusive or exhaustive list.
    (1) Correspondent services agreement. A corporate credit union may 
only provide financial services to nonmembers through a correspondent 
services agreement. A correspondent services agreement is an agreement 
between two corporate credit unions, whereby one of the corporate credit 
unions agrees to provide services to the other corporate credit union or 
its members.
    (2) Credit and investment services. Credit and investment services 
are advisory and consulting activities that assist the member in lending 
or investment management. These services may include loan reviews, 
investment portfolio reviews and investment advisory services.
    (3) Electronic financial services. Electronic financial services are 
any services, products, functions, or activities that a corporate credit 
union is otherwise authorized to perform, provide or deliver to its 
members but performed through electronic means. Electronic services may 
include automated teller machines, online transaction processing through 
a website, website hosting services, account aggregation services, and 
internet access services to perform or deliver products or services to 
members.
    (4) Excess capacity. Excess capacity is the excess use or capacity 
remaining in facilities, equipment or services that: a corporate credit 
union properly invested in or established, in good faith, with the 
intent of serving its members; and it reasonably anticipates will be 
taken up by the future expansion of services to its members. A corporate 
credit union may sell or lease the excess capacity in facilities, 
equipment or services, such as office space, employees and data 
processing.
    (5) Liquidity and asset and liability management. Liquidity and 
asset and liability management services are any services, functions or 
activities that assist the member in liquidity and balance sheet 
management. These services may include liquidity planning and balance 
sheet modeling and analysis.
    (6) Operational services. Operational services are services 
established to deliver financial products and services that enhance 
member service and promote safe and sound operations. Operational 
services may include tax payment, electronic fund transfers and 
providing coin and currency service.
    (7) Payment systems. Payment systems are any methods used to 
facilitate the movement of funds for transactional purposes. Payment 
systems may include Automated Clearing House, wire transfer, item 
processing and settlement services.
    (8) Trustee or custodial services. Trustee services are services in 
which the corporate credit union is authorized to act under a written 
trust agreement to the extent permitted under part 724 of this chapter. 
Custodial and safekeeping services are services a corporate credit union 
performs on behalf of its member to act as custodian or safekeeper of 
investments.
    (b) Procedure for adding services that are not preapproved. To 
provide a service to its members that is not preapproved by NCUA:
    (1) A federal corporate credit union must request approval from 
NCUA. The request must include a full explanation and complete 
documentation of the service and how the service relates to a corporate 
credit union's authority to provide services to its members. The request 
must be submitted jointly to the OCCU Director and the Secretary of the 
Board. The request will be treated as a petition to amend Sec. 704.12 
and NCUA will request public comment or otherwise act on the petition 
within a reasonable period of time. Before engaging in the formal 
approval process, a corporate credit union should seek an

[[Page 443]]

advisory opinion from NCUA's Office of General Counsel as to whether a 
proposed service is already covered by one of the authorized categories 
without filing a petition to amend the regulation; and
    (2) A state-chartered corporate credit union must submit a request 
for a waiver that complies with Sec. 704.1(b) to the OCCU Director.
    (c) Prohibition. A corporate credit union is prohibited from 
purchasing loan servicing rights.

Sec. 704.14  Representation.

    (a) Board representation. The board will be determined as stipulated 
in its bylaws governing election procedures, provided that:
    (1) At least a majority of directors, including the chair of the 
board, must serve on the board as representatives of member credit 
unions;
    (2) The chair of the board may not serve simultaneously as an 
officer, director, or employee of a credit union trade association;
    (3) A majority of directors may not serve simultaneously as 
officers, directors, or employees of the same credit union trade 
association or its affiliates (not including chapters or other subunits 
of a state trade association);
    (4) For purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) 
and (a)(3) of this section, an individual may not serve as a director or 
chair of the board if that individual holds a subordinate employment 
relationship to another employee who serves as an officer, director, or 
employee of a credit union trade association; and
    (5) In the case of a corporate credit union whose membership is 
composed of more than 25 percent non credit unions, the majority of 
directors serving as representatives of member credit unions, including 
the chair, must be elected only by member credit unions.
    (b) Credit union trade association. As used in this section, a 
credit union trade association includes but is not limited to, state 
credit union leagues and league service corporations and national credit 
union trade associations.
    (c) Representatives of organizational members. (1) An organizational 
member of a corporate credit union is a member that is not a natural 
person. An organizational member may appoint one of its members or 
officials as a representative to the corporate credit union. The 
representative shall be empowered to attend membership meetings, to 
vote, and to stand for election on behalf of the member. No individual 
may serve as the representative of more than one organizational member 
in the same corporate credit union.
    (2) Any vacancy on the board of a corporate credit union caused by a 
representative being unable to complete his or her term shall be filled 
by the board of the corporate credit union according to its bylaws 
governing the filling of board vacancies.
    (d) Recusal provision. (1) No director, committee member, officer, 
or employee of a corporate credit union shall in any manner, directly or 
indirectly, participate in the deliberation upon or the determination of 
any question affecting his or her pecuniary interest or the pecuniary 
interest of any entity (other than the corporate credit union) in which 
he or she is interested, except if the matter involves general policy 
applicable to all members, such as setting dividend or loan rates or 
fees for services.
    (2) An individual is ``interested'' in an entity if he or she:
    (i) Serves as a director, officer, or employee of the entity;
    (ii) Has a business, ownership, or deposit relationship with the 
entity; or
    (iii) Has a business, financial, or familial relationship with an 
individual whom he or she knows has a pecuniary interest in the entity.
    (3) In the event of the disqualification of any directors, by 
operation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the remaining qualified 
directors present at the meeting, if constituting a quorum with the 
disqualified directors, may exercise, by majority vote, all the powers 
of the board with respect to the matter under consideration. Where all 
of the directors are disqualified, the matter must be decided by the 
members of the corporate credit union.

[[Page 444]]

    (4) In the event of the disqualification of any committee member by 
operation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the remaining qualified 
committee members, if constituting a quorum with the disqualified 
committee members, may exercise, by majority vote, all the powers of the 
committee with respect to the matter under consideration. Where all of 
the committee members are disqualified, the matter shall be decided by 
the board of directors.
    (e) Administration. (1) A corporate credit union shall be under the 
direction and control of its board of directors. While the board may 
delegate the performance of administrative duties, the board is not 
relieved of its responsibility for their performance. The board may 
employ a chief executive officer who shall have such authority and such 
powers as delegated by the board to conduct business from day to day. 
Such chief executive officer must answer solely to the board of the 
corporate credit union, and may not be an employee of a credit union 
trade association.
    (2) The provisions of Sec. 701.14 of this chapter apply to

Sec. 704.17  State-chartered corporate credit unions.

    (a) This part does not expand the powers and authorities of any 
state-chartered corporate credit union, beyond those powers and 
authorities provided under the laws of the state in which it was 
chartered.
    (b) A state-chartered corporate credit union that is not insured by 
the NCUSIF, but that receives funds from federally insured credit 
unions, is considered an ``institution-affiliated party'' within the 
meaning of Section 206(r) of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C.

Sec. 704.18  Fidelity bond coverage.

    (a) Scope. This section provides the fidelity bond requirements for 
employees and officials in corporate credit unions.
    (b) Review of coverage. The board of directors of each corporate 
credit union shall, at least annually, carefully review the bond 
coverage in force to determine its adequacy in relation to risk exposure 
and to the minimum requirements in this section.
    (c) Minimum coverage; approved forms. Every corporate credit union 
will maintain bond coverage with a company holding a certificate of 
authority from the Secretary of the Treasury. All bond forms, and any 
riders and endorsements which limit the coverage provided by approved 
bond forms, must receive the prior written approval of NCUA. Fidelity 
bonds must provide coverage for the fraud and dishonesty of all 
employees, directors, officers, and supervisory and credit committee 
members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all bonds must include a 
provision, in a form approved by NCUA, requiring written notification by 
surety to NCUA:
    (1) When the bond of a credit union is terminated in its entirety;
    (2) When bond coverage is terminated, by issuance of a written 
notice, on an employee, director, officer, supervisory or credit 
committee member; or
    (3) When a deductible is increased above permissible limits. Said 
notification shall be sent to NCUA and shall include a brief statement 
of cause for termination or increase.
    (d) Minimum coverage amounts. (1) The minimum amount of bond 
coverage will be computed based on the corporate credit union's daily 
average net assets for the preceding calendar year. The following table 
lists the minimum requirements:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Minimum

    (2) It is the duty of the board of directors of each corporate 
credit union to provide adequate protection to meet its unique 
circumstances by obtaining, when necessary, bond coverage in excess of 
the minimums in the table in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) Deductibles. (1) The maximum amount of deductibles allowed are 
based on the corporate credit union's core capital ratio. The following 
table sets out the maximum deductibles, except that in each category the 
maximum deductible shall be $5 million:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Core capital ratio                   Maximum deductible

                                                 of retained earnings
                                                 and paid-in capital.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) A deductible may be applied separately to one or more insuring 
clauses in a blanket bond. Deductibles in excess of those showing in 
this section must have the written approval of NCUA at least 30 calendar 
days prior to the effective date of the deductibles.
    (f) Additional coverage. NCUA may require additional coverage for 
any corporate credit union when, in the opinion of NCUA, current 
coverage is insufficient. The board of directors of the corporate credit 
union must obtain additional coverage within 30 calendar days after the 
date of written notice from NCUA.

Sec. 704.19  Wholesale corporate credit unions.

    (a) General. Wholesale corporate credit unions are subject to the 
preceding requirements of this part, except as set forth in this 
section.
    (b) Earnings retention requirement. A wholesale corporate credit 
union must increase retained earnings if the prior month-end retained 
earnings ratio is less than 1 percent.
    (1) Its retained earnings must increase:
    (i) During the current month, by an amount equal to or greater than 
the monthly earnings retention amount; or
    (ii) During the current and prior two months, by an amount equal to 
or greater than the quarterly earnings retention amount.
    (2) Earnings retention amounts are calculated as follows:
    (i) The monthly earnings retention amount is determined by 
multiplying the earnings retention factor by the prior month-end moving 
daily average net assets; and
    (ii) The quarterly earnings retention amount is determined by 
multiplying the earnings retention factor by moving daily average net 
assets for each of the prior three month-ends.
    (3) The earnings retention factor is determined as follows:
    (i) If the prior month-end retained earnings ratio is less than 1 
percent and the core capital ratio is less than 3 percent, the earnings 
retention factor is .15 percent per annum; or
    (ii) If the prior month-end retained earnings ratio is less than 1 
percent and the core capital ratio is equal to or greater than 3 
percent, the earnings retention factor is .075 percent per annum.
    (4) The OCCU Director may approve a decrease to the earnings 
retention amount set forth in this section if it is determined a lesser 
amount is necessary to avoid a significant adverse impact upon a 
wholesale corporate credit union.
    (5) Operating management of the wholesale corporate credit union 
must notify its board of directors, supervisory committee, OCCU Director 
and, if applicable, the state regulator within 10 calendar days of 
determining the retained earnings ratio has declined below 1 percent. If 
the decline in the retained earnings ratio is due in full or in part, to 
a decline in the dollar amount of retained earnings and the retained 
earnings ratio is not restored to at least 1 percent by the next month 
end, a retained earnings action plan is required to be submitted within 
30 calendar days.
    (6) The retained earnings action plan must be submitted to the OCCU 
Director and, if applicable, the state regulator and, at a minimum, 
include the following:
    (i) Reasons why the dollar amount of retained earnings has 
decreased;
    (ii) Description of actions to be taken to increase the dollar 
amount of retained earnings within specific time frames; and
    (iii) Monthly balance sheet and income projections, including 
assumptions for the ensuing 12-month period.

   Sec. Appendix B to Part 704--Expanded Authorities and Requirements

    A corporate credit union may obtain all or part of the expanded 
authorities contained in this Appendix if it meets the applicable 
requirements of Part 704 and Appendix B, fulfills additional management,

NCUA's written approval. Additional guidance is set forth in the NCUA 
publication Guidelines for Submission of Requests for Expanded 
Authority.
    A corporate credit union seeking expanded authorities must submit to 
NCUA a self-assessment plan supporting its request. A corporate credit 
union may adopt expanded authorities when NCUA has provided final 
approval. If NCUA denies a request for expanded authorities, it will 
advise the corporate credit union of the reason(s) for the denial and 
what it must do to resubmit its request. NCUA may revoke these expanded 
authorities at any time if an analysis indicates a significant 
deficiency. NCUA will notify the corporate credit union in writing of 
the identified deficiency. A corporate credit union may request, in 
writing, reinstatement of the revoked authorities by providing a self-
assessment plan detailing how it has corrected the deficiency.

information:
    (1) Information demonstrating a sound financial position and the 
credit union's ability to manage its day-to-day business affairs, 
including the credit union's latest financial statement. Nonfederally 
insured credit unions must include the following:
    (i) A copy of its most recent outside audit report;
    (ii) Proof of deposit and surety bond insurance which states the 
maximum insurance levels permitted by the policies;
    (iii) A balance sheet, an income and expense statement, and a 
schedule of delinquent loans, for the most recent month-end and each of 
the twelve months preceding that month-end.
    (2) Evidence that the credit union has a need for increased funds in 
order to improve financial services to its members.
    (3) The following information concerning a state-chartered credit 
union's field of membership:
    (i) Current field of membership as set forth in the credit union's 
charter;

[[Page 451]]

    (ii) Changes, if any, to be made to the field of membership for 
participation in the Program, including;
    (A) Evidence of approval of change by credit union board of 
directors;
    (B) Evidence of submission and approval of change by the state

a plan for its growth and development. The plan will set forth 
objectives for financial growth, credit union development and 
capitalization, and the means for achieving these objectives.
    (5) Indication of any other involvement in existing community 
development programs of state and federal agencies.
    (c) NCUA will notify applicant credit unions as to whether or not 
they have qualified for a loan or technical assistance under this part. 
Reasons for nonqualification will be stated. Any applicant whose 
qualification is denied may appeal that decision to the NCUA Board.

[58 FR 21646, Apr. 23, 1993, as amended at 61 FR 50695, Sept. 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 705.6  Community needs plan.

    (a) The credit union's board of directors will prepare a Community 
Needs Plan and submit it with its loan application. The Plan will 
contain a list of needed community services that the credit union will 
provide.
    (b) The credit union's board of directors will report on the 
progress of providing needed community services to the credit union 
members once a year, either at the annual meeting or in a written report 
sent to all members. The credit union will also submit the written 
report or a summary of the report given at the annual meeting to NCUA.


<R05>
Sec. 705.7  Loans to participating credit unions.

    (a) Amount and recording of loans. A participating credit union will 
be eligible to receive up to $300,000 in the aggregate, as determined by 
the NCUA Board, in the form of a loan from the Community Development 
Revolving Loan Fund for Credit Unions. The amount of the loan will be 
based on funds availability, the creditworthiness of the participating 
credit union, financial need, and a demonstrated capability of a 
participating credit union to provide financial and related services to 
its members. At the discretion of NCUA, a loan will be recorded by a 
participating credit union as either a note payable or a nonmember 
deposit.
    (b) Matching requirements. Participating credit unions will be 
encouraged to develop, as rapidly as possible, a permanent source of 
member shares.
    (1) Generally loan monies made available must be matched by the 
participating credit union by increasing its share deposits in an amount 
equal to the loan amount. However, any loan monies matched by member 
share deposits will be credited as a two-for-one match. Nonmember share 
deposits accepted to meet the matching requirement are not subject to 
the 20% limitation on nonmember deposits under Sec. 701.32. 
Participating credit unions must meet this matching requirement within 
one year of the approval of the loan application and must maintain the 
increase in the total amount of share deposits for the duration of the 
loan. Once the loan is repaid, nonmember share deposits accepted to meet 
the matching requirement are subject to Sec. 701.32.
    (2) Upon approval of its loan application, and before it meets its 
matching requirement, a participating credit union may receive the 
entire loan commitment in a single payment. If any funds are withheld, 
the remainder of the funds committed will be available to the 
participating credit union only after it has documented that it has met 
the match requirement for the total amount of the loan committed.
    (3) Failure of a participating credit union to generate the required 
match within one year of the approval of the loan will result in the 
reduction of the loan proportionate to the amount of match actually 
generated. Payment of any additional funds initially approved will be 
limited as appropriate to reflect

[[Page 452]]

the revised amount of the loan approved. Any funds already advanced to 
the participating credit union in excess of the revised amount of loan 
approval must be repaid immediately to NCUA. Failure to repay such funds 
to NCUA upon demand shall result in the default of the entire loan.
    (c) Terms and repayment. (1) Assistance made available through 
Program loans, whether recorded by the credit union as a note payable or 
nonmember deposit at NCUA's direction, is in the form of a loan and must 
be repaid to NCUA. All loans will be scheduled for repayment within the 
shortest time compatible with sound business practices and with 
objectives of the Program, but in no case will the term exceed five 
years.
    (2) Semiannual interest payments (beginning six months after the 
initial distribution of a loan) and semiannual principal payments 
(beginning one year after the initial distribution of a loan) will be 
required.
    (d) Interest rates. Loans made under this part shall bear interest 
at a fixed annual percentage rate of not more than 3 percent and not 
less than 1 percent as determined by the NCUA Board.
    (e) Default, collections and adjustments. The terms of each loan 
agreement shall provide for the immediate acceleration of the unpaid 
balance for breach or default in the performance by the participating 
credit union of the terms or conditions of the loan. This will include 
misrepresentation, default in making interest/principal payments, 
failure to report, insolvency, failure to maintain adequate match for 
the duration of the loan period, etc. The unpaid balance will also be 
accelerated and immediately due if any part of the loan funds are 
improperly used, or if uninvested loan proceeds remain unused for an 
unreasonable or unjustified period of time.

[58 FR 21646, Apr. 23, 1993, as amended at 61 FR 50696, Sept. 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 705.8  State-chartered credit unions.

    State-chartered credit union loan applicants approved for 
participation by NCUA must obtain written concurrence from their 
respective state regulatory authority. Such applicants shall make copies 
of their state examination reports available to NCUA and shall agree to 
examination by NCUA for the limited purpose of compliance with this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 705.9  Application period.

    NCUA will announce annually and publish in the Federal Register when 
applications for participation in the program may be submitted. Such 
notice will be dependent upon the availability of funds.


<R05>
Sec. 705.10  Technical assistance.

    NCUA may provide technical assistance to participating credit unions 
directly or through outside providers selected by the credit unions or 
NCUA. NCUA will base technical assistance on funds availability, the 
needs of the participating credit union, and a demonstrated capability 
of the participating credit union to provide financial and related 
services to its members. NCUA will consider applications for technical 
assistance and determine whether to grant them in accordance with 
established procedures and standards that are publicly available. 
Participating credit unions can be provided with technical assistance 
without obtaining a Program loan. NCUA technical assistance will aid 
participating credit unions in providing services to their members and 
in the efficient operation of such credit unions.

<R05>
Sec. 706.2  Unfair credit practices.

    (a) In connection with the extension of credit to consumers, it is 
an unfair act or practice for a Federal credit union, directly or 
indirectly, to take or receive from a consumer an obligation that:
    (1) Constitutes or contains a cognovit or confession of judgment 
(for purposes other than executory process in the State of Louisiana), 
warrant of attorney, or other waiver of the right to notice and the 
opportunity to be heard in the event of suit or process thereon.
    (2) Constitutes or contains an executory waiver or a limitation of 
exemption from attachment, execution, or other process on real or 
personal property held, owned by, or due to the consumer, unless the 
waiver applies solely to property subject to a security interest 
executed in connection with the obligation.
    (3) Constitutes or contains an assignment of wages or other earnings 
unless:
    (i) The assignment by its terms is revocable at the will of the 
debtor, or
    (ii) The assignment is a payroll deduction plan or preauthorized 
payment plan, commencing at the time of the transaction, in which the 
consumer authorizes a series of wage deductions as a method of making 
each payment, or
    (iii) The assignment applies only to wages or other earnings already 
earned at the time of the assignment.
    (4) Constitutes or contains a nonpossessory security interest in 
household goods other than a purchase money security interest.


<R05>
Sec. 706.3  Unfair or deceptive cosigner practices.

    (a) Prohibited practices. In connection with the extension of credit 
to consumers, it is:
    (1) A deceptive act or practice for a Federal credit union, directly 
or indirectly, to mispresent the nature or extent of cosigner liability 
to any person.
    (2) An unfair act or practice for a Federal credit union, directly 
or indirectly, to obligate a cosigner unless the cosigner is informed 
prior to becoming obligated, which in the case of open-end credit means 
prior to the time that the agreement creating the cosigner's liability 
for future charges is executed,

[[Page 454]]

of the nature of his or her liability as cosigner.
    (b) Disclosure requirement. (1) To comply with the cosigner 
information requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a clear and 
conspicuous disclosure statement shall be given in writing to the 
cosigner prior to becoming obligated. The disclosure statement will 
contain only the following statement, or one which is substantially 
equivalent, and shall either be a separate document or included in the 
documents evidencing the consumer credit obligation.

                           Notice to Cosigner

    You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before 
you do. If the borrower doesn't pay the debt, you will have to. Be sure 
you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this 
responsibility.
    You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the 
borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or collection 
costs, which increase this amount.
    The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to 
collect from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection 
methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing 
you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in default, that 
fact may become a part of your credit record.
    This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.

    (2) If the notice to cosigner is a separate document, nothing other 
than the following items may appear with the notice. Items (i) through 
(v) may not be part of the narrative portion of the notice to cosigner.
    (i) The name and address of the Federal credit union;
    (ii) An identification of the debt to be consigned (e.g., a loan 
identification number);
    (iii) The amount of the loan;
    (iv) The date of the loan;
    (v) A signature line for a cosigner to acknowledge receipt of the 
notice; and
    (vi) To the extent permitted by state law, a cosigner notice 
required by state law may be included in the paragraph (b)(1) notice.
    (3) To the extent the notice to cosigner specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section refers to an action against a cosigner that is 
not permitted by state law, the notice to cosigner may be modified.


<R05>
Sec. 706.4  Late charges.

    (a) In connection with collecting a debt arising out of an extension 
of credit to a consumer, it is an unfair act or practice for a Federal 
credit union, directly or indirectly, to levy or collect any delinquency 
charge on a payment, which payment is otherwise a full payment for the 
applicable period and is paid on its due date or within an applicable 
grace period, when the only delinquency is attributable to late fee(s) 
or delinquency charge(s) assessed on earlier installment(s).
    (b) For purposes of this section, ``collecting a debt'' means any 
activity other than the use of judicial process that is intended to 
bring about or does bring about repayment of all or part of a consumer 
debt.


<R05>
Sec. 706.5  State exemptions.

    (a) If, upon application to the NCUA by an appropriate state agency, 
the NCUA determines that:
    (1) There is a state requirement or prohibition in effect that 
applies to any transaction to which a provision of this rule applies; 
and
    (2) The state requirement or prohibition affords a level of 
protection to consumers that is substantially equivalent to, or greater 
than, the protection afforded by this rule; then that provision of this 
rule will not be in effect in the state to the extent specified by the 
NCUA in its determination, for as long as the state administers and 
enforces the state requirement or prohibition effectively.
    (b) States that received an exemption from the Federal Trade 
Commission's Credit Practices Rule prior to September 17, 1987, are not 
required to reapply to NCUA for an exemption under paragraph (a) of this 
section provided that the state forwards a copy of its exemption 
determination to the appropriate Regional Office. NCUA will honor the 
exemption for as long as the state administers and enforces the state 
requirement or prohibition effectively. Any state seeking a greater 
exemption than that granted to it by the Federal Trade Commission must 
apply to NCUA for the exemption.

Sec. 707.1  Authority, purpose, coverage and effect on State laws.

    (a) Authority. This part is issued by the National Credit Union 
Administration Board to implement the Truth in Savings Act of 1991 
(TISA), contained in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Improvement Act of 1991 (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq., Public Law No. 102-242, 
105 Stat. 2236).
    (b) Purpose. The purpose of this part is to enable credit union 
members and potential members to make informed decisions about accounts 
at credit unions. This part requires credit unions to provide 
disclosures so that members and potential members can make meaningful 
comparisons among credit unions and depository institutions.
    (c) Coverage. This part applies to all credit unions whose accounts 
are either insured by, or eligible to be insured by, the National Credit 
Union Share Insurance Fund, except for any credit union that has been 
designated as a corporate credit union by the National Credit Union 
Administration and any credit union that has $2 million or less in 
assets, after subtracting any nonmember deposits, and is determined to 
be nonautomated by the National Credit Union Administration. In 
addition, the advertising rules in Sec. 707.8 apply to any person who 
advertises an account offered by a credit union, including any person 
who solicits any amount from any other person for placement in a credit 
union.
    (d) Effect on state laws. State law requirements that are 
inconsistent with the requirements of the TISA and this part are 
preempted to the extent of the inconsistency.

limited to, accounts such as share, share draft, checking and term share

the term also includes an account at a credit union that is held by or 
offered by a share or deposit broker.
    (b) Advertisement means a commercial message, appearing in any 
medium, that promotes directly or indirectly:

    (c) Annual percentage yield means a percentage rate reflecting the 
total amount of dividends paid on an account, based on the dividend rate 
and the frequency of compounding for a 365-day period and calculated 
according to the rules in appendix A of this part.

    (e) Board means the National Credit Union Administration Board.
    (f) Bonus means a premium, gift, award, or other consideration worth 
more than $10 (whether in the form of cash, credit, merchandise, or any

opening, maintaining, or renewing an account, or increasing an account 
balance. The term does not include dividends, other consideration worth 
$10 or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the

rate paid on an account, which does not reflect compounding. For 
purposes of the account disclosures in Sec. 707.4(b)(1)(i), the rate

state law, the word ``interest'' shall be substituted for all references 
to ``dividend'' or ``dividends'' in this part.
    (q) Member means:
    (1) A natural person member of the credit union who holds an account 
primarily for personal, family, or household purposes;
    (2) A natural person nonmember who holds an account primarily for

another in a professional capacity or an unincorporated nonbusiness

Sec. 707.3  General disclosure requirements.

    (a) Form. Credit unions must make the disclosures required by 
Sec. Sec. 707.4 through 707.6 and Sec. 707.10 of this part, as 
applicable, clearly and conspicuously, in writing, and in a form the 
member or potential member may keep. Disclosures for each account 
offered by a credit union may be presented separately or combined with 
disclosures for the credit union's other accounts, as long as it is 
clear which disclosures are applicable to the member's account.
    (b) General. The disclosures shall reflect the terms of the legal 
obligation between the member and the credit union. Disclosures may be 
made in languages other than English, provided the disclosures are 
available in English upon request.
    (c) Relation to Regulation E (12 CFR part 205). Disclosures required 
by and provided in accordance with the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 
U.S.C. 1601) and its implementing Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) that 
are also required by this part may be substituted for the disclosures 
required by this part.
    (d) Multiple members. If an account is held by more than one member, 
disclosures may be made to any one of the members.
    (e) Oral responses to inquiries. In an oral response to a member or 
potential member's inquiry about dividend rates payable on its accounts, 
the credit union shall state the annual percentage yield. The dividend 
rate may be stated in addition to the annual percentage yield. No other 
rate may be stated. In stating a dividend rate and annual percentage 
yield, a credit union shall:
    (1) For dividend-bearing accounts other than term share accounts, 
specify a dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of the last 
dividend declaration date. In the event that disclosures of a dividend 
rate and annual percentage yield as of the last dividend declaration 
date might be inaccurate because of known or contemplated dividend rate 
changes, the credit union may disclose the prospective dividend rate and 
prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective dividend rate and 
prospective annual percentage yield may be disclosed either in lieu of, 
or in addition to, the dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of 
the last dividend declaration date.
    (2) For interest-bearing accounts and for dividend-bearing term 
share accounts, specify an interest (dividend) rate and annual 
percentage yield that were offered within the most recent

[[Page 458]]

seven calendar days; state that the rate and yield are accurate as of an 
identified date; and provide a telephone number members may call to 
obtain current rate information.
    (f) Rounding and accuracy rules for rates and yields--(1) Rounding. 
The annual percentage yield, the annual percentage yield earned, and the 
dividend rate shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one 
percentage point (.01%) and expressed to two decimal places. For account 
disclosures, the dividend rate may be expressed to more than two decimal 
places.
    (2) Accuracy. The annual percentage yield (and the annual percentage 
yield earned) will be considered accurate if not more than one-twentieth 
of one percentage point (.05%) above or below the annual percentage 
yield (and the annual percentage yield earned) determined in accordance 
with the rules in appendix A of this part.
    (g) Electronic communication. For rules governing the electronic 
delivery of disclosures, including the definition of electronic 
communication, see Sec. 707.10.

Sec. 707.4  Account disclosures.

    (a) Delivery of account disclosures--(1) Account opening--(i) 
General. A credit union must provide account disclosures to a member or 
potential member before an account is opened or a service is provided, 
whichever is earlier. A credit union is deemed to have provided a 
service when a fee required to be disclosed is assessed. Except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, if the member is not 
present at the credit union when the account is opened or the service is 
provided and has not already received the disclosures, the credit union 
must mail or deliver the disclosures no later than 10 business days 
after the account is opened or the service is provided, whichever is 
earlier.
    (ii) Electronic communication. If a member or potential member who 
is not present at the credit union uses electronic communication (as 
defined in Sec. 707.10) to open an account or request a service, the 
disclosures required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be 
provided before an account is opened or a service is provided.
    (2) Requests. (i) A credit union must provide account disclosures to 
a member or potential member upon request. If a member who is not 
present at the credit union makes a request, the credit union must mail 
or deliver the disclosures within a reasonable time after it receives 
the request and may provide the disclosures in paper form, or 
electronically if the member provides an electronic mail address.
    (ii) In providing disclosures upon request, the credit union may:
    (A) Specify rates as follows:
    (1) For dividend-bearing accounts other than term share accounts, 
specify a dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of the last 
dividend declaration date. In the event that disclosures of a dividend 
rate and annual percentage yield as of the last dividend declaration 
date might be inaccurate because of known or contemplated dividend rate 
changes, the credit union may disclose the prospective dividend rate and 
prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective dividend rate and 
prospective annual percentage yield may be disclosed either in lieu of, 
or in addition to, the dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of 
the last dividend declaration date.
    (2) For interest bearing accounts and for dividend-bearing term 
share accounts, specify an interest rate and annual percentage yield 
that were offered within the most recent seven calendar days; state that 
the rate and yield are accurate as of an identified date; and provide a 
telephone number members may call to obtain current rate information; 
and
    (B) State the maturity of a term share account as either a term or a 
date.
    (b) Content of account disclosures. Account disclosures shall 
include the following, as applicable:
    (1) Rate information--(i) Annual percentage yield and dividend rate. 
(A) For interest-bearing accounts and for dividend-bearing term share 
accounts, the ``annual percentage yield'' and the ``interest rate'' 
(``dividend rate''), using

[[Page 459]]

those terms, and for fixed-rate accounts the period of time the interest 
(dividend) rate will be in effect.
    (B) For dividend-bearing accounts other than term share accounts, a 
credit union shall specify a dividend rate and annual percentage yield 
(using those terms) as of the last dividend declaration date. In the 
event that disclosures of a dividend rate and annual percentage yield as 
of the last dividend declaration date might be inaccurate because of 
known or contemplated dividend rate changes, the credit union may 
disclose the prospective dividend rate and prospective annual percentage 
yield. Such prospective dividend rate and prospective annual percentage 
yield may be disclosed either in lieu of, or in addition to, the 
dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of the last dividend 
declaration date.
    (ii) Variable rates. For variable-rate accounts:
    (A) The fact that the dividend rate and annual percentage yield may 
change;
    (B) How the dividend rate is determined;
    (C) The frequency with which the dividend rate may change; and
    (D) Any limitation on the amount the dividend rate may change.
    (2) Compounding and crediting--(i) Frequency. The frequency with 
which dividends are compounded and credited, and the dividend period for 
dividend-bearing accounts.
    (ii) Effect of closing an account. If members will forfeit dividends 
if they close an account before accrued dividends are credited, a 
statement that the dividends will not be paid in such cases.
    (3) Balance information--(i) Minimum balance requirements. Any 
minimum balance required to:
    (A) Open the account;
    (B) Avoid the imposition of a fee; or
    (C) Obtain the annual percentage yield disclosed.

Except for the balance to open the account, the disclosure shall state 
how the balance is determined for these purposes.
    (ii) Balance computation method. An explanation of the balance 
computation method specified in Sec. 707.7, used to calculate dividends 
on the account.
    (iii) When dividends begin to accrue. A statement of when dividends 
begin to accrue on noncash deposits.
    (4) Fees. The amount of any fee that may be imposed in connection 
with the account (or an explanation of how the fee will be determined) 
and the conditions under which the fee may be imposed.
    (5) Transaction limitations. Any limitations on the number or dollar 
amount of withdrawals or deposits.
    (6) Features of term share accounts. For term share accounts:
    (i) Time requirements. The maturity date.
    (ii) Early withdrawal penalties. A statement that a penalty will be 
imposed for early withdrawal, how it is calculated, and the conditions 
for its assessment.
    (iii) Withdrawal of dividends prior to maturity. If compounding 
occurs and dividends may be withdrawn prior to maturity, a statement 
that the annual percentage yield assumes dividends remain in the account 
until maturity and that a withdrawal will reduce earnings. For accounts 
with a stated maturity greater than 1 year that do not compound 
dividends on an annual or more frequent basis, that require dividend 
payouts at least annually, and that disclose an APY determined in 
accordance with section E of appendix A of this part, a statement that 
dividends cannot remain on account and that payout of dividends is 
mandatory.
    (iv) Renewal policies. A statement of whether or not the account 
will renew automatically at maturity. If it will, a statement of whether 
or not a grace period will be provided and, if so, the length of that 
period must be stated. If the account will not renew automatically, a 
statement of whether dividends will be paid after maturity if the member 
does not renew the account must be stated.
    (7) Bonuses. The amount or type of any bonus, when the bonus will be 
provided, and any minimum balance and time requirements to obtain the 
bonus.
    (8) Nature of dividends. For accounts earning dividends, other than 
term share accounts, a statement that dividends are paid from current 
income and available earnings, after required

[[Page 460]]

transfers to reserves at the end of a dividend period.
    (c) Notice to existing account holders--(1) Notice of availability 
of disclosures. Credit unions shall provide a notice to members who 
receive periodic statements and who hold existing accounts of the type 
offered by the credit union on January 1, 1995. The notice shall be 
included on or with the first periodic statement sent after January 1, 
1995 (or on or with the first periodic statement for a statement cycle 
beginning on or after that date). The notice shall state that the 
members may request account disclosures containing terms, fees, and rate 
information for the account. In responding to such a request, credit 
unions shall provide disclosures in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) Alternative to notice. As an alternative to the notice described 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, credit unions may provide account 
disclosures to members. The disclosures may be provided either with a 
periodic statement or separately, but must be sent no later than when 
the periodic statement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is 
sent.

the annual percentage yield or adversely affect the member. The notice 
shall include the effective date of the change. The notice shall be 
mailed or delivered at least 30 calendar days before the effective date 
of the change.
    (2) No notice required. No notice under this section is required

longer than one month that renew automatically at maturity, credit 
unions shall provide the disclosures described below before maturity. 
The disclosures shall be mailed or delivered at least 30 calendar days 
before maturity of the existing account. Alternatively, the disclosures 
may be mailed or delivered at least 20 calendar days before the end of 
the grace period on the existing account, provided a grace period of at

    (1) Maturities of longer than one year. If the maturity is longer 
than one year, the credit union shall provide account disclosures set 
forth in Sec. 707.4(b) for the new account, along with the date the 
existing account matures. If the dividend rate and annual percentage 
yield that will be paid for the new account are unknown when disclosures 
are provided, the credit union shall state that those rates have not yet 
been determined, the date when they will be determined, and a telephone 
number members may call to obtain the dividend rate and the annual

Sec. 707.6  Periodic statement disclosures.

    (a) Rule when statement and crediting periods vary. In making the 
disclosures described in paragraph (b) of this section, credit unions 
that calculate and credit dividends for a period other than the 
statement period, such as the dividend period, may calculate and 
disclose the annual percentage yield earned and amount of dividends 
earned based on that period rather than the statement period. The 
information in paragraph (b)(4) shall be stated for that period as well 
as for the statement period.
    (b) Statement disclosures. If a credit union mails or delivers a 
periodic statement, the statement shall include the following 
disclosures:
    (1) Annual percentage yield earned. The ``annual percentage yield 
earned,'' using that term as calculated according to the rules in 
appendix A of this part.
    (2) Amount of dividends. The dollar amount of dividends earned 
(accrued or paid and credited) on the account. The dollar amount of any 
extraordinary dividends earned during the statement period shall be 
shown as a separate figure.
    (3) Fees imposed. Fees required to be disclosed under Sec. 
707.4(b)(4) of this part that were debited from the account during the 
statement period. The fees must be itemized by type and dollar amounts. 
Except as provided in Sec. 707.11(a)(1) of this part, when fees of the 
same type are imposed more than once in a statement period, a credit 
union may itemize each fee separately or group the fees together and 
disclose a total dollar amount for all fees of that type.
    (4) Length of period. The total number of days in the statement 
period, or the beginning and ending dates of the period.

Sec. 707.7  Payment of dividends.

    (a) Permissible methods--(1) Balance on which dividends are 
calculated. Credit unions shall calculate dividends on the full amount 
of principal in an account for each day by use of either the daily 
balance method or the average daily balance method. Credit unions shall 
calculate dividends by use of a daily rate of at least \1/365\ of the 
dividend rate. In a leap year a daily rate of \1/366\ of the dividend 
rate may be used.
    (2) Determination of minimum balance to earn dividends. A credit 
union shall use the same method to determine any minimum balance 
required to earn dividends as it uses to determine the balance on which 
dividends are calculated. A credit union may use an additional method 
that is unequivocally beneficial to the member.
    (b) Compounding and crediting policies. This section does not 
require credit unions to compound or credit dividends at any particular 
frequency.
    (c) Date dividends begin to accrue. Dividends shall begin to accrue 
not later than the day specified in section 606 of the Expedited Funds 
Availability Act (12 U.S.C. 4005) and implementing Regulation CC (12 CFR 
part 229). Dividends shall accrue on funds until the day funds are 
withdrawn.

contain a similar term if any maintenance or activity fee may be imposed 
on the account. The word ``profit'' must not be used in referring to 
dividends or interest paid on an account.
    (b) Permissible rates. If an advertisement states a rate of return, 
it shall state the rate as an ``annual percentage yield,'' using that 
term. (The abbreviation ``APY'' may be used provided the term ``annual 
percentage yield'' is stated at least once in the advertisement.) The 
advertisement shall not state any other rate, except that the ``dividend 
rate,'' using that term, may be stated in conjunction with, but not more 
conspicuously than, the annual percentage yield to which it relates.
    (c) When additional disclosures are required. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section, if the annual percentage yield is stated

annual percentage yield is accurate as of a specified date. For 
dividend-bearing accounts other than term share accounts, a statement 
that the annual percentage yield is accurate as of the last dividend 
declaration date. In the event that disclosure of an annual percentage 
yield as of the last dividend declaration date might be inaccurate 
because of known or contemplated dividend rate changes, the credit union 
may disclose the prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective 
annual percentage yield may be disclosed either in lieu of, or in 
addition to, the dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of the 
last dividend declaration date.
    (3) Minimum balance. The minimum balance required to earn the 
advertised annual percentage yield. For tiered-rate accounts, the 
minimum balance required for each tier shall be stated in close 
proximity and with equal prominence to the applicable annual percentage 
yield.

may be imposed for early withdrawal.
    (iii) Required dividend payouts. For noncompounding term share 
accounts with a stated maturity greater than one year that do not 
compound dividends on an annual or more frequent basis, that require 
dividend payouts at least annually, and that disclose an APY determined 
in accordance with section E of appendix A of this part, a statement 
that dividends cannot remain on account and that payout of dividends is 
mandatory.
    (d) Bonuses. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if 
a bonus is stated in an advertisement, the advertisement shall state the 
following information, to the extent applicable, clearly and 
conspicuously:
    (1) The ``annual percentage yield,'' using that term;
    (2) The time requirements to obtain the bonus;
    (3) The minimum balance required to obtain the bonus;
    (4) The minimum balance required to open the account, if it is 
greater than the minimum balance necessary to obtain the bonus; and
    (5) When the bonus will be provided.
    (e) Exemption for certain advertisements--(1) Certain media. If an 
advertisement is made through one of the following media, it need not 
contain the information in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(4), (c)(5), 
(c)(6)(ii), (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section:
    (i) Broadcast or electronic media, such as television or radio;

except that the dividend rate may be stated in conjunction with the 
annual percentage yield to which it relates.
    (B) Contain a statement advising members to contact an employee for 
further information about applicable fees and terms.
    (3) Newsletters. (i) Newsletters sent by a credit union to existing 
members only are not subject to paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (ii) If a newsletter exempted by paragraph (e)(3) of this section 
states a rate of return, it shall:
    (A) State the rate as an ``annual percentage yield,'' using that 
term or the term ``APY.'' The newsletter shall not state any other rate, 
except that the dividend rate may be stated in conjunction with the 
annual percentage yield to which it relates.
    (B) Contain a statement advising members to contact an employee for 
further information about applicable fees and terms.
    (f) Additional disclosures in connection with the payment of

    (a) Definition. Electronic communication means a message transmitted 
electronically between a credit union and a member in a format that 
allows visual text to be displayed on equipment, for example, a personal 
computer monitor.
    (b) General rule. In accordance with the Electronic Signatures in 
Global and National Commerce Act (the E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et 
seq.) and the rules of this part, a credit union may provide by 
electronic communication any disclosure required by this part to be in 
writing.
    (c) When consent is required. Under the E-Sign Act, a credit union 
must obtain a member's affirmative consent when providing disclosures

where the disclosure is available; and
    (ii) Make the disclosure available for at least 90 days from the 
date the disclosure first becomes available or from the date of the 
notice alerting the member of the disclosure, whichever comes later.
    (3) Exceptions. A credit union need not comply with paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section for disclosures required under Sec. 
707.4(a)(2), and need not comply with paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section for disclosures required under Sec. 707.8.
    (e) Redelivery. When a disclosure provided by electronic 
communication is returned to a credit union undelivered, the credit 
union must take reasonable steps to attempt redelivery using information 
in its files.
    (f) Entities other than a credit union. A person other than a credit 
union that is required to comply with this part may use electronic 
communication in accordance with the requirements of this section, as 
applicable.

Sec. 707.11  Additional disclosure requirements for credit unions advertising the payment of overdrafts.

    (a) Periodic statement disclosures--(1) Disclosure of Total Fees. 
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if a credit 
union promotes the payment of overdrafts in an advertisement, the credit 
union must separately disclose on each periodic statement:
    (A) The total dollar amount for all fees or charges imposed on the 
account for paying checks or other items when there are insufficient 
funds and the account becomes overdrawn; and
    (B) The total dollar amount for all fees imposed on the account for 
returning items unpaid.
    (ii) The disclosures required by this paragraph must be provided for 
the statement period and for the calendar year to date, for any account 
to which the advertisement applies.
    (2) Communications not triggering disclosure of total fees. The 
following communications by a credit union do not trigger the 
disclosures required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section:
    (i) Promoting in an advertisement a service for paying overdrafts 
where the credit union's payment of overdrafts will be agreed upon in 
writing and subject to part 226 of this title (Regulation Z);
    (ii) Communicating, whether by telephone, electronically, or 
otherwise, about the payment of overdrafts in response to a member-
initiated inquiry about share accounts or overdrafts. Providing 
information about the payment of overdrafts in response to a balance 
inquiry made through an automated system, such as a telephone response 
machine, an automated teller machine (ATM), or a credit union's Internet 
site, is not a response to a member-initiated inquiry for purposes of 
this paragraph;
    (iii) Engaging in an in-person discussion with a member;
    (iv) Making disclosures that are required by Federal or other 
applicable law;
    (v) Providing a notice or including information on a periodic 
statement informing a member about a specific overdrawn item or the 
amount the account is overdrawn;
    (vi) Including in a share account agreement a discussion of the 
credit union's right to pay overdrafts;
    (vii) Providing a notice to a member, such as at an ATM, that 
completing a requested transaction may trigger a fee for overdrawing an 
account, or providing a general notice that items overdrawing an account 
may trigger a fee; or
    (viii) Providing informational or educational materials concerning 
the payment of overdrafts if the materials do not specifically describe 
the credit union's overdraft service.
    (3) Time period covered by disclosures. A credit union must make the 
disclosures required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the first 
statement period that begins after a credit union advertises the payment 
of overdrafts. A credit union may disclose total fees imposed for the 
calendar year by aggregating fees imposed since the beginning of the 
calendar year, or since the beginning of the first statement period

[[Page 465]]

that year for which such disclosures are required.
    (4) Termination of promotions. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
becomes inapplicable with respect to a share account two years after the 
date of a credit union's last advertisement promoting the payment of 
overdrafts related to that account.
    (5) Acquired accounts. A credit union that acquires an account must 
thereafter provide the disclosures required by paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section for the first statement period that begins after the credit 
union promotes the payment of overdrafts in an advertisement that 
applies to the acquired account. If disclosures under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section are required for the acquired account, the credit union 
may, but is not required to, include fees imposed before acquisition of 
the account.
    (b) Advertising disclosures for overdraft services--(1) Disclosures. 
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2),(b)(3), and (b)(4) of this 
section, any advertisement promoting the payment of overdrafts must 
disclose in a clear and conspicuous manner:
    (i) The fee or fees for the payment of each overdraft;
    (ii) The categories of transactions for which a fee for paying an 
overdraft may be imposed;
    (iii) The time period by which the member must repay or cover any 
overdraft; and
    (iv) The circumstances under which the credit union will not pay an 
overdraft.
    (2) Communications about the payment of overdrafts not subject to 
additional advertising disclosures. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
does not apply to:
    (i) An advertisement promoting a service where the credit union's 
payment of overdrafts will be agreed upon in writing and subject to part 
226 of this title (Regulation Z);
    (ii) A communication by a credit union about the payment of 
overdrafts in response to a member-initiated inquiry about share 
accounts or overdrafts. Providing information about the payment of 
overdrafts in response to a balance inquiry made through an automated 
system, such as a telephone response machine, ATM, or a credit union's 
Internet site, is not a response to a member-initiated inquiry for 
purposes of this paragraph;
    (iii) An advertisement made through broadcast or electronic media, 
such as television or radio;
    (iv) An advertisement made on outdoor media, such as billboards;
    (v) An ATM receipt;
    (vi) An in-person discussion with a member;
    (vii) Disclosures required by Federal or other applicable law;
    (viii) Information included on a periodic statement or a notice 
informing a member about a specific overdrawn item or the amount the 
account is overdrawn;
    (ix) A term in a share account agreement discussing the credit 
union's right to pay overdrafts;
    (x) A notice provided to a member, such as at an ATM, that 
completing a requested transaction may trigger a fee for overdrawing an 
account, or a general notice that items overdrawing an account may 
trigger a fee; or
    (xi) Informational or educational materials concerning the payment 
of overdrafts if the materials do not specifically describe the credit 
union's overdraft service.
    (3) Exception for ATM screens and telephone response machines. The 
disclosures described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this 
section are not required in connection with any advertisement made on an 
ATM screen or using a telephone response machine.
    (4) Exception for indoor signs. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
does not apply to advertisements for the payment of overdrafts on indoor 
signs as described by Sec. 707.8(e)(2) of this part, provided that the 
sign contains a clear and conspicuous statement that fees may apply and 
that members should contact an employee for further information about 
applicable fees and terms. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), an 
indoor sign does not include an ATM screen.

    Sec. Appendix A to Part 707--Annual Percentage Yield Calculation

    The annual percentage yield (APY) measures the total amount of 
dividends a credit

[[Page 466]]

union pays on an account based on the dividend rate and the frequency of 
compounding. The annual percentage yield is expressed as an annualized 
rate, based on a 365-day year. (Credit unions may calculate the annual 
percentage yield based on a 365-day or a 366-day year in a leap year.) 
Part I of this appendix discusses the annual percentage yield 
calculations for account disclosures and advertisements, while Part II 
discusses annual percentage yield earned calculations for statements. 
The annual percentage yield reflects only dividends and does not include 
the value of any bonus, as that term is defined in part 707, that may be 
provided to the member to open, maintain, increase or renew an account. 
Dividends, interest or other earnings are not to be included in the 
annual percentage yield if such amounts are determined by circumstances 
that may or may not occur in the future. These formulas apply to both 
dividend-bearing and interest-bearing accounts held by credit unions.

Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising 
                                Purposes

    In general, the annual percentage yield for account disclosures 
under Sec. Sec. 707.4 and 707.5 and for advertising under Sec. 707.8 
is an annualized rate that reflects the relationship between the amount 
of dividends that would be earned by the member for the term of the 
account and the amount of principal used to calculate those dividends. 
The amount of dividends that would be earned may be projected based on 
the most recent past declared rate or an anticipated future rate, 
whichever the credit union judges to most reasonably approximate the 
dividends to be earned. Special rules apply to accounts with tiered and 
stepped dividend rates, and to certain term share accounts with a stated 
maturity greater than 1 year.

                            A. General Rules

    Except as provided in Part I. E. of this appendix, the annual 
percentage yield shall be calculated by the formula shown below. Credit 
unions may calculate the annual percentage yield using projected 
dividends based on either the rate at the last dividend declaration date 
or the rate anticipated at a future date. The credit union must disclose 
whichever option it uses to members. Credit unions shall calculate the 
annual percentage yield based on the actual number of days for the term 
of the account. For accounts without a stated maturity date (such as a 
typical share or share draft account), the calculation shall be based on 
an assumed term of 365 days. In determining the total dividends figure 
to be used in the formula, credit unions shall assume that all principal 
and dividends remain on deposit for the entire term, and that no other 
transactions (deposits or withdrawals) occur during the term. (This 
assumption shall not be used if a credit union requires, as a condition 
of the account, that members withdraw dividends during the term. In such 
a case, the dividends (and annual percentage yield calculation) shall 
reflect that requirement.) For term share accounts that are offered in 
multiples of months, credit unions may base the number of days on either 
the actual number of days during the applicable period, or the number of 
days that would occur for any actual sequence of that many calendar 
months. If credit unions choose to use this permissive rule, they must 
use the same number of days to calculate the dollar amount of dividends 
that will be earned on the account in the annual percentage yield 
formula (where ``Dividends'' are divided by ``Principal''.)
    The annual percentage yield is to be calculated by use of the 
following general formula ((``APY'') is used for convenience in the 
formulas):

APY=100 [(1 + Dividends/Principal) <SUP>(365/Days in term)</SUP> -1].
    ``Principal'' is the amount of funds assumed to have been deposited 
at the beginning of the account.
    ``Dividends'' is the total dollar amount of dividends earned on the 
Principal for the term of the account.
    ``Days in term'' is the actual number of days in the term of the 
account.
    When the ``days in term'' is 365 (that is, where the stated maturity 
is 365 days or where the account does not have a stated maturity), the 
APY can be calculated by use of the following simple formula:

APY=100 (Dividends/Principal).

Examples:
    (1) If a credit union would pay $61.68 in dividends for a 365-day 
year on $1,000 deposited into a share draft account, the APY is 6.17%:

APY=100 [(1 + 61.68/1,000) <SUP>(365/365)</SUP> -1]
APY=6.17%.
    Or, using the simple formula above (since the term is deemed to be 
365 days):

APY=100 (61.68/1,000)
APY=6.17%.
    (2) If a credit union pays $30.37 in dividends on a $1,000 six-month 
term share certificate account (where the six-month period used by the 
credit union contains 182 days), using the general formula above, the 
APY is 6.18%:

APY=100 [(1+30.37/1,000)<SUP>(365/182)</SUP>-1]
APY=6.18%.
    The APY is affected by the frequency of compounding, i.e., the 
amount of dividends will be greater the more frequently dividends are 
compounded for a given nominal rate. When two credit unions are offering 
the same dividend rate on, for example, a share account, the APY 
disclosed may be different

[[Page 467]]

if the credit unions use a different frequency of compounding.
Examples:
    (1) If a credit union pays $1,268.25 in dividends for a 365-day year 
on $10,000 deposited into a regular share account earning 12%, and the 
dividends are compounded monthly, the APY will be 12.68%.

APY=100 ($1,268.25/10,000)
APY=12.68%
    (2) However, if a credit union is compounding dividends on a 
quarterly basis on an account which otherwise has the same terms, the 
dividends will be $1,255.09 and the APY will be 12.55%.

APY=100 ($1,255.09/10,000)
APY=12.55%

 B. Stepped-Rate Accounts (Different Rates Apply in Succeeding Periods)

    For accounts with two or more dividend rates applied in succeeding 
periods (where the rates are known at the time the account is opened), a 
credit union shall assume each dividend rate is in effect for the length 
of time provided for in any share agreement.
Examples:
    (1) If a credit union offers a $1,000 6-month term share 
(certificate) account on which it pays a 5% dividend rate, compounded 
daily, for the first three months (which contain 91 days), and a 5.5% 
dividend rate, compounded daily, for the next three months (which 
contain 92 days), the total dividends for six months is $26.68, and, 
using the general formula above, the APY is 5.39%:

APY=100 [(1+26.68/1,000)<SUP>(365/183)</SUP>-1]
APY=5.39%.
    (2) If a credit union offers a $1,000 2-year share certificate on 
which it pays a 6% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the first year, 
and a 6.5% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the next year, the total 
dividends for two years is $133.13, and, using the general formula 
above, the APY is 6.45%:

APY=100 [(1+133.13/1,000)<SUP>(365/730)</SUP>-1]
APY=6.45%.

                        C. Variable-Rate Accounts

    For variable-rate accounts without an introductory premium or 
discounted rate, a credit union must base the calculation only on the 
initial dividend rate in effect when the account is opened (or 
advertised), and assume that this rate will not change during the year.
    Variable-rate accounts with an introductory premium or discount rate 
must be treated like stepped-rate accounts. Thus, a credit union shall 
assume that: (1) The introductory simple dividend rate is in effect for 
the length of time provided for in the account contract; and (2) the 
variable dividend rate that would have been in effect when the account 
is opened or advertised (but for the introductory rate) is in effect for 
the remainder of the year. If the variable rate is tied to an index, the 
index-based rate in effect at the time of disclosure must be used for 
the remainder of the year. If the rate is not tied to an index, the rate 
in effect for existing members holding the same account (who are not 
receiving the introductory dividend rate) must be used for the remainder 
of the year.
    For example, if a credit union offers an account on which it pays a 
7% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the first three months (which, 
for example, contains 91 days), while the variable dividend rate that 
would have been in effect when the account was opened was 5%, the total 
dividends for a 365-day year for a $1,000 account balance is $56.52, 
(based on 91 days at 7% followed by 274 days at 5%). Using the simple 
formula, the APY is 5.65%:

APY=100 (56.52/1,000)
APY=5.65%.

   D. Accounts With Tiered Rates (Different Rates Apply to Specified 
                             Balance Level)

    For accounts in which two or more dividend rates paid on the account 
are applicable to specified balance levels, the credit union must 
calculate the annual percentage yield in accordance with the method 
described below that it uses to calculate dividends. In all cases, an 
annual percentage yield (or a range of annual percentage yields, if 
appropriate) must be disclosed for each balance tier.
    For purposes of the examples discussed below, assume the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Simple dividend rate (Percent)     Share balance required to earn rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.25..............................  Up to but not exceeding $2,500.
5.50..............................  Above $2,500, but not exceeding
                                     $15,000.
5.75..............................  Above $15,000.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Tiering Method A

    Under this method, a credit union pays on the full balance in the 
account the stated dividend rate that corresponds to the applicable 
share balance tier. For example, if a member deposits $8,000, the credit 
union pays the 5.50% dividend rate on the entire $8,000. This is also 
known as a ``hybrid'' or ``plateau'' tiered rate account.
    When this method is used to determine dividends, only one annual 
percentage yield will apply to each tier. Within each tier, the annual 
percentage yield will not vary with the amount of principal assumed to 
have been deposited.
    For the dividend rates and account balances assumed above, the 
credit union will state three annual percentage yields--one 
corresponding to each balance tier. Calculation of each annual 
percentage yield is similar for this type of account as for accounts 
with a single fixed dividend rate. Thus, the

[[Page 468]]

calculation is based on the total amount of dividends that would be 
received by the member for each tier of the account for a year and the 
principal assumed to have been deposited to earn that amount of 
dividends.
    First tier. Assuming daily compounding, the credit union will pay 
$53.90 in dividends on a $1,000 account balance. Using the general 
formula for the first tier, the APY is 5.39%:

APY=100 [(1+53.90/1,000)<SUP>(365/365)</SUP>-1]
APY=5.39%.
    Using the simple formula:

APY=100 (53.90/1,000)
APY=5.39%.
    Second tier. The credit union will pay $452.29 in dividends on an 
$8,000 deposit. Thus, using the simple formula, the annual percentage 
yield for the second tier is 5.65%:

APY=100 (452.29/8,000)
APY=5.65%.
    Third tier. The credit union will pay $1,183.61 in dividends on a 
$20,000 account balance. Thus, using the simple formula, the annual 
percentage yield for the third tier is 5.92%:

APY=100 (1,183.61/20,000)
APY=5.92%.

                            Tiering Method B

    Under this method, a credit union pays the stated dividend rate only 
on that portion of the balance within the specified tier. For example, 
if a member deposits $8,000, the credit union pays 5.25% on only $2,500 
and 5.50% on $5,500 (the difference between $8,000 and the first tier 
cutoff of $2,500). This is also known as a ``pure'' tiered rate account.
    The credit union that computes dividends in this manner must provide 
a range that shows the lowest and the highest annual percentage yields 
for each tier (other than for the first tier, which, like the tiers in 
Method A, has the same annual percentage yield throughout). The low 
figure for an annual percentage yield is calculated based on the total 
amount of dividends earned for a year assuming the minimum principal 
required to earn the dividend rate for that tier. The high figure for an 
annual percentage yield is based on the amount of dividends the credit 
union would pay on the highest principal that could be deposited to earn 
that same dividend rate. If the account does not have a limit on the 
amount that can be deposited, the credit union may assume any amount.
    For the tiering structure assumed above, the credit union would 
state a total of five annual percentage yields--one figure for the first 
tier and two figures stated as a range for the other two tiers.
    First tier. Assuming daily compounding, the credit union could pay 
$53.90 in dividends on a $1,000 account balance. For this first tier, 
using the simple formula, the annual percentage yield is 5.39%:

APY=100 (53.90/1,000)
APY=5.39%.
    Second tier. For the second tier the credit union would pay between 
$134.75 and $841.45 in dividends, based on assumed balances of $2,500.01 
and $15,000, respectively. For $2,500.01, dividends would be figured on 
$2,500 at 5.25% dividend rate plus dividends on $.01 at 5.50%. For the 
low end of the second tier, therefore, the annual percentage yield is 
5.39%. Using the simple formula:

APY=100 (134.75/2,500)
APY=5.39%.
    For $15,000, dividends are figured on $2,500 at 5.25% dividend rate 
plus dividends on $12,500 at 5.50% dividend rate. For the high end of 
the second tier, the annual percentage yield, using the simple formula, 
is 5.61%:

APY=100 (841.45/15,000)
APY=5.61%.
    Thus, the annual percentage yield range that would be stated for the 
second tier is 5.39% to 5.61%.
    Third tier. For the third tier, the credit union would pay $841.45 
and $5,871.78 in dividends on the low end of the third tier (a balance 
of $15,000.01). For $15,000.01, dividends would be figured on $2,500 at 
5.25% dividend rate, plus dividends on $12,500 at 5.50% dividend rate, 
plus dividends on $.01 at 5.75% dividend rate. For the low end of the 
third tier, therefore, the annual percentage yield, using the simple 
formula, is 5.61%:

APY=100 (841.45/15,000)
APY=5.61%.
    Assuming the credit union does not limit the account balance, it may 
assume any maximum amount for the purposes of computing the annual 
percentage yield for the high end of the third tier. For an assumed 
maximum balance amount of $100,000, dividends would be figured on $2,500 
at 5.25% dividend rate, plus dividends on $12,500 at 5.50% dividend 
rate, plus dividends on $85,000 at 5.75% dividend rate. For the high end 
of the third tier, therefore, the annual percentage yield, using the 
simple formula, is 5.87%:

APY=100 (5,871.78/100,000)
APY=5.87%.
    Thus, the annual percentage yield that would be stated for the third 
tier is 5.61% to 5.87%. If the assumed maximum balance amount is 
$1,000,000, credit unions would use $985,000 rather than $85,000 in the 
last calculation. In that case for the high end of the third tier, the 
annual percentage yield, using the simple formula, is 5.91%:

APY=100 (59,134.22/1,000,000)
APY=5.91%
    Thus, the annual percentage yield range that would be stated for the 
third tier is 5.61% to 5.91%.

E. Term Share Accounts with a Stated Maturity Greater than One Year that 
                     Pay Dividends At Least Annually

    1. For term share accounts with a stated maturity greater than one 
year, that do not compound dividends on an annual or more frequent 
basis, and that require the member to withdraw dividends at least 
annually, the annual percentage yield may be disclosed as equal to the 
dividend rate.

Example:
    If a credit union offers a $1,000 two-year term share account that 
does not compound and that pays out dividends semi-annually by check or 
transfer at a 6.00% dividend rate, the annual percentage yield may be 
disclosed as 6.00%.
    2. For term share accounts covered by this paragraph that are also 
stepped-rate accounts, the annual percentage yield may be disclosed as 
equal to the composite dividend rate.

Example:
    (1) If a credit union offers a $1,000 three-year term share account 
that does not compound and that pays out dividends annually by check or 
transfer at a 5.00% dividend rate for the first year, 6.00% dividend 
rate for the second year, and 7.00% dividend rate for the third year, 
the credit union may compute the composite dividend rate and APY as 
follows:
    (a) Multiply each dividend rate by the number of days it will be in 
effect;
    (b) Add these figures together; and
    (c) Divide by the total number of days in the term.
    (2) Applied to the example, the products of the dividend rates and 
days the rates are in effect are (5.00%x365 days) 1825, (6.00%x365 days) 
2190, and (7.00%x365) 2555, respectively. The sum of these products, 
6570, is divided by 1095, the total number of days in the term. The 
composite dividend rate and APY are both 6.00%.

         Part II. Annual Percentage Yield Earned for Statements

    The annual percentage yield earned for statements under Sec. 707.6 
is an annualized rate that reflects the relationship between the amount 
of dividends actually earned (accrued or paid and credited) to the 
member's account during the period and the average daily balance in the 
account for the period over which the dividends were earned.
    Pursuant to Sec. 707.6(a), when dividends are paid less frequently 
than statements are sent, the APY Earned may reflect the number of days 
over which dividends were earned rather than the number of days in the 
statement period, e.g., if a credit union uses the average daily balance 
method and calculates dividends for a period other than the statement 
period, the annual percentage yield earned shall reflect the 
relationship between the amount of dividends earned and the average 
daily balance in the account for the other period, such as a crediting 
or dividend period.
    The annual percentage yield shall be calculated by using the 
following formulas (``APY Earned'' is used for convenience in the 
formulas):

                           A. General Formula

APY Earned=100 [(1+Dividends earned/
Balance)<SUP>(365/Daysinperiod)</SUP>-1].

    ``Balance'' is the average daily balance in the account for the 
period.
    ``Dividends earned'' is the actual amount of dividends accrued or 
paid and credited to the account for the period.
    ``Days in period'' is the actual number of days over which the 
dividends disclosed on the statement were earned.

Examples:
    (1) If a credit union calculates dividends for the statement period 
(and uses either the daily balance or the average daily balance method), 
and the account had a balance of $1,500 for 15 days and a balance of 
$500 for the remaining 15 days of a 30-day statement period, the average 
daily balance for the period is $1,000. Assume that $5.25 in dividends 
was earned during the period. The annual percentage yield earned (using 
the formula above) is 6.58%:

APY Earned=100 [(1+5.25/1,000)<SUP>(365/30)</SUP>-1]
APY Earned=6.58%.
    (2) Assume a credit union calculates dividends on the average daily 
balance for the calendar month and provides periodic statements that 
cover the period from the 16th of one month to the 15th of the next 
month. The account has a balance of $2,000 September 1 through September 
15 and a balance of $1,000 for the remaining 15 days of September. The 
average daily balance for the month of September is $1,500, which 
results in $6.50 in dividends earned for the month. The annual 
percentage yield earned for the month of September would be shown on the 
periodic statement covering September 16 through October 15. The annual 
percentage yield earned (using the formula above) is 5.40%:

APY Earned=100 [(1+6.50/1,500)<SUP>(365/30)</SUP>-1]
APY Earned = 5.40%.
    (3) Assume a credit union calculates dividends on the average daily 
balance for a quarter (for example, the calendar months of September 
through November), and provides monthly periodic statements covering 
calendar months. The account has a balance of $1,000 throughout the 30 
days of September, a balance of $2,000 throughout the 31 days of 
October, and a balance of $3,000 throughout the 30 days of November. The 
average daily balance for the quarter is $2,000, which results in $21 in 
dividends earned for the quarter. The annual percentage yield earned

[[Page 470]]

would be shown on the periodic statement for November. The annual 
percentage yield earned (using the formula above) is 4.28%:

APY Earned=100 [(1+21/2,000)<SUP>(365/91)</SUP>-1]
APY Earned=4.28%.

 B. Special formula for use where periodic statement is sent more often 
           than the period for which dividends are compounded.

    Credit unions that use the daily balance method to accrue dividends 
and that issue periodic statements more often than the period for which 
dividends are compounded shall use the following special formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27SE93.000

    The following definition applies for use in this formula (all other 
terms are defined under Part II):
    ``Compounding'' is the number of days in each compounding period.
    Assume a credit union calculates dividends for the statement period 
using the daily balance method, pays a 5.00% dividend rate, compounded 
annually, and provides periodic statements for each monthly cycle. The 
account has a daily balance of $1000.00 for a 30-day statement period. 
The dividend earned of $4.11 for the period, and the annual percentage 
yield earned (using the special formula above) is 5.00%:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27SE93.001

APY Earned = 5.00%.

    General Note: Appendix B contains model clauses and sample forms 
intended for optional use by credit unions to aid in compliance with the 
disclosure requirements of Sec. Sec. 707.4 (account disclosures), 707.5 
(subsequent disclosures), 707.6 (statement disclosures), and 707.8 
(advertisements). Section 269(b) of TISA provides that credit unions 
that use these clauses and forms will be in compliance with TISA's 
disclosure provisions.

    As discussed in the supplementary information to Sec. 707.3(a), 
this final rule provides for flexibility in designing the format of the

[[Page 471]]

disclosures. Credit unions can choose to prepare a single document or 
brochure that incorporates disclosures for all accounts offered, or to 
prepare different documents for each type of account. Credit unions may 
also use inserts to a document, or fill in blanks to show current rates, 
fees and other terms.
    In the model clauses, words in parentheses indicate the type of 
disclosure a credit union should insert in the space provided (for 
example, a credit union might insert ``July 23, 1995'' in the blank for 
a ``(date)'' disclosure). Brackets and ``/'' indicate that a credit 
union must choose the alternative that best describes its practice (for 
example, ``[daily balance/ average daily balance]''). It should be noted 
that only in sections B-6 through B-10 of this appendix have specific 
examples of disclosures been given, with dates and figures. Sections B-1 
through B-5, and section B-11 provide only unspecific model clauses or 
blank forms. The Board felt, as did the FRB in the Appendix A to 
Regulation DD, that a mix of blank clauses and forms and application of 
the model clauses to real specific situations would benefit those who 
must comply with TISA.
    Any references to NCUA Rules and Regulations, the NCUA Standard FCU 
Bylaws, or the NCUA Accounting Manual for FCUs, are provided for 
guidance and as a point of reference for credit unions. Citations to 
these sources does not indicate that their application is required for 
those credit unions who need not follow them.

       B-1 Model Clauses for Account Disclosures (Sec. 707.4(b))

                 (a) Rate Information (Sec. 707.4(b)(1))

           (i) Fixed-Rate Accounts (Sec. 707.4(b)(1)(i)(A-B))

                      1. Interest-bearing Accounts

    The interest rate on your deposit account is ------% with an annual 
percentage yield (APY) of ------%. [For purposes of this disclosure, 
this is a rate and APY that were offered within the most recent seven 
calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call (credit union 
telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] You will be paid 
this rate [for (time period)/until (date)/for at least 30 calendar 
days].

    Note: This provision reflects an accurate statement for an interest-
bearing account authorized by state law for state-chartered credit 
unions. While the definition of the term ``interest'' permits its 
substitution for the term ``dividends,'' separate disclosures should be 
made for interest-bearing accounts. Since account opening disclosures 
may be provided to potential members requesting account information 
before opening an account, and members opening new accounts, information 
is provided indicating that the rate may not be current, but that the 
potential member or member may call the credit union to obtain up-to-
date information. When opening a new account, of course, a credit union 
could provide the contractual rate alone, and delete the sentences in 
brackets. Given the definition of fixed-rate account in Sec. 707.2(n), 
credit unions offering fixed-rate accounts must contract to hold rates 
steady for at least a 30-day period. Thus, if the 30-day option of the 
last sentence is not chosen, the period chosen must be longer than 30 
days.

                 2. Dividend-bearing Term Share Accounts

    The dividend rate on your term share account is ------% with an 
annual percentage yield (APY) of ------%. [For purposes of this 
disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were offered within the most 
recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call 
(credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] You 
will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until (date)/for at least 30 
calendar days].

    Note: This provision reflects an accurate statement for a fixed-
rate, dividend-bearing term share account. Interest-bearing term share 
accounts would use the disclosure in Sec. 1, above. Since account 
opening disclosures may be provided to potential members requesting 
account information before opening an account, and members opening new 
accounts, information is provided indicating that the rate may not be 
current, but that the potential member or member may call the credit 
union to obtain up-to-date information. When opening a new account, of 
course, a credit union could provide the contractual rate alone, and 
delete the sentences in brackets. Given the definition of fixed-rate 
account in Sec. 707.2(n), credit unions offering fixed-rate accounts 
must contract to hold rates steady for at least a 30-day period. Thus, 
if the 30-day option of the last sentence is not chosen, the period 
chosen must be longer than 30 days.

                   3. Other Dividend-bearing Accounts

[As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], the dividend rate 
was ------% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ------% on your 
account. /or The prospective dividend rate on your account is ------% 
with a prospective APY of ------% for the current dividend period.] You 
will be paid this rate for [(time period)/at least 30 calendar days].

 or

[As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], the dividend rate 
was ------% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ------% on your 
account. /or The prospective dividend rate on your account is ------% 
with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ------% for this dividend 
period.] This rate will not

[[Page 472]]

change unless the credit union notifies you at least 30 calendar days 
prior to any change.

    Note: Credit unions may disclose the dividend rate and annual 
percentage yield on accounts as of the last dividend declaration date. 
This necessitates inclusion of a disclosure of the actual calendar date 
of the last dividend declaration date. Additionally or alternatively (if 
the last dividend rate could be inaccurate), credit unions may disclose 
a prospective dividend rate and a prospective annual percentage yield. 
Such prospective rates and yields must be estimated in good faith, and 
must be declared at the proper time if it is at all possible to do so. 
As for the last sentence in these disclosures, this provision reflects a 
credit union policy to set prospective dividend rates for the next month 
(or at least 30 days), quarter or other period. Many credit unions, at 
their mid-monthly board meeting, set prospective dividend rates for the 
next month beginning on the 1st day of the month and continuing to the 
last day of the month. These rates must be formalized or ratified at the 
end of a dividend period. Given the timing of the board meetings, the 
time to prepare and mail notices and the 30 day period, it will often 
take credit unions 45 to 60 days to effectively change rates. For these 
reasons, the Board strongly suggests that credit unions do not offer 
fixed-rate, dividend-bearing accounts.

           (ii) Variable-Rate Accounts (Sec. 707.4(b)(1)(ii))

                      1. Interest-bearing Accounts

    The interest rate on your deposit account is ------%, with an annual 
percentage yield (APY) of ------%. [For purposes of this disclosure, 
this is a rate and APY that were offered within the most recent seven 
calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call (credit union 
telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] The interest rate 
and annual percentage yield may change every (time period) based on 
[(name of index)/the determination of the credit union board of 
directors]. The interest rate for your account will [never change by 
more than ------% each (time period)/never be less/more than ------%/
never exceed ------% above or fall more than ------% below the initial 
interest rate].

    Note: This disclosure combines the requirements of Sec. 
707.4(b)(1)(i) with Sec. 707.4(b)(1)(ii) for interest-bearing accounts. 
The variable nature of a deposit account usually is based on an external 
index or is set at the discretion of the board. If another means of rate 
setting is used, that, instead of the proposed language, must be 
disclosed. Since account opening disclosures may be provided to 
potential members requesting account information before opening an 
account, and members opening new accounts, information is provided 
indicating that the rate may not be current, but that the potential 
member or member may call the credit union to obtain up-to-date 
information. When opening a new account, of course, a credit union could 
provide the contractual rate alone, and delete the sentences in 
brackets. Rarely would there be limitations on rate changes, but 
language is provided for this situation in the last sentence. Of course, 
it is only to be used if it applies to an account.

                 2. Dividend-bearing Term Share Accounts

    The dividend rate on your term share account is ------%, with an 
annual percentage yield (APY) of ------%. [For purposes of this 
disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were offered within the most 
recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call 
(credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] The 
dividend rate and annual percentage yield may change every (time period) 
based on [(name of index)/the determination of the credit union board of 
directors]. The dividend rate for your account will [never change by 
more than ------% each (time period)/never be less/more than ------% /
never exceed ------% above or fall more than ------% below the initial 
dividend rate].

    Note: This disclosure combines the requirements of Sec. 
707.4(b)(1)(i) with Sec. 707.4(b)(1)(ii) for dividend-bearing, 
variable-rate term share accounts. The variable nature of a deposit 
account usually is based on an external index or is set at the 
discretion of the board. If another means of rate setting is used, that, 
instead of the model language, must be disclosed. Since account opening 
disclosures may be provided to potential members requesting account 
information before opening an account, and members opening new accounts, 
information is provided indicating that the rate may not be current, but 
that the potential member or member may call the credit union to obtain 
up-to-date information. When opening a new account, of course, a credit 
union could provide the contractual rate alone, and delete the sentences 
in brackets. Rarely would there be limitations on rate changes, but 
language is provided for this situation in the last sentence. Of course, 
it is only to be used if it applies to an account.

                   3. Other Dividend-bearing Accounts

[As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], the dividend rate 
was ------% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ------% on your 
account. /or The prospective dividend rate on your account is ------% 
with an anticipated annual percentage yield (APY) of ------% for the 
current dividend period.] The dividend rate and annual percentage yield 
may change every (dividend period) as determined by the credit union 
board of directors.


[[Page 473]]


    Note: This language combines the requirements of Sec. 
707.4(b)(1)(i) with Sec. 707.4(b)(1)(ii). Credit unions may disclose 
the dividend rate and annual percentage yield on accounts as of the last 
dividend declaration date. This necessitates inclusion of a disclosure 
of the actual calendar date of the last dividend declaration date or use 
of the phrase ``last dividend declaration date''. Additionally or 
alternatively, credit unions may disclose a prospective dividend rate 
and a prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective rates and 
yields must be estimated in good faith, and must be declared at the 
proper time if it is at all possible to do so. As for the last sentence 
in these disclosures, this provision reflects the variable nature of the 
account. Generally, there is only one variable-rate feature for share 
accounts: the frequency of dividend period rate changes (e.g., daily, 
weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually). Normally, there 
are no contractual limitations on share account earnings (unless imposed 
by a regulator), nor are earnings based on any internal or external 
index. If contractual limitations or an index are involved, however, 
those factors would need to be disclosed (unless a regulator orders 
otherwise).

           (iii) Stepped-Rate Accounts (Sec. 707.4(b)(1)(i))

                      1. Interest-bearing Accounts

    The initial interest rate on your deposit account is ------%. You 
will be paid that rate [for (time period)/ until (date)]. After that 
time, the interest rate for your deposit account will be ------% and you 
will be paid that rate [for (time period)/ until (date)]. The annual 
percentage yield (APY) for your account is ------%. [For purposes of 
this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were offered within the 
most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please 
call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate 
information.] You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until 
(date)/for at least 30 calendar days].

                 2. Dividend-bearing Term Share Accounts

    The initial dividend rate on your term share account is ------%. You 
will be paid that rate [for (time period)/ until (date)]. After that 
time, the dividend rate for your term share account will be ------% and 
you will be paid that rate [for (time period)/ until (date)]. The annual 
percentage yield (APY) for your account is ------%. [For purposes of 
this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were offered within the 
most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please 
call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate 
information.] You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until 
(date)/for at least 30 calendar days].

                   3. Other Dividend-bearing Accounts

[As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], the initial 
dividend rate on your account was ------%. /or The prospective dividend 
rate on your account is ------%.] You will be paid that rate [for (time 
period)/ until (date)]. After that time, the prospective dividend rate 
for your share account will be ------% and you will be paid such rate 
[for (time period)/ until (date)]. The annual percentage yield (APY) for 
your account is ------%. You will be paid this rate for [(time period)/
at least 30 calendar days].

    Note: Stepped-rate accounts are accounts with two or more rates that 
take effect in succeeding periods. The applicable rates and time periods 
are known when the account is opened. By nature these are fixed-rate 
accounts and are usually associated with term share (certificate) 
accounts. Accordingly, a contract provision (for share accounts) to 
change rates should be included.

            (iv) Tiered-Rate Accounts (Sec. 707.4(b)(1)(i))

                      1. Interest-bearing Accounts

                            Tiering Method A

    1* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is $------ or more, 
the interest rate paid on the entire balance in your account will be --
----%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ------%.
    2* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is more than $----
--, but less than $------, the interest rate paid on the entire balance 
in your account will be ------%, with an APY of ------%.
    3* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is $------ or less, 
the interest rate paid on the entire balance will be ------% with an APY 
of ------%.
    [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were 
offered within the most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as 
of (date). Please call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current 
rate information.]
    [Fixed-rate--You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until 
(date)/for at least 30 calendar days]./ Variable-rate--The interest rate 
and APY may change every (time period) based on [(name of index)/ the 
determination of the credit union board of directors.]

    Note: Tiering Method A pays the stated interest rate that 
corresponds to the applicable deposit tier on the full balance in the 
account. This example contemplates a two-tier system. The option (1, 2 
or 3) most closely matching the terms of the account should be chosen as 
the appropriate disclosure. For tiered-rate accounts, a disclosure may 
be added about the currency of the rate, as is provided in the first set 
of brackets. A disclosure regarding the fixed-rate or variable-

[[Page 474]]

rate nature of the account must be added, as is provided in the last set 
of brackets.

                            Tiering Method B

    1* An interest rate of --------% will be paid only on the portion of 
your [daily balance/average daily balance] that is greater than $------
--. The annual percentage yield (APY) for this tier will range from ----
----% to --------%, depending on the balance in the account.
    2* An interest rate of --------% will be paid only on the portion of 
your [daily balance/average daily balance] that is greater than $------
--, but less than $--------. The annual percentage yield (APY) for this 
tier will range from --------% to --------%, depending on the balance in 
the account.
    3* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is $-------- or 
less, the interest rate paid on the entire balance will be --------%, 
with an annual percentage yield (APY) of --------%.
    [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were 
offered within the most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as 
of (date). Please call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current 
rate information.]
    [Fixed-rate--You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until 
(date)/for at least 30 calendar days]./ Variable-rate--The interest rate 
and APY may change every (time period) based on [(name of index)/ the 
determination of the credit union board of directors.]

    Note: Tiering Method B pays different stated interest rates 
corresponding to applicable deposit tiers, on the applicable balance in 
each tier of the account. For example, a credit union might pay 3% 
interest on account funds of $500 or below, and pay 4% interest on the 
portion of the same account that exceeds $500. The example contemplates 
an account with two tiers, but additional tiers are possible. The option 
(1, 2 or 3) most closely matching the terms of the account should be 
chosen as the appropriate disclosure. For tiered-rate accounts, a 
disclosure may be added about the currency of the rate, as is provided 
in the first set of brackets.
    Tiered-rate accounts can be either fixed-rate or variable-rate 
accounts. The last sentence offers an option of either fixed-rate or 
variable-rate disclosure. Thus, the disclosures outlined above will be 
made in addition to either: (i) Disclosure of the period the fixed-rates 
are in effect or (ii) the variable-rate disclosures. Tiered-rate 
accounts are also subject to the requirement for disclosure of the 
balance computation method, see paragraph (e) to this appendix.

                 2. Dividend-bearing Term Share Accounts

                            Tiering Method A

    1* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is $-------- or 
more, the dividend rate paid on the entire balance in your account will 
be --------%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of --------%.
    2* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is more than $----
----, but less than $--------, the dividend rate paid on the entire 
balance in your account will be --------%, with an APY of --------%.
    3* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is $-------- or 
less, the dividend rate paid on the entire balance will be --------% 
with an APY of --------%.
    [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were 
offered within the most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as 
of (date). Please call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current 
rate information.]
    [Fixed-rate--You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until 
(date)/for at least 30 calendar days]./ Variable-rate--The interest rate 
and APY may change every (time period) based on [(name of index)/ the 
determination of the credit union board of directors.]

    Note: Tiering Method A pays the stated dividend rate that 
corresponds to the applicable account balance tier on the full balance 
in the account. This example contemplates a two-tier system. The option 
(1, 2 or 3) most closely matching the terms of the account should be 
chosen as the appropriate disclosure. For tiered-rate accounts, a 
disclosure may be added about the currency of the rate, as is provided 
in the first set of brackets. A disclosure regarding the fixed-rate or 
variable-rate nature of the account must be added, as is provided in the 
last set of brackets.

                            Tiering Method B

    1* A dividend rate of --------% will be paid only on the portion of 
your [daily balance/average daily balance] that is greater than $------
--. The annual percentage yield (APY) for this tier will range from ----
----% to --------%, depending on the balance in the account.
    2* A dividend rate of --------% will be paid only on the portion of 
your [daily balance/average daily balance] that is greater than $------
--, but less than $--------. The annual percentage yield (APY) for this 
tier will range from --------% to --------%, depending on the balance in 
the account.
    3* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is $-------- or 
less, the dividend rate paid on the entire balance will be --------%, 
with an annual percentage yield (APY) of --------%.
    [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were 
offered within the

[[Page 475]]

most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please 
call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate 
information.]
    [Fixed-rate--You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until 
(date)/for at least 30 calendar days]./ Variable-rate--The interest rate 
and APY may change every (time period) based on [(name of index)/ the 
determination of the credit union board of directors.]

    Note: Tiering Method B pays different stated dividend rates 
corresponding to applicable account balance tiers, on the applicable 
balance in each tier of the account. For example, a credit union might 
pay 3% dividend on account funds of $500 or below, and pay 4% dividend 
on the portion of the same account that exceeds $500. The example 
contemplates an account with two tiers, but additional tiers are 
possible. The option (1, 2 or 3) most closely matching the terms of the 
account should be chosen as the appropriate disclosure. For tiered-rate 
accounts, a disclosure may be added about the currentness of the rate, 
as is provided in the first set of brackets.
    Tiered-rate accounts can be either fixed-rate or variable-rate 
accounts. The last sentence offers an option of either fixed-rate or 
variable-rate disclosure. Thus, the disclosures outlined above will be 
made in addition to either: (i) Disclosure of the period the fixed-rates 
are in effect or (ii) the variable-rate disclosures. Tiered-rate 
accounts are also subject to the requirement for disclosure of the 
balance computation method, see paragraph (e) to this appendix.

                   3. Other Dividend-bearing Accounts

                            Tiering Method A

    1* [As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], if your 
[daily balance/average daily balance] was $-------- or more, the 
dividend rate paid on the entire balance in your account was --------%, 
with an annual percentage yield (APY) of --------%. /or If your [daily 
balance/average daily balance] is $-------- or more, a prospective 
dividend rate of --------% will be paid on the entire balance in your 
account with a prospective annual percentage yield (APY) of --------% 
for this dividend period.]
    2* [As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], if your 
[daily balance/average daily balance] was more than $--------, but was 
less than $--------, the dividend rate paid on the entire balance in 
your account was --------%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of --
------%. /or If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is more than 
$--------, but is less than $--------, a prospective dividend rate of --
------% will be paid on the entire balance in your account with a 
prospective annual percentage yield (APY) of --------% for this dividend 
period.]
    3* [As of the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], if your 
[daily balance/average daily balance] was $-------- or less, the 
dividend rate paid on the entire balance in your account will be ------
--% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of --------%. /or If your 
[daily balance/average daily balance] is $-------- or less, the 
prospective dividend rate of --------% will be paid on the entire 
balance in your account with a prospective annual percentage yield (APY) 
of --------% for this dividend period.
    [Fixed-rate--You will be paid this rate for [(time period)/at least 
30 calendar days]./ Variable-rate--The dividend rate and APY may change 
every (dividend period) as determined by the credit union board of 
directors.]

    Note: Tiering Method A pays the stated dividend rate that 
corresponds to the applicable deposit tier on the full balance in the 
account. This example contemplates a two-tier system. The option (1, 2 
or 3) most closely matching the terms of the account should be chosen as 
the appropriate disclosure. For tiered-rate accounts, a disclosure may 
be added about the prospective rate. Note that the prospective rate 
disclosure options match the required tiered-rate disclosures based on 
the previous dividend declaration date. A disclosure regarding the 
fixed-rate or variable-rate nature of the account must be added, as is 
provided in the last set of brackets.

                            Tiering Method B

    1* [As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], a dividend 
rate of --------% was paid only on the portion of your [daily balance/
average daily balance] that was greater than $--------. The annual 
percentage yield (APY) for this tier ranged from --------% to --------%, 
depending on the balance in the account. /or A prospective dividend rate 
of --------% will be paid only on the portion of your [daily balance/
average daily balance] that is greater than $-------- with a prospective 
annual percentage yield (APY) ranging from --------% to --------%, 
depending on the balance in the account, for this dividend period.]
    2* [As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], a dividend 
rate of --------% was paid only on the portion of your [daily balance/
average daily balance] that was greater than $-------- but less than $--
------. The annual percentage yield (APY) for this tier ranged from ----
----% to --------%, depending on the balance in the account. /or A 
prospective dividend rate of --------% will be paid only on the portion 
of your [daily balance/average daily balance] that is greater than $----
----, but less than $--------] with a prospective annual percentage 
yield (APY)

[[Page 476]]

ranging from --------% to --------%, depending on the balance in the 
account, for this dividend period.]
    3* [As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], if your 
[daily balance/average daily balance] was $-------- or less, the 
dividend rate paid on the entire balance was --------%, with an annual 
percentage yield (APY) of --------%. /or If your [daily balance/average 
daily balance] was $------ or less, the prospective dividend rate paid 
on the entire balance in your account will be ------% with a prospective 
annual percentage yield (APY) of ------% for this dividend period.

    Note: Tiering Method B pays different stated dividend rates 
corresponding to applicable account tiers, on the applicable balance in 
each tier of the account. For example, a credit union might pay a 3% 
dividend on account funds of $500 or below, and pay a 4% dividend on the 
portion of the same account that exceeds $500. The example contemplates 
an account with two tiers, but additional tiers are possible. The option 
(1, 2 or 3) most closely matching the terms of the account should be 
chosen as the appropriate disclosure. Note that the prospective rate 
disclosure options match the required tiered-rate disclosures based on 
the previous dividend declaration date.
    Tiered-rate accounts can be either fixed-rate or variable-rate 
accounts. The last sentence offers an option of either fixed-rate or 
variable-rate disclosures. Thus, the disclosures outlined above must be 
made in addition to either: (i) Disclosure of the period the fixed-rates 
are in effect or (ii) the variable-rate disclosures. Tiered-rate 
accounts are also subject to the requirement for disclosure of the 
balance computation method, see paragraph (e) to this appendix.

               (b) Nature of Dividends (Sec. 707.4(b)(8))

    Dividends are paid from current income and available earnings, after 
required transfers to reserves at the end of a dividend period.

    Note: The Board of Directors declares dividends based on current 
income and available earnings of the credit union after providing for 
the required reserves at the end of the month. The dividend rate and 
annual percentage yield shown may reflect either the last dividend 
declaration date on the account or the earnings the credit union 
anticipates having available for distribution. This disclosure only 
applies to share and share draft (as opposed to deposit) accounts and 
should be grouped with the Rate Information to make the disclosures more 
meaningful. This disclosure also does not apply to term share accounts 
for reasons discussed in the supplementary information regarding 
Sec. Sec. 707.3(e) and 707.4(b)(8).

            (c) Compounding and Crediting (Sec. 707.4(b)(2))

    [Dividends/Interest] will be compounded (frequency) and will be 
credited (frequency).

and, if applicable:

    If you close your [share/deposit] account before [dividends/
interest] [are/is] paid, you will not receive the accrued [dividends/
interest].

and, if applicable (for dividend-bearing accounts):

    For this account type, the dividend period is (frequency), for 
example, the beginning date of the first dividend period of the calendar 
year is (date) and the ending date of such dividend period is (date). 
All other dividend periods follow this same pattern of dates. The 
dividend declaration date follows the ending date of a dividend period, 
and for the example is (date).

    Note: Where the word ``(frequency)'' appears, time periods must be 
inserted to coincide with those specified in board resolutions of each 
credit union's board of directors. A disclosure of dividend period was 
added to Sec. 707.4(b)(2)(i) in the final rule to assist members in 
knowing when dividend rate and APY disclosures would be given by a 
credit union using the optional statement rule of Sec. 707.6(a). The 
dividend declaration date is important for purposes of Sec. 
707.4(a)(2)(ii), request disclosures, Sec. 707.4(b)(2), account opening 
disclosures, and Sec. 707.8(c)(2), advertising disclosures. The Board 
believes that this is critical information for dividend-bearing 
accounts, but that provision by an example (whether of the first 
dividend period of the year, or of any randomly chosen dividend period) 
is favorable to providing a list of such dates for the entire year or 
for a period of years (although these methods would also be 
permissible). As noted in the supplementary information to Sec. 
707.2(j), dividend declaration date, the dividend period and actual 
dividend distribution date may vary. Thus, it is possible for crediting 
periods and dividend periods not to coincide, though the Board believes 
that credit unions should make every effort to attempt to coordinate the 
two periods.

         (d) Minimum Balance Requirements (Sec. 707.4(b)(3)(i))

    (i) To open the account
    The minimum balance required to open this account is $--------.

or, for first share account at a credit union

    The minimum required to open this account is the purchase of a (par 
value of a share) share in the credit union.
    (ii) To avoid imposition of fees
    You must maintain a minimum daily balance of $-------- in your 
account to avoid a service fee. If, during any (time period), your 
account balance falls below the required

[[Page 477]]

minimum daily balance, your account will be subject to a service fee of 
$-------- for that (time period).

or

    You must maintain a minimum average daily balance of $-------- in 
your account to avoid a service fee. If, during any (time period), your 
average daily balance is below the required minimum, your account will 
be subject to a service fee of $-------- for that (time period).
    (iii) To obtain the annual percentage yield disclosed
    You must maintain a minimum daily balance of $-------- in your 
account each day to obtain the disclosed annual percentage yield.

    or

    You must maintain a minimum average daily balance of $-------- in 
your account to obtain the disclosed annual percentage yield.
    (iv) Absence of minimum balance requirements
    No minimum balance requirements apply to this account.
    (v) Par value
    The par value of a share in this credit union is $--------.

    Note: Where the words ``(time period)'' appear, time periods should 
be inserted to coincide with those specified in board resolutions of 
each credit union's board of directors. As the supplementary information 
to Sec. 707.4(b)(3)(i) explains, the par value of a share to establish 
membership is a critical disclosure to be made to potential members of 
credit unions. The par value disclosure is required by Sec. 
707.4(b)(3)(i) as being analogous to a minimum balance account opening 
requirement.

         (e) Balance Computation Method (Sec. 707.4(b)(3)(ii))

    (i) Daily Balance Method
    [Dividends/Interest] [are/is] calculated by the daily balance method 
which applies a daily periodic rate to the balance in the account each 
day.
    (ii) Average Daily Balance Method
    [Dividends/Interest] [are/is] calculated by the average daily 
balance method which applies a periodic rate to the average daily 
balance in the account for the period. The average daily balance is 
calculated by adding the balance in the account for each day of the 
period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the period.

    Note: Any explanation of balance computation method must contain 
enough information for members to grasp the means by which dividends or 
interest will be calculated on their accounts. Using a shorthand form, 
such as ``day in/day out'' for the daily balance method or ``average 
balance'' for the average daily balance method, without more 
information, is insufficient. In addition, any disclosure based on the 
equivalency of the two allowable methods, such as stating that the 
average daily balance method was the same as the daily balance method, 
is impermissible and misleading.

      (f) Accrual of Dividends/Interest on Noncash Deposits (Sec. 
                            704.4(b)(3)(iii))

    [Dividends/Interest] will begin to accrue on the business day you 
[place/deposit] noncash items (e.g. checks) to your account.

or
    [Dividends/Interest] will begin to accrue no later than the business 
day we receive provisional credit for the [placement/deposit] of noncash 
items (e.g. checks) to your account.

    Note: Accrual information is not included in the explanation of 
balance computation method required by Sec. 707.4(b)(4)(ii). In 
addition, the disclosures required by TISA do not affect the substantive 
requirements of the EFAA and Regulation CC.

    The EFAA and Regulation CC control, and any modifications to them 
should occasion credit unions to revisit this disclosure with a view to 
revising it to reflect current law.

                (g) Fees and Charges (Sec. 707.4(b)(4))

    The following fees and charges may be assessed against your account:

(Service/explanation)--$------.
(Service/explanation)--$------.

    Note: Fees and charges may be disclosed in an account disclosure, or 
separately in a Rate and Fee Schedule (see section B-11 of this 
appendix). In either event, the disclosure should also specify when the 
fee will be assessed by using phrases such as ``per item,'' ``per 
month,'' or ``per inquiry.''

             (h) Transaction Limitations (Sec. 707.4(b)(5))

    The minimum amount you may [withdraw/write a draft for] is $--------
    During any statement period, you may not make more than six 
withdrawals or transfers to another credit union account of yours or to 
a third party by means of a preauthorized or automatic transfer or 
telephonic order or instruction. No more than three of the six transfers 
may be made by check, draft, debit card, if applicable, or similar order 
to a third party. If you exceed the transfer limitations set forth above 
in any statement period, your account will be subject to [closure by the 
credit union/a fee of $--------.

    Note: This paragraph satisfies the requirements of Sec. 707.4(b)(6) 
with respect to Regulation D limitations on share accounts and money 
market accounts. These are some of the more common limitations 
applicable.

    The credit union reserves the right to require a member intending to 
make a withdrawal from any account (except a share draft account) to 
give written notice of such

[[Page 478]]

intent not less than seven days and up to 60 days before such 
withdrawal.

    Note: This disclosure is limited to federal credit unions with 
Bylaws containing this limitation. See Standard Federal Credit Union 
Bylaws, Art. III, section 5(a). Similar disclosures are required of any 
state-chartered credit unions having similar limitations in their 
bylaws, or under state law. This limitation does not directly relate to 
the ``number'' or ``amount'' of transactions, and accordingly, may not 
be necessary under Sec. 707.4(b)(5), but would, if applicable, be 
required by Sec. 707.3(b).

   (i) Disclosures Related to Term Share Accounts (Sec. 707.4(b)(6))

    (i) Time requirements
    Your account will mature on (date).

or

    Your account will mature after (time period).
    (ii) Early withdrawal penalties
    We [will/may] impose a penalty if you withdraw [any/all] of the 
[funds/principal] in your account before the maturity date. The penalty 
will equal [-------- [days'/weeks'/months'] [dividends/interest] on your 
account.

or
    We [will/may] impose a penalty of $---------- if you withdraw [any/
all] of the [funds/principal] before the maturity date.
    If you withdraw some of your funds before maturity, the [dividend/
interest] rate for the remaining funds in your account will be ------%, 
with an annual percentage yield of ------%.

    Note: In most cases, the dividend rate and annual percentage yield 
on the funds remaining in the account after early withdrawal are the 
same as before the withdrawal. Accordingly, the disclosure of dividend 
rate and annual percentage yield after withdrawal is required only if 
the dividend rate and APY will change.

    (iii) Withdrawal of Dividends/Interest Prior to Maturity
    The annual percentage yield is based on an assumption that 
[dividends/interest] will remain in the account until maturity. A 
withdrawal will reduce earnings.

    Note: This disclosure may be used if the credit union compounds 
dividends/interest and allows withdrawal of accrued dividends/interest 
before maturity. This disclosure alerts members that the annual 
percentage yield is based on an assumption that the dividends/interest 
remain on deposit until maturity.

    (iv) Renewal Policies

             1. Automatically Renewable Term Share Accounts

    Your term share account will automatically renew at maturity. You 
will have a grace period of -------- [calendar/business] days after the 
maturity date to withdraw the funds in the account without being charged 
an early withdrawal penalty.

 or

    Your term share account will automatically renew at maturity. There 
is no grace period following the maturity of this account.

           2. Non-Automatically Renewable Term Share Accounts

    This account will not renew automatically at maturity. If you do not 
renew the account, your account will [continue to earn/no longer earn] 
[dividends/interest] after the maturity date.

    Note: These disclosures should agree with the necessary pre-maturity 
notices for term share accounts in B-3 of this appendix.

    (v) Required dividend distribution.
    This account requires the distribution of dividends and does not 
allow dividends to remain in the account.

                     (j) Bonuses (Sec. 704.4(b)(7))

    You will [be paid/receive] [$----------/(description of item)] as a 
bonus [when you open the account/on (date)].
    You must maintain a minimum [daily balance/average daily balance] of 
$---------- to obtain the bonus.
    To earn the bonus, [$----------/your entire principal] must remain 
on deposit [for (time period)/until (date)].

    Note: These disclosures follow the requirements of Sec. 707.4(b)(7) 
and should be used as applicable. Further information may also be added, 
especially if it clarifies the conditions and timing of receiving the 
bonus, or better informs the member about the bonus.

         B-2 Model Clauses for Changes in Terms (Sec. 707.5(a))

    On (date), the (type of fee) will increase to $----------.
    On (date), the [dividend/interest] rate on your account will 
decrease to ------%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ------%.
    On (date), the [minimum daily balance/average daily balance] 
required to avoid imposition of a fee will increase to $----------.

    Note: These examples apply to the more common changes necessitating 
a change in terms notice. However, any change, amendment or modification 
reducing the APY or adversely affecting the members holding such 
accounts must be disclosed. For such changes not contemplated by the 
model

[[Page 479]]

clauses, the Board recommends the use of as simple language as possible 
to convey the change, along with cross-referencing to the particular 
sections or paragraph numbers of the account opening disclosures, when 
to do so
will assist members in reviewing and understanding the change.

   B-3 Model Clauses for Pre-Maturity Notices for Term Share Accounts 
                           (Sec. 707.5(b-c))

                            (a) Maturity Date

    Your term share account will mature on ----------.

                             (b) Nonrenewal

    Unless your term share account is renewed, it will not accrue 
further [dividends/interest] after the maturity date.

                          (c) Rate Information

    The [dividend/interest] rate and annual percentage yield that will 
apply to your term share account if it is renewed have not yet been 
determined. That information will be available on --------. After that 
date, you may call the credit union during regular business hours at 
(telephone number) to find out the [dividend/interest] rate and annual 
percentage yield (APY) that will apply to your term share account if it 
is renewed.

    Note: Pre-maturity notices should follow the requirements of Sec. 
707.5(b-d) as closely as possible. Care should be taken to explain any 
grace periods used. See discussion of use of alternative timing in 
supplementary information to Sec. 707.2(o) and Sec. 707.5(b-d).

    Note: This form is modeled on NCUA Form FCU 150, Application for 
Membership, as discussed in the Accounting Manual for FCUs, Sec. Sec. 
5030.1, 5150.3. It is noted that other information can also be requested 
on the signature card, as long as it is in accordance with federal and 
state laws. For example, information identifying the member, such as a 
state driver's license number, could be added. The types of accounts 
that the signature applies to could be specified. Furthermore, the Board 
notes that this card contains much identification information that may 
not be necessary for all credit unions; common sense should guide credit 
union boards of directors in designing their applications for 
membership/signature cards. However, the Board believes that the 
information solicited on this form is reasonable and prudent for many 
credit unions. Payable on death designations, joint account language 
required under state law, life savings beneficiary designations, and 
other like variations and designations may be added to the card if so 
desired. The proposed signature card/ application for membership form 
contained taxpayer certification language. One commenter noted that the 
IRS may always change its requirements in this area, which are beyond 
the authority of the Board. Therefore, the Board has deleted reference 
to the IRS taxpayer certification required by 26 USC 3406, but notes 
that such certification must be made in accordance with applicable law 
and IRS rules. The information may be included on the front and back of 
a standard size signature card, or on the front of a large size 
signature card. However, no account terms may be included on a signature 
card unless a copy of the signature card is provided to the member at 
the time of account opening. The Board recommends that credit unions 
refrain from this practice, and instead use standard account 
disclosures. One reason for this is that if laws, regulations or credit 
union policies change, discrepancies

[[Page 480]]

may result between them and the earlier signature card terms. Given the 
longevity of credit union membership, signature cards may well be in use 
for up to or over a century. In addition, as signature cards are 
relatively small, they probably will not contain enough space to make 
all desired and required disclosures. Fragmentation of terms, some on 
signature cards, some on separate disclosures, could easily lead to 
member confusion. As terms are usually construed against the drafter, 
credit unions should be very careful in their use of account terms and 
conditions varying from those provided as model clauses and sample forms 
in this appendix.

    Note: This form is modeled on NCUA Form FCU 107SCP, Credit Union 
Share Certificate, as discussed in the Accounting Manual for FCUs, 
Sec. Sec. 5030.1, 5150.6. It is simplified to reflect the term share 
(certificate) account agreement, the parties involved, the maturity term 
and the annual percentage yield and dividend rate. All other terms are 
incorporated by reference. This should allow the credit union maximum 
flexibility in fashioning certificate, and other term share account, 
products. If a credit union so desired, other terms and conditions could 
be incorporated into the term share certificate itself, as long as a 
copy is presented to the member at the account opening. Care should also 
be taken to ensure that the term share certificate format addresses any 
necessary state law concerns. As the FRB's Regulation D on reserve 
requirements permits all term share accounts to be represented by a 
transferable or nontransferable, or a negotiable or nonnegotiable, 
certificate, instrument, passbook, statement or otherwise, and still be 
considered a ``time deposit'', the Board has made no entry on this 
sample form regarding such terms, leaving the decision instead to each 
credit union's board of directors. 12 CFR 202.4(c)(2).

           B-6 Sample Form (Regular Share Account Disclosures)

                    Regular Share Account Disclosures

    1. Rate information. As of April 1, 1995, the dividend rate was 
5.00% and the annual percentage yield (APY) was 5.13% on your regular 
share account. In addition, the credit union estimates a prospective 
dividend rate of 5.25% and a prospective APY of 5.39% on your share 
account for this dividend period. The dividend rate and annual 
percentage yield may change every quarter as determined by the credit 
union board of directors.
    2. Compounding and crediting. Dividends will be compounded daily and 
will be credited quarterly. For this account type, the dividend period 
is quarterly, for example, the beginning date of the first dividend 
period of the calendar year is January 1 and the ending date of such 
dividend period is March 31. All other dividend periods follow this same 
pattern of dates. The dividend declaration date follows the ending date 
of a dividend period, and for the example is April 1. If you close your 
regular share account before dividends are credited, you will not 
receive accrued dividends.
    3. Minimum balance requirements. The minimum balance to open this 
account is the purchase of a $5 share in the Credit Union. You must 
maintain a minimum daily balance of $500 in your account to avoid a 
service fee. If, during any day during a quarter, your account balance 
falls below the required minimum daily balance, your account will be 
subject to a service fee of $5 for that quarter.
    4. Balance computation method. Dividends are calculated by the daily 
balance method which applies a daily periodic rate to the principal in 
your account each day.
    5. Accrual of dividends. Dividends will begin to accrue on the 
business day you deposit noncash items (e.g., checks) to your account.

[[Page 481]]

    6. Fees and charges. The following fees and charges may be assessed 
against your account.
    a. Statement copies--$5.00 per statement.
    b. Account inquiries--$3.00 per inquiry.
    c. Dormant account fee--$10.00 per month.
    d. Wire transfers--$8.00 per transfer.
    e. Minimum balance service fee--$5.00 per quarter.
    f. Share transfer--$1.00 per transfer.
    g. Excessive share withdrawals $1.00 per item.
    7. Transaction limitations. During any statement period, you may not 
make more than six withdrawals or transfers to another credit union 
account of yours or to a third party by means of a preauthorized or 
automatic transfer or telephonic order or instruction. No more than 
three of the six transfers may be made by check, draft, debit card, if 
applicable, or similar order to a third party. If you exceed the 
transfer limitations set forth above in any statement period, your 
account will be subject to closure by the credit union or to a fee of 
$1.00 per item.
    8. Nature of dividends. Dividends are paid from current income and 
available earnings, after required transfers to reserves at the end of a 
dividend period.
    9. Bylaw Requirements. A member who fails to complete payment of one 
share within ---------- of his admission to membership, or within ------
---- from the increase in the par value in shares, or a member who 
reduces his share balance below the par value of one share and does not 
increase the balance to at least the par value of one share within ----
------ of the reduction may be terminated from membership at the end of 
a dividend period. [All blanks should be filled with time chosen by 
credit union board of directors.] Shares may be transferred only from 
one member to another, by written instrument in such form as the Credit 
Union may prescribe. The Credit Union reserves the right, at any time, 
to require members to give, in writing, not more than 60 days notice of 
intention to withdraw the whole or any part of the amounts so paid in by 
them. No member may withdraw shareholdings that are pledged as required 
on security on loans without the written approval of the credit 
committee or a loan officer, except to the extent that such shares 
exceed the member's total primary and contingent liability to the Credit 
Union. No member may withdraw any shareholdings below the amount of his/
her primary or contingent liability to the Credit Union if he/she is 
delinquent as a borrower, or if borrowers for whom he/she is comaker, 
endorser, or guarantor are delinquent, without the written approval of 
the credit committee or loan officer.
    10. Par value of shares; Dividend period. The par value of a regular 
share in this Credit Union is $5. The dividend period of the Credit 
Union is quarterly.
    11. National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Member accounts in 
this Credit Union are federally insured by the National Credit Union 
Share Insurance Fund.
    12. Other Terms and Conditions. [In this item, which may be titled 
or subdivided in any manner by each credit union, NCUA suggests that the 
following issues be covered or handled: Statutory lien or setoff; 
expenses (garnishments and bankruptcy orders and holds on account); 
joint ownership accounts; trust accounts; payable-on-death accounts; 
retirement accounts; Uniform Transfer to Minor Act accounts; sole 
proprietorship accounts; escrow and custodial accounts; corporation 
accounts; not-for-profit corporation accounts; voluntary association 
accounts; partnership accounts; public unit accounts; powers of attorney 
(guardianship orders); tax disclosures and certifications; Uniform 
Commercial Code variances; amendments; reliance on signature card; 
change of address; incorporations of other documents by reference, such 
as expedited funds availability policies, service charges schedules or 
electronic banking disclosures; ability to suspend services; and 
operational matters (stop payment orders--verbal and written, 
satisfactory identification, refusal of deposits not in proper form, 
wire transfers, stale check deposits, availability of periodic 
statements or passbook feature.)]

    Note: This form is modeled on the share account disclosures in the 
Accounting Manual for FCUs, Sec. 5150.7. The disclosures are for a 
variable-rate, daily balance method dividend calculation regular share 
account in an FCU with a $500 minimum balance to avoid service fees. For 
the example, the account was opened on May 1, 1995. Other terms are 
self-explanatory. The dividend rate paid and annual percentage yield 
disclosures will reflect the prospective dividend rate for a given 
dividend period. Item nos. 1-8 reflect standard TISA and part 707 
disclosures discussed in sections B-1 through B-3 of this appendix. Note 
that if the credit union limits the maximum amount of shares which may 
be held by one member under NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. III, section 
2, that this should be stated in item no. 7, transaction limitations. 
Item no. 9 reflects various terms provided in Art. III, sections 3-6 of 
the NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws. Item no. 10 reflects the par value amount 
of regular shares in a federal credit union, pursuant to section 117 of 
the FCU Act, 12 U.S.C. 117. It also states the dividend period of the 
credit union, which is set by the board of directors. Item no. 11 
addresses the requirements of 12 CFR part 740. Nonfederally insured 
credit unions (NICUs) would be expected to disclose information required 
by section 151 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement 
Act of 1991. 12 USC 1831t. By December 19, 1992, all

[[Page 482]]

NICUs were required to include conspicuously on all periodic statements 
of account, signature cards, passbooks, share certificates and other 
similar instruments of deposit and in all advertising a notice that the 
credit union is not federally insured. Additional disclosures will be 
required of NICUs by June 19, 1994. Item no. 12 is inserted to ensure 
that credit unions add other account terms and conditions not covered by 
the proposed regulation. These sorts of terms are contemplated by 
proposed Sec. 707.3(b), requiring that the disclosures reflect the 
terms of the legal obligation between the member and the credit union. 
This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but to give a general idea of 
other topics often covered in share account contracts. Item no. 12 is 
not expressly required by either TISA or part 707, but any of these 
terms that are disclosed must be accurate and not misleading. Also the 
Board strongly recommends that such terms are included in account 
opening disclosures to inform the membership and to clearly set forth 
the legal relationship between the members and their credit union.

            B-7 Sample Form (Share Draft Account Disclosures)

                     Share Draft Account Disclosures

    1. Rate information. As of January 1, 1995, the dividend rate was 
3.00% and the annual percentage yield (APY) was 3.04% on your share 
account. In addition, the prospective dividend rate on your account is 
3.15% with a prospective annual percentage yield (APY) of 3.20% for the 
current dividend period. The dividend rate and APY may change every 
dividend period as determined by the credit union board of directors.
    2. Compounding and crediting. Dividends will be compounded monthly 
and will be credited monthly. For this account type, the dividend period 
is monthly, for example, the beginning date of the first dividend period 
of the calendar year is January 1 and the ending date of such dividend 
period is January 31. All other dividend periods follow this same 
pattern of dates. The dividend declaration date follows the ending date 
of a dividend period, and for the example above is February 1. If you 
close your share draft account before dividends are credited, you will 
not receive accrued dividends.
    3. No Minimum balance requirements apply to this account.
    4. Balance computation method. Dividends are calculated by the 
average daily balance method which applies a periodic rate to the 
average daily balance in the account for the period. The average daily 
balance is calculated by adding the balance in the account for each day 
of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the 
period.
    5. Accrual of dividends. Dividends will begin to accrue no later 
than the business day we receive provisional credit for the placement of 
noncash items (e.g. checks) to your account.
    6. Fees and charges. The following fees and charges may be assessed 
against your account.
    a. Statement copies--$5.00 per statement.
    b. Account inquiries--$3.00 per inquiry.
    c. Dormant account fee--$10.00 per month.
    d. Wire transfers--$8.00 per transfer.
    e. Overdrafts/Returned Items--$5.00 per draft.
    f. Share transfer--$1.00 per transfer.
    g. Excessive share withdrawals--$1.00 per item.
    h. Certified checks--$5.00 per check.
    i. Stop Payment Order--$5.00 per order.
    j. Check Printing Fee--$12.00 per 200 checks (varies depending on 
style of check ordered).
    7. No transaction limitations apply to this account.
    8. Nature of dividends. Dividends are paid from current income and 
available earnings, after required transfers to reserves at the end of a 
dividend period.
    9. Bylaw Requirements. A member who fails to complete payment of one 
share within ---------- of his admission to membership, or within ------
---- from the increase in the par value in shares, or a member who 
reduces his share balance below the par value of one share and does not 
increase the balance to at least the par value of one share within ----
------ of the reduction may be terminated from membership at the end of 
a dividend period. [All blanks should be filled with time chosen by 
credit union board of directors.] Shares may be transferred only from 
one member to another, by written instrument in such form as the Credit 
Union may prescribe. The Credit Union reserves the right, at any time, 
to require members to give, in writing, not more than 60 days notice of 
intention to withdraw the whole or any part of the amounts so paid in by 
them. Shares paid in under an accumulated payroll deduction plan may not 
be withdrawn until credited to a member's account. No member may 
withdraw shareholdings that are pledged as required on security on loans 
without the written approval of the credit committee or a loan officer, 
except to the extent that such shares exceed the member's total primary 
and contingent liability to the Credit Union. No member may withdraw any 
shareholdings below the amount of his/her primary or contingent 
liability to the Credit Union if he/she is delinquent as a borrower, or 
if borrowers for whom he/she is comaker, endorser, or guarantor are 
delinquent, without the written approval of the credit committee or loan 
officer.
    10. Par value of shares; Dividend period. The par value of a regular 
share in this Credit Union is $5. The dividend period of the Credit 
Union is monthly, beginning on the first of a

[[Page 483]]

month and ending on the last day of the month.
    11. National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Member accounts in 
this Credit Union are federally insured by the National Credit Union 
Share Insurance Fund.
    12. Other Terms and Conditions. [See section B-6, item 12, of this 
appendix].

    Note: This form is modeled on the share account disclosures in the 
Accounting Manual for FCUs, Sec. 5150.7. The disclosures are for a 
variable-rate, average daily balance method dividend calculation share 
draft account in an FCU with no minimum balance requirement. For 
purposes of this example, the account was opened on January 15, 1995. 
The Credit Union has monthly dividend periods. Other terms are self-
explanatory. The dividend rate paid and annual percentage yield 
disclosures will reflect the prospective dividend rate for a given 
dividend period. The disclosures are very similar to the ones in section 
B-6 of appendix B, except for the rollback and par value disclosures, 
which have been removed from the final rule and appendices.

        B-8 Sample Form (Money Market Share Account Disclosures)

                 Money Market Share Account Disclosures

    1. Rate information. As of January 1, 1995, if your average daily 
balance was $500 or more, the dividend rate paid on the entire balance 
in your account was 4.75%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 
4.85%. If your average daily balance is $500 or more, a prospective 
dividend rate of 4.95% will be paid on the entire balance in your 
account with a prospective APY of 5.00% for this dividend period on your 
account. The dividend rate and APY may change every dividend period as 
determined by the credit union board of directors.
    2. Compounding and crediting. Dividends will be compounded monthly 
and will be credited quarterly. If you close your share money market 
account before dividends are credited, you will not receive accrued 
dividends.
    3. Minimum balance requirements. The minimum balance required to 
open this account is $500. You must maintain a minimum daily balance of 
$500 in your account to avoid a service fee. If, during any (time 
period), your account falls below the required minimum daily balance, 
your account will be subject to a service fee of $5 for that (time 
period).
    4. Balance computation method. Dividends are calculated by the 
average daily balance method which applies a periodic rate to the 
average daily balance in your account for the period. The average daily 
balance is calculated by adding the principal in the account for each 
day of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the 
period.
    5. Accrual of dividends. Dividends will begin to accrue on the 
business day you deposit noncash items (e.g., checks) to your account.
    6. Fees and charges. The following fees and charges may be assessed 
against your account.
    a. Statement copies--$5.00 per statement.
    b. Account inquiries--$3.00 per inquiry.
    c. Dormant account fee--$10.00 per month.
    d. Wire transfers--$8.00 per transfer.
    e. Minimum balance service fee--$5.00 per (time period).
    f. Share transfer--$1.00 per transfer.
    g. Excessive share withdrawals--$1.00 per item.
    h. Certified checks--$5.00 per check.
    i. Stop Payment Order--$5.00 per order.
    j. Check Printing Fee--$12.00 per 200 checks (varies depending on 
style of check ordered).
    7. Transaction limitations. During any statement period, you may not 
make more than six withdrawals or transfers to another credit union 
account of yours or to a third party by means of a preauthorized or 
automatic transfer or telephonic order or instruction. No more than 
three of the six transfers may be made by check, draft, debit card, if 
applicable, or similar order to a third party. If you exceed the 
transfer limitations set forth above in any statement period, your 
account will be subject to closure by the credit union or to a fee of 
$1.00 per item.
    8. Nature of dividends. Dividends are paid from current income and 
available earnings, after required transfers to reserves at the end of a 
dividend period.
    9. Bylaw Requirements. [This section should reflect any requirements 
concerning share accounts in the FISCU's bylaws or charter.]
    10. Par value of shares; Dividend period. The par value of a regular 
share in this Credit Union is $50. The dividend period of the Credit 
Union is monthly, beginning on the first of a month and ending on the 
last day of the month.
    11. National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Member accounts in 
this Credit Union are federally insured by the National Credit Union 
Share Insurance Fund.
    12. Other Terms and Conditions. [See section B-6, item 12, of this 
appendix.]

    Note: This form is modeled on the share account disclosures in the 
Accounting Manual for FCUs, Sec. 5150.7 and on the share draft account 
disclosures in section B-7 of this appendix. The disclosures are for a 
variable-rate, tiered-rate (method A, option 1), average daily balance 
method dividend calculation, money market share account in a FISCU with 
a $500 minimum balance to open the account and to avoid service fees. 
For purposes of this example, the account was opened on January 29, 
1995. Other terms are self-explanatory. The dividend rate paid and

[[Page 484]]

annual percentage yield disclosures will reflect the prospective 
dividend rate for a given dividend period. Note that the contents of 
Item 9, Bylaw requirements, must be tailored to the specific bylaws of a 
FISCU or NICU. Also note the high par value amount in Item 10.

     B-9 Sample Form (Term Share (Certificate) Account Disclosures)

              Term Share (Certificate) Account Disclosures

    1. Rate information. [Repeat rates disclosed on face of term share 
certificate, see Sec. B-5, Sample Form (Term Share (Certificate) 
Account)].
    2. Compounding and crediting. Dividends will be compounded monthly 
and will be credited annually. If you close your certificate account 
before dividends are credited, you will not receive accrued dividends.
    3. Minimum balance requirements. The minium balance required to open 
this account is $500.
    4. Balance computation method. Dividends are calculated by the daily 
balance method, which applies a daily periodic rate to the principal in 
your account each day.
    5. Accrual of dividends. Dividends will begin to accrue on the 
business day you deposit noncash items (e.g., checks) to your account.
    6. Fees and charges. The following fees and charges may be assessed 
against your account.
    a. Statement copies--$5.00 per statement.
    b. Account inquiries--$3.00 per inquiry.
    c. Share transfer--$1.00 per transfer.
    7. Transaction limitations. After the account is opened, you may not 
make deposits into the account until the maturity date stated on the 
certificate.
    8. Maturity date. Your account will mature on January 1, 1996.
    9. Early withdrawal penalties. We may impose a penalty if you 
withdraw any of the funds before the maturity date. The penalty will 
equal three months' dividends on your deposit.
    10. Renewal policies. Your certificate account will automatically 
renew at maturity. You will have a grace period of 10 business days 
after the maturity date to withdraw the funds in the account without 
being charged an early withdrawal penalty.
    11. Bonus. You will receive a new (insert brand name) toaster-oven 
as a bonus when you open the account after December 31, 1994, and before 
June 30, 1995. You must maintain your entire principal on deposit until 
the maturity date of your certificate account to obtain the bonus.
    12. [Reserved]
    13. Bylaw Requirements. [This section should reflect any 
requirements concerning share accounts in the FISCU's bylaws or 
charter.]
    14. Par value of shares; Dividend period. The par value of a regular 
share in this Credit Union is $25. The dividend period of the Credit 
Union on this type of account is annual, beginning on the date the 
account is opened, and ending on the stated maturity date, unless 
renewed.
    15. National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Member accounts in 
this Credit Union are federally insured by the National Credit Union 
Share Insurance Fund.
    16. Other Terms and Conditions. [See section B-6, item 12, of this 
appendix.]

    Note: Even though this disclosure if for an account at a FISCU, this 
form is modeled on the share account disclosures in the Accounting 
Manual for FCUs, Sec. 5150.7 and upon the regular share account 
disclosures in section B-6 of this appendix. The disclosures are for a 
fixed-rate, daily balance method dividend calculation, automatically 
renewing term share certificate account in a FISCU with a $500 minimum 
balance to open the account and a ten day grace period. For the example, 
the account is opened on January 1, 1995 and matures on January 1, 1996. 
Other terms are self-explanatory. The dividend rate paid and annual 
percentage yield disclosures reflect the contracted, prospective 
dividend rate for a given dividend period. Note the special disclosures 
for term share certificate accounts, items nos. 8-10. Note also the 
bonus disclosure, item no. 11.

    Note: This form is modeled on the share draft statement of account, 
Form FCU 107G-SD, in the Accounting Manual for FCUs, Sec. 5150.4. All 
information is self-explanatory. Codes of transactions are not required, 
but are a common credit union practice. The information regarding fees 
could also be included on the line of the periodic statement showing 
when the fees were debited from the account. Alternatively, a credit 
union could show all fees debited against the account for the statement 
period in a special area of the periodic statement. Clarity to the 
member of the required information--annual percentage yield earned; 
amount of dividends; fees imposed and length of period--is the important 
goal. An additional disclosure regarding the dollar value of any 
extraordinary dividends earned must be added to those statements showing 
the payment of such extraordinary dividends to the member.

       Sec. Appendix C to Part 707--Official Staff Interpretations

                              Introduction

    1. Official status. This commentary is the means by which the staff 
of the Office of General Counsel of the National Credit Union 
Administration issues official staff interpretations of Part 707 of the 
NCUA Rules and Regulations. Good faith compliance with this commentary 
affords protection from liability under section 271(f) of the Truth in 
Savings Act (TISA), 12 U.S.C. 4311.

  Section 707.1--Authority, Purpose, Coverage, and Effect on State Laws

                              (c) Coverage

    1. Foreign applicability. Part 707 applies to all credit unions that 
offer share and deposit accounts to residents (including resident 
aliens) of any state as defined in Sec. 707.2(v) and that offer 
accounts insurable by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund 
(NCUSIF) whether or not such accounts are insured by the NCUSIF. 
Corporate credit unions designated as such by NCUA under 12 CFR 704.2 
(definition of ``corporate credit union'') are exempt from part 707.
    2. Persons who advertise accounts. Persons who advertise accounts 
are subject to the advertising rules. This includes agent and agented 
accounts, such as a member who subdivides interests in a jumbo term 
share certificate account for sale to other parties or among members who 
form a certificate account investment club. For example, if an agent 
places an advertisement that offers members an interest in an account at 
a credit union, the advertising rules apply to the advertisement, 
whether the account is held by the agent or directly by the member.
    3. Nonautomated credit unions. Nonautomated credit unions with an 
asset size of $2 million or less, after subtracting any nonmember 
deposits, are exempt from TISA and part 707. NCUA defines a 
``nonautomated credit union'' as a credit union without sufficient data 
processing capability and capacity to establish, operate and maintain a 
share and loan software system to timely and accurately process all 
account transactions of all members. The nonautomated credit union 
exemption is available to all credit unions meeting the asset size and 
automation standards of this comment, including newly chartered credit 
unions. If any of the credit unions eligible for this exemption grow to 
have more than $2 million in assets as of December 31 of any year, the 
NCUA Board will require such credit unions to comply with TISA and part 
707 on January 1 of one year after such credit union loses its exemption 
eligibility. Similarly, if a credit union becomes sufficiently automated 
to operate a complete share and loan system, such credit union will be 
entitled to the same compliance phase-in period.

                        (d) Effect on State Laws

    1. Preemption of state laws/Inconsistent requirements. State law 
requirements that are inconsistent with the requirements of TISA and 
part 707 are preempted to the extent of the inconsistency. A state law 
is inconsistent if it requires a credit union to make disclosures or 
take actions that contradict the requirements of the federal law. A 
state law is also contradictory if it requires the use of the same term 
to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the federal 
law, requires the use of a term different from that required in the 
federal law to describe the same item, or permits a method of 
calculating dividends or interest on an account different from that 
required in the federal law.
    2. Preemption determinations. A credit union, state, or other 
interested party may request the Board to determine whether a state law 
requirement is inconsistent with the federal requirements. A request for 
a determination should be addressed to NCUA's Office of General Counsel, 
1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. Written preemption requests 
should cite (or include a copy of) the allegedly inconsistent state law, 
demonstrate the inconsistency with TISA and part 707 and the burden on 
credit unions, and formally request a preemption determination. The 
Office of General Counsel may provide other interested parties, 
particularly affected states, an informal opportunity to comment on any 
request for a preemption determination, unless it finds that such notice 
and opportunity for comment would be impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest. NCUA will publicize any preemption 
determinations using any means readily at its disposal.
    3. Effect of preemption determinations. After the Board, through its 
Office of General Counsel, determines that a state law is inconsistent, 
a credit union may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or 
take actions relying on the inconsistent law.

[[Page 487]]

    4. Reversal of determination. The Board reserves the right to 
reverse a determination for any reason bearing on the coverage or effect 
of state or federal law.

                       Section 707.2--Definitions

                               (a) Account

    1. Covered accounts. Examples of accounts subject to the regulation 
are:
    i. Dividend-bearing and interest-bearing accounts.
    ii. Non-dividend-bearing and non-interest-bearing accounts.
    iii. Accounts opened as a condition of obtaining a credit card.
    iv. Escrow accounts with a consumer purpose, such as an account 
established by a member to escrow rental payments, pending resolution of 
a dispute with the member's landlord.
    v. Accounts held by a parent or custodian for a minor under a 
state's Uniform Gift to Minors Act (or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act).
    vi. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee 
pension (SEP) accounts.
    vii. Payable-on-Death (POD) or ``Totten trust'' accounts.
    2. Other accounts. Examples of accounts not subject to the 
regulation are:
    i. Mortgage escrow accounts for collecting taxes and property 
insurance premiums.
    ii. Accounts established to make periodic disbursements on 
construction loans.
    iii. Trust accounts opened by a trustee pursuant to a formal written 
trust agreement (not merely declarations of trust on a signature card 
such as a ``Totten trust,'' or an IRA or SEP account).
    iv. Accounts opened by an executor in the name of decedent's estate.
    v. Accounts of individuals operating businesses as sole proprietors.
    vi. Certificates of indebtedness. Some credit unions borrow funds 
from their members through a certificate of indebtedness that sets forth 
the terms and conditions of the repayment of the borrowing, such as 
federal credit unions do through 12 CFR 701.38. Such an account does not 
represent an account in a credit union and is not covered by part 707.
    vii. Unincorporated nonbusiness association accounts.
    3. Other investments. The term ``account'' does not apply to these 
products. Examples of products not covered are:
    i. Government securities.
    ii. Mutual funds.
    iii. Annuities.
    iv. Securities or obligations of a credit union.
    v. Contractual arrangements such as repurchase agreements, interest 
rate swaps, and bankers acceptances.
    vi. Purchases of U.S. Savings Bonds through a credit union.
    vii. Services offered through a group purchasing plan or a credit 
union service organization (CUSO).
    4. Options. All dividend-bearing and interest-bearing accounts are 
either fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts.
    5. Use of synonyms. Generally, it is not the purpose of part 707 to 
prohibit specific descriptive terms for accounts. For example, credit 
unions can use adjectives and trade names to describe accounts such as 
``Best Share Draft Account,'' or ``Ultra Money Market Share Account.'' 
Synonyms for share, share draft, money market share, and term share 
accounts may be used to describe various types of credit union share and 
deposit accounts as long as the synonym is accurate and not misleading 
and, for account disclosures, is used in conjunction with the correct 
legal term. For example, the following synonyms may be used:
    i. The term ``checking account'' may be used to describe share draft 
accounts.
    ii. The term ``money market account'' may be used to describe money 
market share accounts.
    iii. The term ``savings account'' may be used to describe regular 
share and share accounts.
    iv. The terms ``share certificate,'' ``certificate account,'' or 
``certificate'' may be used to describe share certificates and other 
dividend-bearing term share accounts.
    v. However, under no circumstances may a credit union describe a 
share account as a deposit account, or vice versa. For example, the term 
``certificate of deposit'' or ``CD'' may not be used to describe share 
certificates and other dividend-bearing term share accounts. Similarly, 
the terms ``time account'' (used in Regulation DD, 12 CFR 230.2(u)) and 
``time deposit'' (used in Regulation D, 12 CFR 204.2(c)) may not be used 
to describe term share accounts.

                            (b) Advertisement

    1. Covered messages. Advertisements include commercial messages in 
visual, oral, or print media that invite, offer, or otherwise announce 
generally to members and potential members the availability of member 
accounts such as:
    i. Telephone solicitations.
    ii. Messages on automated teller machine (ATM) screens (including 
any printout).
    iii. Messages on a computer screen in a credit union's lobby 
(including any printout) other than a screen viewed solely by the credit 
union's employee.
    iv. Messages in a newspaper, magazine, or promotional flyer or on 
radio or television.
    v. Messages promoting an account that are provided along with 
information about the member's existing account at a credit union and 
that promote another account at the

[[Page 488]]

credit union (such as account promotional messages on the periodic 
statement).
    2. Other messages. Examples of messages that are not advertisements 
are:
    i. Rate sheets published in newspapers, periodicals, or trade 
journals (unless the credit union or share and deposit broker that 
offers accounts at the credit union pays a fee to have the information 
included or otherwise controls publication).
    ii. Telephone conversations initiated by a member or potential 
member about an account.
    iii. An in-person discussion with a member about the terms for a 
specific account.
    iv. For purposes of Sec. 707.8(b) of this part through Sec. 
707.8(e) of this part, information given to members about existing 
accounts, such as current rates recorded on a voice-response machine or 
notices for automatically renewable time account sent before renewal.
    v. Information about a particular transaction in an existing 
account.
    vi. Disclosures required by Federal or other applicable law.
    vii. A share account agreement.

                      (c) Annual Percentage Yield.

    1. General. The annual percentage yield (APY) is required for 
disclosures for new accounts, oral responses to inquiries about rates; 
disclosures provided upon request; initial disclosures (if the credit 
union chooses to provide full disclosures instead of the abbreviated 
notice); notices prior to the renewal of a term share account, if known 
at the time the notice is sent, and in advertising. The annual 
percentage yield shows the total amount of dividends for a 365 day 
period (or a 366 day period for a leap year) on an assumed principal 
amount based on the dividend rate and frequency of compounding as a 
percentage of the assumed principal (for accounts such as share or share 
draft accounts) or for the total amount of dividends over the term of 
the account for term share accounts. The annual percentage yield assumes 
the principal amount remains in the account for 365 days (366 days for 
leap year) or for the term of the account.
    2. How Annual Percentage Yield Differs from Annual Percentage Yield 
Earned. The annual percentage yield (APY) differs from the annual 
percentage yield earned (APYE). The annual percentage yield earned is 
required for periodic statements only. The annual percentage yield 
earned shows the total amount of dividends earned for the dividend or 
statement period as a percent of the actual average daily balance in the 
member's account. Unlike the annual percentage yield, the annual 
percentage yield earned is affected by additions and withdrawals during 
the period. The annual percentage yield and the annual percentage yield 
earned must be calculated according to the formulas provided in Appendix 
A to this rule.

                    (d) Average Daily Balance Method

    1. General. One of the two required methods (the daily balance is 
the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends must be 
accrued and paid. The average daily balance method requires the 
application of a periodic rate to the average daily balance in the 
account for the average daily balance calculation period. The average 
daily balance is determined by adding the full amount of principal in 
the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the 
number of days in the period.

                               (e) Board.

    1. General. The NCUA Board.

                                (f) Bonus

    1. General. Bonuses include items of value offered as incentives to 
members, such as an offer to pay the final installment deposit for a 
holiday club account if the final installment is over $10. Bonuses do 
not include the payment of dividends (including extraordinary 
dividends), the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of 
expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, or other consideration 
aggregating $10 or less per year.
    2. Examples. The following are examples of bonuses.
    i. A credit union offers $25 to potential members for becoming a 
member and opening an account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, 
or direct deposit.
    ii. A credit union offers $25 to a member with only a regular share 
account to open a share draft account. The $25 could be provided by 
check, cash, or direct deposit.
    iii. A credit union offers a portable radio with a value of $20 to 
members and potential members for opening a share draft account.
    iv. A credit union pays the final installment deposit for a holiday 
club account if over $10.
    3. Examples not comprising bonuses. The following are examples of 
items that are not bonuses:
    i. Discount coupons distributed by credit unions for use at 
restaurants or stores.
    ii. A credit union offers $20 to any member if the member is 
responsible for encouraging a potential member to open an account. The 
$20 is not a bonus because the $20 is not paid to the individual opening 
the account. Any item, including cash, given or offered to a third party 
(that is not a joint member or joint owner in an account being opened) 
in exchange for a member or potential member opening (or a member 
renewing or adding to) an account is not a bonus.
    iii. A credit union offers $25 to a member if the member can locate 
his name in the body of a newsletter.
    iv. Life savings benefits. Many credit unions offer life savings 
benefits to beneficiaries of deceased members. Because the

[[Page 489]]

benefit accrues to a third party, such life savings plans offered are 
not bonuses.
    v. A credit union offers to pay annual membership dues in a 
benevolent organization for a class of members.
    4. De minimis rule. Items with a de minimis value of $10 or less are 
not bonuses. Credit unions may rely on the valuation standard used by 
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine if the value of the item 
is de minimis. Items required to be reported by the credit union under 
IRS rules are bonuses under this regulation. Examples of items of de 
minimis values are:
    i. Disability insurance premiums on a share account valued at an 
amount of $10 or less per year.
    ii. Coffee mugs, T-shirts or other merchandise with a market value 
of $10 or less per year.
    5. Aggregation. In determining if an item valued at $10 or less is a 
bonus, credit unions must aggregate per account per calendar year items 
that may be given to members. In making this determination, credit 
unions aggregate per account only the market value of items that may be 
given for a specific promotion. To illustrate, assume a credit union 
offers in January to give members an item valued at $7 for each calendar 
quarter during the year that the average account balance in a share 
draft account exceeds $10,000. The bonus rules are triggered, since 
members are eligible under the promotion to receive up to $28 during the 
year. However, the bonus rules are not triggered if an item valued at $7 
is offered to members opening a share draft account during the month of 
January, even though in November the credit union introduces a new 
promotion that includes, for example, an offer to existing share draft 
accountholders for an item valued at $8 for maintaining an average 
balance of $5,000 for the month.
    6. Waiver or reduction of a fee or absorption of expenses. Bonuses 
do not include value received by members through the waiver or reduction 
of fees for credit union-related services (even if the fees waived 
exceed $10), such as the following:
    i. Waiving a safe deposit box rental fee for one year for members 
who open a new account.
    ii. Waiving fees for travelers checks for members, and waiving check 
and share draft printing fees.
    iii. Nondiscriminatorily waiving all fees for a particular class of 
members, such as seniors or minors.
    iv. Discounts on interest rates charged for loans at the credit 
union.
    v. Rebates of loan interest already paid by a member.
    vi. Discounts on application fees charged for loans at the credit 
union.
    vii. Packaged, linked, or tied-account services.
    7. Non-dividend membership benefits. Such benefits are not bonuses 
because they are sporadic in nature, often difficult to value, and 
providing non-dividend membership benefits is a long-standing unique 
credit union practice. (See commentary to Sec. 707.2(r) for examples of 
such benefits.)

                            (g) Credit Union

    1. General. Includes credit unions in the United States, Puerto 
Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and U.S. territories. Applies to credit 
unions whether or not the accounts in the credit union are federally, 
state, privately insured, or uninsured.

                        (h) Daily Balance Method

    1. General. One of the two required methods (the average daily 
balance is the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends 
must be accrued and paid. The daily balance method requires the 
application of a daily periodic rate to the full amount of principal in 
the account each day.

                       (i) Dividend and Dividends

    1. General. Member savings placed in share accounts are equity 
investments, and the returns earned on these accounts are dividends. 
Federal credit unions may only offer dividend-bearing and non-dividend-
bearing share accounts. State-chartered credit unions may offer both 
share and deposit accounts if permitted by state law. State law, 
including without limitation regulations and official interpretations, 
will determine if returns earned in accounts in state-chartered credit 
unions are dividends. Dividends exclude the payment of a bonus or other 
consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver or 
reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership 
benefits and extraordinary dividends. Dividend-bearing accounts must be 
either fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts.
    2. Procedure. Credit unions must follow appropriate law (state law 
for state-chartered credit unions and federal law for federal credit 
unions) in determining dividend policies and declaring dividends. 
Generally, dividends may be viewed as a portion of the available account 
and undivided earnings of the credit union which is set apart, after 
required transfer to reserves, by valid act of the board of directors, 
for distribution among the members. As a matter of legal procedure, 
members are usually not entitled to dividends until the following steps 
are completed: (1) The board of the credit union develops a 
nondiscriminatory dividend policy, by establishing dividend periods, 
dividend credit determination dates dividend distribution dates, any 
associated penalties (if applicable), and the method of dividend 
computation for each type of share account;

[[Page 490]]

(2) the provisions for required transfers to reserves are made; (3) 
sufficient and available prior and/or current earnings are available at 
the end of the dividend period; (4) the board formally makes a dividend 
declaration in accordance with the credit union's dividend policy; and 
(5) dividends must be paid to members by a credit to the appropriate 
share account, payment by check or share draft, or by a combination of 
the two methods.
    3. When available. Credit unions must follow the law of their 
primary chartering authority to determine when dividends are available. 
Generally, it is the declaration of the dividend itself which creates 
the dividend and the member has no right to receive a dividend until it 
is so declared. The decision of when to declare dividends lies within 
the official discretion of each credit union's board of directors and 
cannot be abrogated by contract. An agreement to pay dividends on a 
share account is generally interpreted not as an obligation to pay the 
stipulated dividends absolutely and unconditionally, but as an 
undertaking to pay them out of the earnings when sufficiently 
accumulated from which dividends in general are properly payable. 
Generally, ``prospective rates'' are rates set in good faith in advance 
of the close of a dividend period, that may be altered if sufficient 
funds are not available, or in the event of a superseding event, such as 
a strike, plant closure, significant fluctuation in market rates and/or 
a significant change in financial structure, natural disaster or 
emergency that alters the assumptions under which the ``prospective 
rates'' were made. It is the intent of TISA that all disclosure be 
accurate when made, and credit unions are urged to make every effort to 
ratify disclosed ``prospective rates.'' ``Prospective rates'' may also 
be referred to as ``projected rates'' or similar wording, but not as 
``estimated rates.'' (See comment 3(b)-2, prohibiting use of estimates).
    4. Sample dividend resolutions. (i) The following resolution may be 
used where the dividend rates are set after the close of a dividend 
period.

    Resolution of Board of Directors for the Declaration of Dividends

    A. I, ----------------, certify that I am Secretary of ------------
---- Credit Union Board of Directors, and that the following is a 
correct copy of the resolution for declaring dividend adopted by the --
-------------- Credit Union at a meeting of the Board of Directors duly 
and properly held on ------------------, 19----. This resolution appears 
in the minutes of this meeting and has not been rescinded or modified.
    B. Resolved, that
    (1) The Board of Directors has developed a nondiscriminatory 
dividend policy, by establishing dividend periods, dividend credit 
determination dates, dividend distribution dates, any associated 
penalties (if applicable), and the method of dividend computation for 
each type of share account;
    (2) The required transfers to reserves have been made; and
    (3) Sufficient and available prior and/or current earnings are 
available at the end of this dividend period.
    C. Resolved, further, that the Board of Directors now formally makes 
a dividend declaration in accordance with the Credit Union's dividend 
policy and authorizes that on ----------------, 19----, dividends must 
be paid to members by a credit to the appropriate share account, payment 
by share draft or by a combination of the two methods.
    D. I further certify that the Board of Directors of this Credit 
Union has, and the time of adoption of this resolution had, full power 
and lawful authority to adopt the foregoing resolutions and that this 
resolution revokes any prior resolution.
    In witness whereof, this is my signature and the date on which I 
signed this Resolution.

    (ii) The following resolution may be used where the dividend rates 
are set before the close of a dividend period.

    Resolution of Board of Directors for the Declaration of Dividends

    A. I, ----------------, certify that I am the Secretary of --------
-------- Credit Union, and that the following is a correct copy of the 
resolution for declaring dividends adopted by the ---------------- 
Credit Union at a meeting of the Board of Directors duly and properly 
held on --------------------, 19----. This resolution appears in the 
minutes of that meeting and has not been rescinded or modified.
    B. Resolved, that the Board of Directors has adopted a 
nondiscriminatory dividend policy, by establishing dividend periods, 
dividend credit determination dates, dividend distribution dates, any 
associated penalties (if applicable) and the method of dividend 
computation for each type of share account.
    C. Resolved, that it is the policy and practice of the Board of 
Directors to meet periodically to establish prospective dividend rates 
for each type of dividend-bearing share account.
    D. Resolved, that if the required transfers to reserves have been 
made and there are sufficient and available prior and/or current 
earnings available at the end of a dividend period, the officers of the 
Credit Union are

[[Page 491]]

authorized to pay dividends at the rate prospectively established by the 
Board of Directors for each account for the dividend period. The 
officers may pay the dividends without any further action of the Board 
of Directors. The act of paying the dividends shall constitute the 
declaration of the dividends and shall be a ratification of the 
prospective dividend rate.
    In witness whereof, this is my signature and the date on which I 
signed this Resolution.

    5. Referencing. Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of 
the term ``share'' in part 707, as in ``share account,'' also refers to 
``deposit,'' as in ``deposit account,'' where appropriate (for interest-
bearing or non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered 
credit unions).

                      (j) Dividend Declaration Date

    1. General. The importance of the dividend declaration date is to 
tie the last paid dividend to a certain period of time to place members 
and potential members on notice that the last paid dividend is different 
from the next dividend to be paid. In order to achieve this purpose, a 
credit union may use any of the following methods:
    i. ``As of 3/15/95'' (the date the board of directors last met and 
declared the last paid dividend).
    ii. ``As of 3/31/95'' (the last day of the last dividend period upon 
which a dividend has been paid).
    iii. ``For the period 1/1/95 to 3/31/95'' (the last dividend period 
upon which a dividend has been paid).
    iv. ``For the first quarter of 1995'' (the last dividend period upon 
which a dividend has been paid).
    v. ``For April 1995'' (the last dividend period upon which a 
dividend has been paid).
    vi. ``As of the last dividend declaration date'' (the last dividend 
period upon which a dividend has been paid).

                           (k) Dividend Period

    1. General. The dividend period is to be set by a credit union's 
board of directors for each account type, e.g., regular share, share 
draft, money market share, and term share. The most common dividend 
periods are weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. 
Dividend periods need not agree with calendar months, e.g., a monthly 
dividend period could begin March 15 and end April 14.

                            (l) Dividend Rate

    1. General. The dividend rate does not reflect compounding. 
Compounding is reflected in the ``annual percentage yield'' definition.
    2. Referencing. Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of 
the term ``dividend rate'' in part 707 also refers to ``interest rate,'' 
where appropriate (for interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit 
accounts at some state-chartered credit unions).

                       (m) Extraordinary Dividends

    1. General. The definition encompasses all irregularly scheduled and 
declared dividends, and as dividends, extraordinary dividends are exempt 
from the ``bonus'' disclosure requirements. Extraordinary dividends do 
not have to be disclosed on account disclosures, but the dollar amount 
of an extraordinary dividend credited to the account during the 
statement period does have to be separately disclosed on the periodic 
statement for the dividend period during which the extraordinary 
dividends are earned. Extraordinary dividends, like ordinary dividends, 
do not include the payment of a bonus or other consideration worth $10 
or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the 
absorption of expenses or non-dividend membership benefits. See comments 
2(f) 1 through 7 and 2(i) 1 through 4. Extraordinary dividends may be 
calculated by any means determined by the board of directors of a credit 
union and may not be used in the annual percentage yield earned 
calculation.
    2. Use of synonym. Extraordinary dividends may be described as 
``bonus dividends.''

                         (n) Fixed-Rate Account

    1. General. Includes all accounts in which the credit union, by 
contract, agrees to give at least 30 days advance written notice of 
decreases in the dividend rate. Thus, credit unions can decrease rates 
only after providing advance written notice of rate decreases, e.g., a 
``change-in-terms notice.''

                            (o) Grace Period

    1. General. A period after maturity of an automatically renewing 
term share account during which the member may withdraw funds without 
being assessed a penalty. Use of a ``grace period'' is discretionary, 
not mandatory. This definition does not refer to the ``grace period'' 
account, which is a synonym for ``federal rollback method'' or ``in by 
the 10th'' accounts, which are prohibited by TISA and part 707.

                              (p) Interest

    1. General. Member savings placed in deposit accounts are debt 
investments, and the return earned on these accounts is interest. 
Federal credit unions are not authorized to

[[Page 492]]

offer any interest-bearing deposit accounts. State-chartered credit 
unions may offer both share and deposit accounts if permitted by state 
law. State law, including without limitation regulations and official 
interpretations, will determine if returns earned in accounts in state-
chartered credit unions are interest. Interest excludes the payment of a 
bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the 
waiver of reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend 
membership benefits, and extraordinary dividends.
    2. Differences between dividends and interest. Generally, dividends 
are returns on an equity investment (shares); interest is return on a 
debt investment (deposits). Dividends, in general, are not properly 
payable until declared at the close of a dividend period; interest, in 
general, is properly payable daily according to the deposit contract. 
Dividend rates are prospective until actually declared; interest rates 
are set according to contract in advance and are earned on that basis. 
Share accounts establish a member (owner)/credit union (cooperative) 
relationship; deposit accounts establish a depositor (creditor)/
depository (debtor) relationship.
    3. Referencing. Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of 
the terms ``dividend'' or ``dividends'' in part 707 also refers to 
``interest'' where appropriate (for interest-bearing and non-interest-
bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered credit unions).

                               (q) Member

    1. Professional capacity. Examples of accounts held by a natural 
person in a professional capacity for another are:
    i. Attorney-client trust accounts.
    ii. Trust, estate and court-ordered accounts.
    iii. Landlord-tenant security accounts.
    2. Other accounts. Examples of accounts not held in a professional 
capacity include accounts held by parents for a child under the Uniform 
Gifts to Minors Act (or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.
    3. Retirement plans. IRAs and SEP accounts are member accounts to 
the extent that funds are invested in accounts subject to the 
regulation. Keogh accounts, like sole proprietor accounts, are not 
subject to the regulation.

                  (r) Non-Dividend Membership Benefits

    1. General. Term reflects unique credit union practices that are 
difficult to value, encourage community spirit, and are not granted in 
such quantity as to be includable as calculable dividends.
    2. Examples. Examples include:
    i Food, refreshments, and drawings and raffles at annual meetings, 
member functions, and branch openings.
    ii. Travel club benefits.
    iii. Prizes offered at annual meetings, such as U.S. Savings Bonds, 
a deposit of funds into the winner's account, trips, and other gifts. 
Such prizes are not bonuses because they are offered as an incentive to 
increase attendance at the annual meeting, and not to entice members to 
open, maintain, or renew accounts or increase an account balance.
    iv. Life savings benefits.

                          (s) Passbook Account

    1. Relation to Regulation E. Passbook accounts include accounts 
accessed by preauthorized electronic fund transfers to the account (as 
defined in 12 CFR Sec. 205.2(j)), such as an account credited by direct 
share and deposit of social security payments. Accounts that permit 
access by other electronic means are not ``passbook accounts,'' and any 
statements that are sent four or more times a year must comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 707.6.

                         (t) Periodic Statement

    1. General. Periodic statements are not required by part 707. 
Passbook and term share accounts are exempt from periodic statement 
requirements.
    2. Examples. Periodic statements do not include:
    i. Additional statements provided solely upon request.
    ii. General service information such as a quarterly newsletter or 
other correspondence that describes available services and products.

                          (u) Potential Member

    1. General. A potential member is a natural person eligible for 
membership in a credit union, who has not yet taken the steps necessary 
to become a member. The term also includes natural person nonmembers 
eligible to hold accounts in a credit union pursuant to relevant federal 
or state law.
    2. Verification of eligibility. It is recommended that credit unions 
have sound written procedures in place to identify those eligible for 
membership. If these procedures include verification measures, such as 
an application process, verification telephone call or letter to an 
employer or association within the field of membership, witnessing by an 
existing member, or similar procedure, then the credit union may first 
verify the membership eligibility of a potential member before providing 
account disclosures or other information to the potential member. This 
process of verifying a member's eligibility status, making a 
recommendation for membership, and providing account disclosures should 
be completed within 20 calendar days. This period also applies when 
potential

[[Page 493]]

members not on credit union premises request disclosures.
    3. Nonmembers. Within its sole discretion, the board of directors of 
a credit union may provide TISA disclosures to nonmembers who are 
ineligible for membership or to hold an account at the credit union. If 
disclosures are made to such nonmembers, it is the position of the Board 
that no civil liability can accrue to the credit union for any errors in 
such disclosures. (See commentary to Sec. 707.3(d)).

                                (v) State

    1. General. Territories and possessions include American Samoa, 
Guam, the Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands.

                        (w) Stepped-Rate Account

    1. General. Stepped-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or 
more dividend rates (known at the time the account is opened) will take 
effect in succeeding periods.
    2. Example. An example of a stepped-rate account is a one-year term 
share certificate account in which a 5.00% dividend rate is paid for the 
first six months, and 5.50% for the second six months.

                         (x) Term Share Account

    1. Relation to Regulation D. Regulation D permits, in limited 
circumstances, the withdrawal of funds without penalty during the first 
six days after a ``time deposit'' is opened. (See 12 CFR 
204.2(c)(1)(i).) But the fact that a member makes a withdrawal as 
permitted by Regulation D does not disqualify the account from being a 
term share account for purposes of this regulation (such as withdrawals 
upon the death of the member, or within a ``grace period'' for 
automatically renewable term share accounts).
    2. Club accounts. Club accounts, including Christmas club, holiday 
club, and vacation club accounts may be either term share or regular 
share accounts, depending on the terms of the account. Although club 
accounts typically have a maturity date, they are not term share 
accounts unless they also require a penalty of at least seven days' 
dividends for withdrawals during the first six days after the account is 
opened.

                         (y) Tiered-Rate Account

    1. General. Tiered-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or 
more dividend rates are paid on the account and are determined by 
reference to a specified balance level. Tiered-rate accounts are of two 
types: Tiering Method A and Tiering Method B. In Tiering Method A 
accounts, the credit union pays the applicable tiered dividends rate on 
the entire amount in the account. This method is also known as the 
``hybrid'' or ``plateau'' tiered-rate account. In Tiering Method B 
accounts, the credit union does not pay the applicable tiered dividends 
rate on the entire amount in the account, but only on the portion of the 
share account balance that falls within each specified tier. This method 
is also known as the ``pure'' or ``split-rate'' tiered-rate account. 
(See Appendix A, part I, D.)
    2. Example. An example of a tiered-rate account is one in which a 
credit union pays a 5.00% dividend rate on balances below $1,000, and 
5.50% on balances $1,000 and above.
    3. Term share accounts. Term share accounts that pay different rates 
based solely on the amount of the initial share and deposit are not 
tiered-rate accounts.
    4. Minimum balance accounts. A requirement to maintain a minimum 
balance to earn dividends does not make an account a tiered-rate 
account. If dividends are not paid on amounts below a specified balance 
level, then the account has a minimum balance requirement (required to 
be disclosed under Sec. 707.4(b)(3)(i)), but the account does not 
constitute a tiered-rate account. A zero rate (0%) cannot constitute a 
tier. Minimum balance accounts are single rate accounts with a minimum 
balance requirement.

                        (z) Variable-Rate Account

    1. General. Includes accounts in which the credit union does not 
contract to give at least 30 days advance written notice of decreases in 
the dividend rate. An account meets this definition whether the rate 
change is determined by reference to an index, by use of a formula, or 
merely at the discretion of the credit union's board of directors. An 
account that permits one or more rate adjustments prior to maturity at 
the member's option, such as a rate relock option, is a variable-rate 
account.
    2. Differences between fixed-rate and variable-rate accounts. All 
ccounts must either be fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts. Classifying 
an account as variable-rate affects credit unions three ways:
    i. Additional account disclosures are required (Sec. 
707.4(b)(1)(ii));
    ii. Rate decreases are exempted from change-in-terms requirements 
(Sec. 707.5(a)(2)(i)); and
    iii. Advertising notice required (Sec. 707.8(c)(1)).
    Fixed-rate accounts require a contract term obligating the credit 
union to a 30-day advance, written notice to members before decreasing 
the dividend rate on the account. Term changes adversely affecting the 
member and rate decreases cannot take effect until 30 days after such 
fixed-rate change-in-terms notices are mailed or delivered to members 
(Sec. 707.5(a)).

[[Page 494]]

             Section 707.3--General Disclosure Requirements

                                (a) Form

    1. General. All required disclosures (e.g., account disclosures, 
change-in-terms notices, term share renewal/maturity notices, statement 
disclosures and advertising disclosures) must be made clearly and 
conspicuously, in a form the member may retain. Disclosures need be made 
only as applicable (e.g., disclosures for a non-dividend-bearing account 
would not include disclosure of annual percentage yield, dividend rate, 
or other disclosures pertaining to dividend calculations).
    2. Design requirements. Disclosures must be presented in a format 
that allows members and potential members to readily understand the 
terms of their account. Credit unions are not required to use a 
particular type size or typeface, nor are credit unions required to 
state any term more conspicuously than any other term. Disclosures may 
be made:
    i. In any order.
    ii. In combination with other disclosures or account terms.
    iii. In combination with disclosures for other types of accounts, as 
long as it is clear to members and potential members which disclosures 
apply to their account.
    iv. On more than one page and on the front and reverse sides.
    v. By using inserts to a document or filling in blanks.
    vi. On more than one document, as long as the documents are provided 
at the same time.
    3. Consistent terminology. A credit union must use the same 
terminology to describe terms or features that are required to be 
disclosed. For example, if a credit union describes a monthly fee 
(regardless of account activity), as a ``monthly service fee'' in 
account opening disclosures, the periodic statements and change-in-terms 
notices must use the same terminology so that members and potential 
members can readily identify the fee.

                               (b) General

    1. Terms and conditions. Credit unions are required to have 
disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the credit 
union and a member at the time the member opens the account. This 
provision does not impose any contract terms or supersede state or other 
laws that define how the legal obligations between a credit union and 
its membership are determined.
    2. Specificity of legal obligation. Credit unions may refer to the 
calendar month or to roughly equivalent intervals during a calendar year 
as a ``month.'' Use of estimates is prohibited in TISA disclosures.
    3. Foreign language. Disclosures may be made in any foreign 
language, if desired by the board of directors of a credit union. 
However, disclosures must also be provided in English, upon request.

                      (c) Relation to Regulation E

    1. General rule. Compliance with Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) is 
deemed to satisfy the disclosure requirements of this regulation, such 
as when:
    i. A credit union changes a term that triggers a notice under 
Regulation E, and the timing and disclosure rules of Regulation E for 
sending change-in-terms notices.
    ii. A member adds an ATM access feature to an account, and the 
credit union provides disclosures pursuant to Regulation E, including 
disclosure of fees before the member receives ATM access. (See 12 CFR 
205.7.)
    iii. A credit union complying with the timing rules of Regulation E 
discloses at the same time fees for electronic services (such as balance 
inquiry fees imposed if the inquiry is made at an ATM) that are required 
to be disclosed by this regulation, but not by Regulation E.
    iv. A credit union relies on Regulation E's rules regarding 
disclosures of limitations on the frequency and amount of electronic 
fund transfers, including security-related exceptions. But any 
limitation on the number of ``intra-institutional transfers'' to or from 
the member's other accounts at the credit union during a given time 
period must be disclosed, even though intra-institutional transfers are 
exempt from Regulation E.

                          (d) Multiple Members

    1. General. When an account has multiple natural person member 
accountholders, delivery of disclosures to any member accountholder or 
agent authorized by the accountholder satisfies the disclosure 
requirements of part 707.

                     (e) Oral Response to Inquiries

    1. Application of rule. Credit unions need not provide rate 
information orally. Disclosures need be made only as appropriate. For 
example, the requirement to give a telephone number for a member to call 
about rates for interest-bearing accounts and dividend-bearing term 
share accounts, would not be necessary for members calling the credit 
union for information. Also, the disclosure requirements are applicable 
only to credit union employees and volunteers acting in the ordinary 
course of credit union business.
    2. Relation to advertising. The advertising rules do not cover an 
oral response to a question about rates.
    3. Existing accounts. This paragraph does not apply to oral 
responses about rate information for existing term share accounts or 
accounts not currently offered. For example, if a member holding a one-
year term share account requests dividend rate information

[[Page 495]]

about the account during the term, the credit union need not disclose 
the annual percentage yield, unless the member is calling for rate 
information under a maturity notice.

          (f) Rounding and Accuracy Rules for Rates and Yields

                             (f)(1) Rounding

    1. Permissible rounding. The annual percentage yield, annual 
percentage yield earned and dividend rate must be rounded to the nearest 
one-hundredth of one percentage point (.01%) when disclosed. Examples of 
permissible rounding are an annual percentage yield calculated to be 
5.644%, rounded down and shown as 5.64%; 5.645% would be rounded up and 
disclosed as 5.65%. For account disclosures, the dividend rate may be 
expressed to more than two decimal places.

                             (f)(2) Accuracy

    1. Annual percentage yield and annual percentage yield earned. The 
tolerance for annual percentage yield and annual percentage yield earned 
calculations is designed to accommodate inadvertent errors. Credit 
unions may not purposely incorporate the one-twentieth of one percentage 
point (.05%) tolerance into their calculation of yields.
    2. Dividend rate. There is no tolerance for an inaccuracy in the 
dividend rate.

                   Section 707.4--Account Disclosures

                   (a) Delivery of Account Disclosures

                         (a)(1) Account Opening

    1. New accounts. New account disclosures must be provided when:
    i. A term share account that does not automatically rollover is 
renewed by a member.
    ii. A member changes the term for a renewable term share account 
(from a one-year term share account to a six-month term share account, 
for instance) (see comment 5(b)-5 regarding disclosure alternatives).
    iii. A credit union transfers funds from an account to open a new 
account not at the member's request, unless the credit union previously 
gave account disclosures and any change-in-terms notices for the new 
account (e.g., funds in a money market share account are transferred by 
a credit union to open a new account for the member, such as a share 
draft account, because the member exceeded transaction limitations on 
the money market share account).
    iv. A credit union accepts a deposit from a member to an account 
that the credit union had previously deemed to be ``closed,'' under 
applicable federal or state law, for the purpose of treating accrued, 
but uncredited, dividends as forfeited dividends. New account numbers 
are not required by this requirement.
    2. Acquired accounts. New account disclosures need not be given when 
a credit union acquires an account through an acquisition of, or merger 
with, another credit union (but see Sec. 707.5(a) regarding advance 
notice requirements if terms are changed).
    3. Combination disclosures. New account disclosures need not be 
given when a member has already received disclosures covering several 
accounts, and opens a new account properly disclosed by the already 
received combination disclosures, if the new account is opened within a 
reasonable amount of time after receipt of the combination disclosures 
and if the received disclosures and terms are accurate at the time the 
new account is opened.

                             (a)(2) Requests

                                (a)(2)(i)

    1. Inquiries versus requests. A response to an oral inquiry (by 
telephone or in person) about rates and yields or fees does not trigger 
the duty to provide account disclosures. But, when a member asks for 
written information about an account (whether by telephone, in person, 
or by other means), the credit union must provide disclosures unless the 
account is no longer offered to the public.
    2. General requests. When member's or potential member's request 
disclosures about a type of account (a share draft account, for 
example), a credit union that offers several variations may provide 
disclosures for any one of them. No disclosures need be made to 
nonmembers, though a credit union may provide disclosures to nonmembers 
within its sole discretion.
    3. Timing for response. Ten business days is a reasonable time for 
responding to requests for account information that members do not make 
in person, including requests made by electronic communication.
    4. Requests by electronic communication. Posting disclosures on a 
credit union's web site generally does not relieve the credit union's 
duty to provide disclosures upon request. If the member provides an e-
mail address, the credit union may provide the disclosures 
electronically, but the credit union must either send the disclosures by 
e-mail or send a notice to the member's e-mail address pursuant to Sec. 
707.10(d)(2)(i) to inform the member where the disclosures are posted.

                            (a)(2)(ii)(A)(2)

    1. Recent rates. Credit unions comply with this paragraph if they 
disclose an interest rate (or dividend rate on a dividend-bearing term 
share account) and annual percentage yield accurate within the seven 
calendar days preceding the date they send the disclosures.

[[Page 496]]

                              (a)(2)(ii)(B)

    1. Term. Describing the maturity of a term share account as ``1 
year'' or ``6 months,'' for example, illustrates a response stating the 
maturity of a term share account as a term rather than a date (e.g., 
``June 1, 1995'').

                   (b) Content of Account Disclosures

                         (b)(1) Rate Information

           (b)(1)(i) Annual Percentage Yield and Dividend Rate

    1. Rate disclosures. In addition to the dividend rate and annual 
percentage yield, credit unions may disclose a periodic rate 
corresponding to the dividend rate. No other rate or yield (such as 
``tax effective yield'') is permitted. If the annual percentage yield is 
the same as the dividend rate, credit unions may disclose a single 
figure but must use both terms.
    2. Fixed-rate accounts. For fixed-rate term share accounts paying 
the opening rate until maturity, credit unions may disclose the period 
of time the dividend rate will be in effect by stating, or cross-
referencing, the maturity date. For other fixed-rate accounts, credit 
unions may use a date (such as ``This rate will be in effect through 
June 30, 1995'') or a period (such as ``This rate will be in effect for 
at least 30 days'').
    3. Tiered-rate accounts. Each dividend rate, along with the 
corresponding annual percentage yield for each specified balance level 
(or range of annual percentage yields, if appropriate), must be 
disclosed for tiered-rate accounts. (See Appendix A, Part I, Paragraph 
D.)
    4. Stepped-rate accounts. A single composite annual percentage yield 
must be disclosed for stepped-rate accounts. (See Appendix A, Part I, 
Paragraph B.) The dividend rates and the period of time each will be in 
effect also must be provided. When the initial rate offered for a 
specified time on a variable-rate account is higher or lower than the 
rate that would otherwise be paid on the account, the calculation of the 
annual percentage yield must be made as if for a stepped-rate account. 
(See Appendix A, Part I, Paragraph C.)
    5. Minimum balance accounts. If a credit union sets a minimum 
balance to earn dividends, the credit union may, but need not, state 
that the annual percentage yield is 0% for those days the balance in the 
account drops below the minimum balance level when using the daily 
balance method. Nor is a disclosure of 0% required for credit unions 
using the average daily balance method, if the member fails to meet the 
minimum balance required for the average daily balance period.

                        (b)(1)(ii) Variable Rates

                              (b)(1)(ii)(B)

    1. Determining dividend rates. To disclose how the dividend rate is 
determined, credit unions must:
    i. Identify the index and specific margin, if the dividend rate is 
tied to an index.
    ii. State that rate changes are within the credit union's 
discretion, if the credit union does not tie changes to an index.

                              (b)(1)(ii)(C)

    1. Frequency of rate changes. A credit union reserving the right to 
change rates at its discretion must state the fact that rates may change 
at any time.

                              (b)(1)(ii)(D)

    1. Limitations. A floor or ceiling on rates or on the amount the 
rate may decrease or increase during any time period must be disclosed. 
Credit unions need not disclose the absence of limitations on rate 
changes.

                    (b)(2) Compounding and Crediting

                           (b)(2)(i) Frequency

    1. General. Descriptions such as ``quarterly'' or ``monthly'' are 
sufficient. Irregular crediting and compounding periods, such as if a 
cycle is out short at year end for tax reporting purposes, need not be 
disclosed.
    2. Dividend period. For dividend-bearing accounts, the dividend 
period must be disclosed. (A specific example must also be given, see 
Appendix B, Sec. B-1(c).) The dividend period for term share accounts 
generally may be disclosed as the account's term (e.g., two years).

                 (b)(2)(ii) Effect of Closing an Account

    1. Deeming an account closed. A credit union may, subject to state 
or other law, provide in account contracts the actions by members that 
will be treated as closing the account and that will result in the 
forfeiture of accrued but uncredited dividends. An example is the 
withdrawal of all funds from the account prior to the date dividends are 
credited. Credit unions are cautioned that bylaw requirements may 
prevent a credit union from deeming a member's account closed until 
certain time periods are extinguished if funds remain in a member's 
account. NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. III, Sec. 3. Such bylaw 
requirements may not be overridden without proper agency approval.

                       (b)(3) Balance Information

                 (b)(3)(i) Minimum Balance Requirements

    1. Par value. Credit unions must disclose any minimum balance 
required to open the account, to avoid the imposition of a fee, or to 
obtain the annual percentage yield. Since

[[Page 497]]

members cannot generally maintain any accounts until the par value of 
the membership share is paid in full, this section requires that credit 
unions disclose the par value of a share necessary to become a member 
and maintain accounts at the credit union. The par value of a share and 
the minimum balance requirement do not have to be the same amount (e.g., 
a credit union may have a $5 par value for a membership share, in order 
for accounts to be opened and maintained, and a $100 minimum balance 
requirement, in order for the account to earn dividends).
    2. Disclosures. The explanation of minimum balance computation 
methods may be combined with the balance computation method disclosures 
(Sec. 707.4(b)(3)(ii)) if they are the same. If a credit union uses 
different cycles for determining minimum balance requirements for 
purposes of assessing fees and for paying dividends, the credit union 
must disclose the specific cycle or time period used for each purpose 
(e.g., use of a midmonth statement cycle for determining dividends, and 
use of a calendar month cycle for determining fees). Credit unions may 
assess fees by using any method. If fees on one account are tied to the 
balance in another account, such provision must be explained (e.g., if 
share draft fees are tied to a minimum balance in the regular share 
account (or a combination of the share draft and regular share 
accounts), the share draft account must explain that fact and how the 
balance in the regular share account (or both accounts) is determined). 
The fee need not be disclosed in the account disclosures if the fee is 
not imposed on that account.

                  (b)(3)(ii) Balance Computation Method

    1. Methods and periods. Credit unions may use different methods or 
periods to calculate minimum balances for purposes of imposing a fee 
(the daily balance for a calendar month, for example) and accruing 
dividends (the average daily balance for a statement period, for 
example). Each method and corresponding period must be disclosed.

               (b)(3)(iii) When dividends begin to accrue

    1. Additional information. Credit unions must include a statement as 
to when dividends begin to accrue for noncash deposits. Credit unions 
may disclose additional information such as the time of day after which 
deposits are treated as having been received the following business day, 
and may use additional descriptive terms such as ``ledger'' or 
``collected'' balances to disclose when dividends begin to accrue. Under 
the ledger balance method, dividends begin to accrue on the day of 
deposit. Under the collected balance methods, dividends begin to accrue 
when provisional credit is received for the item deposited.

                               (b)(4) Fees

    1. Types of fees. Fees related to the routine use of an account must 
be disclosed. The following are types of fees that must be disclosed in 
connection with an account:
    i. Maintenance fees, such as monthly service fees.
    ii. Fees related to share deposits or withdrawals.
    iii. Fees for special services, such as stop payment fees, fees for 
balance inquiries or verification of share and deposits, fees associated 
with checks returned unpaid, fees for regularly sending to members share 
drafts that otherwise would be held by the credit union, and overdraft 
line of credit access fees (if charged against the share account).
    iv. Fees to open or to close an account.
    v. Fees imposed upon dormant or inactive accounts.
    2. Other fees. Credit unions need not disclose fees such as the 
following:
    i. Fees for services offered to members and nonmembers alike, such 
as fees for certain travelers checks, for wire transfers and automated 
clearinghouse (ACH) transfers, to process credit card cash advances, or 
to handle U.S. Savings Bond Redemption (even if different amounts are 
charged to members and nonmembers).
    ii. Incidental fees, such as fees associated with state escheat 
laws, garnishment or attorneys fees, to change names on an account, to 
generate a midcycle periodic statement, to wrap loose coins, for 
photocopying, for statements returned to the credit union because of a 
wrong address, and locator fees.
    3. Amount of fees. Credit unions are cautioned that merely providing 
fee information in an account disclosure may not be sufficient to gain 
the legal right to impose the fee involved under applicable law. Credit 
unions must state the amount and conditions under which a fee may be 
imposed. Naming and describing the fee typically satisfies this 
requirement. Some examples are:
    i. ``$4.00 monthly service fee''.
    ii. $7.00 and up'' or ``fee depends on style of checks ordered'' for 
check printing fees.
    4. Tied-accounts. Credit unions must state if fees that may be 
assessed against an account are tied to other accounts at the credit 
union. For example, if a credit union ties the fees payable on a share 
draft account to balances held in the share draft account and in a 
regular share account, the share draft account disclosures must state 
that fact and explain how the fee is determined.
    5. Regulation E statements. Some fees are required to be disclosed 
under both Regulation E (12 CFR 205.7) and part 707. If such fees, such 
as ATM transaction fees, are disclosed on a Regulation E statement, they 
need not be disclosed again on a periodic statement required under part 
707.

[[Page 498]]

    6. Fees for overdrawing an account. Under Sec. 707.4(b)(4) of this 
part, credit unions must disclose the conditions under which a fee may 
be imposed. In satisfying this requirement credit unions must specify 
the categories of transactions for which an overdraft fee may be 
imposed. An exhaustive list of transactions is not required. It is 
sufficient for a credit union to state that the fee applies to 
overdrafts ``created by check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, or 
other electronic means.'' Disclosing a fee ``for overdraft items'' would 
not be sufficient.

                     (b)(5) Transaction Limitations

    1. General rule. Examples of limitations on the number of dollar 
amount of share deposits or withdrawals that credit unions must disclose 
are:
    i. Limits on the number of share drafts or checks that may be 
written on an account for a given time period.
    ii. Limits on withdrawals or share deposits during the term of a 
term share account.
    iii. Limitations required by Regulation D, such as the number of 
withdrawals permitted from money market share accounts by check to third 
parties each month (credit unions need not disclose reservation of right 
to require a notice for withdrawals from accounts required by federal or 
state law).

                 (b)(6) Features of Term Share Accounts

                       (b)(6)(i) Time Requirements

    1. ``Callable'' term share accounts. In addition to the maturity 
date, credit unions must state the date or the circumstances under which 
the credit union may redeem a term share account at the credit union's 
option (a ``callable'' term share account).

                  (b)(6)(ii) Early Withdrawal Penalties

    1. General. The term ``penalty'' may, but need not, be used to 
describe the loss that may be incurred by members for early withdrawal 
of funds from term share accounts.
    2. Examples. Examples of early withdrawal penalties are:
    i. Monetary penalties, such a specific dollar amount (e.g., 
``$10.00'') or a specific days' worth of dividends (e.g., ``seven days' 
dividends plus accrued but uncredited dividends, but only if the account 
is closed'').
    ii. Adverse changes to terms such as the lowering of the dividend 
rate, annual percentage yield, or reducing the compounding or crediting 
frequency for funds remaining in shares or on deposit.
    iii. Reclamation of bonuses.
    3. Relation to rules for IRAs or similar plans. Penalties imposed by 
the Internal Revenue Code for certain withdrawals from IRAs or similar 
pension or savings plans are not early withdrawal penalties for purposes 
of this regulation.
    4. Disclosing penalties. Penalties may be stated in months, whether 
credit unions assess the penalty using the actual number of days during 
the period or using another method such as a number of days that occurs 
in any actual sequence of the total calendar months involved. For 
example, stating ``one month's dividends'' is permissible, whether the 
credit union assesses 30 days' dividends during the month of April, or 
selects a time period between 28 and 31 days for calculating the 
dividends for all early withdrawals regardless of when the penalty is 
assessed.

                       (b)(6)(iv) Renewal Policies

    1. Rollover term share accounts. Credit unions are not required to 
provide a grace period, to pay dividends during the grace period, or to 
disclose whether or not dividends will be paid during the grace period. 
Credit unions offering a grace period on term share accounts must give 
the length of the grace period. Commentary, Appendix B, Model Clauses, 
Sec. B-1(i)(iv).
    2. Nonrollover term share accounts. Credit unions that pay dividends 
on funds following the maturity of term share accounts that do not renew 
automatically need not state the rate (or annual percentage yield) that 
may be paid.

                             (b)(7) Bonuses

    1. General. Credit unions are required to state the amount and type 
of bonus, and disclose any minimum balance or time requirement to obtain 
the bonus and when the bonus will be provided. If the minimum balance or 
time requirement is otherwise required to be disclosed, credit unions 
need not duplicate the disclosure for purposes of this paragraph.

                       (b)(8) Nature of Dividends

    1. General. Dividends are not payable until declared and unless 
sufficient current and undivided earnings are available after required 
transfers to reserves at the close of a dividend period. A disclosure 
explaining dividends educates members and protects credit unions in the 
event that a prospective dividend cannot be paid, or is not properly 
payable. This disclosure is required for all dividend-bearing share 
accounts. Term share accounts need not include a statement regarding the 
nature of dividends.
    2. State-chartered credit unions with interest-bearing deposit 
accounts. State law controls the nature of accounts (i.e., whether an 
account is a share account or a deposit account). If a member of a 
state-chartered credit union is opening only an interest-bearing deposit 
account, or is requesting account disclosures only for an interest-
bearing deposit account (if state law requires the

[[Page 499]]

depositor to hold a share account), the disclosures must generally 
include the following information on any dividend-bearing share portion 
of the account (e.g., membership share): the par value of a share; a 
statement that the portion of the deposit that represents the par value 
of the membership share will earn dividends, and that dividends are paid 
from current income and available earnings after required transfers to 
reserves. Further additional disclosures, such as a separate dividend 
rate and annual percentage yield for the membership share, are not 
required (if the additional disclosures would agree with the remainder 
of the account which is invested in an interest-bearing deposit).

                  (c) Notice to Existing Accountholders

    1. General. Only members who receive periodic statements (provided 
regularly at least four times per year) and who hold accounts of the 
type offered by the credit union as of the compliance date of part 707 
(generally January 1, 1995) must receive the notice. If following 
receipt of the notice members request disclosures, credit unions have 
twenty calendar days from receipt of the request to provide the 
disclosures. Rate and annual percentage yield information in such 
disclosures must conform to that required for disclosures upon request. 
As an alternative to including the notice in or on the periodic 
statement, the final rule permits credit unions to send the account 
disclosures themselves, as long as they are sent at the same time as the 
periodic statement (the disclosures may be mailed either with the 
periodic statement or separately).
    2. Form of the notice. The notice may be included on the periodic 
statement, in a member newsletter, or on a statement stuffer or other 
insert, if it is clear and conspicuous. The notice cannot be sent in a 
separate mailing from the periodic statement.
    3. Timing. The notice may accompany the first periodic statement 
after the compliance date for part 707, or the periodic statement for 
the first cycle beginning after that date. For example, a credit union's 
statement cycle is December 15, 1994-January 14, 1995. The statement is 
mailed on January 15, The next cycle is January 15, 1995 through 
February 14, 1995, and the statement for that cycle is mailed on 
February 15. The credit union may provide the notice either on or with 
the January 15 statement or on or with the February 15 statement, as it 
covers the first cycle after January 1, 1995.
    4. Early compliance. Credit unions that provide the notice to 
existing members prior to the compliance date of part 707, must be 
prepared to provide accurate and timely disclosures when, following 
receipt of the notice, members ask for account disclosures. Such 
disclosures must be provided even if they are requested before the 
compliance date of part 707. Credit unions who provide early notice to 
existing members need to comply with other aspects of part 707, but need 
not provide disclosures already provided in compliance with part 707.

                  Section 707.5--Subsequent Disclosures

                           (a) Change in Terms

                     (a)(1) Advance Notice required

    1. Form of notice. Credit unions may provide a change-in-term notice 
on or with a regular periodic statement or in another mailing (such as a 
highlighted portion of a newsletter or statement stuffer insert). If a 
credit union provides notice through revised account disclosures, the 
changed term must be highlighted in some manner. For example, credit 
unions may state that a particular fee has been changed (also specifying 
the new amount) or use an accompanying letter that refers to the changed 
term. Credit unions are cautioned that unless credit unions have 
reserved the right to change terms in the account agreement or 
disclosures, a change-in-terms notice may not be sufficient to amend the 
terms under applicable law.
    2. Effective date. An example of a language for disclosing the 
effective date of a change is: ``As of May 11, 1995''.
    3. Terms that change upon the occurrence of an event. A credit union 
offering terms that will automatically change upon the occurrence of a 
stated event need not send an advance notice of the change provided the 
credit union fully describes the conditions of the change in the account 
opening disclosures (and sends any change-in-term notices regardless of 
whether the changed term affects that member's account at that time).
    4. Examples. Examples of changes not requiring an advance change-in-
terms notice are:
    i. The termination of employment for employee-members for whom 
account maintenance or activity fees were waived during their employment 
by the credit union.
    ii. The expiration of one year in a promotion described in the 
account opening disclosures to ``waive $4.00 monthly service charges for 
one year''.

                        (a)(2) No Notice Required

                     (a)(2)(ii) Check Printing Fees

    1. Increase in fees. A notice is not required for an increase in 
fees for printing share drafts (or deposit and withdrawal slips) even if 
the credit union adds some amount to the price charged by the vendor.

(b) Notice Before Maturity for Term Share Accounts Longer Than One Month 
                        That Renew Automatically.

    1. Maturity dates on nonbusiness days. In determining the term of a 
term share account,

[[Page 500]]

credit unions may disregard the fact that the term will be extended 
beyond the disclosed number of days if the maturity date falls on a 
nonbusiness day. For example, a holiday or weekend may cause a ``one-
year'' term share account to extend beyond 365 days (or 366, in a leap 
year), or a ``one-month'' term share account to extend beyond 31 days.
    2. Disclosing when rates will be determined. Ways to disclose when 
the annual percentage yield will be available include the use of:
    i. A specific date, such as ``October 28''.
    ii. A date that is easily discernible, such as ``the Tuesday prior 
to the maturity date stated on the notice'' or ``as of the maturity date 
stated on this notice''.
    3. Alternative timing rule. Under the alternative timing rule, a 
credit union that offers a 10-day grace period would have to provide the 
disclosures at least 10 calendar days prior to the scheduled maturity 
date.
    4. Club accounts. If members have agreed to the transfer of payments 
from another account to a club term share account for the next club 
period, the credit union must comply with the requirements for 
automatically renewable term share accounts--even though members may 
withdraw funds from the club account at the end of the current club 
period.
    5. Renewal of a term share account. In the case of a change-in-terms 
that becomes effective if a rollover term share account is subsequently 
renewed:
    i. If the change is initiated by the credit union, the disclosure 
requirements of this paragraph apply. (Section 707.5(a) applies if the 
change becomes effective prior to the maturity of the existing term 
share account.)
    ii. If the change is initiated by the member, the account opening 
disclosure requirements of Sec. 707.4(b) apply. (If the notice required 
by this paragraph has been provided, credit unions may give new account 
disclosures or disclosures that reflect the new term.)
    6. Example. If a member receives a notice prior to maturity on a 
one-year term share account and requests a rollover to a six-month 
account, the credit union must provide either account opening 
disclosures including the new maturity date or, if all other terms 
previously disclosed in the prematurity notice remain the same, only the 
new maturity date.

                (b)(1) Maturities of Longer Than One Year

    1. Highlighting changed terms. Credit unions need not highlight 
terms that have changed since the last account disclosures were 
provided.

(c) Notice Before Maturity for Term Share Accounts Longer Than One Year 
                     That Do not Renew Automatically

    1. Subsequent account. When funds are transferred following maturity 
of a nonrollover term share account, credit unions need not provide 
account disclosures unless a new account is established.

              Section 707.6--Periodic Statement Disclosures

           (a) Rule When Statement and Crediting Periods Vary

    1. General. Credit unions are not required to provide periodic 
statements. If they provide periodic statements, disclosures need only 
be furnished to the extent applicable. For example, if no dividends are 
earned for a statement period, credit unions need not state that fact. 
Or, credit unions may disclose ``$0'' dividends earned and ``0%'' annual 
percentage yield earned.
    2. Regulation E interim statements. When a credit union provides 
regular quarterly statements, and in addition provides a monthly interim 
statement to comply with Regulation E, the interim statement need not 
comply with this section unless it states dividend or rate information. 
(See 12 CFR 205.9). For credit unions that choose not to treat 
Regulation E activity statements as part 707 periodic statements, the 
quarterly periodic statement must reflect the annual percentage yield 
earned and dividends earned for the full quarter. However, credit unions 
choosing this option need not redisclose fees already disclosed on an 
interim Regulation E activity statement on the quarterly periodic 
statement. For credit unions that choose to treat Regulation E activity 
statements as part 707 periodic statements, the Regulation E statement 
must meet all part 707 requirements.
    3. Combined statements. Credit unions may provide certain 
information about an account (such as a money market share account or 
regular share account) on the periodic statement for another account 
(such as a share draft account) without triggering the disclosures 
required by this section, as long as:
    i. The information is limited to information such as the account 
number, the type of account, balance information, accountholders' names, 
and social security or tax identification number; and
    ii. The credit union also provides members a periodic statement 
complying with this section for the account (the money market share 
account or regular share account, in the example).
    4. Other information. Additional information that may be given on or 
with a periodic statement, includes:

[[Page 501]]

    i. Dividend rates and corresponding periodic rates to the dividend 
rate applied to balances during the statement period.
    ii. The dollar amount of dividends earned year-to-date.
    iii. Bonuses paid (or any de minimis consideration of $10 or less).
    iv. Fees for other products, such as safe deposit boxes.
    v. Accounts not covered by the periodic statement disclosure 
requirements (passbook and term share accounts) may disclose any 
information on the statement related to such accounts, so long as such 
information is accurate and not misleading.
    5. When statement and crediting periods vary. This rule permits 
credit unions, on dividend-bearing share accounts, to report the annual 
percentage yield earned and the amount of dividends earned on a 
statement other than on each periodic statement when the dividend period 
does not agree with, varies from, or is different than, the statement 
period. For dividend-bearing share accounts, credit unions may disclose 
the required information either upon each periodic statement, or on the 
statement on which dividends are actually earned (credited or posted) to 
the member's account. In addition, for accounts using the average daily 
balance method of calculating dividends, when the average daily balance 
period and the statement periods do not agree, vary or are different, 
credit unions may also report annual percentage yield earned and the 
dollar amount of dividends earned on the periodic statement on which the 
dividends or interest is earned. For example, if a credit union has 
quarterly dividend periods, or uses a quarterly average daily balance on 
an account, the first two monthly statements may not state annual 
percentage yield earned and dividends earned figures; the third 
``monthly'' statement will reflect the dividends earned and the annual 
percentage yield earned for the entire quarter. The fees imposed 
disclosure must be given on the periodic statement on which they are 
imposed.
    6. Length of the period. Credit unions must disclose the length of 
both the dividend period (or average daily balance calculation period) 
and the statement period. For example, a statement could disclose a 
statement period of April 16 through May 15 and further state that ``the 
dividends earned and the annual percentage yield earned are based on 
your dividend period (or average daily balance) for the period April 1 
through April 30.''
    7. Dividend period more frequent than statement period. Credit 
unions that calculate dividends on a monthly basis, but send statements 
on a quarterly basis, may disclose a single dividend (and annual 
percentage yield earned) figure. Alternatively, a credit union may 
disclose three dividends earned and three annual percentage yield earned 
figures, one of each month in the quarter, as long as the credit union 
states the number of days (or beginning and ending date) in each 
dividend period if it varies from the statement period.
    8. Additional voluntary disclosures. For credit unions not 
disclosing the annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned on 
all periodic statements, credit unions may place a notice on statements 
without dividends and annual percentage yield earned figures, that the 
annual percentage yield earned and dollar amount of dividends earned 
will appear on the first statement at the close of the dividend (or 
average daily balance) period, or similar wording. Credit unions may 
also choose to include a telephone number to call for interim 
information, if desired by a member.

                        (b) Statement Disclosures

                  (b)(1) Annual Percentage Yield Earned

    1. Ledger and collected balances. Credit unions that accrue interest 
using the collected balance method may use either the ledger or 
collected balance methods to determine the balance used to determine the 
annual percentage yield earned. Ledger balance means the record of the 
balance in a member's account, as per the credit union's records. (The 
ledger balance may reflect additions and deposits for which the credit 
union has not yet received final payment). Collected balance means the 
record of balance in a member's account reflecting collected funds, that 
is, cash or checks deposited in the credit union which have been 
presented for payment and for which payment has actually been received. 
(See Regulation CC, 12 CFR 229.14).

                 (b)(2) Amount of Dividends or Interest

    1. Definition of earned. The term ``earned'' is defined to include 
dividends and interest either ``accrued'' or ``paid and credited.'' 
Credit unions may use either the ``ledger'' or the ``collected'' balance 
for either option. (See 707.6(b)(1)1. and 707.7(c)2. of this appendix.)
    2. Accrued interest. Credit unions must state the amount of interest 
that accrued during the statement period, even if it was not credited.
    3. Terminology. In disclosing dividends earned for the period, 
credit unions must use the term ``dividends'' or terminology such as: 
``Dividends paid,'' to describe dividends that have been credited; 
``Dividends accrued,'' to indicate that dividends are not yet credited.
    4. Closed accounts. If a member closes an account between crediting 
periods and forfeits accrued dividends, the credit union may not show 
any figures for ``dividends earned''

[[Page 502]]

or annual percentage yield earned for the period (other than zero, at 
the credit union's option).
    5. Extraordinary dividends. Extraordinary dividends are not a 
component of the annual percentage yield earned or the dividend rate, 
but are an addition to the member's account. The dollar amount of the 
extraordinary dividends paid, denoted as a separate, identified figure, 
must be disclosed on the periodic statement on which the extraordinary 
dividends are earned. A credit union may also disclose information 
regarding the calculation of the extraordinary dividends, and additional 
annual percentage yield earned and dividend rate figures taking into 
account the extraordinary dividend, so long as such information is 
accurate and not misleading.

                           (b)(3) Fees Imposed

    1. General. Periodic statements must state fees disclosed under 
Sec. 707.4(b) that were debited to the account during the statement 
period, even if assessed for an earlier period.
    2. Itemizing fees by type. In itemizing fees imposed more than once 
in the period, credit unions may group fees if they are the same type. 
See Sec. 707.11(a)(1) of this part regarding certain fees that must be 
grouped when a credit union promotes the payment of overdrafts. When 
fees of the same type are grouped together, the description must make 
clear that the dollar figure represents more than a single fee, for 
example, ``total fees for checks written this period.'' Examples of fees 
that may not be grouped together are--
    i. Monthly maintenance and excess-activity fees.
    ii. ``Transfer'' fees, if different dollar amounts are imposed, such 
as $.50 for deposits and $1.00 for withdrawals.
    iii. Fees for electronic fund transfers and fees for other services, 
such as balance-inquiry or maintenance fees.
    iv. Fees for paying overdrafts and fees for returning checks or 
other items unpaid.
    3. Identifying fees. Statement details must enable the member to 
identify the specific fee. For example:
    i. Credit unions may use a code to identify a particular fee if the 
code is explained on the periodic statement or in documents accompanying 
the statement.
    ii. Credit unions using debit slips may disclose the date the fee 
was debited on the periodic statement and show the amount and type of 
fee on the dated debit slip.
    4. Relation to Regulation E. Disclosure of fees in compliance with 
Regulation E complies with this section for fees related to electronic 
fund transfers (for example, totaling all electronic funds transfer fees 
in a single figure).

                         (b)(4) Length of Period

    1. General. Credit unions providing the beginning and ending dates 
of the period must make clear whether both dates are included in the 
period. For example, stating ``April 1 through April 30'' would clearly 
indicate that both April 1 and April 30 are included in the period.
    2. Opening or closing an account mid-cycle. If an account is opened 
or closed during the period for which a statement is sent, credit unions 
must calculate the annual percentage yield earned based on account 
balances for each day the account was open.

                   Section 707.7--Payment of Dividends

                         (a) Permissible Methods

    1. Prohibited calculation methods. Calculation methods that do not 
comply with the requirement to pay dividends on the full amount of 
principal in the account each day include:
    i. The ``rollback'' method, also known as the ``grace period'' or 
``in by the 10th'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the 
lowest balance in the account for the period.
    ii. The ``increments of par value'' method, where credit unions only 
pay dividends on full shares in an account, e.g., a credit union with $5 
par value shares pays dividends on $20 of a $24 account balance.
    iii. The ``ending balance'' method, where credit unions pay 
dividends on the balance in the account at the end of the period.
    iv. The ``investable balance'' method, where credit unions pay 
dividends on a percentage of the balance, excluding an amount credit 
unions set aside for reserve requirements.
    v. The ``low balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on 
the lowest balance in the account for any day in that period.
    2. Use of 365-day basis. Credit unions may apply a daily periodic 
rate that is greater than \1/365\ of the dividend rate--such as \1/360\ 
of the dividend rate--as long as it is applied 365 days a year.
    3. Periodic dividend payments. A credit union can pay dividends each 
day on the account and still make uniform dividend payments. For 
example, for a one-year term share account, a credit union could make 
monthly dividend payments that are equal to \1/12\ of the amount of 
dividends that will be earned for a 365-day period (or 11 uniform 
monthly payments--each equal to roughly \1/12\ of the total amount of 
dividends--and one payment that accounts to the remainder of the total 
amount of dividends earned for the period).
    4. Leap year. Credit unions may apply a daily rate of \1/366\ or \1/
365\ of the dividend rate for 366 days in a leap year, if the account 
will earn dividends for February 29.

[[Page 503]]

    5. Maturity of term share accounts. Credit unions are not required 
to pay dividends after term share accounts mature. Examples include:
    i. During any grace period offered by a credit union for an 
automatically renewable term share account, if the member decides during 
that period not to renew the account.
    ii. Following the maturity of nonrollover term share accounts.
    iii. When the maturity date falls on a holiday, and the member must 
wait until the next business day to obtain the funds.
    6. Dormant accounts. Credit unions must pay dividends on funds in an 
account, even if inactivity or the infrequency of transactions would 
permit the credit union to consider the account to be ``inactive'' or 
``dormant'' (or similar status) as defined by state or other law or the 
account contract.
    7. Insufficient funds. Credit unions are not required to pay 
dividends on checks or share drafts deposited to a member's account that 
are returned for insufficient funds. If a credit union accrues dividends 
on a check that it later determines is not good, it may deduct from the 
accrued dividends any dividends attributed to the proceeds of the 
returned check. If dividends have already been credited before the 
credit union determines the item has insufficient funds, the credit 
union may deduct the amount of the check and associated dividends from 
the account balance. The amount deducted will not be reflected in the 
dividend amount and annual percentage yield earned reported for the next 
period.
    8. Account drawn below par value of a share. If a member draws his 
or her account below the par value of a share, dividends would continue 
to accrue on the account so long as any minimum balance requirement is 
met. However, under the NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, if a member who 
reduces his or her share balance below the value of a par value share 
and does not increase the balance within at least six months, the credit 
union may terminate the member's membership. State-chartered credit 
unions may have similar termination provisions.

        (a)(2) Determination of Minimum Balance To Earn Dividends

    1. General. Credit unions may set minimum balance requirements that 
must be met in order to earn dividends. However, credit unions must use 
the same method to determine a minimum balance required to earn 
dividends as they use to determine the balance upon which dividends will 
accrue and pay. For example, a credit union that calculates dividends on 
the daily balance method must use the daily balance method to determine 
if the minimum balance to earn dividends has been met. Similarly, a 
credit union that calculates dividends on the average daily balance 
method must use the average daily balance method to determine if the 
minimum to earn dividends has been met. Credit unions may have a par 
value of a share that is different from the minimum balance requirement 
to earn dividends. (See commentary to Sec. 707.4(b)(3)(i)).
    2. Daily balance accounts. Credit unions that require a minimum 
balance to earn dividends may choose not to pay dividends for days when 
the balance drops below the required minimum balance if they use the 
daily balance method to calculate dividends. For example, a credit union 
could set a minimum daily balance level of $200 and pay dividends only 
those days the $200 daily balance is maintained.
    3. Average daily balance accounts. Credit unions that require a 
minimum balance to earn dividends may choose not to pay dividends for 
the average daily balance calculation period in which the average daily 
balance drops below the required minimum, if they use the average daily 
balance method to calculate dividends. For example, a credit union could 
set a minimum average daily balance level of $200 and pay dividends only 
if the $200 average daily balance is met for the calculation period.
    4. Beneficial method. Credit unions may not require members to 
maintain both a minimum daily balance and a minimum average daily 
balance to earn dividends, such as by requiring the member to maintain a 
$500 daily balance and a prescribed average daily balance (whether 
higher or lower). But a credit union could offer a minimum balance to 
earn dividends that includes an additional method that is 
``unequivocally beneficial'' to the member such as the following:
    i. A credit union using the daily balance method to calculate 
dividends and requiring a $500 minimum daily balance could choose to pay 
dividends on the account (for those days the minimum balance is not met) 
as long as the member maintained an average daily balance throughout the 
month of $400.
    ii. A credit union using the average daily balance method to 
calculate dividends and requiring a $400 minimum average daily balance 
could choose to pay dividends on the account as long as the member 
maintained a daily balance of $500 for at least half of the days in the 
period.
    iii. A credit union using either the daily balance method or average 
daily balance method to calculate dividends that requires: (A) a $500 
daily balance; or (B) a $400 average daily balance to pay dividends on 
the account.
    5. Paying on full balance. Credit unions must pay dividends on the 
full balance in the account that meets the required minimum balance. For 
example, if $300 is the minimum daily balance required to earn 
dividends, and a member deposits $500, the credit union must pay the 
stated dividend rate on the full $500 and not just on the $200.

[[Page 504]]

    6. Negative balances prohibited. Credit unions must treat a negative 
account balance as zero to determine:
    i. The daily or average daily balance on which dividends will be 
paid.
    ii. Whether any minimum balance to earn dividends is met. (See 
commentary to Appendix A, Part II, which prohibits credit unions from 
using negative balances in calculating the dividends figure for the 
annual percentage yield earned.)
    7. Club accounts. Credit unions offering club accounts (such as a 
``holiday'' or ``vacation'' club accounts) cannot impose a minimum 
balance requirement for dividends based on the total number or dollar 
amount of payments required under the club plan. For example, if a plan 
calls for $10 weekly payments for 50 weeks, the credit union cannot set 
a $500 minimum balance and then pay only if the member makes all 50 
payments.
    8. Minimum balances not affecting dividends. Credit unions may use 
the daily balance, average daily balance, or other computation method to 
calculate minimum balance requirements not involving the payment of 
dividends--such as to compute minimum balances for assessing fees.

                 (b) Compounding and Crediting Policies

    1. General. Credit unions choosing to compound dividends may 
compound or credit dividends annually, semi-annually, quarterly, 
monthly, daily, continuously, or on any other basis.
    2. Withdrawals prior to crediting date. If members withdraw funds 
(without closing the account), prior to a scheduled crediting date, 
credit unions may delay paying the accrued dividends on the withdrawn 
amount until the scheduled crediting date, but may not avoid paying 
dividends.
    3. Closed accounts. Subject to state or other law, a credit union 
may choose not to pay accrued dividends if members close an account 
prior to the date accrued dividends are credited, as long as the credit 
union has disclosed that fact. If accrued dividends are paid, accrued 
dividends must be paid on funds up until the account is closed or the 
account is deemed closed. For example, if an account is closed on a 
Tuesday, accrued dividends on the funds through Monday would be paid. 
Whether (and the conditions under which) credit unions are permitted to 
deem an account closed by a member is determined by state or other law, 
if any. Credit unions are cautioned that bylaw requirements may prevent 
a credit union from deeming a member's account closed until certain time 
periods are extinguished. (See NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. III, Sec. 
3. Such bylaw requirements may not be overridden without proper agency 
approval.)

                   (c) Date Dividends Begin To Accrue

    1. Relation to Regulation CC. Credit unions may rely on the 
Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) and Regulation CC (12 CFR part 
229) to determine, for example, when a deposit is considered made for 
purposes of dividend accrual, or when dividends need not be paid on 
funds because a deposited check is later returned unpaid.
    2. Ledger and collected balances. Credit unions may calculate 
dividends by using a ``ledger'' balance or ``collected'' balance method, 
as long as the crediting requirements of the EFAA are met (12 CFR 
229.14).
    3. Withdrawal of principal. Credit unions must accrue dividends on 
funds until the funds are withdrawn from the account. For example, if a 
check is debited to an account on a Tuesday, the credit union must 
accrue dividends on those funds through Monday.

                       Section 707.8--Advertising

               (a) Misleading or Inaccurate Advertisements

    1. General. All advertisements are subject to the rule against 
misleading or inaccurate advertisements, even though the disclosure 
applicable to various media differ. The word ``profit'' may be used when 
referring to dividend-bearing share accounts, as it reflects the nature 
of dividends. The word ``profit'' may not be used when referring to 
interest-bearing deposit accounts.
    2. Indoor signs. An indoor sign advertising an annual percentage 
yield is not misleading or inaccurate if:
    i. For a tiered-rate account, it also provides the upper and lower 
dollar amounts of the tier corresponding to the advertised annual 
percentage yield.
    ii. For a term share account, it also provides the term required to 
obtain the advertised annual percentage yield.
    3. ``Free'' or ``no cost'' accounts. For purposes of determining 
whether an account can be advertised as ``free'' or ``no cost,'' 
maintenance and activity fees include:
    i. Any fee imposed if a minimum balance requirement is not met, or 
if the member exceeds a specified number of transactions.
    ii. Transaction and service fees that members reasonably expect to 
be imposed on an account on a regular basis (see comments 4(b)(4)-1 and 
2).
    iii. A flat fee, such as a monthly service fee.
    iv. Fees imposed to deposit, withdraw or transfer funds, including 
per-check or per-transaction charges (for example, $.25 for each 
withdrawal, whether by check, in person).
    4. Other fees. Examples of fees that are not maintenance or activity 
fees include:
    i. Fees that are not required to be disclosed under Sec. 
707.4(b)(4).
    ii. Check printing fees of any type.

[[Page 505]]

    iii. Fees for obtaining copies of checks, whether or not the 
original checks have been truncated or returned to the member 
periodically.
    iv. Balance inquiry fees.
    v. Fees assessed against a dormant account.
    vi. Fees for using an ATM.
    vii. Fees for electronic transfer services that are not required to 
obtain an account, such as preauthorized transfers or home electronic 
credit union services.
    viii. Stop payment fees and fees for share drafts or checks returned 
unpaid.
    5. Similar terms. An advertisement may not use a term such as ``fees 
waived'' if a maintenance or activity fee may be imposed because it is 
similar to the terms ``free'' or ``no cost.''
    6. Specific account services. Credit unions may advertise a specific 
account service or feature as free as long as no fee is imposed for that 
service or feature. For example, credit unions offering an account that 
is free of deposit or withdrawal fees could advertise that fact, as long 
as the advertisement does not mislead members by implying that the 
account is free and that no other fee (a monthly service fee, for 
example) may be charged.
    7. Free for limited time. If an account (or a specific account 
service) is free only for a limited period of time--for example, for one 
year following the account opening--the account (or service) may be 
advertised as free as long as the time period is stated.
    8. Conditions not related to share accounts. Credit unions may 
advertise accounts as ``free'' for members that meet conditions not 
related to share accounts, such as the member's age. For example, credit 
unions may advertise a share draft account as ``free for persons over 65 
years old,'' even though a maintenance or activity fee may be assessed 
on accounts held by members that are 65 or younger.
    9. Electronic advertising. If an advertisement using electronic 
communication displays a triggering term (such as a bonus or annual 
percentage yield) the advertisement must clearly refer the member to the 
location where the additional required information begins. For example, 
an advertisement that includes a bonus or annual percentage yield may be 
accompanied by a link that directly takes the member to the additional 
information.
    10. Examples. Examples of advertisements that would ordinarily be 
misleading, inaccurate, or misrepresent the deposit contract are:
    i. Representing an overdraft service as a ``line of credit,'' unless 
the service is subject to 12 CFR part 226 (Regulation Z).
    ii. Representing that the credit union will honor all checks or 
authorize payment of all transactions that overdraw an account, with or 
without a specified dollar limit, when the credit union retains 
discretion at any time not to honor checks or authorize transactions.
    iii. Representing that members with an overdrawn account can 
maintain a negative balance when the terms of the account's overdraft 
service require members promptly to return the share account to a 
positive balance.
    iv. Describing a credit union's overdraft service solely as 
protection against bounced checks when the credit union also permits 
overdrafts for a fee for overdrawing their accounts by other means, such 
as ATM withdrawals, debit card transactions, or other electronic fund 
transfers.
    v. Advertising an account-related service for which the credit union 
charges a fee in an advertisement that also uses the word ``free'' or 
``no cost'' or a similar term to describe the account, unless the 
advertisement clearly and conspicuously indicates that there is a cost 
associated with the service. If the fee is a maintenance or activity fee 
under Sec. 707.8(a)(2) of this part, however, an advertisement may not 
describe the account as ``free'' or ``no cost'' or contain a similar 
term even if the fee is disclosed in the advertisement.

                          (b) Permissible Rates

    1. Tiered-rate accounts. An advertisement for a tiered-rate account 
that states an annual percentage yield must also state the annual 
percentage yield for each tier, along with corresponding minimum balance 
requirements. Any dividend rates stated must appear in conjunction with 
the annual percentage yields for each tier.
    2. Stepped-rate accounts. An advertisement that states a dividend 
rate for a stepped-rate account must state all the dividend rates and 
the time period that each rate is in effect.
    3. Representative examples. An advertisement that states an annual 
percentage yield for a type of account (such as a term share account for 
a specified term) need not state the annual percentage yield applicable 
to every variation offered by the credit union or indicate that other 
maturity terms are available. In an advertisement stating that rates for 
an account may vary depending on the amount of the initial deposit or 
the term of a term share account, credit unions need not list each 
balance level and term offered. Instead, the advertisement may:
    i. Provide a representative example of the annual percentage yields 
offered, clearly described as such. For example, if a credit union 
offers a $25 bonus on all term share accounts and the annual percentage 
yield will vary depending on the term selected, the credit union may 
provide a disclosure of the

[[Page 506]]

annual percentage yield as follows: ``For example, our 6-month share 
certificate currently pays a 3.15% annual percentage yield.''
    ii. Indicate that various rates are available, such as by stating 
short-term and longer-term maturities along with the applicable annual 
percentage yields: ``We offer share certificates with annual percentage 
yields that depend on the maturity you choose. For example, our one-
month share certificate earns a 2.75% APY. Or, earn a 5.25% APY for a 
three-year share certificate.''
    4. Electronic communication. A dividend rate may be stated only if 
it is provided in conjunction with, but not more conspicuously than, the 
annual percentage yield to which it relates. In an advertisement using 
electronic communication, the member must be able to view both rates 
simultaneously. This requirement is not satisfied if the member can view 
the annual percentage yield only by use of a link that connects the 
member to information appearing at another location.

              (c) When Additional Disclosures are Required

    1. Trigger terms. The following are examples of information stated 
in advertisements that are not ``trigger'' terms:
    i. ``One, three, and five year share certificates available''.
    ii. ``Bonus rates available''.
    iii. ``1% over our current rate,'' so long as the rates are not 
determinable from the advertisement.

             (c)(2) Time Annual Percentage Yield is Offered

    1. Specified recent date. If an advertisement discloses an annual 
percentage yield as of a specified date, that date must be recent in 
relation to the publication or broadcast frequency of the media used. 
For example, the printing date of a brochure printed once for an account 
promotion that will be in effect for six months would be considered 
``recent,'' even though rates change during the six-month period. 
Dividend rates published in a daily newspaper or on television must be a 
rate offered shortly before (or on) the date the rates are published or 
broadcast. Similarly, dividend rates published in a daily newspaper or 
on television must be a rate reflecting either the preceding dividend 
period, or a prospective rate, and the option chosen should be noted.
    2. Reference to date of publication. An advertisement may refer to 
the annual percentage yield as being accurate as of the date of 
publication, if the date is on the publication itself. For instance, an 
advertisement in a periodical may state that a rate is ``current through 
the date of this issue,'' if the periodical shows the date.

                          (c)(5) Effect of Fees

    1. Scope. This requirement applies only to maintenance or activity 
fees as described in paragraph 8(a).

                 (c)(6) Features of Term Share Accounts

                       (c)(6)(i) Time Requirements

    1. Club accounts. If a club account has a maturity date, but the 
term may vary depending on when the account is opened, credit unions may 
use a phrase such as: ``The maturity date of this club account is 
November 15; its term varies depending on when the account is opened.''

                  (c)(6)(ii) Early Withdrawal Penalties

    1. Discretionary penalties. Credit unions imposing early withdrawal 
penalties on a case-by-case basis may disclose that they ``may'' (rather 
than ``will'') impose a penalty if that accurately describes the account 
terms.

                               (d) Bonuses

    1. General reference to ``bonus.'' General statements such as 
``bonus checking'' or ``get a bonus when you open a checking account'' 
do not trigger the bonus disclosures.

                (e) Exemption for Certain Advertisements

                          (e)(1) Certain Media

                                (e)(1)(i)

    1. ATM messages. Messages provided on ATM or computer screens are 
eligible for this exemption.
    2. Internet advertisements. The exemption for advertisements made 
through broadcast or electronic media does not extend to advertisements 
made by electronic communication, such as advertisements posted on the 
Internet or sent by e-mail.

                               (e)(1)(iii)

    1. Tiered-rate accounts. Solicitations for tiered-rate accounts made 
through telephone response machines must provide all annual percentage 
yields and the balance requirements applicable to each tier.

                           (e)(2) Indoor Signs

                                (e)(2)(i)

    1. General. Indoor signs include advertisements displayed on 
computer screens, banners, preprinted posters, and chalk or peg boards. 
Any advertisement inside the premises that can be retained by a member 
(such as a brochure or a printout from a computer) is not an indoor 
sign.

                           (e)(3) Newsletters

    1. General. The partial exemption applies to all credit union 
newsletters, whether instituted before or after the compliance date of

[[Page 507]]

part 707. Nor must a newsletter be of any particular circulation 
frequency (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually, annually, or 
irregularly) or of any certain format (e.g. magazine, bulletin, 
broadside, circular, mimeograph, letter, or pamphlet) in order to be 
eligible for the partial advertising exemption.
    2. Permissible Distribution. In order for newsletters to retain the 
partial advertising exemption, newsletters can be sent to existing 
credit union members only. Any distribution reasonably calculated to 
reach only members is also acceptable, such as:
    i. Mailing newsletters to existing members.
    ii. Distributing newsletters at a function reasonably limited to 
members, such as an annual meeting or member picnic.
    iii. Displaying or offering newsletters at a credit union lobby, 
branch, or office.
    3. Impermissible Distribution. Distributing a newsletter in a place 
open to nonmembers, such as a sponsor's lunch room, is not reasonably 
calculated to reach only members, and such newsletter would be subject 
to all applicable advertising rules.

             Section 707.9--Enforcement and Record Retention

                          (c) Record Retention

    1. Evidence of required actions. Credit unions comply with the 
regulation by demonstrating they have done the following:
    i. Established and maintained procedures for paying dividends and 
providing timely disclosures as required by the regulation, and
    ii. Retained sample disclosures for each type account offered to 
members, such as account-opening disclosures, copies of advertisements, 
and change-in-term notices; and information regarding the dividend rates 
and annual percentage yields offered.
    2. Methods of retaining evidence. Credit unions must be able to 
reconstruct the required disclosures or other actions. They need not 
keep disclosures or other business records in hard copy. Records 
evidencing compliance may be retained on microfilm, microfiche, or by 
other methods that reproduce records accurately (including computer 
files). Credit unions must retain copies of all printed advertisements 
and the text of all advertisements conveyed by electronic or broadcast 
media, and newsletters.
    3. Payment of dividends. Credit unions must retain sufficient rate 
and balance information to permit the verification of dividends paid on 
an account, including the payment of dividends on the full principal 
balance.

                Section 707.10--Electronic Communication

                            (b) General Rule

    1. Relationship to the E-Sign Act. The E-Sign Act authorizes the use 
of electronic disclosures. It does not affect any requirement imposed 
under this part other than a provision that requires disclosures to be 
in paper form, and it does not affect the content or timing of 
disclosures. Electronic disclosures are subject to the regulation's 
format, timing, and retainability rules and the clear and conspicuous 
standard. For example, to satisfy the clear and conspicuous standard for 
disclosures, electronic disclosures must use visual text.
    2. Clear and conspicuous standard. A credit union must provide 
electronic disclosures using a clear and conspicuous format. Also, in 
accordance with the E-Sign Act:
    i. The credit union must disclose the requirements for accessing and 
retaining disclosures in that format;
    ii. The member must demonstrate the ability to access the 
information electronically and affirmatively consent to electronic 
delivery; and
    iii. The credit union must provide the disclosures in accordance 
with the specified requirements.
    3. Timing and effective delivery.
    i. When a member opens an account on-line. When a member opens an 
account on-line, the member must be required to access the disclosures 
required under Sec. 707.4 before the account is opened or a service is 
provided, whichever is earlier. A link to the disclosures satisfies the 
timing rule if the member cannot bypass the disclosures before opening 
the account. Or the disclosures in this example must automatically 
appear on the screen, even if multiple screens are required to view the 
entire disclosure. The credit union is not required to confirm that the 
member has read the disclosure.
    ii. For disclosures provided periodically. Disclosures provided by 
mail are timely based on when the disclosures are sent. Disclosures 
posted at an Internet web site, such as periodic statements or change-
in-terms and other notices, are timely when the credit union has both 
made the disclosures available and sent a notice alerting the member 
that the disclosures have been posted. For example, under Sec. 707.5, 
credit unions must give advance notice to affected members at least 30 
calendar days in advance of certain changes. For a change in terms 
notice posted on the Internet, a credit union must both post the notice 
and notify members of its availability at least 30 days in advance of 
the change.
    4. Retainability of disclosures. Credit unions satisfy the 
requirement that disclosures be in a form that the member may keep if 
electronic disclosures are delivered in a format that is capable of 
being retained (such as by

[[Page 508]]

printing or storing electronically). The format must also be consistent 
with the information required to be provided under Section 
101(c)(1)(C)(i) of the E-Sign Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001(c)(1)(C)(i)), about 
the hardware and software requirements for accessing and retaining 
electronic disclosures.
    5. Disclosures provided on credit union's equipment. A credit union 
that controls the equipment providing electronic disclosures to members 
(for example, a computer terminal located in a credit union's lobby or 
at a public kiosk) must ensure that the equipment satisfies the 
regulation's requirements to provide timely disclosures in a clear and 
conspicuous format and in a form that the member may keep. For example, 
if disclosures are required at the time of an on-line transaction, the 
disclosures must be sent to the member's e-mail address or must be 
posted at another location such as the credit union's Internet web site, 
unless the credit union provides a printer that automatically prints the 
disclosures.

       (d) Address Or Location To Receive Electronic Communication

                                 (d)(1)

    1. Electronic address. A member's electronic address is an e-mail 
address that is not limited to receiving communications transmitted 
solely by the credit union.

                                 (d)(2)

    1. Identifying account involved. A credit union may identify a 
specific account in a variety of ways and is not required to identify an 
account by reference to the account number. For example, where the 
member has only one share account, and no confusion would result, the 
credit union may refer to ``your share account.'' If the member has two 
accounts, the credit union may, for example, differentiate accounts by 
using terms such as ``primary account'' and ``secondary account'' or by 
using a truncated account number.
    2. 90-day rule. The actual disclosures provided to a member must be 
available for at least 90 days, but the credit union has discretion to 
determine whether they should be available at the same location for the 
entire period.

                             (e) Redelivery

    1. E-mail returned as undeliverable. If an e-mail to the member 
(containing an alert notice or other disclosure) is returned as 
undeliverable, the redelivery requirement is satisfied if, for example, 
the credit union sends the disclosure to a different e-mail address or 
postal address that the credit union has on file for the member. Sending 
the disclosures a second time to the same electronic address is not 
sufficient if the credit union has a different address for the member on 
file.

  Section 707.11--Additional disclosure requirements for credit unions 
                 advertising the payment of overdrafts.

                   (a) Periodic statement disclosures.

    (a)(1) Disclosure of total fees.
    1. Examples of credit unions advertising the payment of overdrafts. 
A credit union would trigger the periodic statement disclosures if it:
    i. Promotes the credit union's policy or practice of paying some 
overdrafts, unless the service would be subject to 12 CFR part 226 
(Regulation Z), in advertisements using broadcast media, brochures, 
telephone solicitations ,or electronic mail, or on Internet sites, ATM 
screens or receipts, billboards, or indoor signs. But see, Sec. 
707.11(a)(2) of this part regarding communications about the payment of 
overdrafts that would not trigger periodic statement disclosures;
    ii. Includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member 
of an overdraft limit or the amount of funds available for overdrafts. 
For example, a credit union that includes a message on a periodic 
statement informing the member of a $500 overdraft limit or that the 
member has $300 remaining on the overdraft limit, is promoting an 
overdraft service;
    iii. Discloses an overdraft limit or includes the dollar amount of 
an overdraft limit in a balance disclosed by any means, including on an 
ATM receipt or on an automated system, such as a telephone response 
machine, ATM screen, or the credit union's Internet site.
    2. Applicability of periodic statement disclosures. The periodic 
statement disclosures apply to all accounts for which the credit union 
has advertised the payment of overdrafts. For example, if an 
advertisement promoting the payment of overdrafts specifies the types of 
accounts to which the advertisement applies, the credit union would not 
be required to provide the periodic statement disclosures for other 
types of accounts offered by the credit union for which the 
advertisement does not apply. If an advertisement does not specify the 
types of accounts to which it applies, the advertisement would be 
considered to apply to all of a credit union's share accounts.
    3. Transfer services. The overdraft services covered by Sec. 
707.11(a)(1) of this part do not include a service providing for the 
transfer of funds from another share account of the member to permit the 
payment of items without creating an overdraft, even if a fee is charged 
for the transfer.
    4. Fees for paying overdrafts. A credit union that advertises the 
payment of overdrafts must disclose on periodic statements a total 
dollar amount for all fees charged to the account for paying overdrafts. 
The credit union

[[Page 509]]

must disclose separate totals for the statement period and for the 
calendar year to date. The total dollar amount includes per-item fees as 
well as interest charges, daily or other periodic fees, or fees charged 
for maintaining an account in overdraft status, whether the overdraft is 
by check or by other means. It also includes fees charged when there are 
insufficient funds because previously deposited funds are subject to a 
hold or are uncollected. It does not include fees for transferring funds 
from another account to avoid an overdraft, or fees charged when the 
credit union has previously agreed in writing to pay items that overdraw 
the account and the service is subject to 12 CFR part 226 (Regulation 
Z).
    5. Fees for returning items unpaid. A credit union that advertises 
the payment of overdrafts must disclose a total dollar amount for all 
fees charged to the account for dishonoring or returning checks or other 
items drawn on the account. The credit union must disclose separate 
totals for the statement period and for the calendar year to date. Fees 
imposed when deposited items are returned are not included.
    6. Waived fees. In some cases, a credit union may provide a 
statement for the current period reflecting that fees imposed during a 
previous period were waived and credited to the account. Credit unions 
may, but are not required to, reflect the adjustment in the total for 
the calendar year to date. Such adjustments should not affect the total 
disclosed for fees imposed during the current statement period.
    7. Totals for the calendar year to date. Some credit unions' 
statement periods do not coincide with the calendar month. In such 
cases, the credit union may disclose a calendar year-to-date total by 
aggregating fees for 12 monthly cycles, starting with the period that 
begins during January and finishing with the period that begins during 
December. For example, if statement periods begin on the 10th day of 
each month, the statement covering December 10, 2006 through January 9, 
2007 may disclose the year-to-date total for fees imposed from January 
10, 2006 through January 9, 2007. Alternatively, the credit union could 
provide a statement for the cycle ending January 9, 2007, showing the 
year-to-date total for fees imposed January 1, 2006 through December 31, 
2006.
    8. Itemization of fees. A credit union may itemize each fee in 
addition to providing the disclosures required by Sec. 707.11(a)(1) of 
this part.

                (a)(3) Time period covered by disclosures

    1. Periodic statement disclosures. The disclosures under Sec. 
707.11(a)(1) of this part must be included on periodic statements 
provided by a credit union reflecting the first statement period that 
begins after the credit union advertises the payment of overdrafts. For 
example, if a member's statement period typically closes on the 15th of 
each month, a credit union that promotes the payment of overdrafts on 
July 1, 2006, must provide the disclosures required by Sec. 
707.11(a)(1) of this part on subsequent periodic statements for that 
member beginning with the statement reflecting the period from July 16, 
2006 through August 15, 2006. Only credit unions that promote the 
payment of overdrafts in an advertisement on or after July 1, 2006 must 
provide disclosures on periodic statements under Sec. 707.11(a)(1) of 
this part.

                        (a)(5) Acquired accounts

    1. Examples. As provided in Sec. 707.11(a)(5) of this part, a 
credit union that acquires share accounts through merger must provide 
the disclosures required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the 
first statement period that begins after the credit union promotes the 
payment of overdrafts in an advertisement that applies to the acquired 
account. If the acquiring credit union does not advertise the payment of 
overdrafts, or the advertisement does not apply to the acquired 
accounts, the credit union need not provide the disclosures required by 
Sec. 707.11(a)(1) of this part for the acquired accounts, even if the 
credit union that previously held the accounts advertised the payment of 
overdrafts with respect to those accounts.

    (b) Advertising disclosures in connection with overdraft services

    1. Examples of credit unions promoting the payment of overdrafts. A 
credit union must include the advertising disclosures in Sec. 
707.11(b)(1) of this part if the credit union:
    i. Promotes the credit union's policy or practice of paying 
overdrafts, unless the service would be subject to 12 CFR part 226 
(Regulation Z). This includes advertisements using print media such as 
newspapers or brochures, telephone solicitations, electronic mail, or 
messages posted on an Internet site. But see, Sec. 707.11(b)(2) of this 
part for communications that are not subject to the additional 
advertising disclosures;
    ii. Includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member 
of an overdraft limit or the amount of funds available for overdrafts. 
For example, a credit union that includes a message on a periodic 
statement informing the member of a $500 overdraft limit or that the 
member has $300 remaining on the overdraft limit, is promoting an 
overdraft service.
    iii. Discloses an overdraft limit or includes the dollar amount of 
an overdraft limit in a balance disclosed on an automated system, such 
as a telephone response machine, ATM screen, or the credit union's 
Internet site. See, however, Sec. 707.11(b)(3) of this part.

[[Page 510]]

    2. Transfer services. The overdraft services covered by Sec. 
707.11(b)(1) of this part do not include a service providing for the 
transfer of funds from another share account of the member to permit the 
payment of items without creating an overdraft, even if a fee is charged 
for the transfer.
    3. Electronic media. The exception for advertisements made through 
broadcast or electronic media, such as television or radio, does not 
apply to advertisements posted on a credit union's Internet site, on an 
ATM screen, provided on telephone response machines, or sent by 
electronic mail.
    4. Fees. The fees that must be disclosed under Sec. 707.11(b)(1) of 
this part include per-item fees as well as interest charges, daily or 
other periodic fees, and fees charged for maintaining an account in 
overdraft status, whether the overdraft is by check or by other means. 
The fees also include fees charged when there are insufficient funds 
because previously deposited funds are subject to a hold or are 
uncollected. The fees do not include fees for transferring funds from 
another account to avoid an overdraft or fees charged when the credit 
union has previously agreed in writing to pay items that overdraw the 
account and the service is subject to 12 CFR part 226 (Regulation Z).
    5. Categories of transactions. An exhaustive list of transactions is 
not required. Disclosing that a fee may be imposed for covering 
overdrafts created by check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, or 
other electronic means would satisfy the requirements of Sec. 
707.11(b)(1)(ii) of this part where the fee may be imposed in these 
circumstances. See comment 4(b)(4)-5 of this part.
    6. Time period to repay. If a credit union reserves the right to 
require a member to pay an overdraft immediately or on demand instead of 
affording members a specific time period to establish a positive balance 
in the account, a credit union may comply with Sec. 707.11(b)(1)(iii) 
of this part by disclosing this fact.
    7. Circumstances for nonpayment. A credit union must describe the 
circumstances under which it will not pay an overdraft. It is sufficient 
to state, as applicable: ``Whether your overdrafts will be paid is 
discretionary and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we 
typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing, 
or you are not making regular deposits, or you have too many 
overdrafts.''
    8. Advertising an account as ``free.'' If the advertised account-
related service is an overdraft service subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 707.11(b)(1) of this part, credit unions must disclose the fee or 
fees for the payment of each overdraft, not merely that a cost is 
associated with the overdraft service, as well as other required 
information. Compliance with comment 8(a)--10.v is not sufficient.

       Appendix A to Part 707--Annual Percentage Yield Calculation

Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising 
                                Purposes

    1. Rounding for calculations. The following are examples of 
permissible rounding rules for calculating dividends and the annual 
percentage yield:
    i. The daily rate applied to a balance carried to five or more 
decimals. For example; .008219178%, 3.00% for a 365 day year, would be 
rounded to no less than .00822%.
    ii. The daily dividends or interest earned carried to five or more 
decimals. For example; $.08219178082, daily dividends on $1,000 at 3% 
for a 365 day year, would be rounded to no less than $.08219.
    2. Exponents in a leap year. The annual percentage yield formula's 
exponent numerator will remain 365 in leap years. The ``days in term'' 
figure used in the denominator should be consistent with the length of 
term used in the dividends calculation.
    3. First tier of a tiered-rate account. When credit unions use a 
rate table, the first tier of a tiered rate account is to be disclosed 
and advertised; ``Up to but not exceeding * * * '', ``$.01 to * * * '', 
or similar language.
    4. Term Share Accounts Opened in Midterm. For club accounts that 
meet the definition of a term share account, the annual percentage yield 
is based on the maximum number of days in the term not to exceed 365 
days (or 366 days in a leap year).

     Part II. Annual Percentage Yield Earned for Periodic Statements

    1. Balance method. The dividend or interest figure used in the 
calculation of the annual percentage yield earned may be derived from 
the daily balance method or the average daily balance method. Regardless 
of the dividend calculation method, the balance used in the annual 
percentage yield earned formula is the average daily balance. The 
average daily balance calculation is the sum of the balances for each 
day in the period divided by the number of days in the period. The 
balance for each day is based on a point in time; i.e. beginning of day 
balance, end of day balance, closing of day balance, etc. Each day's 
balance, for dividend accrual and payment purposes, must be based on the 
same point in time and cannot be based on the day's low balance.
    2. Negative balances prohibited. Credit unions must treat a negative 
account balance as zero to determine the balance on which the annual 
percentage yield earned is calculated. (See commentary to Sec. 
707.7(a)(2).)

[[Page 511]]

                           A. General Formula

    1. Accrued but uncredited dividends. To calculate the annual 
percentage yield earned, accrued but uncredited dividends:
    i. May not be included in the balance for statements that are issued 
at the same time or less frequently than the account's compounding and 
crediting frequency. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an 
account that compounds dividends daily and credits dividends monthly, 
the balance may not be increased each day to reflect the effect of daily 
compounding. Assume a credit union will pay $13.70 in dividends on 
$100,000 for the first day, $6.85 in dividends on $50,013.70 for the 
second day, and $3.43 in dividends on $25,020.55 for the third day. The 
sum of each days balance is $175,000 (does not include accrued, but 
uncredited, dividends amounts $13.70, $6.85, and $3.43), thereby 
resulting in an average daily balance for the three days of $58,333.33.
    ii. Must be included in the balance for succeeding statements if a 
statement is issued more frequently than compounded dividends is 
credited on an account. For example, if monthly statements are sent for 
an account that compounds dividends daily and credits dividends 
quarterly, the balance for the second monthly statement would include 
dividends that had accrued for the prior month. Assume a credit union 
will pay $411.78 in dividends on 30 days of $100,000, $427.28 in 
dividends on 31 days of $100,411.78, and $415.23 in dividends on 30 days 
of $100,839.06. The balance (average daily balance in the account for 
the period) for the second 31 days is $100,411.78.
    2. Rounding. The dividends earned figure used to calculate the 
annual percentage yield earned must be rounded to two decimals to 
reflect the amount actually paid. For example, if the dividends earned 
for a statement period is $20.074 and the credit union pays the member 
$20.07, the credit union must use $20.07 (not $20.074) to calculate the 
annual percentage yield earned. For accounts that pay dividends based on 
the daily balance method, compound and credit dividends or interest 
quarterly, and send monthly statements, the credit union may, but need 
not, round accrued dividends to two decimals for calculating the 
``projected'' or ``anticipated'' annual percentage yield earned on the 
first two monthly statements issued during the quarter. However, on the 
quarterly statement the dividends earned figure must reflect the amount 
actually paid.
    3. Compounding frequency using the average daily balance method. Any 
compounding frequency, including daily compounding, can be used when 
calculating dividends using the average daily balance method. (See 
comment 707.7(b), which does not require credit unions to compound or 
credit dividends at any particular frequency).

 B. Special Formula for Use Where Periodic Statement is Sent More Often 
           Than the Period for Which Dividends are Compounded

    1. Statements triggered by Regulation E. Credit unions may, but need 
not, use this formula to calculate the annual percentage yield earned 
for accounts that receive quarterly statements and that are subject to 
Regulation E's rule calling for monthly statements when an electronic 
fund transfer has occurred. They may do so even though no monthly 
statement was issued during a specific quarter. This formula must be 
used for accounts that compound and credit dividends quarterly and that 
receive monthly statements, triggered by Regulation E, which comply with 
the provisions of Sec. 707.6.
    2. Days in compounding period. Credit unions using the special 
annual percentage yield earned formula must use the actual number of 
days in the compounding period.

         Appendix B to Part 707--Model Clauses and Sample Forms

    1. Modifications. Credit unions that modify the model clauses will 
be deemed in compliance as long as they do not delete information 
required by TISA or regulation or rearrange the format so as to affect 
the substance or clarity of the disclosures.
    2. Format. Credit unions may use inserts to a document (see Sample 
Form B-11) or fill-in blanks (see Sample Forms B-4 and B-5, which use 
double underlining to indicate terms that have been filled in) to show 
current rates, fees or other terms.
    3. Disclosures for opening accounts. The sample forms illustrate the 
information that must be provided to a member when an account is opened, 
as required by Sec. 707.4(a)(1). (See Sec. 707.4(a)(2), which states 
the requirements for disclosing the annual percentage yield, the 
dividend rate, and the maturity of a term share account in responding to 
a member's request.)
    4. Compliance with Regulation E. Credit unions may satisfy certain 
requirements under Part 707 with disclosures that meet the requirements 
of Regulation E. (See Sec. 707.3(c).) The model clauses and sample 
forms do not give examples of disclosures that would be covered by both 
this regulation and Regulation E (such as disclosing the amount of a fee 
for ATM usage). Credit unions should consult appendix A to Regulation E 
for appropriate model clauses.
    5. Duplicate disclosures. If a requirement such as a minimum balance 
applies to more than one account term (to obtain a bonus and determine 
the annual percentage yield, for example), credit unions need not repeat 
the requirement for each term, as long as it

[[Page 512]]

is clear which terms the requirement applies to.
    6. Guide to model clauses. In the model clauses, italicized words 
indicate the type of disclosure a credit union should insert in the 
space provided (for example, a credit union might insert ``March 25, 
1995'' in the blank for ``(date)'' disclosure). Brackets and diagonals 
(``/'') indicate a credit union must choose the alternative that 
describes its practice (for example, [daily balance/average daily 
balance]).
    7. Sample forms. The sample forms (B-4 through B-11) serve a purpose 
different from the model clauses. They illustrate various ways of 
adapting the model clauses to specific accounts. The clauses shown 
relate only to the specific transactions described.

without the prior approval of the NCUA, subject to applicable law 
governing mutual savings banks and savings associations and the other 
requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.3  Board of directors' approval and members' opportunity to comment.

    (a) A credit union's board of directors must comply with the 
following notice requirements before voting on a proposal to convert.
    (1) No later than 30 days before a board of directors votes on a 
proposal to convert, it must publish a notice in a general circulation 
newspaper, or in multiple newspapers if necessary, serving all areas 
where the credit union has an office, branch, or service center. It must 
also post the notice in a clear and conspicuous fashion in the lobby of 
the credit union's home office and branch offices and on the credit 
union's Web site, if it has one. If the notice is not on the home page 
of the Web site, the home page must have a clear and conspicuous link, 
visible on a standard monitor without scrolling, to the notice.

[[Page 513]]

    (2) The public notice must include the following:
    (i) The name and address of the credit union;
    (ii) The type of institution to which the credit union's board is 
considering a proposal to convert;
    (iii) A brief statement of why the board is considering the 
conversion and the major positive and negative effects of the proposed 
conversion;
    (iv) A statement that directs members to submit any comments on the 
proposal to the credit union's board of directors by regular mail, 
electronic mail, or facsimile;
    (v) The date on which the board plans to vote on the proposal and 
the date by which members must submit their comments for consideration, 
which may not be more than 5 days before the board vote;
    (vi) The street address, electronic mail address, and facsimile 
number of the credit union where members may submit comments; and
    (vii) A statement that, in the event the board approves the proposal 
to convert, the proposal will be submitted to the membership of the 
credit union for a vote following a notice period that is no shorter 
than 90 days.
    (3) The board of directors must approve publication of the notice.
    (b) The credit union must collect member comments and retain copies 
at the credit union's main office until the conversion process is 
completed.
    (c) The board of directors may vote on the conversion proposal only 
after reviewing and considering all member comments. The conversion 
proposal may only be approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of 
board members who have determined the conversion is in the best 
interests of the members. If approved, the board of directors must set a 
date for a vote on the proposal by the members of the credit union.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.4  Disclosures and communications to members.

    (a) After the board of directors has complied with Sec. 708a.3 and 
approves a conversion proposal, the credit union must provide written 
notice of its intent to convert to each member who is eligible to vote 
on the conversion. The notice to members must be submitted 90 calendar 
days, 60 calendar days, and 30 calendar days before the date of the 
membership vote on the conversion. A ballot must be included in the same 
envelope as the 30-day notice and only in the 30-day notice. A 
converting credit union may not distribute ballots with either the 90-
day or 60-day notice, in any other written communications, or in person 
before the 30-day notice is sent.
    (b)(1) The notice to members must adequately describe the purpose 
and subject matter of the vote to be taken at the special meeting or by 
submission of the written ballot. The notice must clearly inform members 
that they may vote at the special meeting or by submitting the written 
ballot. The notice must state the date, time, and place of the meeting.
    (2) The notices that are submitted 90 and 60 days before the 
membership vote on the conversion must state in a clear and conspicuous 
fashion that a written ballot will be mailed together with another 
notice 30 days before the date of the membership vote on conversion. The 
notice submitted 30 days before the membership vote on the conversion 
must state in a clear and conspicuous fashion that a written ballot is 
included in the same envelope as the 30-day notice materials.
    (3) For purposes of facilitating the member-to-member contact 
described in paragraph (f) of this section, the 90-day notice must 
indicate the number of credit union members eligible to vote on the 
conversion proposal and state how many members have agreed to accept 
communications from the credit union in electronic form. The 90-day 
notice must also include the information listed in paragraph (f)(9) of 
this section.
    (4) The member ballot must include:
    (i) A brief description of the proposal (e.g., ``Proposal: Approval 
of the Plan Charter Conversion by which (insert name of credit union) 
will convert its charter to that of a federal mutual savings bank.'');
    (ii) Two blocks marked respectively as ``FOR'' and ``AGAINST;'' and
    (ii) The following language: ``A vote FOR the proposal means that 
you want your credit union to become a mutual

[[Page 514]]

savings bank. A vote AGAINST the proposal means that you want your 
credit union to remain a credit union.'' This language must be displayed 
in a clear and conspicuous fashion immediately beneath the FOR and 
AGAINST blocks.
    (5) The ballot may also include voting instructions and the 
recommendation of the board of directors (i.e., ``Your Board of 
Directors recommends a vote FOR the Plan of Conversion'') but may not 
include any further information without the prior written approval of 
the Regional Director.
    (c) An adequate description of the purpose and subject matter of the 
member vote on conversion, as required by paragraph (b) of this section, 
must include:
    (1) A clear and conspicuous disclosure that the conversion from a 
credit union to a mutual savings bank could lead to members losing their 
ownership interests in the credit union if the mutual savings bank 
subsequently converts to a stock institution and the members do not 
become stockholders;
    (2) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how a conversion from a 
credit union to a mutual savings bank will affect members' voting rights 
and if the mutual savings bank intends to base voting rights on account 
balances;
    (3) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of any conversion-related 
economic benefit a director or senior management official will or may 
receive including receipt of or an increase in compensation and an 
explanation of any foreseeable stock-related benefits associated with a 
subsequent conversion to a stock institution or mutual holding company 
structure. The explanation of stock-related benefits must include a 
comparison of the opportunities to acquire stock available to officials 
and employees with those opportunities available to the general 
membership;
    (4) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how the conversion from a 
credit union to a mutual savings bank will affect the institution's 
ability to make non-housing-related consumer loans because of a mutual 
savings bank's obligations to satisfy certain lending requirements as a 
mutual savings bank. This disclosure should specify possible reductions 
in some kinds of loans to members; and
    (5) An affirmative statement that, at the time of conversion to a 
mutual savings bank, the credit union does or does not intend to convert 
to a stock institution or a mutual holding company structure.
    (d)(1) A converting credit union must provide the following 
disclosures in a clear and conspicuous fashion with the 90-, 60-, and 
30-day notices it sends to its members regarding the conversion:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
             IMPORTANT REGULATORY DISCLOSURE ABOUT YOUR VOTE
The National Credit Union Administration, the federal government agency
 that supervises credit unions, requires [insert name of credit union]
 to provide the following disclosures:
1. LOSS OF CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP. A vote ``FOR'' the proposed
 conversion means you want your credit union to become a mutual savings
 bank. A vote ``AGAINST'' the proposed conversion means you want your
 credit union to remain a credit union.
2. RATES ON LOANS AND SAVINGS. If your credit union converts to a bank,
 you may experience changes in your loan and savings rates. Available
 historic data indicates that, for most loan products, credit unions on
 average charge lower rates than banks. For most savings products,
 credit unions on average pay higher rates than banks.
3. POTENTIAL PROFITS BY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. Conversion to a mutual
 savings bank is often the first step in a two-step process to convert
 to a stock-issuing bank or holding company structure. In such a
 scenario, the officers and directors of the institution often profit by
 obtaining stock in excess of that available to other members.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) This text must be placed in a box, must be the only text on the 
front side of a single piece of paper, and must be placed so that the 
member will see the text after reading the credit union's cover letter 
but before reading any other part of the member notice. The back side of 
the paper must be blank. A converting credit union may modify this text 
only with the prior written

[[Page 515]]

consent of the Regional Director and, in the case of a state-chartered 
credit union, the appropriate state regulatory agency.
    (e) All written communications from a converting credit union to its 
members regarding the conversion must be written in a manner that is 
simple and easy to understand. Simple and easy to understand means the 
communications are written in plain language designed to be understood 
by ordinary consumers and use clear and concise sentences, paragraphs, 
and sections. For purposes of this part, examples of factors to be 
considered in determining whether a communication is in plain language 
and uses clear and concise sentences, paragraphs and sections include 
the use of short explanatory sentences; use of definite, concrete, 
everyday words; use of active voice; avoidance of multiple negatives; 
avoidance of legal and technical business terminology; avoidance of 
explanations that are imprecise and reasonably subject to different 
interpretations; and use of language that is not misleading.
    (f)(1) A converting credit union must mail or e-mail a requesting 
member's proper conversion-related materials to other members eligible 
to vote if:
    (i) A credit union's board of directors has adopted a proposal to 
convert;
    (ii) A member makes a written request that the credit union mail or 
e-mail materials for the member;
    (iii) The request is received by the credit union no later than 35 
days after it sends out the 90-day member notice; and
    (iv) The requesting member agrees to reimburse the credit union for 
the reasonable expenses, excluding overhead, of mailing or e-mailing the 
materials and also provides the credit union with an appropriate advance 
payment.
    (2) A member's request must indicate if the member wants the 
materials mailed or e-mailed. If a member requests that the materials be 
mailed, the credit union will mail the materials to all eligible voters. 
If a member requests the materials be e-mailed, the credit union will e-
mail the materials to all members who have agreed to accept 
communications electronically from the credit union. The subject line of 
the credit union's e-mail will be ``Proposed Credit Union Conversion--
Views of Member (insert member name).''
    (3) (i) A converting credit union may, at its option, include the 
following statement with a member's material:

    On (date), the board of directors of (name of converting credit 
union) adopted a proposal to convert from a credit union to a mutual 
savings bank. Credit union members who wish to express their opinions 
about the proposed conversion to other members may provide those 
opinions to (name of credit union). By law, the credit union, at the 
requesting members' expense, must then send those opinions to the other 
members. The attached document represents the opinion of a member of 
this credit union. This opinion is a personal opinion and does not 
necessarily reflect the views of the management or directors of the 
credit union.

    (ii) A converting credit union may not add anything other than this 
statement to a member's material without the prior approval of the 
Regional Director.
    (4) The term ``proper conversion-related materials'' does not 
include materials that:
    (i) Due to size or similar reasons are impracticable to mail or e-
mail;
    (ii) Are false or misleading with respect to any material fact;
    (iii) Omit a material fact necessary to make the statements in the 
material not false or misleading;
    (iv) Relate to a personal claim or a personal grievance, or solicit 
personal gain or business advantage by or on behalf of any party;
    (v) Relate to any matter, including a general economic, political, 
racial, religious, social, or similar cause, that is not significantly 
related to the proposed conversion;
    (vi) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation 
impugn a person's character, integrity, or reputation;
    (vii) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual 
foundation make charges concerning improper, illegal, or immoral 
conduct; or
    (viii) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual 
foundation make statements impugning the stability and soundness of the 
credit union.
    (5) If a converting credit union believes some or all of a member's 
request is not proper it must submit the

[[Page 516]]

member materials to the Regional Director within seven days of receipt. 
The credit union must include with its transmittal letter a specific 
statement of why the materials are not proper and a specific 
recommendation for how the materials should be modified, if possible, to 
make them proper. The Regional Director will review the communication, 
communicate with the requesting member, and respond to the credit union 
within seven days with a determination on the propriety of the 
materials. The credit union must then immediately mail or e-mail the 
material to the members if so directed by NCUA.
    (6) A credit union must ensure that its members receive all 
materials that meet the requirements of Sec. 708a.4(f) on or before the 
date the members receive the 30-day notice and associated ballot. If a 
credit union cannot meet this delivery requirement, it must postpone 
mailing the 30-day notice until it can deliver the member materials. If 
a credit union postpones the mailing of the 30-day notice, it must also 
postpone the special meeting by the same number of days. When the credit 
union has completed the delivery, it must inform the requesting member 
that the delivery was completed and provide the number of recipients.
    (7) The term ``appropriate advance payment'' means:
    (i) For requests to mail materials to all eligible voters, a payment 
in the amount of 150% of the first class postage rate times the number 
of mailings, and
    (ii) For requests to e-mail materials only to members that have 
agreed to accept electronic communications, a payment in the amount of 
200 dollars.
    (8) If a credit union posts conversion-related information or 
material on its Web site, then it must simultaneously make a portion of 
its Web site available free of charge to its members to post and share 
their opinions on the conversion. A link to the portion of the Web site 
available to members to post their views on the conversion must be 
marked ``Members: Share your views on the proposed conversion and see 
other members views'' and the link must also be visible on all pages on 
which the credit union posts its own conversion-related information or 
material, as well as on the credit union's homepage. If a credit union 
believes a particular member submission is not proper for posting, it 
will provide that submission to the Regional Director for review as 
described in paragraph (f)(5) of this section. The credit union may also 
post a content-neutral disclaimer using language similar to the language 
in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.
    (9) A converting credit union must inform members with the 90-day 
notice that if they wish to provide their opinions about the proposed 
conversion to other members they can submit their opinions in writing to 
the credit union no later than 35 days from the date of the notice and 
the credit union will forward those opinions to other members. The 90-
day notice will provide a contact at the credit union for delivery of 
communications, will explain that members must agree to reimburse the 
credit union's costs of transmitting the communication including 
providing an advance payment, and will refer members to this section of 
NCUA's rules for further information about the communication process. 
The credit union, at its option, may include additional factual 
information about the communication process with its 90-day notice.
    (10) A group of members may make a joint request that the credit 
union send its materials to other members. For purposes of paragraphs 
(f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, the credit union will use the group 
name provided by the group.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.5  Notice to NCUA.

    (a) If a converting credit union's board of directors approves a 
proposal to convert, it must provide the Regional Director with notice 
of its intent to convert during the 90 calendar day period preceding the 
date of the membership vote on the conversion.
    (1) A credit union must give notice to the Regional Director of its 
intent to convert by providing a letter describing the material features 
of the conversion or a copy of the filing the credit union has made or 
intends to make with another federal or state regulatory agency in which 
the credit union seeks that agency's approval of

[[Page 517]]

the conversion. A credit union must include with the notice to the 
Regional Director copies of the notices the credit union has provided or 
intends to provide to members under Sec. Sec. 708a.3 and 708a.4. The 
credit union must also include a copy of the ballot form and all written 
materials the credit union has distributed or intends to distribute to 
members. The term ``written materials'' includes written documentation 
or information of any sort, including electronic communications posted 
on a Web site or transmitted by electronic mail.
    (2) As part of its notice to NCUA of intent to convert, the credit 
union's board of directors must provide the Regional Director with a 
certification of its support for the conversion proposal and plan. Each 
director who voted in favor of the conversion proposal must sign the 
certification. The certification must contain the following:
    (i) A statement that each director signing the certification 
supports the proposed conversion and believes the proposed conversion is 
in the best interests of the members of the credit union;
    (ii) A description of all materials submitted to the Regional 
Director with the notice and certification;
    (iii) A statement that each board member signing the certification 
has examined all these materials carefully and these materials are true, 
correct, current, and complete as of the date of submission; and
    (iv) An acknowledgement that federal law (18 U.S.C. 1001) prohibits 
any misrepresentations or omissions of material facts, or false, 
fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations made with respect 
to the certification or the materials provided to the Regional Director 
or any other documents or information provided to the members of the 
credit union or NCUA in connection with the conversion.
    (3) A state-chartered credit union must state as part of the notice 
required by Sec. 708a.5(a) if its state chartering law permits it to 
convert to a mutual savings bank and provide the specific legal 
citation. A state-chartered credit union will remain subject to any 
state law requirements for conversion that are more stringent than those 
this part imposes, including any internal governance requirements, such 
as the requisite membership vote for conversion and the determination of 
a member's eligibility to vote. If a state-chartered credit union relies 
for its authority to convert to a mutual savings bank on a state law 
parity provision, meaning a provision in state law permitting a state-
chartered credit union to operate with the same or similar authority as 
a federal credit union, it must:
    (i) Include in its notice a statement that its state regulatory 
authority agrees that it may rely on the state law parity provision as 
authority to convert; and
    (ii) Indicate its state regulatory authority's position as to 
whether federal law and regulations or state law will control internal 
governance issues in the conversion such as the requisite membership 
vote for conversion and the determination of a member's eligibility to 
vote.
    (b) If it chooses, a credit union may seek a preliminary 
determination from the Regional Director regarding any of the notices 
required under this part and its proposed methods and procedures 
applicable to the membership conversion vote. The Regional Director will 
make a preliminary determination regarding the notices and methods and 
procedures applicable to the membership vote within 30 calendar days of 
receipt of a credit union's request for review unless the Regional 
Director extends the period as necessary to request additional 
information or review a credit union's submission. A credit union's 
prior submission of any notice or proposed voting procedures does not 
relieve the credit union of its obligation to certify the results of the 
membership vote required by Sec. 708a.6 or eliminate the right of the 
Regional Director to disapprove the actual methods and procedures 
applicable to the membership vote if the credit union fails to conduct 
the membership vote in a fair and legal manner consistent with the 
Federal Credit Union Act and these rules.

[[Page 518]]

    (c) After receiving the notice described in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the Regional Director will contact and consult with the 
appropriate State Supervisory Authority.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.6  Membership approval of a proposal to convert.

    (a) A proposal for conversion approved by a board of directors 
requires approval by a majority of the members who vote on the proposal.
    (b) The board of directors must set a voting record date to 
determine member voting eligibility that is at least one day before the 
publication of notice required in Sec. 708a.3.
    (c) A member may vote on a proposal to convert in person at a 
special meeting held on the date set for the vote or by written ballot 
filed by the member. The vote on the conversion proposal must be by 
secret ballot and conducted by an independent entity. The independent 
entity must be a company with experience in conducting corporate 
elections. No official or senior management official of the credit union 
or the immediate family members of any official or senior management 
official may have any ownership interest in or be employed by the 
independent entity.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.7  Certification of vote on conversion proposal.

    (a) The board of directors of the converting credit union must 
certify the results of the membership vote to the Regional Director 
within 10 calendar days after the vote is taken.
    (b) The certification must also include a statement that the notice, 
ballot and other written materials provided to members were identical to 
those submitted to NCUA pursuant to Sec. 708a.5. If the board cannot 
certify this, the board must provide copies of any new or revised 
materials and an explanation of the reasons for any changes.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.8  NCUA oversight of methods and procedures of membership vote.

    (a) The Regional Director will review the methods by which the 
membership vote was taken and the procedures applicable to the 
membership vote. The Regional Director will determine: if the notices 
and other communications to members were accurate, not misleading, and 
timely; the membership vote was conducted in a fair and legal manner; 
and the credit union has otherwise complied with part 708a.
    (b) After completion of this review, the Regional Director will 
issue a determination that the methods and procedures applicable to the 
membership vote are approved or disapproved. The Regional Director will 
issue this determination within 30 calendar days of receipt from the 
credit union of the certification of the result of the membership vote 
required under Sec. 708a.7 unless the Regional Director extends the 
period as necessary to request additional information or review the 
credit union's submission. Approval of the methods and procedures under 
this paragraph remains subject to a credit union fulfilling the 
requirements in Sec. 708a.10 for timely completion of the conversion.
    (c) If the Regional Director disapproves the methods by which the 
membership vote was taken or the procedures applicable to the membership 
vote, the Regional Director may direct that a new vote be taken.
    (d) A converting credit union may appeal the Regional Director's 
determination to the NCUA Board. The credit union must file the appeal 
within 30 days after receipt of the Regional Director's determination. 
The NCUA Board will act on the appeal within 90 days of receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.9  Other regulatory oversight of methods and procedures of membership vote.

    The federal or state regulatory agency that will have jurisdiction 
over the financial institution after conversion must verify the 
membership vote and may direct that a new vote be taken, if it 
disapproves of the methods by which the membership vote was taken or the 
procedures applicable to the membership vote.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.10  Completion of conversion.

    (a) After receipt of the approvals under Sec. 708a.8 and Sec. 
708a.9 the credit union may complete the conversion.

[[Page 519]]

    (b) The credit union must complete the conversion within one year of 
the date of receipt of NCUA approval under Sec. 708a.8. If a credit 
union fails to complete the conversion within one year the Regional 
Director will disapprove of the methods and procedures. The credit 
union's board of directors must then adopt a new conversion proposal and 
solicit another member vote if it still desires to convert.
    (c) The Regional Director may, upon timely request and for good 
cause, extend the one year completion period for an additional six 
months.
    (d) After notification by the board of directors of the mutual 
savings bank or mutual savings association that the conversion has been 
completed, the NCUA will cancel the insurance certificate of the credit 
union and, if applicable, the charter of a federal credit union.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.11  Limit on compensation of officials.

    No director or senior management official of an insured credit union 
may receive any economic benefit in connection with the conversion of a 
credit union other than compensation and other benefits paid to 
directors or senior management officials of the converted institution in 
the ordinary course of business.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.12  Voting incentives.

    If a converting credit union offers an incentive to encourage 
members to participate in the vote, including a prize raffle, every 
reference to such incentive made by the credit union in a written 
communication to its members must also state that members are eligible 
for the incentive regardless of whether they vote for or against the 
proposed conversion.


<R05>
Sec. 708a.13  Voting guidelines.

    A converting credit union must conduct its member vote on conversion 
in a fair and legal manner. NCUA provides the following guidelines as 
suggestions to help a credit union obtain a fair and legal vote and 
otherwise fulfill its regulatory obligations. These guidelines are not 
an exhaustive checklist and do not by themselves guarantee a fair and 
legal vote.
    (a) Applicability of state law. While NCUA's conversion rule applies 
to all conversions of federally insured credit unions, federally insured 
state-chartered credit unions (FISCUs) are also subject to state law on 
conversions. NCUA's position is that a state legislature or state 
supervisory authority may impose conversion requirements more stringent 
or restrictive than NCUA's. States that permit this kind of conversion 
may have substantive and procedural requirements that vary from federal 
law. For example, there may be different voting standards for approving 
a vote. While the Federal Credit Union Act requires a simple majority of 
those who vote to approve a conversion, some states have higher voting 
standards requiring two-thirds or more of those who vote. A FISCU should 
be careful to understand both federal and state law to navigate the 
conversion process and conduct a proper vote.
    (b) Eligibility to vote.
    (1) Determining who is eligible to cast a ballot is fundamental to 
any vote. No conversion vote can be fair and legal if some members are 
improperly excluded. A converting credit union should be cautious to 
identify all eligible members and make certain they are included on its 
voting list. NCUA recommends that a converting credit union establish 
internal procedures to manage this task.
    (2) A converting credit union should be careful to make certain its 
member list is accurate and complete. For example, when a credit union 
converts from paper recordkeeping to computer recordkeeping, some member 
names may not transfer unless the credit union is careful in this 
regard. This same problem can arise when a credit union converts from 
one computer system to another where the software is not completely 
compatible.
    (3) Problems with keeping track of who is eligible to vote can also 
arise when a credit union converts from a federal charter to a state 
charter or vice versa. NCUA is aware of an instance where a federal 
credit union used membership materials allowing two or more individuals 
to open a joint account and also allowed each to become a member. The 
federal credit

[[Page 520]]

union later converted to a state-chartered credit union that, like most 
other state-chartered credit unions in its state, used membership 
materials allowing two or more individuals to open a joint account but 
only allowed the first person listed on the account to become a member. 
The other individuals did not become members as a result of their joint 
account, but were required to open another account where they were the 
first or only person listed on the account. Over time, some individuals 
who became members of the federal credit union as the second person 
listed on a joint account were treated like those individuals who were 
listed as the second person on a joint account opened directly with the 
state-chartered credit union. Specifically, both of those groups were 
treated as non-members not entitled to vote. This example makes the 
point that a credit union must be diligent in maintaining a reliable 
membership list.
    (c) Scheduling the special meeting. NCUA's conversion rule requires 
a converting credit union to permit members to vote by written mail 
ballot or in person at a special meeting held for the purpose of voting 
on the conversion. Although most members may choose to vote by mail, a 
significant number may choose to vote in person. As a result, a 
converting credit union should be careful to conduct its special meeting 
in a manner conducive to accommodating all members wishing to attend, 
including selecting a meeting location that can accommodate the 
anticipated number of attendees and is conveniently located. The meeting 
should also be held on a day and time suitable to most members' 
schedules. A credit union should conduct its meeting in accordance with 
applicable federal and state law, its bylaws, Robert's Rules of Order or 
other appropriate parliamentary procedures, and determine before the 
meeting the nature and scope of any discussion to be permitted.
    (d) Voting incentives. Some credit unions may wish to offer 
incentives to members, such as entry to a prize raffle, to encourage 
participation in the conversion vote. The credit union must exercise 
care in the design and execution of such incentives.
    (1) The credit union should ensure that the incentive complies with 
all applicable state, federal, and local laws.
    (2) The incentive should not be unreasonable in size. The cost of 
the incentive should have a negligible impact on the credit union's net 
worth ratio and the incentive should not be so large that it distracts 
the member from the purpose of the vote. If the board desires to use 
such incentives, the cost of the incentive should be included in the 
directors' deliberation and determination that the conversion is in the 
best interests of the credit union's members.
    (3) The credit union should ensure that the incentive is available 
to every member that votes regardless of how or when he or she votes. 
All of the credit union's written materials promoting the incentive to 
the membership must disclose to the members, as required by Sec. 
708a.12 of this part, that they have an equal opportunity to participate 
in the incentive program regardless of whether they vote for or against 
the conversion. The credit union should also design its incentives so 
that they are available equally to all members who vote, regardless of 
whether they vote by mail or in person at the special meeting.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_Mergers


<R05>
Sec. 708b.101  Mergers generally.

    (a) In any case where a merger will result in the termination of 
federal insurance or conversion to nonfederal insurance, the merging 
credit union must comply with the provisions of subparts B and C of this 
part in addition to this subpart A.
    (b) A federally-insured credit union must have the prior written 
approval of the NCUA before merging with any other credit union.
    (c) Where the continuing credit union is a federal credit union, it 
must be in compliance with the chartering policies of the NCUA.
    (d) Where the continuing or merging credit union is a state credit 
union, the merger must be permitted by state law or authorized by the 
state authority.
    (e) Where both the merging and continuing credit unions are 
federally-insured and the two credit unions have overlapping fields of 
membership, the continuing credit union must, within three months after 
completion of the merger, either:
    (1) Notify all members of the continuing credit union of the 
potential loss of insurance coverage if they had overlapping membership,
    (2) Notify all individuals and entities that were actually members 
of both credit unions of the potential loss of insurance coverage, or
    (3) Determine which members of both credit unions may actually have 
uninsured funds six months after the merger and notify those members of 
the potential loss of insurance coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.102  Special provisions for federal insurance.

    (a) Where the continuing credit union is federally-insured, the 
NCUSIF will assess a deposit and a prorated insurance premium (unless 
waived in whole or in part for all insured credit unions during that 
year) on the additional share accounts insured as a result of the merger 
of a nonfederally-insured or uninsured credit union with a federally-
insured credit union.
    (b) Where the continuing credit union is nonfederally-insured or 
uninsured but desires to be federally-insured as of the date of the 
merger, it must submit an application to the appropriate Regional 
Director when the merging credit union requests approval of the merger 
proposal. If the Regional Director approves the merger, the NCUSIF will 
assess a deposit and a prorated insurance premium (unless waived in 
whole or in part for all insured credit unions during that year) on any 
additional share accounts insured as a result of the merger.
    (c) Where the continuing credit union is nonfederally-insured or 
uninsured and does not make application for insurance, but the merging 
credit union is federally-insured, the continuing credit union is 
entitled to a refund of the merging credit union's NCUSIF deposit and to 
a refund of the unused portion of the NCUSIF share insurance premium (if 
any). If the continuing credit union is uninsured, the NCUSIF will make 
the refund only after expiration of the one-year period of continued 
insurance coverage noted in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Where the continuing credit union is nonfederally-insured, 
NCUSIF insurance of the member accounts of a merging federally-insured 
credit union ceases as of the effective date of the merger.
    (e) Where the continuing credit union is uninsured, NCUSIF insurance 
of the member accounts of the merging federally-insured credit union 
will continue for a period of one year, subject to the restrictions in 
section 206(d)(1) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.103  Preparation of merger plan.

[[Page 523]]

    (2) Current delinquent loan summaries and analyses of the adequacy 
of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses account;
    (3) Consolidated financial statements, including an assessment of 
the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net worth of each 
credit union before the merger and the GAAP net worth of the continuing 
credit union after the merger;
    (4) Analyses of share values;
    (5) Explanation of any proposed share adjustments;
    (6) Explanation of any provisions for reserves, undivided earnings 
or dividends;

savings and loan protection insurance and insurance of member accounts;
    (9) Provisions for determining that all assets and liabilities of 
the continuing credit union will conform with the requirements of the 
Act (where the continuing credit union is a federal credit union); and
    (10) Proposed charter amendments (where the continuing credit union 
is a federal credit union). These amendments, if any, will usually 
pertain to the name of the credit union and the definition of its field 
of membership.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 708b.104  Submission of merger proposal to the NCUA.

    (a) Upon approval of the merger plan by the boards of directors of 
the credit unions, the credit unions must submit the following 
information to the Regional Director:
    (1) The merger plan, as described in this part;
    (2) Resolutions of the boards of directors;
    (3) Proposed Merger Agreement;
    (4) Proposed Notice of Special Meeting of the Members (for merging 
federal credit unions);
    (5) Copy of the form of Ballot to be sent to the members (for 
merging federal credit unions);
    (6) Evidence that the state's supervisory authority approves the 
merger proposal (for states that require such agreement before NCUA 
approval);
    (7) Application and Agreement for Insurance of Member Accounts (for 
continuing state credit unions desiring to become federally-insured);
    (8) If the merging credit union has $50 million or more in assets on 
its latest call report, a statement about whether the two credit unions 
intend to make a Hart-Scott-Rodino Act premerger notification filing 
with the Federal Trade Commission and, if not, an explanation why not; 
and
    (9) For mergers where the continuing credit union is not federally-
insured and will not apply for federal insurance:
    (i) A written statement from the continuing credit union that it 
``is aware of the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1831t(b), including all 
notification and acknowledgment requirements''; and
    (ii) Proof that the accounts of the credit union will be accepted 
for coverage by the nonfederal insurer (if the credit union will have

    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 708b.105  Approval of merger proposal by the NCUA.

    (a) In any case where the continuing credit union is federally-
insured and the merging credit union is nonfederally-insured or 
uninsured, the NCUA will determine the potential risk to the NCUSIF.
    (b) If the NCUA finds that the merger proposal complies with the 
provisions of this Part and does not present an undue risk to the 
NCUSIF, it may approve the proposal subject to any other specific 
requirements as it may prescribe to fulfill the intended purposes of the 
proposed merger. For mergers of federal credit unions into federally-
insured credit unions, if the NCUA determines that the merging credit 
union is in danger of insolvency and that the proposed merger would 
reduce the risk or avoid a threatened loss to the NCUSIF, the NCUA may 
permit the merger to become effective without an affirmative vote of the 
membership of the merging credit union otherwise required by Sec. 
708b.106 of this part.
    (c) NCUA may approve any proposed charter amendments for a 
continuing federal credit union contingent upon

[[Page 524]]

the completion of the merger. All charter amendments must be consistent 
with NCUA chartering policy.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.106  Approval of the merger proposal by members.

    (a) When the merging credit union is a federal credit union, the 
members must:
    (1) Have the right to vote on the merger proposal in person at the 
annual meeting, if within 60 days after NCUA approval, or at a special 
meeting to be called within 60 days of NCUA approval, or by mail ballot, 
received no later than the date and time announced for the annual 
meeting or the special meeting called for that purpose.
    (2) Be given advance notice of the meeting in accordance with the 
provisions of Article IV, Meetings of Members, Federal Credit Union 
Bylaws. The notice must:
    (i) Specify the purpose of the meeting and the time and place;
    (ii) Contain a summary of the merger plan, including, but not 
necessarily limited to, current financial statements for each credit 
union, a consolidated financial statement for the continuing credit 
union, analyses of share values, explanation of any proposed share 
adjustments, explanation of any changes relative to insurance such as 
life savings and loan protection insurance and insurance of member 
accounts;
    (iii) State reasons for the proposed merger;
    (iv) Provide name and location, including branches, of the 
continuing credit union;
    (v) Inform the members that they have the right to vote on the 
merger proposal in person at the meeting or by written ballot to be 
received no later than the date and time announced for the annual 
meeting or the special meeting called for that purpose; and
    (vi) Be accompanied by a Ballot for Merger Proposal.
    (b) Approval of a proposal to merge a federal credit union into a 
federally-insured credit union requires the affirmative vote of a 
majority of the members of the merging credit union who vote on the 
proposal. If the continuing credit union is uninsured or nonfederally-
insured, the voting requirements of subpart B apply. If the continuing 
credit union is nonfederally-insured, the merging credit union must use 
the form notice and ballot in subpart C of this part unless the Regional 
Director approves the use of different forms.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.107  Certificate of vote on merger proposal.

    The board of directors of the merging federal credit union must 
certify the results of the membership vote to the Regional Director 
within 10 days after the vote is taken. The certification must include 
the total number of members of record of the credit union, the number 
who voted on the merger, the number who voted in favor, and the number 
who voted against. If the continuing credit union is nonfederally-
insured, the merging credit union must use the certification form in 
subpart C of this part unless the Regional Director approves the use of 
a different form.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.108  Completion of merger.

    (a) Upon approval of the merger proposal by the NCUA and by the 
state supervisory authority (where the continuing or merging credit 
union is a state credit union) and by the members of each credit union 
where required, the credit unions may complete the merger.
    (b) Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of the 
continuing credit union must certify the completion of the merger to the 
Regional Director within 30 days after the effective date of the merger.
    (c) Upon the NCUA's receipt of certification that the merger has 
been completed, the NCUA will cancel the charter of the merging federal 
credit union (if applicable) and the insurance certificate of any 
merging federally-insured credit union.

     Subpart B_Voluntary Termination or Conversion of Insured Status


<R05>
Sec. 708b.201  Termination of insurance.

    (a) A state credit union may terminate federal insurance, if 
permitted by state law, either on its own or by merging into an 
uninsured credit union.
    (b) A federal credit union may terminate federal insurance only by 
merging

[[Page 525]]

into, or converting its charter to, an uninsured state credit union.
    (c) A majority of the credit union's members must approve a 
termination of insurance by affirmative vote. The credit union must use 
an independent entity to collect and tally the votes and certify the 
results for all terminations, including terminations that involve a 
merger or charter conversion. The vote must be taken by secret ballot, 
meaning that no credit union employee or official can determine how a 
particular member voted.
    (d) Termination of federal insurance requires the NCUA's prior 
written approval. A credit union must notify the NCUA and request 
approval of the termination through the Regional Director in writing at 
least 90 days before the proposed termination date and within one year 
after obtaining the membership vote. The notice to the NCUA must 
include:
    (1) A written statement from the credit union that it ``is aware of 
the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1831t(b), including all notification and 
acknowledgment requirements;'' and
    (2) A certification of the member vote that must include the total 
number of members of record of the credit union, the number who voted in 
favor of the termination, and the number who voted against.
    (e) The NCUA will approve or disapprove the termination in writing 
within 90 days after being notified by the credit union.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.202  Notice to members of proposal to terminate insurance.

    (a) When the board of directors of a federally-insured credit union 
adopts a resolution proposing to terminate federal insurance, including 
termination due to a merger or conversion of charter, it must provide 
its members with written notice of the proposal to terminate and of the 
date set for the membership vote. The first written communication 
following the resolution that is made by or on behalf of the credit 
union and that informs the members that the credit union will seek 
termination is the notice of the proposal to terminate. This notice 
must:
    (1) Inform the members of the requirement for a membership vote and 
the date for the vote;
    (2) Explain that the insurance provided by the NCUA is federal 
insurance and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United 
States government; and
    (3) Include a conspicuous statement that if the termination or 
merger is approved, and the credit union, or the continuing credit union 
in the case of a merger, subsequently fails, the federal government does 
not guarantee the member will get his or her money back.
    (b) The credit union must deliver the notice in person to each 
member, or mail it to each member at the address for the member as it 
appears on the records of the credit union, not more than 30 nor less 
than 7 days before the date of the vote. The membership must be given 
the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. The credit union may provide the 
notice of the proposal and the ballot to members at the same time.
    (c) If the membership and the NCUA approve the proposition for 
termination of insurance, the credit union must give the members prompt 
and reasonable notice of termination.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.203  Conversion of insurance.

    (a) A federally-insured state credit union may convert to nonfederal 
insurance, if permitted by state law, either on its own or by merging 
into a nonfederally-insured credit union.
    (b) A federal credit union may convert to nonfederal insurance only 
by merging into, or converting its charter to, a nonfederally-insured 
state credit union.
    (c) Conversion to nonfederal insurance requires the prior written 
approval of the NCUA. After the credit union board of directors resolves 
to seek a conversion, the credit union must notify the Regional Director 
promptly, in writing, of the desired conversion and request NCUA 
approval of the conversion. The notification must be in the form 
specified in subpart C of this part, unless the Regional Director 
approves a different form. The credit union must provide this 
notification and request for approval to the

[[Page 526]]

Regional Director at least 14 days before the credit union notifies its 
members and seeks their vote and at least 90 days before the proposed 
conversion date. NCUA will approve or disapprove the conversion as 
described in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (d) Approval of a conversion of federal to nonfederal insurance 
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the credit union's 
members who vote on the proposition, provided at least 20 percent of the 
total membership participates in the voting. The credit union must use 
an independent entity to collect and tally the votes and certify the 
results for all share insurance conversions, including share insurance 
conversions that involve a merger or charter conversion. The vote must 
be taken by secret ballot, meaning that no credit union employee or 
official can determine how a particular member voted.
    (e) For all conversions, the notice to the NCUA must include:
    (1) A written statement from the credit union that it ``it is aware 
of the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1831t(b), including all notification 
and acknowledgment requirements;'' and
    (2) Proof that the nonfederal insurer is authorized to issue share 
insurance in the state where the credit union is located and that the 
insurer will insure the credit union.
    (f) The board of directors of the credit union and the independent 
entity that conducts the membership vote must certify the results of the 
membership vote to the NCUA within 10 days after the deadline for 
receipt of votes. The certification must include the total number of 
members of record of the credit union, the number who voted on the 
conversion, the number who voted in favor of the conversion, and the 
number who voted against. The certification must be in the form 
specified in subpart C of this part.
    (g) Generally, the NCUA will approve or disapprove the conversion in 
writing within 14 days after receiving the certification of the vote.
    (h) For conversions by merger, the merging credit unions must follow 
the procedures specified in subparts A and B of this part and use the 
forms specified in subpart C of this part. In the event the procedures 
of Subpart A and B conflict, the credit union must follow subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.204  Notice to members of proposal to convert insurance.

    (a) When the board of directors of a federally-insured credit union 
adopts a resolution proposing to convert from federal to nonfederal 
insurance, including an insurance conversion associated with a merger or 
conversion of charter, it must provide its members with written notice 
of the proposal to convert insurance and of the date set for the 
membership vote. The first written communication following this

insurance is the notice of the proposal to convert. This notice must:
    (1) Inform the members of the requirement for a membership vote and 
the date for the vote;
    (2) Explain that the insurance provided by the NCUA is federal 
insurance and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United 
States government, while the insurance provided by the nonfederal 
insurer is not guaranteed by the federal or any state government;
    (3) Include a conspicuous statement that if the conversion or merger 
is approved, and the credit union, or the continuing credit union in the 
case of a merger, subsequently fails, the federal government does not 
guarantee the member will get his or her money back; and
    (4) Be in the form set forth in subpart C of this part, unless the 
Regional Director approves a different form.
    (b) The credit union must deliver the notice in person to each 
member or mail it to each member at the address for the member as it 
appears on the records of the credit union, not more than 30 nor less 
than 7 days before the date for the vote. The credit union must give the 
membership the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. The form of the 
ballot must be as set forth in subpart C of this part, unless the 
Regional Director approves the use of a

[[Page 527]]

different form. The notice of the proposal and the ballot may be 
provided to the members at the same time.
    (c) If the membership and the NCUA approve the proposition for 
conversion of insurance, the credit union will give prompt and 
reasonable notice to the membership. The credit union must deliver the 
notice at least 30 days before the effective date of the conversion. The 
notice must identify the effective date of the conversion, and the first 
page must also include a conspicuous statement (i.e., in bold and no 
smaller than any other font size used in the notice) that:
    (1) The conversion will result in the loss of federal share 
insurance, and
    (2) The credit union will, at any time before the effective date of 
conversion, permit all members who have share certificates or other term 
accounts to close the federally-insured portion of those accounts 
without an early withdrawal penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.205  Modifications to notice and ballot.

    (a) Converting credit unions will use the form notice and ballot as 
provided in subpart C of this part unless the Regional Director approves 
the use of a different form.
    (b) A converting credit union will provide the Regional Director 
with a copy of the notice and ballot, including any reasons for 
conversion and estimated costs of conversion, on or before the date the 
notice and ballot are mailed to the members.
    (c) Federally-insured state credit unions may include additional 
language in the notice and ballot regarding state requirements for 
mergers, where appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 708b.206  Share insurance communications to members.

    (a) Every share insurance communication must comply with Sec. 740.2 
of this chapter, which, in part, prohibits federally-insured credit 
unions from making any representation that is inaccurate or deceptive in 
any particular.
    (b) Every share insurance communication about share insurance 
conversion must contain the following conspicuous statement: ``IF YOU 
ARE A MEMBER OF THIS CREDIT UNION, YOUR ACCOUNTS ARE CURRENTLY INSURED 
BY THE NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION, A FEDERAL AGENCY. THIS 
FEDERAL INSURANCE IS BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED 
STATES GOVERNMENT. IF THE CREDIT UNION CONVERTS TO PRIVATE INSURANCE AND 
THE CREDIT UNION FAILS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT 
YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK.'' The statement must:
    (1) Appear on the first page of the communication where conversion 
is discussed and, if the communication is on an internet website 
posting, the credit union must make reasonable efforts to make it 
visible without scrolling; and
    (2) Must be in capital letters, bolded, offset from the other text 
by use of a border, and at least one font size larger than any other 
text (exclusive of headings) used in the communication.
    (c) Every share insurance communication about share insurance 
termination must contain the following conspicuous statement: ``IF YOU 
ARE A MEMBER OF THIS CREDIT UNION, YOUR ACCOUNTS ARE CURRENTLY INSURED 
BY THE NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION, A FEDERAL AGENCY. THIS 
FEDERAL INSURANCE IS BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED 
STATES GOVERNMENT. IF THE CREDIT UNION TERMINATES ITS FEDERAL INSURANCE 
AND THE CREDIT UNION FAILS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GUARANTEE 
THAT YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK.'' The statement must:
    (1) Appear on the first page of the communication where termination 
is discussed and, if the communication is on an internet website 
posting, the credit union must make reasonable efforts to make it 
visible without scrolling; and
    (2) Must be in capital letters, bolded, offset from the other text 
by use of a border, and at least one font size larger than any other 
text (exclusive of headings) used in the communication.
    (d) A converting credit union must provide the Regional Director 
with a

[[Page 528]]

copy of any share insurance communication that the credit union will 
make during the voting period. The Regional Director must receive the 
copy at or before the time the credit union makes it available to 
members. The converting credit union must inform the Regional Director 
when the communication is to be made, to which members it will be 
directed, and how it will be disseminated. For purposes of this section, 
the voting period begins on the date of the board of director's 
resolution to seek conversion or termination and ends on the date the 
member voting closes.
    (e) The Regional Director may take appropriate action, including 
disapproving a conversion, if he or she determines that a converting 
credit union, by inclusion or omission of information in a share 
insurance communication, materially mislead or misinformed its 
membership. For example, the Regional Director will treat any share 
insurance communication that compares the relative strength, safety, or 
claims paying ability of a private insurer with that of the National 
Credit Union Share Insurance Fund as materially misleading if the 
comparison fails to mention that the federal insurance provided by the 
NCUA is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States 
government.

    In accordance with federal law at Title 12, United States Code 
Section 1785(b)(1)(D), I request the National Credit Union 
Administration approve the conversion of (insert name of credit union) 
from federal share insurance to private primary share insurance with 
(insert name of private insurance company).
    On (insert date), the board of directors of (insert name of credit

private insurance. A copy of the resolution is enclosed.
    On (insert date), the credit union plans to solicit the vote of our 
members on the conversion. The credit union will employ (insert name, 
address, and telephone number of independent entity) to conduct the 
member vote. The credit union will use the form notice and ballot 
required by NCUA regulations, and will certify the results to NCUA as 
required by NCUA regulations.
    Aside from the notice and ballot, the credit union (does)(does not) 
intend to provide its members with additional written information about 
the conversion. I understand that NCUA regulations forbid any 
communications to members, including communications about NCUA insurance 
or private insurance, that are inaccurate or deceptive.
    (Insert name of State) allows credit unions to obtain primary share

Notice of Proposal to Convert to Nonfederally-Insured Status and Special 
                           Meeting of Members

                (Insert Name of Converting Credit Union)

    On (insert date), the board of directors of your credit union 
approved a proposition to convert from federal share (deposit) insurance 
to private insurance. You are encouraged to attend a special meeting of 
our credit union at (insert address) on (insert time and date) to 
address this proposition.

[[Page 529]]

                           Purpose of Meeting

    The meeting has two purposes:
    1. To consider and act upon a proposal to convert your account 
insurance from federal insurance to private insurance.
    2. To approve the action of the Board of Directors in authorizing 
the officers of the credit union to carry out the proposed conversion.

                          Insurance Conversion

    Currently, your accounts have share insurance provided by the 
National Credit Union Administration, an agency of the federal 
government. The basic federal coverage is up to $100,000, but accounts 
may be structured in different ways, such as joint accounts, payable-on-
death accounts, or IRA accounts, to achieve federal coverage of much 
more than $100,000. If the conversion is approved, your federal 
insurance will terminate on the effective date of the conversion. 
Instead, your accounts in the credit union will be insured up to 
$(insert dollar amount) by (insert name of insurer), a corporation 
chartered by the State of (insert name of State). The federal insurance 
provided by the National Credit Union Administration is backed by the 
full faith and credit of the United States government. The private 
insurance you will receive from (insert name of insurer), however, is 
not guaranteed by the federal or any state or local government.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
     IF THIS CONVERSION IS APPROVED, AND THE (insert name of credit
 
       union) FAILS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOU
 
                        WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Also, because this conversion, if approved, would result in the loss 
of federal share insurance, the credit union will, at any time between 
the approval of the conversion and the effective date of conversion and 
upon request by the member, permit all members who have share 
certificates or other term accounts to close the federally-insured 
portion of those accounts without an early withdrawal penalty. (This is 
an optional sentence. It may be deleted without the approval of the 
Regional Director. The members must be informed about this right, 
however, as described in 12 CFR 708b.204(c).)
    The board of directors has concluded that the proposed conversion is 
desirable for the following reasons: (insert reasons). (This is an 
optional paragraph. It may be deleted without the prior approval of the 
Regional Director.)
    The proposed conversion will result in the following one-time cost 
associated with the conversion: (List the total estimated dollar amount, 
including (1) the cost of conducting the vote, (2) the cost of changing 
the credit union's name and insurance logo, and (3) attorney and 
consultant fees.)
    The conversion must have the approval of a majority of members who 
vote on the proposal, provided at least 20 percent of the total 
membership participates in the voting.
    Enclosed with this Notice of Special Meeting is a ballot. If you 
cannot attend the meeting, please complete the ballot and return it to

federal insurance to private insurance. A copy of the resolution is 
enclosed.
    On (insert date), the credit union plans to solicit the vote of our 
members on the conversion. The credit union will employ (insert

name, address, and telephone number of independent entity) to conduct 
the vote. The credit union will use the form notice and ballot required 
by NCUA regulations, and will certify the results to NCUA as required by 
NCUA regulations.
    Aside from the notice and ballot, the credit union (does)(does not) 
intend to provide our members with additional written information about 
the conversion. I understand that NCUA regulations forbid any 
communications to members, including communications about NCUA insurance 
or private insurance, that are inaccurate or deceptive.
    I have enclosed a copy of a letter from (insert name and title of 
state regulator) indicating approval of our conversion to a state 
charter.
    (Insert name of State) allows credit unions to obtain primary share 
insurance from (insert name of private insurance company). I have 
enclosed a copy of a letter from (insert name and title of state 
regulator) establishing that (insert name of private insurer) has the 
authority to provide (insert name of credit union), after conversion to 
a state charter, with primary share insurance.
    I have enclosed a copy of a letter from (insert name of private 
insurer) indicating it has accepted (insert name of credit union) for 
primary share insurance and will insure the credit union immediately 
upon the date that it loses its federal share insurance.
    I am aware of the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1831t(b), including all 
notification and acknowledgment requirements.
    Enclosed you will also find other information required by NCUA's 
Chartering and Field of Membership Manual, Chapter 4, Sec. III.C.
    The point of contact for conversion matters is (insert name and

    (b) Form notice to members of intent to convert and special meeting 
of members:

  Notice of Proposal To Convert to a State Charter and to Nonfederally-
              Insured Status and Special Meeting of Members

                (Insert Name of Converting Credit Union)

    On (insert date), the board of directors of your credit union 
approved a proposition to convert from federal share (deposit) insurance 
to private insurance and to convert from a federal credit union to a 
state-chartered credit union. You are encouraged to attend a special 
meeting of our credit union at (insert address) on (insert time and 
date) to address this proposition.

                           Purpose of Meeting

    The meeting has two purposes:
    1. To consider and act upon a proposal to convert your credit union 
from a federal charter to a state charter and your account insurance 
from federal insurance to private insurance.
    2. To approve the action of the Board of Directors in authorizing 
the officers of the credit union to carry out the proposed conversion.

                          Insurance Conversion

    Currently, your accounts have share insurance provided by the 
National Credit Union Administration, an agency of the federal 
government. The basic federal coverage is up to $100,000, but accounts 
may be structured in different ways, such as joint accounts, payable-on-
death accounts, or IRA accounts, to achieve federal coverage of much 
more than $100,000. If the conversion is approved, your federal 
insurance will terminate on the effective date of the conversion. 
Instead, your accounts in the credit union will be insured up to 
$(insert dollar amount) by (insert name of insurer), a corporation 
chartered by the State of (insert name of State). The federal insurance 
provided by the National Credit Union Administration is backed by the 
full faith and credit of the United States government. The private 
insurance you will receive from (insert name of insurer), however, is 
not guaranteed by the federal or any state or local government.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
     IF THIS CONVERSION IS APPROVED, AND THE (insert name of credit
 
       union) FAILS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOU
 
                        WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Also, because this conversion, if approved, would result in the loss 
of federal share insurance, the credit union will, at any time between 
the approval of the conversion and the effective date of conversion and 
upon request of the member, permit all members

[[Page 532]]

who have share certificates or other term accounts to close the 
federally-insured portion of those accounts without an early withdrawal 
penalty. (This is an optional sentence. It may be deleted without the 
approval of the Regional Director. The members must be informed about 
this right, however, as described in 12 CFR 708b.204(c).)
    The board of directors has concluded that the proposed conversion is 
desirable for the following reasons: (Insert reasons) (This is an 
optional paragraph. It may be deleted without the approval of the 
Regional Director.).
    The proposed conversion will result in the following one-time cost 
associated with the conversion: (List the total estimated dollar amount, 
including (1) the cost of conducting the vote, (2) the cost of changing 
the credit union's name and insurance logo, and (3) attorney and 
consultant fees.)
    The conversion must have the approval of a majority of members who 
vote on the proposal, provided at least 20 percent of the total 
membership participates in the voting.
    Enclosed with this Notice of Special Meeting is a ballot. If you 
cannot attend the meeting, please complete the ballot and return it to 
(insert name and address of independent entity conducting the vote) by 
no later than (insert time and date). To be counted, your ballot must 
reach us by that date and time.

Sec. 708b.303  Conversion of insurance through merger.

    Unless the Regional Director approves the use of different forms, a 
federally-insured credit union that is merging into a nonfederally-
insured credit union must use the forms in this section.
    (a) Form notice to members of intent to merge and convert and 
special meeting of members:

     Notice of Special Meeting on Proposal To Merge and Convert to 
                       Nonfederally-Insured Status

                  (Insert Name of Merging Credit Union)

    On (insert date), the Board of Directors of your credit union 
approved a proposition to merge with (insert name of continuing credit 
union) and to convert from federal share (deposit) insurance to private 
insurance. You are encouraged to attend a special meeting of our credit 
union at (insert address) on (insert time and date).

                           Purpose of Meeting

    The meeting has two purposes:
    1. To consider and act upon a proposal to merge our credit union 
with (insert name of continuing credit union), the continuing credit 
union.
    2. To approve the action of the Board of Directors of our credit 
union in authorizing the officers of the credit union, subject to member 
approval, to carry out the proposed merger.
    If this merger is approved, our credit union will transfer all its 
assets and liabilities to the continuing credit union. As a member of 
our credit union, you will become a member of the continuing credit 
union. On the effective date of the merger, you will receive shares in 
the continuing credit union for the shares you own now in our credit 
union.

                          Insurance Conversion

    Currently, your accounts have share insurance provided by the 
National Credit Union Administration, an agency of the federal 
government. The basic federal coverage is up to $100,000, but accounts 
may be structured in different ways, such as joint accounts, payable-on-
death accounts, or IRA accounts, to achieve federal coverage of much 
more than $100,000. If the merger is approved, your federal insurance 
will terminate on the effective date of the merger. Instead, your 
accounts in the credit union will be insured up to $(insert dollar 
amount) by (insert name of insurer), a corporation chartered by the 
State of (insert name of State). The federal insurance provided by the 
National Credit Union Administration is backed by the full faith and 
credit of the United States government. The private insurance you will 
receive from (insert name of insurer), however, is not guaranteed by the 
federal or any state or local government.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
      IF THIS MERGER IS APPROVED AND THE (insert name of continuing
 
          credit union) FAILS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
 
                 GUARANTEE YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 534]]

    Also, because this merger, if approved, would result in the loss of 
federal share insurance, the (insert name of merging credit union) will, 
at any time between the approval of the merger and the effective date of 
merger and upon request of the member, permit all members who have share 
certificates or other term accounts to close the federally-insured 
portion of those accounts without an early withdrawal penalty. (This is 
an optional sentence. It may be deleted without the approval of the 
Regional Director. The members must be informed about this right, 
however, as described in 12 CFR 708b.204(c).)

            Other Information Related to the Proposed Merger

    The directors of the participating credit unions carefully analyzed 
the assets and liabilities of the participating credit unions and 
appraised each credit union's share values. The appraisal of the share 
values appears on the attached individual and consolidated financial 
statements of the participating credit unions.

    (a) The Board, as liquidating agent, by operation of law and without

the rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the credit union, and of 
its shareholders, officers, and directors, with respect to the credit

not be prohibited from continuing such liquidation. Notwithstanding 
other provisions of this part, the board of directors of the credit 
union may meet following the placing of the institution into liquidation 
for the sole purpose of considering and authorizing the filing of this 
action in the name of the credit union. No such action in the name of 
the credit union may be instituted without the authorization of the 
board of directors of the institution pursuant to a valid board of 
directors resolution. No credit union funds shall be available to pay 
expenses incurred in bringing a legal action to challenge the Board's 
liquidation action.

carried on the books of the credit union, and the security therefor, if 
any, a brief description of the assets and any security, and a record of 
the credit union's creditor and accounts liabilities.
    (b) Notice to creditors. The liquidating agent shall promptly 
publish a notice to the credit union's creditors to present their 
claims, together with proof, to the liquidating agent by a date 
specified in the notice. This date shall be not less than 90 days after 
the

[[Page 537]]

publication of the notice. The liquidating agent shall republish such 
notice approximately one and two months, respectively, after the initial 
publication. At the time of initial publication, the liquidating agent 
shall mail a notice similar to the published notice to any creditor 
shown on the credit union's books at the last address appearing therein. 
If the liquidating agent discovers the name of a creditor whose name 
does not appear on the credit union's books, a notice similar to the 
published notice shall be mailed to such creditor within 30 days after 
the discovery of the name and address.
    (c) General. The liquidating agent shall collect all obligations and 
money due such credit union and may, to the extent consistent with its 
appointment, do all things desirable or expedient in its discretion to 
wind up the affairs of the credit union including, but not limited to, 
the following:
    (1) Exercise all rights and powers of the credit union including, 
but not limited to, any rights and powers under any mortgage, deed of 
trust, chose in action, option, collateral note, contract, judgment or 
decree, or instrument of any nature;
    (2) Institute, prosecute, maintain, defend, intervene, and otherwise 
participate in any and all actions, suits, or other legal proceedings by

or any of them, shall have an interest, and in every way to represent 
the credit union, its shareholders and creditors, subject to the 
direction of General Counsel;
    (3) Employ on a salary or fee basis such persons as in the judgment 
of the liquidating agent are necessary or desirable to carry out its 
responsibilities and functions, including, but not limited to, 
appraisers and Certified Public Accountants, and pay the costs out of 
the assets of the liquidated credit union;
    (4) Employ or retain any attorney or attorneys designated by, or 
acceptable to, the General Counsel in connection with litigation or for 
legal advice and assistance, for the liquidation generally or in 
particular instances, and pay compensation and retainers of such 
attorney or attorneys, together with all expenses, including, but not 
limited to, the costs and expenses of any litigation, as approved by the 
General Counsel, out of the assets of the liquidated credit union;
    (5) Execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all deeds, contracts, 
leases, assignments, bills of sale, releases, extensions, satisfactions, 
and other instruments necessary or proper for any purposes, including, 
but not limited to, the effectuation, termination, or transfer of real, 
personal or mixed property, or that shall be necessary or proper to 
liquidate the credit union, and any deed or other instrument executed 
pursuant to the authority hereby given shall be as valid and effective 
for all purposes as if the same had been executed as the act and deed of 
the credit union;
    (6) With concurrence of General Counsel, disaffirm or repudiate any 
contract or lease to which the credit union is a party, the performance 
of which the liquidating agent, in his sole discretion, determines to be 
burdensome, and which disaffirmance or repudiation in the liquidating 
agent's sole discretion will promote the orderly administration of the 
credit union's affairs;
    (7) Deposit, withdraw, or transfer funds, and otherwise exercise 
complete control over all investment or depository accounts maintained 
by or for the credit union at financial dispository or similar

Sec. 709.5  Payout priorities in involuntary liquidation.

    (a) Claimants whose claims are secured shall receive their security. 
To the extent their respective claims exceed the value of the security 
for those claims, as determined to the satisfaction of the liquidating 
agent, they shall each have an unsecured claim against the credit union 
having priority as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Unsecured claims against the liquidation estate that are proved 
to the satisfaction of the liquidating agent shall have priority in the 
following order:
    (1) Administrative costs and expenses of liquidation;
    (2) Claims for wages and salaries, including vacation, severance, 
and sick leave pay;
    (3) Taxes legally due and owing to the United States or any state or 
subdivision thereof;
    (4) Debts due and owing the United States, including the National 
Credit Union Administration;
    (5) General creditors, and secured creditors (to the extent that 
their respective claims exceed the value of the security for those 
claims);
    (6) Shareholders to the extent of their respective uninsured shares 
and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund to the extent of its 
payment of share insurance;
    (7) In a case involving liquidation of a corporate credit union, 
membership capital;
    (8) In a case involving liquidation of a low-income designated 
credit union, any outstanding secondary capital accounts issued pursuant 
to the authority of Sec. Sec. 701.34 or 741.204(c) of this chapter; and
    (9) In a case involving liquidation of a corporate credit union, 
paid-in capital.
    (c) Priorities are to be based on the circumstances that exist on 
the date of liquidation.
    (d) If the repudiation or disaffirmance of any contract or lease 
gives rise to a claim for damages, such claim shall be considered a 
general creditor claim under paragraph (b)(5) of this section and not a 
cost or expense of liquidation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (e) All unsecured claims of any category or class or priority 
described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(7) of this section shall be 
paid in full, or provisions made for such payment, before

[[Page 539]]

any claims of lesser priority are paid. If there are insufficient funds 
to pay all claims of a category or class, payment shall be made pro 
rata. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the liquidating 
agent may, at any time, and from time to time, prior to the payment in 
full of all claims of a category or class with higher priority, make 
such distributions to claimants in priority categories described in 
paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section as 
the liquidating agent believes are reasonably necessary to conduct the 
liquidation, provided that the liquidating agent determines that 
adequate funds exist or will be recovered during the liquidation to pay 
in full all claims of any higher priority. If a surplus remains after 
making distribution in full on all allowed claims described in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(9) of this section, such surplus shall be 
distributed pro rata to the credit union's shareholders.

Sec. 709.6  Initial determination of creditor claims by the liquidating agent.

    (a)(1) Any party wishing to submit a claim against the liquidated 
credit union must submit a written proof of claim in accordance with the 
requirements set forth in the notice to creditors. A failure to submit a 
written claim within the time provided in the notice to creditors shall 
be deemed a waiver of said claim and claimant shall have no further 
rights or remedies with respect to such claim.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
liquidating agent may, at his discretion, consider an untimely claim 
provide the following two criteria are present:
    (i) The claimant did not receive notice of the appointment of the 
liquidating agent in time to file a claim before the date provided for 
in the notice; and
    (ii) The claim is filed in time to permit payment of the claim.
    (b) The liquidating agent may require submission of supplemental 
evidence by the claimant and by interested parties in the event of a 
dispute concerning a claim against any asset of the liquidated credit 
union. In requiring the submission of supplemental evidence, the 
liquidating agent may set such limitations of time, scope, and size as 
the liquidating agent deems reasonable in the circumstances, and may 
refuse to include in the record submissions or portions of submissions 
not in compliance with such limitations or requirements. The liquidating 
agent shall compile such written record of a claim or dispute as, in its 
discretion, is deemed sufficient to provide a reasonable basis for 
allowing or disallowing a claim or resolving a dispute. This written 
record shall be considered the administrative record.
    (c) The liquidating agent shall determine whether to allow or 
disallow a claim and shall notify the claimant within 180 days from the 
date a claim against a credit union is filed pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1) of the section. This 180-day period may be extended by written 
agreement between the claimant and the liquidating agent. Failure by the 
liquidating agent to determine a claim and notify the claimant within 
the 180-day period or, if the period is extended, within the extended 
period, shall be deemed a denial of the claim.
    (d) If a claim or any portion thereof is disallowed, the notice to 
the claimant shall contain a statement of the reasons for the 
disallowance and an explanation of appeal rights pursuant to Sec. 709.7 
of this part.
    (e) Notice of any determination with respect to a claim shall be 
sufficient if mailed to the most recent address of the claimant which 
appears:
    (1) On the credit union's books;
    (2) In the claim filed by the claimant; or
    (3) In the documents submitted in the proof of claim.
    (f) In the event the liquidating agent disallows all or part of a 
claim, the liquidating agent shall file with the Board, or its 
designated agent, a report of its determination. This report shall 
become part of the record and shall include the notice to the claimant 
and findings on all issues raised and decided by the liquidating agent.

Sec. 709.7  Procedures for appeal of initial determination.

    In order to appeal all or part of an initial decision which 
disallows a claim, in whole or in part, a claimant must, within 60 days 
of the mailing of the initial determination, file an administrative 
appeal pursuant to Sec. 709.8 of this part, or file suit against the 
liquidated credit union in the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia or in the United States district court having 
jurisdiction over the place where the credit union's principal place of 
business is located, or continue an action commenced before the 
appointment of the liquidating agent. If the claimant does not appeal or 
file or continue a suit, any disallowance shall be final and the 
claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 709.8  Administrative appeal of the initial determination.

    (a) General. A claimant requesting an administrative appeal may 
request review pursuant to any of the procedures listed in paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section. Any appeal of the initial determination must be 
in writing and must specify what type of appeal the claimant requests. 
The determination of whether to agree to a request for administrative 
appeal shall rest solely with the Board, which shall notify the claimant 
of its decision in writing. The 60 day period for filing a lawsuit in 
United States district court, provided for in Sec. 709.7 of this part, 
shall be tolled from the date of claimant's request for an 
administrative appeal to the date of the Board's decision regarding that 
request.
    (b) Hearing on the record. Except as provided herein, any hearing 
requested pursuant to this section shall be conducted in accordance with 
the provisions of subpart A, part 747, of this chapter. The Board shall 
render a final decision with respect to such claim after consideration 
of the hearing record and recommended decision. The Board's 
determination shall be subject to judicial review under chapter 7 of 
title 5, United States Code. Any claimant seeking judicial review of the 
Board's final decision under this paragraph must file a petition in the 
court of appeals for the circuit in which the principal office of the 
credit union is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia Circuit, within 30 days of the date of the 
Board's final decision. If a claimant does not file a petition before 
the end of the 30-day period, the Board's decision shall be final, and 
the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to 
such claim.
    (1) Burden of proof. In any hearing on the record, the burden of 
proof to establish entitlement to any modification of the initial 
determination shall rest solely upon the claimant.
    (2) Order of procedure. In any hearing on the record, at the time 
for opening arguments, counsel for the claimant shall argue first, and 
at the time for closing arguments, counsel for the claimant shall argue 
last.
    (c) Alternative dispute resolution. Paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of 
this section list alternatives for dispute resolution which may be 
available at the discretion of the Board. From time to time, the NCUA 
Board may authorize additional alternative dispute resolution processes.
    (1) Appeal to the Board. Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1), the 
claimant may file an appeal with the NCUA Board within the time provided 
for in Sec. 709.7. The appeal must be in writing and filed with the 
Secretary of the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke 
Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. There shall be no personal appearance 
before the Board in connection with an appeal under this paragraph 
(c)(1).
    (i) Content of appeal. Any appeal must include:
    (A) A statement of the facts on which the appeal is based;
    (B) A statement of the basis for the initial determination to which 
the claimant objects and the alleged error in such determination, 
including citations to applicable statutes and regulations;
    (C) Any other evidence relied upon by the claimant which was not 
previously provided to the liquidating agent.
    (ii) Procedures for review of the appeal. (A) Within 60 days of the 
date of the Board's receipt of an appeal, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, the

[[Page 541]]

Board may request in writing that the claimant submit supplemental 
evidence in support of its appeal. If additional evidence is requested, 
the claimant shall have 45 days from the date of issuance of such 
request to provide such additional information. Failure by the claimant 
to provide such additional information may, as determined solely by the 
Board, result in denial of the claimant's appeal.
    (B) Within 60 days from the date of the Board's receipt of an 
appeal, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the claimant may 
amend or supplement the appeal in writing. In the event the claimant 
does amend or supplement the appeal, the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, with respect to requests for additional 
information and responses to such requests, shall apply with equal force 
to any such amendment or supplement to an appeal.
    (iii) Determination on appeal. (A) Within 180 days from the date of 
receipt of an appeal by the Board, the Board shall issue a decision 
allowing or disallowing claimant's appeal.
    (B) The decision by the Board on appeal shall be provided to the 
claimant in writing, stating the reasons for the decision, and shall 
constitute a final agency decision regarding the claimant's claim.
    (C) Failure by the Board to issue a decision on appeal of the 
claimant's claim within the 180-day period provided for under paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section shall be deemed to be a denial of such 
appeal for the purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) Judicial review. (A) For the purposes of seeking judicial 
review of actions taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
only a determination on appeal issued by the NCUA Board pursuant to this 
section shall constitute a final determination regarding a claim.
    (B) A final determination by the Board is reviewable in accordance 
with the provisions of chapter 7, title 5, United States Code, by the 
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or the court 
of appeals for the Federal judicial circuit where the credit union's 
principal place of business is located. Any request for judicial review 
under this paragraph must be filed within 60 days of the date of the 
Board's final decision. If any claimant fails to file before the end of 
the 60-day period, the Board's decision shall be final, and the claimant 
shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim.
    (2) The following additional procedures for dispute resolution may 
be made available at the sole discretion of the Board: mediation; 
nonbinding arbitration; and neutral fact finding.

Sec. 709.9  Expedited determination of creditor claims.

    (a) General. The provisions of this section establish procedures 
under which claimants may request expedited relief in lieu of the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 709.6 of this part. A claimant shall be 
entitled to expedited determination of a claim only upon a showing that 
there exists a legally valid and enforceable or perfected security 
interest in assets of the liquidated credit union and that irreparable 
injury will occur if the routine claims procedure is followed.
    (b) Filing of request for expedited relief. All requests for 
expedited relief must be filed within 30 days from the date of mailing, 
by the liquidating agent, of the notice to the creditor concerned. The 
request shall be deemed to be filed when received by the Secretary of 
the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, 
Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. A copy of the request must be simultaneously 
served upon the liquidating agent for the credit union concerned. There 
shall be no right of personal appearance before the Board in connection 
with any claim submitted under this paragraph.
    (c) Content of request for expedited relief. Any Request for 
Expedited Relief must contain the following:
    (1) A clear and concise statement of the facts and issues on which 
the request is based;
    (2) A clear and concise statement describing the nature of any 
security interests in any assets of the credit union;
    (3) A clear and concise statement of the probable, imminent and 
irreparable

[[Page 542]]

harm likely to occur if expedited relief is not granted;
    (4) An assessment of the likelihood of success on the merits of the 
underlying claim, including statutory citations and relevant 
documentation supporting the merits of the claim;
    (5) Any other relevant documentation that supports the request;
    (6) Citations to applicable statutes, regulations, or other legal 
authority; and
    (7) A signed statement certifying that a copy of the request has 
been mailed or hand delivered to the liquidating agent on or before the 
day that the request was filed with the Board.
    (d) Burden of proof. The burden of proving entitlement to expedited 
relief rests at all times with the requester.
    (e) Additional information. The Board may order the filing of 
additional information and or documentation in order to make its 
determination. Such filing shall be on a date certain, and failure to 
provide the additional documentation or information may constitute the 
sole grounds for denial of the request.
    (f) Decision. Before the end of the 90-day period beginning on the 
date a request if filed, the Board shall render its decision and provide 
it to the requester. The Board will determine whether to grant expedited 
review and allow or disallow the claim or whether such claim should be 
resolved pursuant to the claims process described in Sec. 709.6 of this 
part.
    (1) Expedited review denied. A decision by the Board that expedited 
review is not appropriate shall be final and the claim shall be decided 
pursuant to the claims adjudication process set forth in Sec. 709.6 of 
this part.
    (2) Expedited review granted. If expedited review is granted, the 
Board shall decide the claim. If the claim is disallowed, in whole or 
part, the decision shall contain a statement of each reason for the 
disallowance and the procedure for obtaining judicial review.
    (g) Period for filing or renewing suit. Any claimant who files a 
request for expedited relief shall be permitted to file a suit, or to 
continue a suit filed before the appointment of the liquidating agent, 
seeking a determination of the claimant's rights with respect to its 
security interest after the earlier of:
    (1) The end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the filing 
of a request for expedited relief; or
    (2) The date the Board denies all or part of the claim.
    (h) Statute of limitations. If an action described in paragraph (g) 
of this section is not filed, or the motion to renew a previously filed 
suit is not made, before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the 
date on which such action or motion may be filed in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section, the claim shall be deemed to be 
disallowed as of the end of such period (other than any portion of such 
claim that was allowed by the Board). Such disallowance shall be final 
and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect 
to such claim.

Sec. 709.10  Treatment by conservator or liquidating agent of financial assets transferred in connection with a securitization or participation.

    (a) Definitions. (1) Beneficial interest means debt or equity (or 
mixed) interests or obligations of any type issued by a special purpose 
entity that entitle their holders to receive payments that depend 
primarily on the cash flow from financial assets owned by the special 
purpose entity.
    (2) Financial asset means cash or a contract or instrument that 
conveys to one entity a contractual right to receive cash or another 
financial instrument from another entity.
    (3) Legal isolation means that transferred financial assets have 
been put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor, its 
creditors, a trustee in bankruptcy, or a receiver, either by a single 
transaction or a series of transactions taken as a whole.
    (4) Participation means the transfer or assignment of an undivided 
interest in all or part of a loan or a lease from a seller, known as the 
``lead,'' to a buyer, known as the ``participant,'' without recourse to 
the lead, under an agreement between the lead and the participant. 
Without recourse means that the participation is not subject to any

[[Page 543]]

agreement that requires the lead to repurchase the participant's 
interest or to otherwise compensate the participant due to a default on 
the underlying obligation.
    (5) Securitization means the issuance by a special purpose entity of 
beneficial interests:
    (i) The most senior class of which at time of issuance is rated in 
one of the four highest categories assigned to long-term debt or in an 
equivalent short-term category (within either of which there may be sub-
categories or gradations indicating relative standing) by one or more 
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; or
    (ii) Which are sold in transactions by an issuer not involving any 
public offering for purposes of section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933, 
as amended, or in transactions exempt from registration under such Act 
under 17 CFR 230.91 through 230.905 (Regulation S) thereunder (or any 
successor regulation).
    (6) Special purpose entity means a trust, corporation, or other 
entity demonstrably distinct from the federally-insured credit union 
that is primarily engaged in acquiring and holding (or transferring to 
another special purpose entity) financial assets, and in activities 
related or incidental thereto, in connection with the issuance by such 
special purpose entity (or by another special purpose entity that 
acquires financial assets directly or indirectly from such special 
purpose entity) of beneficial interests.
    (b) The Board, by exercise of its authority to disaffirm or 
repudiate contracts under 12 U.S.C. 1787(c), will not reclaim, recover, 
or recharacterize as property of the credit union or the liquidation 
estate any financial assets transferred to another party by a federally-
insured credit union in connection with a securitization or 
participation, provided that a transfer meets all conditions for sale 
accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles, 
other than the ``legal isolation'' condition addressed by this section.
    (c) Paragraph (b) of this section will not apply unless the 
federally-insured credit union received adequate consideration for the 
transfer of financial assets at the time of the transfer, and the 
documentation effecting the transfer of financial assets reflects the 
intent of the parties to treat the transaction as a sale, and not as a 
secured borrowing, for accounting purposes.
    (d) Paragraph (b) of this section will not be construed as waiving, 
limiting, or otherwise affecting the power of the Board, as conservator 
or liquidating agent, to disaffirm or repudiate any agreement imposing 
continuing obligations or duties upon the federally-insured credit union 
in conservatorship or the liquidation estate.
    (e) Paragraph (b) of this section will not be construed as waiving, 
limiting or otherwise affecting the rights or powers of the Board to 
take any action or to exercise any power not specifically limited by 
this section, including, but not limited to, any rights, powers or 
remedies of the Board regarding transfers taken in contemplation of the 
credit union's insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay, or 
defraud the credit union or the creditors of such credit union, or that 
is a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.
    (f) The Board will not seek to avoid an otherwise legally 
enforceable securitization agreement or participation agreement executed 
by a federally-insured credit union solely because such agreement does 
not meet the ``contemporaneous'' requirement of sections 207(b)(9) and 
208(a)(3) of the Federal Credit Union Act.
    (g) This section may be repealed by the NCUA upon 30 days notice and 
opportunity for comment provided in the Federal Register, but any such 
repeal or amendment will not apply to any transfers of financial assets 
made in connection with a securitization or participation that was in 
effect before such repeal or modification. For purposes of this 
paragraph, a securitization would be in effect on the earliest date that 
the most senior level of beneficial interests is issued, and a 
participation would be in effect on the date that the parties executed 
the participation agreement.

    An agreement to provide for the lawful collateralization of funds of 
a federal, state, or local governmental entity or of any depositor or 
member referred to in section 207(k)(2)(A) of the Act will not be deemed 
to be invalid under sections 207(b)(9) and 208(a)(3) of the Act solely 
because such agreement was not executed contemporaneously with the 
acquisition of collateral or with any changes, increases, or 
substitutions in the collateral made in accordance with such agreement, 
provided the following conditions are met:
    (a) The agreement was undertaken in the ordinary course of business,

or defraud the credit union or its creditors;
    (b) The secured obligation represents a bona fide and arm's length 
transaction;
    (c) The secured party or parties are not insiders or affiliates of 
the credit union;
    (d) The grant or creation of the security interest was for adequate 
consideration; and,
    (e) The security agreement evidencing the security interest is in 
writing, was approved by the credit union's board of directors, and has 
been continuously an official record of the credit union from the time 
of its execution.

Sec. 709.12  Prepayment fees to Federal Home Loan Bank.

    The Board as conservator or liquidating agent of a federally-insured 
credit union in receipt of any extension of credit from a Federal Home 
Loan Bank will allow a claim for a prepayment fee by the Bank if:
    (a) The claim is made pursuant to a written contract that provides 
for a prepayment fee but the prepayment fee allowed by the Board will 
not exceed the present value of the loss attributable to the difference 
between the contract rate of the secured borrowing and the reinvestment 
rate then available to the Bank; and
    (b) The indebtedness owed to the Bank is secured by sufficient 
collateral in which a perfected security interest in favor of the Bank 
exists or as to which the Bank's security interest is entitled to 
priority under section 306(d) of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 
1987, 12 U.S.C. 1430(e), or otherwise so that the aggregate of the 
outstanding principal on the advances secured by the collateral, the 
accrued but unpaid interest on the outstanding principal and the 
prepayment fee applicable to the advances can be paid in full from the 
amounts realized from the collateral. For purposes of this paragraph, 
the adequacy of the collateral will be determined as of the date the 
prepayment fees are due and payable under the terms of the written 
contract.

qualified financial contract for purposes of the special treatment for

agreement for any swap agreement, together with all supplements to such 
master agreement, will be treated as one swap agreement.

legally recognized entity, appointed by the board of directors to 
liquidate the Federal credit union.


<R05>
Sec. 710.2  Responsibility for conducting voluntary liquidation.

assets, for expediting the liquidation, and for equitable distribution 
of the assets to the members.
    (b) After voting to present the question of liquidation to the 
members, the board of directors may appoint a liquidating agent and

authorize reasonable compensation for the services provided.
    (c) The board of directors shall determine that the liquidating 
agent and all persons who handle or have access to funds of the Federal 
credit union are adequately covered by surety bond and that either such 
coverage remains in effect, or the discovery period is extended, for at 
least four months after final distribution of assets.
    (d) Within three days after the decision of the board of directors 
to submit the question of liquidation to the members, the Regional 
Director will be notified in writing, setting forth in detail the 
reasons for the proposed action. A balance sheet and income statement as 
of the previous month-end will be included with the notification. During 
the liquidation process, financial statements will be submitted to the 
Regional Director as requested.
    (e) Promptly after the decision to present the question of 
liquidation to the members, the board of directors or liquidating agency 
shall develop a written plan for the liquidation of the assets and 
payment of shares (liquidation plan). The plan should provide for the 
liquidation of assets and payment of creditors and shareholders within 
one year of the liquidation date. If the liquidation period is projected 
to exceed one year, an explanation must be provided in the liquidation 
plan. A copy of the liquidation plan will be mailed to the Regional 
Director within 30 days of the date the board of directors votes to 
present the question of liquidation to the members.


<R05>
Sec. 710.3  Approval of the liquidation proposal by members.

    (a) When the board of directors decides to present the question of 
liquidation to the members, it shall act promptly to obtain the members'

liquidation proposal in person at the membership meeting called for that 
purpose or by written ballot to be received no later than the time and 
date indicated on the notice.
    (2) Include or be accompanied by a ballot for the liquidation 
proposal.
    (b) The liquidation proposal must be approved by the affirmative 
vote of a majority of the Federal credit union members who vote on the 
proposal.
    (c) If the members do not approve the liquidation, the board of 
directors, or if delegated the authority, the liquidating agent, must 
decide within seven days whether the Federal credit union should resume 
operations or, if good cause exists, to resubmit the question of 
liquidation to the members.
    (d) If the members approve the liquidation, neither the members nor 
the

[[Page 546]]

board of directors may rescind the decision to liquidate unless the 
Regional Director concurs in the recision.
    (e) The Regional Director will be notified in writing of the results 
of the membership vote on the voluntary liquidation proposal within 
three days of the date of the vote.

    (c) Approval of the Regional Director must be obtained prior to 
consummating any sale of assets which would not provide sufficient funds 
to pay shareholders at par.


<R05>
Sec. 710.5  Notice of liquidation to creditors.

    (a) When approval for liquidation is obtained from the members, the 
board of directors or the liquidating agent shall cause notice to be

<R05>
Sec. 710.6  Distribution of assets.

    (a) With the approval of the regional director, a partial pro rata 
distribution of the Federal credit union's assets may be made to its 
members from cash funds available on authorization by the board of 
directors or liquidating agent. Payment of a partial distribution may 
exclude member accounts of less than $25.00.
    (b) After all assets of the Federal credit union have been converted 
to cash or found to be worthless and all loans and debts owing to it 
have been collected or found to be uncollectible and all obligations of 
the Federal credit union have been paid, with the exception of shares 
due its members, the books shall be closed and the pro rata distribution 
to the members shall be computed. The computation shall be based on the 
total amount in each share account.

[[Page 547]]

    (c) Promptly after the pro rata distribution to members has been 
computed, checks shall be drawn for the amounts to be distributed to 
each member. The checks shall be mailed to the members at their last 
known address or handed to them in person.
    (d) Unclaimed share accounts, unpaid claims, and unpaid claims of 
members or creditors who failed to cash their final distribution checks 
shall be trusteed or escheated in accordance with the laws of the state 
in which the member or creditor resides.
    (e) The Regional Director will be notified in writing within three 
days when the final distribution of assets to the members is started.


<R05>
Sec. 710.7  Retention of records.

    (a) The board of directors or liquidating agent shall appoint a

    Source: 61 FR 50702, Sept. 27, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 711.1  Authority, purpose, and scope.

    (a) Authority. This part is issued under the provisions of the 
Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (Interlocks Act) (12 
U.S.C. 3201 et seq).
    (b) Purpose. The purpose of the Interlocks Act and this part is to 
foster competition by generally prohibiting a management official from 
serving two nonaffiliated depository organizations in situations where 
the management interlock likely would have an anticompetitive effect.
    (c) Scope. This part applies to management officials of federally 
insured credit unions. Section 711.4(c) exempts a management official of 
a credit union from the prohibitions of the Interlocks Act when the 
individual serves as a management official of another credit union. 
Therefore, the Interlocks Act prohibitions contained in this part only 
apply to a management official of a credit union when that individual 
also serves as a management official of another type of depository 
organization (usually a bank or thrift).


<R05>
Sec. 711.2  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
    (a) Affiliate. (1) The term affiliate has the meaning given in 
section 202 of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201). For purposes of that 
section 202, shares held by an individual include shares held by members 
of his or her immediate family. ``Immediate family'' means spouse, 
mother, father, child, grandchild, sister, brother, or any of their 
spouses, whether or not any of their shares are held in trust.
    (2) For purposes of section 202(3)(B) of the Interlocks Act (12 
U.S.C. 3201(3)(B)), an affiliate relationship involving a depository 
institution based on common ownership does not exist if

[[Page 548]]

the appropriate federal supervisory agency determines, after giving the 
affected persons the opportunity to respond, that the asserted 
affiliation was established in order to avoid the prohibitions of the 
Interlocks Act and does not represent a true commonality of interest 
between the depository organizations. In making this determination, the 
appropriate Federal supervisory agency considers, among other things, 
whether a person, including members of his or her immediate family, 
whose shares are necessary to constitute the group owns a nominal 
percentage of the shares of one of the organizations and the percentage 
is substantially disproportionate to that person's ownership of shares 
in the other organization.
    (b) Area median income means:
    (1) The median family income for the metropolitan statistical area 
(MSA), if a depository organization is located in an MSA; or
    (2) The statewide nonmetropolitan median family income, if a 
depository organization is located outside an MSA.
    (c) Community means a city, town, or village, and contiguous or 
adjacent cities, towns, or villages.
    (d) Contiguous or adjacent cities, towns, or villages means cities, 
towns, or villages whose borders touch each other or whose borders are 
within 10 road miles of each other at their closest points. The property 
line of an office located in an unincorporated city, town, or village is 
the boundary line of that city, town, or village for the purpose of this 
definition.
    (e) Depository holding company means a bank holding company or a 
savings and loan holding company (as more fully defined in section 202 
of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201) having its principal office 
located in the United States.
    (f) Depository institution means a commercial bank (including a 
private bank), a savings bank, a trust company, a savings and loan 
association, a building and loan association, a homestead association, a 
cooperative bank, an industrial bank, or a credit union, chartered under 
the laws of the United States and having a principal office located in 
the United States. Additionally, a United States office, including a 
branch or agency, of a foreign commercial bank is a depository 
institution.
    (g) Depository institution affiliate means a depository institution 
that is an affiliate of a depository organization.
    (h) Depository organization means a depository institution or a 
depository holding company.
    (i) District bank means any State bank operating under the Code of 
Law of the District of Columbia.
    (j) Low- and moderate-income areas means census tracts (or, if an 
area is not in a census tract, block numbering areas delineated by the 
United States Bureau of the Census) where the median family income is 
less than 100 percent of the area median income.
    (k) Management official. (1) The term management official means:
    (i) A director;
    (ii) An advisory or honorary director of a depository institution

701.14(b)(2), or a person holding an equivalent position regardless of 
title;
    (iv) A branch manager;
    (v) A trustee of a depository organization under the control of 
trustees; and
    (vi) Any person who has a representative or nominee serving in any 
of the capacities in this paragraph (m)(1).
    (2) The term management official does not include:
    (i) A person whose management functions relate exclusively to the 
business of retail merchandising or manufacturing;
    (ii) A person whose management functions relate principally to the 
business outside the United States of a foreign commercial bank; or
    (iii) A person described in the provisions of section 202(4) of the 
Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201(4)) (referring to an officer of a State-
chartered savings bank, cooperative bank, or trust company that neither 
makes real estate mortgage loans nor accepts savings).
    (l) Office means a principal or branch office of a depository 
institution located in the United States. Office does not include a 
representative office of a

the Office of Management and Budget.
    (o) Representative or nominee means a natural person who serves as a 
management official and has an obligation to act on behalf of another 
person with respect to management responsibilities. NCUA will find that 
a person has an obligation to act on behalf of another person only if 
the first person has an agreement, express or implied, to act on behalf 
of the second person with respect to management responsibilities. NCUA 
will determine, after giving the affected persons an opportunity to 
respond, whether a person is a representative or nominee.
    (p) Total assets. (1) The term total assets means assets measured on 
a consolidated basis and reported in the most recent fiscal year-end 
Consolidated Report of Condition and Income.
    (2) The term total assets does not include:
    (i) Assets of a diversified savings and loan holding company as 
defined by section 10(a)(1)(F) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 
1467a(a)(1)(F)) other than the assets of its depository institution 
affiliate;
    (ii) Assets of a bank holding company that is exempt from the 
prohibitions of section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
pursuant to an order issued under section 4(d) of that Act (12 U.S.C. 
1843(d)) other than the assets of its depository institution affiliate; 
or
    (iii) Assets of offices of a foreign commercial bank other than the 
assets of its United States branch or agency.
    (q) United States includes any State or territory of the United 
States of America, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American

<R05>
Sec. 711.3  Prohibitions.

    (a) Community. A management official of a depository organization 
may not serve at the same time as a management official of an 
unaffiliated depository organization if the depository organizations in 
question (or a depository institution affiliate thereof) have offices in 
the same community.
    (b) RMSA. A management official of a depository organization may not 
serve at the same time as a management official of an unaffiliated 
depository organization if the depository organizations in question (or 
a depository institution affiliate thereof) have offices in the same 
RMSA and each depository organization has total assets of $50 million or 
more.
    (c) Major assets. A management official of a depository organization 
with total assets exceeding $2.5 billion (or any affiliate thereof) may 
not serve at the same time as a management official of an unaffiliated 
depository organization with total assets exceeding $1.5 billion (or any 
affiliate thereof), regardless of the location of the two depository 
organizations. The NCUA will adjust these thresholds, as necessary, 
based on year-to-year change in the average of the Consumer Price Index 
for the Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, not seasonally 
adjusted, with rounding to the nearest $100 million. The NCUA will 
announce the revised thresholds by publishing a notice in the Federal 
Register.

liquidation, or which is in the hands of a receiver, conservator, or 
other official exercising a similar function;
    (b) A corporation operating under section 25 or section 25A of the 
Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 601 et seq. and 12 U.S.C. 611 et seq., 
respectively) (Edge Corporations and Agreement Corporations);

[[Page 550]]

    (c) A credit union being served by a management official of another 
credit union;
    (d) A depository organization that does not do business within the 
United States except as an incident to its activities outside the United 
States;
    (e) A State-chartered savings and loan guaranty corporation;
    (f) A Federal Home Loan Bank or any other bank organized solely to 
serve depository institutions (a bankers' bank) or solely for the 
purpose of providing securities clearing services and services related 
thereto for depository institutions and securities companies;
    (g) A depository organization that is closed or is in danger of 
closing as determined by the appropriate Federal depository institutions 
regulatory agency and is acquired by another depository organization. 
This exemption lasts for five years, beginning on the date the 
depository organization is acquired; and
    (h)(1) A diversified savings and loan holding company (as defined in 
section 10(a)(1)(F) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 
1467a(a)(1)(F)) with respect to the service of a director of such 
company who also is a director of an unaffiliated depository 
organization if:
    (i) Both the diversified savings and loan holding company and the 
unaffiliated depository organization notify their appropriate Federal 
depository institutions regulatory agency at least 60 days before the 
dual service is proposed to begin; and
    (ii) The appropriate regulatory agency does not disapprove the dual 
service before the end of the 60-day period.
    (2) The NCUA Board or its designee may disapprove a notice of 
proposed service if it finds that:
    (i) The service cannot be structured or limited so as to preclude an 
anticompetitive effect in financial services in any part of the United 
States;
    (ii) The service would lead to substantial conflicts of interest or 
unsafe or unsound practices; or
    (iii) The notificant failed to furnish all the information required 
by NCUA.
    (3) The NCUA Board or its designee may require that any interlock 
permitted under this paragraph (h) be terminated if a change in 
circumstances occurs with respect to one of the interlocked depository 
organizations that would have provided a basis for disapproval of the 
interlock during the notice period.


<R05>
Sec. 711.5  Small market share exemption.

    (a) Exemption. A management interlock that is prohibited by Sec. 
711.3(a) or Sec. 711.3(b) is permissible, provided:
    (1) The interlock is not prohibited by Sec. 711.3(c); and
    (2) The depository organizations (and their depository institution 
affiliates) hold, in the aggregate, no more than 20% of the deposits, in 
each RMSA or community in which the depository organizations (or their 
depository institution affiliates) are located. The amount of deposits 
will be determined by reference to the most recent annual Summary of 
Deposits published by the FDIC. This information is available on the 
Internet at http://www.fdic.gov.
    (b) Confirmation and records. Each depository organization must 
maintain records sufficient to support its determination of eligibility 
for the exemption under paragraph (a) of this section, and must 
reconfirm that determination on an annual basis.

[64 FR 66360, Nov. 26, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 711.6  General exemption.

    (a) Exemption. NCUA may, by agency order issued following receipt of 
an application, exempt an interlock from the prohibitions in Sec. 
711.3, if NCUA finds that the interlock would not result in a monopoly 
or substantial lessening of competition, and would not present other 
safety and soundness concerns.
    (b) Presumptions. In reviewing applications for an exemption under 
this section, NCUA will apply a rebuttable presumption that an interlock 
will not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition if 
the depository organization seeking to add a management official:
    (1) Primarily serves, low- and moderate-income areas;
    (2) Is controlled or managed by persons who are members of a 
minority group or women;
    (3) Is a depository institution that has been chartered for less 
than two years; or

[[Page 551]]

    (4) Is deemed to be in ``troubled condition'' as defined in Sec. 
701.14(b)(3) of this chapter.
    (c) Duration. Unless a shorter expiration period is provided in the 
NCUA approval, an exemption permitted by paragraph (a) of this section 
may continue so long as it would not result in a monopoly or substantial 
lessening of competition, or be unsafe or unsound. If the NCUA grants an 
interlock exemption in reliance upon a presumption under paragraph (b) 
of this section, the interlock may continue for three years, unless 
otherwise provided in the approval.

[64 FR 66360, Nov. 26, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 711.7  Change in circumstances.

    (a) Termination. A management official shall terminate his or her 
service if a change in circumstances causes the service to become 
prohibited. A change in circumstances may include, but is not limited 
to, an increase in asset size of an organization, a change in the 
delineation of the RMSA or community, the establishment of an office, an 
increase in the aggregate deposits of the depository organization, or an 
acquisition, merger, consolidation, or reorganization of the ownership 
structure of a depository organization that causes a previously 
permissible interlock to become prohibited.
    (b) Transition period. A management official described in paragraph 
(a) of this section may continue to serve the depository organization 
involved in the interlock for 15 months following the date of the change 
in circumstances. NCUA may shorten this period under appropriate 
circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 711.8  Enforcement.

    Except as provided in this section, NCUA administers and enforces 
the Interlocks Act with respect to federally insured credit unions, and 
may refer any case of a prohibited interlocking relationship involving 
these entities to the Attorney General of the United States to enforce 
compliance with the Interlocks Act and this part.

post-closing, undivided earnings (this does not include regular reserves 
or special reserves required by law, regulation or special agreement 
between the credit union and its regulator or share insurer); and
    (2) Total investments in and total loans to CUSOs will be measured 
consistent with GAAP.
    (e) Divestiture. If the limitations in paragraph (a) of this section 
are reached or exceeded because of the profitability of the CUSO and the 
related GAAP valuation of the investment under the equity method, 
without an additional cash outlay by the FCU, divestiture is not 
required. An FCU may continue to invest up to 1% without regard to the 
increase in the GAAP valuation resulting from a CUSO's profitability.

<R05>
Sec. 712.3  What are the characteristics of and what requirements apply to CUSOs?

    (a) Structure. An FCU can invest in or loan to a CUSO only if the 
CUSO is structured as a corporation, limited liability company, or 
limited partnership. An FCU may only participate in a limited 
partnership as a limited partner. For purposes of this part, 
``corporation'' means a legally incorporated corporation as established 
and maintained under relevant federal or state law. For purposes of this 
part, ``limited partnership'' means a legally established limited 
partnership as established and maintained under relevant state law. For 
purposes of this part, ``limited liability company'' means a legally 
established limited liability company as established and maintained 
under relevant state law, provided that the FCU obtains written legal 
advice that the limited liability company is a recognized legal entity 
under the applicable laws of the state of formation and that the limited 
liability company is established in a manner that will limit potential 
exposure of the FCU to no more than the amount of funds invested in, or 
loaned to, the CUSO.
    (b) Customer base. An FCU can invest in or loan to a CUSO only if 
the CUSO primarily serves credit unions, its membership, or the 
membership of credit unions contracting with the CUSO.
    (c) Federal credit union accounting for financial reporting 
purposes. An FCU must account for its investments in or loans to a CUSO 
in conformity with ``generally accepted accounting principles'' (GAAP).
    (d) CUSO accounting; audits and financial statements; NCUA access to 
information. An FCU must obtain written agreements from a CUSO, prior to 
investing in or lending to the CUSO, that the CUSO will:
    (1) Account for all its transactions in accordance with GAAP;
    (2) Prepare quarterly financial statements and obtain an annual 
financial statement audit of its financial statements by a licensed 
certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards. A wholly owned CUSO is not required to obtain a 
separate annual financial statement audit if it is included in the 
annual consolidated financial statement audit of the credit union that 
is its parent; and
    (3) Provide NCUA and its representatives with complete access to any 
books and records of the CUSO and the ability to review CUSO internal 
controls, as deemed necessary by NCUA in carrying out its 
responsibilities under the Act.
    (e) Other laws. A CUSO must comply with applicable Federal, state 
and local laws.

[63 FR 10756, Mar. 5, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 33187, June 22, 1999; 64 
FR 57365, Oct. 25, 1999; 66 FR 40578, Aug. 3, 2001; 70 FR 55228, Sept. 
21, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 712.4  What must an FCU and a CUSO do to maintain separate corporate identities?

    (a) Corporate separateness. An FCU and a CUSO must be operated in a 
manner that demonstrates to the public the separate corporate existence 
of the FCU and the CUSO. Good business

[[Page 553]]

practices dictate that each must operate so that:
    (1) Its respective business transactions, accounts, and records are 
not intermingled;
    (2) Each observes the formalities of its separate corporate 
procedures;
    (3) Each is adequately financed as a separate unit in the light of 
normal obligations reasonably foreseeable in a business of its size and 
character;
    (4) Each is held out to the public as a separate enterprise;
    (5) The FCU does not dominate the CUSO to the extent that the CUSO 
is treated as a department of the FCU; and
    (6) Unless the FCU has guaranteed a loan obtained by the CUSO, all 
borrowings by the CUSO indicate that the FCU is not liable.
    (b) Legal opinion. Prior to an FCU investing in a CUSO, the FCU must 
obtain written legal advice as to whether the CUSO is established in a 
manner that will limit potential exposure of the FCU to no more than the 
loss of funds invested in, or lent to, the CUSO. In addition, if a CUSO 
in which an FCU has an investment plans to change its structure under 
Sec. 712.3(a), an FCU must also obtain prior, written legal advice that 
the CUSO will remain established in a manner that will limit potential 
exposure of the FCU to no more than the loss of funds invested in, or 
loaned to, the CUSO. The legal advice must address factors that have led 
courts to ``pierce the corporate veil'' such as inadequate 
capitalization, lack of separate corporate identity, common boards of 
directors and employees, control of one entity over another, and lack of 
separate books and records. The legal advice may be provided by 
independent legal counsel of the investing FCU or the CUSO.


<R05>
Sec. 712.5  What activities and services are preapproved for CUSOs?

    NCUA may at any time, based upon supervisory, legal, or safety and 
soundness reasons, limit any CUSO activities or services, or refuse to 
permit any CUSO activities or services. Otherwise, an FCU may invest in, 
loan to, and/or contract with only those CUSOs that are sufficiently 
bonded or insured for their specific operations and engaged in the 
preapproved activities and services related to the routine daily 
operations of credit unions. The specific activities listed within each

amount necessary to participate in the service provider, or a greater 
amount if necessary to receive a reduced price for goods or services.

<R05>
Sec. 712.7  What must an FCU do to add activities or services that are not preapproved?

    In order for an FCU to invest in and/or loan to a CUSO that offers 
an unpreapproved activity or service, the FCU must first receive NCUA 
Board approval. The request for NCUA Board approval of an unpreapproved 
activity or service must include a full explanation and complete 
documentation of the activity or service and how that activity or 
service is associated with routine credit union operations. The request 
must be submitted jointly to your Regional Office and to the Secretary 
of the Board. The request will be treated as a petition to amend Sec. 
712.5 and NCUA will request public comment or otherwise act on the 
petition within 60 days after receipt. Before you engage in the petition 
process, you should seek an advisory opinion from NCUA's Office of 
General Counsel as to whether a proposed activity is already covered by 
one of the authorized categories without filing a petition to amend the 
regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 712.8  What transaction and compensation limits might apply to individuals related to both an FCU and a CUSO?

    (a) Officials and Senior Management Employees. The officials, senior 
management employees, and their immediate family members of an FCU that 
has outstanding loans or investments in a CUSO must not receive any 
salary, commission, investment income, or other income or compensation 
from the CUSO either directly or indirectly, or from any person being 
served through the CUSO. This provision does not prohibit such FCU 
officials or senior management employees from assisting in the operation 
of a CUSO, provided the officials or senior management employees are not 
compensated by the

[[Page 555]]

CUSO. Further, the CUSO may reimburse the FCU for the services provided 
by such FCU officials and senior management employees only if the 
account receivable of the FCU due from the CUSO is paid in full at least 
every 120 days. For purposes of this paragraph (a), ``official'' means 
affiliated credit union directors or committee members. For purposes of 
this paragraph (a), ``senior management employee'' means affiliated 
credit union chief executive officer (typically this individual holds 
the title of President or Treasurer/Manager), any assistant chief 
executive officers (e.g. Assistant President, Vice President, or 
Assistant Treasurer/Manager) and the chief financial officer 
(Comptroller). For purposes of this paragraph (a), ``immediate family 
member'' means a spouse or other family members living in the same 
household.
    (b) Employees. The prohibition contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section also applies to FCU employees not otherwise covered if the 
employees are directly involved in dealing with the CUSO unless the 
FCU's board of directors determines that the FCU employees' positions do 
not present a conflict of interest.
    (c) Others. All transactions with business associates or family 
members of FCU officials, senior management employees, and their 
immediate family members, not specifically prohibited by paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section must be conducted at arm's length and in the 
interest of the FCU.


<R05>
Sec. 712.9  When must an FCU comply with this part?

    (a) Investments. An FCU's investments in CUSOs in existence prior to 
April 1, 1998, must conform with this part not later than April 1, 2001, 
unless the Board grants prior approval to continue such investment for a 
stated period.
    (b) Loans. An FCU's loans to CUSOs in existence prior to April 1, 
1998, must conform with this part not later than April 1, 2001, unless:

<R05>
Sec. 713.5  What is the required minimum dollar amount of coverage?

    (a) The minimum required amount of fidelity bond coverage for any 
single loss is computed based on a federal credit union's total assets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Assets                            Minimum bond
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$0 to $4,000,000.......................  Lesser of total assets or
                                          $250,000.
$4,000,001 to $50,000,000..............  $100,000 plus $50,000 for each
                                          million or fraction thereof
                                          over $1,000,000.
$50,000,000 to $500,000,000............  $2,550,000 plus $10,000 for
                                          each million or fraction
                                          thereof over $50,000,000, to a
                                          maximum of $5,000,000.
Over $500,000,000......................  One percent of assets, rounded
                                          to the nearest hundred
                                          million, to a maximum of
                                          $9,000,000.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) This is the minimum coverage required, but a federal credit 
union's board of directors should purchase additional or enhanced 
coverage when its circumstances warrant. In making this determination, a 
board of directors should consider its own internal risk assessment, its 
fraud trends and loss experience, and factors such as its cash on hand, 
cash in transit, and the nature and risks inherent in any expanded 
services it offers such as wire transfer and remittance services.
    (c) While the above is the required minimum amount of bond coverage, 
credit unions should maintain increased coverage equal to the greater of 
either of the following amounts within thirty days of discovery of the 
need for such increase:
    (1) The amount of the daily cash fund, i.e. daily cash plus 
anticipated daily money receipts on the credit union's premises, or
    (2) The total amount of the credit union's money in transit in any 
one shipment.
    (3) Increased coverage is not required pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, however, when the credit union temporarily increased its 
cash fund because of unusual events which cannot reasonably be expected 
to recur.
    (d) Any aggregate limit of liability provided for in a fidelity bond 
policy must be at least twice the single loss limit of liability. This 
requirement does not apply to optional insurance coverage.
    (e) Any proposal to reduce your required bond coverage must be 
approved in writing by the NCUA Board at least twenty days in advance of 
the proposed effective date of the reduction.

[64 FR 28720, May 27, 1999, as amended at 70 FR 61716, Oct. 26, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 713.6  What is the permissible deductible?

    (a)(1) The maximum amount of allowable deductible is computed based 
on a federal credit union's asset size and capital level, as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Assets                         Maximum deductible
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$0 to $100,000.........................  No deductible allowed.
$100,001 to $250,000...................  $1,000.
$250,000 to $1,000,000.................  $2,000.

[[Page 557]]

 
Over $1,000,000........................  $2,000 plus 1/1000 of total
                                          assets up to a maximum of
                                          $200,000; for credit unions
                                          over $1 million in assets that
                                          qualify for NCUA's Regulatory
                                          Flexibility Program in Part
                                          742, the maximum deductible is
                                          $1,000,000.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The deductibles may apply to one or more insurance clauses in a 
policy. Any deductibles in excess of the above amounts must receive the 
prior written permission of the NCUA Board.
    (b) A deductible may not exceed 10 percent of a credit union's 
Regular Reserve unless a separate Contingency Reserve is set up for the 
excess. In computing the maximum deductible, valuation accounts such as 
the allowance for loan losses cannot be considered.
    (c) A credit union's eligibility to qualify for a deductible in 
excess of $200,000 is determined based on it having assets in excess of 
$1 million as reflected in its most recent year-end 5300 call report 
and, as of that same year-end, qualifying for NCUA's Regulatory 
Flexibility Program under part 742 of this title as determined by its 
most recent examination report. A credit union that previously qualified 
for a deductible in excess of $200,000, but that subsequently fails to 
qualify based on its most recent year-end 5300 call report because 
either its assets have decreased or it no longer meets the net worth 
requirements of part 742 of this title or fails to meet the CAMEL rating 
requirements of part 742 of this title as determined by its most recent 
examination report, must obtain the coverage otherwise required by 
paragraph (b) of this section within 30 days of filing its year-end call 
report and must notify the appropriate NCUA regional office in writing 
of its changed status and confirm that it has obtained the required 
coverage.

[64 FR 28720, May 27, 1999, as amended at 70 FR 61716, Oct. 26, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 713.7  May the NCUA Board require a credit union to secure additional insurance coverage?

    The NCUA Board may require additional coverage when the Board 
determines that a credit union's current coverage is inadequate. The 
credit union must purchase this additional coverage within 30 days.

<R05>
Sec. 714.1  What does this part cover?

    This part covers the standards and requirements that you, a federal 
credit union, must follow when engaged in the leasing of personal 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 714.2  What are the permissible leasing arrangements?

    (a) You may engage in direct leasing. In direct leasing, you 
purchase personal property from a vendor, becoming the owner of the 
property at the request of your member, and then lease the property to 
that member.
    (b) You may engage in indirect leasing. In indirect leasing, a third 
party leases property to your member and you then purchase that lease 
from the third party for the purpose of leasing the property to your 
member. You do

[[Page 558]]

not have to purchase the leased property if you comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 714.3.
    (c) You may engage in open-end leasing. In an open-end lease, your 
member assumes the risk and responsibility for any difference in the 
estimated residual value and the actual value of the property at lease 
end.
    (d) You may engage in closed-end leasing. In a closed-end lease, you 
assume the risk and responsibility for any difference in the estimated 
residual value and the actual value of the property at lease end. 
However, your member is always responsible for any excess wear and tear 
and excess mileage charges as established under the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 714.3  Must you own the leased property in an indirect leasing arrangement?

    You do not have to own the leased property in an indirect leasing 
arrangement if:
    (a) You obtain a full assignment of the lease. A full assignment is 
the assignment of all the rights, interests, obligations, and title in a 
lease to you, that is, you become the owner of the lease;
    (b) You are named as the sole lienholder of the leased property;
    (c) You receive a security agreement, signed by the leasing company, 
granting you a sole lien in the leased property and the right to take 
possession and dispose of the leased property in the event of a default 
by the lessee, a default in the leasing company's obligations to you, or 
a material adverse change in the leasing company's financial condition; 
and
    (d) You take all necessary steps to record and perfect your security 
interest in the leased property. Your state's Commercial Code may treat 
the automobiles as inventory, and require a filing with the Secretary of 
State.


<R05>
Sec. 714.4  What are the lease requirements?

    (a) Your lease must be a net lease. In a net lease, your member 
assumes all the burdens of ownership including maintenance and repair, 
licensing and registration, taxes, and insurance;
    (b) Your lease must be a full payout lease. In a full payout lease, 
you must reasonably expect to recoup your entire investment in the 
leased property, plus the estimated cost of financing, from the lessee's 
payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property at the 
expiration of the lease term; and
    (c) The amount of the estimated residual value you rely upon to 
satisfy the full payout lease requirement may not exceed 25% of the 
original cost of the leased property unless the amount above 25% is 
guaranteed. Estimated residual value is the projected value of the 
leased property at lease end. Estimated residual value must be 
reasonable in light of the nature of the leased property and all 
circumstances relevant to the leasing arrangement.


<R05>
Sec. 714.5  What is required if you rely on an estimated residual value greater than 25% of the original cost of the leased property?

    If the amount of the estimated residual value you rely upon to 
satisfy the full payout lease requirement of Sec. 714.4(b) exceeds 25% 
of the original cost of the leased property, a financially capable party 
must guarantee the excess. The guarantor may be the manufacturer. The 
guarantor may also be an insurance company with an A.M. Best rating of 
at least a B+, or with at least the equivalent of an A.M. Best B+ rating 
from another major rating company. You must obtain or have on file 
financial documentation demonstrating that the guarantor has the 
resources to meet the guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 714.6  Are you required to retain salvage powers over the leased property?

    You must retain salvage powers over the leased property. Salvage 
powers protect you from a loss and provide you with the power to take 
action if there is an unanticipated change in conditions that threatens 
your financial position by significantly increasing your exposure to 
risk. Salvage powers allow you:
    (a) As the owner and lessor, to take reasonable and appropriate 
action to salvage or protect the value of the property or your interests 
arising under the lease; or

[[Page 559]]

    (b) As the assignee of a lease, to become the owner and lessor of 
the leased property pursuant to your contractual rights, or take any 
reasonable and appropriate action to salvage or protect the value of the 
property or your interests arising under the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 714.7  What are the insurance requirements applicable to leasing?

    (a) You must maintain a contingent liability insurance policy with 
an endorsement for leasing or be named as the co-insured if you do not 
own the leased property. Contingent liability insurance protects you 
should you be sued as the owner of the leased property. You must use an 
insurance company with a nationally recognized industry rating of at 
least a B+.
    (b) Your member must carry the normal liability and property 
insurance on the leased property. You must be named as an additional 
insured on the liability insurance policy and as the loss payee on the 
property insurance policy.


<R05>
Sec. 714.8  Are the early payment provisions, or interest rate provisions, applicable in leasing arrangements?

    You are not subject to the early payment provisions set forth in 
Sec. 701.21(c)(6) of this chapter. You are also not subject to the 
interest rate provisions in Sec. 701.21(c)(7).


<R05>
Sec. 714.9  Are indirect leasing arrangements subject to the purchase of eligible obligation limit set forth in Sec. 701.23 of this chapter?

    Your indirect leasing arrangements are not subject to the eligible 
obligation limit if they satisfy the provisions of Sec. 
701.23(b)(3)(iv) that require that you make the final underwriting 
decision and that the lease contract is assigned to you very soon after 
it is signed by the member and the dealer or leasing company.


<R05>
Sec. 714.10  What other laws must you comply with when engaged in leasing?

    You must comply with the Consumer Leasing Act, 15 U.S.C. 1667-67f, 
and its implementing regulation, Regulation M, 12 CFR part 213. You must 
comply with state laws on consumer leasing, but only to the extent that 
the state leasing laws are consistent with the Consumer Leasing Act, 15 
U.S.C. 1667e, or provide the member with greater protections or benefits 
than the Consumer Leasing Act. You are also subject to the lending rules 
set forth in Sec. 701.21 of this chapter, except as provided in Sec. 
714.8 and Sec. 714.9 of this part. The lending rules in Sec. 701.21 
address the preemption of other state and federal laws that impact on 
credit transactions.

Sec. 715.1  Scope of this part.

    This part implements section 202(a)(6)(D) of the Federal Credit 
Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1782(a)(6)(D), as added by section 201(a) of the 
Credit Union Membership Access Act, Pub. L. No. 105-219, 112 Stat. 918 
(1998). This part prescribes the responsibilities of the Supervisory 
Committee to obtain an annual audit of the credit union according to its 
charter type and asset size, and to conduct a verification of members' 
accounts.


<R05>
Sec. 715.2  Definitions used in this part.

    As used in this part:

[[Page 560]]

    (a) Balance sheet audit refers to the examination of a credit 
union's assets, liabilities, and equity under generally accepted 
auditing standards (GAAS) by an independent public accountant for the 
purpose of opining on the fairness of the presentation on the balance 
sheet. Credit unions required to file call reports consistent with GAAP 
should ensure the audited balance sheet is likewise prepared on a GAAP 
basis. The opinion under this type of engagement would not address the 
fairness of the presentation of the credit union's income statement, 
statement of changes in equity (including comprehensive income), or 
statement of cash flows.
    (b) Compensated person refers to any accounting/auditing 
professional, excluding a credit union employee, who is compensated for 
performing more than one supervisory committee audit and/or verification 
of members' accounts per calendar year.
    (c) Financial statements refers to a presentation of financial data, 
including accompanying notes, derived from accounting records of the 
credit union, and intended to disclose a credit union's economic 
resources or obligations at a point in time, or the changes therein for 
a period of time, in conformity with GAAP, as defined herein, or 
regulatory accounting procedures. Each of the following is considered to 
be a financial statement: a balance sheet or statement of financial 
condition; statement of income or statement of operations; statement of 
undivided earnings; statement of cash flows; statement of changes in 
members' equity; statement of revenue and expenses; and statement of 
cash receipts and disbursements.
    (d) Financial statement audit (also known as an ``opinion audit'') 
refers to an audit of the financial statements of a credit union 
performed in accordance with GAAS by an independent person who is 
licensed by the appropriate State or jurisdiction. The objective of a 
financial statement audit is to express an opinion as to whether those 
financial statements of the credit union present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position and the results of its operations and 
its cash flows in conformity with GAAP, as defined herein, or regulatory 
accounting practices.
    (e) GAAP is an acronym for ``generally accepted accounting 
principles'' which refers to the conventions, rules, and procedures 
which define accepted accounting practice. GAAP includes both broad 
general guidelines and detailed practices and procedures, provides a 
standard by which to measure financial statement presentations, and 
encompasses not only accounting principles and practices but also the 
methods of applying them.
    (f) GAAS is an acronym for ``generally accepted auditing standards'' 
which refers to the standards approved and adopted by the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants which apply when an 
``independent, licensed certified public accountant'' audits financial 
statements. Auditing standards differ from auditing procedures in that 
``procedures'' address acts to be performed, whereas ``standards'' 
measure the quality of the performance of those acts and the objectives 
to be achieved by use of the procedures undertaken. In addition, 
auditing standards address the auditor's professional qualifications as 
well as the judgment exercised in performing the audit and in preparing 
the report of the audit.
    (g) Independent means the impartiality necessary for the 
dependability of the compensated auditor's findings. Independence 
requires the exercise of fairness toward credit union officials, 
members, creditors and others who may rely upon the report of a 
supervisory committee audit report.
    (h) Internal control refers to the process, established by the 
credit union's board of directors, officers and employees, designed to 
provide reasonable assurance of reliable financial reporting and 
safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition. A credit union's internal control structure consists of 
five components: control environment; risk assessment; control 
activities; information and communication; and monitoring. Reliable 
financial reporting refers to preparation of Call Reports (NCUA Forms 
5300 and 5310) that meet management's financial reporting objectives. 
Internal control over safeguarding of assets against unauthorized 
acquisition, use,

[[Page 561]]

or disposition refers to prevention or timely detection of transactions 
involving such unauthorized access, use, or disposition of assets which 
could result in a loss that is material to the financial statements.
    (i) Reportable conditions refers to a matter coming to the attention 
of the independent, compensated auditor which, in his or her judgment, 
represents a significant deficiency in the design or operation of the 
internal control structure of the credit union, which could adversely 
affect its ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial 
data consistent with the representations of management in the financial 
statements.
    (j) Report on Examination of Internal Control over Call Reporting 
refers to an engagement in which an independent, licensed, certified 
public accountant or public accountant, consistent with attestation 
standards, examines and reports on management's written assertions 
concerning the effectiveness of its internal control over financial 
reporting in its most recently filed semiannual or year-end Call Report, 
with a concentration in high risk areas. For credit unions, such high 
risk areas most often include: lending activity; investing activity; and 
cash handling and deposit-taking activity.
    (k) State-licensed person refers to a certified public accountant or 
public accountant who is licensed by the State or jurisdiction where the 
credit union is principally located to perform accounting or auditing 
services for that credit union.
    (l) Supervisory committee refers to a supervisory committee as 
defined in Section 111(b) of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 
1761(b). For some federally-insured state chartered credit unions, the 
``audit committee'' designated by state statute or regulation is the 
equivalent of a supervisory committee.
    (m) Supervisory committee audit refers to an engagement under either 
Sec. 715.5 or Sec. 715.6 of this part.
    (n) Working papers refers to the principal record, in any form, of 
the work performed by the auditor and/or supervisory committee to 
support its findings and/or conclusions concerning significant matters. 
Examples include the written record of procedures applied, tests 
performed, information obtained, and pertinent conclusions reached in 
the engagement, proprietary audit programs, analyses, memoranda, letters 
of confirmation and representation, abstracts of credit union documents, 
reviewer's notes, if retained, and schedules or commentaries prepared or 
obtained in the course of the engagement.

<R05>
Sec. 715.3  General responsibilities of the Supervisory Committee.

    (a) Basic. The supervisory committee is responsible for ensuring 
that the board of directors and management of the credit union--
    (1) Meet required financial reporting objectives and
    (2) Establish practices and procedures sufficient to safeguard 
members' assets.
    (b) Specific. To carry out the responsibilities set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the supervisory committee must determine 
whether:
    (1) Internal controls are established and effectively maintained to 
achieve the credit union's financial reporting objectives which must be 
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the supervisory committee 
audit, verification of members' accounts and its additional 
responsibilities;
    (2) The credit union's accounting records and financial reports are 
promptly prepared and accurately reflect operations and results;
    (3) The relevant plans, policies, and control procedures established 
by the board of directors are properly administered; and
    (4) Policies and control procedures are sufficient to safeguard 
against error, conflict of interest, self-dealing and fraud.
    (c) Mandates. In carrying out the responsibilities set forth in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Supervisory Committee must:
    (1) Ensure that the credit union adheres to the measurement and 
filing requirements for reports filed with the NCUA Board under Sec. 
741.6 of this chapter;

[[Page 562]]

    (2) Perform or obtain a supervisory committee audit, as prescribed 
in Sec. 715.4 of this part;
    (3) Verify or cause the verification of members' passbooks and 
accounts against the records of the credit union, as prescribed in Sec. 
715.8 of this part;
    (4) Act to avoid imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with 
the requirements of this part, as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 715.11 and 
715.12 of this part.

[64 FR 41035, July 29, 1999, as amended at 69 FR 27828, May 17, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 715.4  Audit responsibility of the Supervisory Committee.

    (a) Annual audit requirement. A federally-insured credit union is 
required to obtain an annual supervisory committee audit which occurs at 
least once every calendar year (period of performance) and must cover 
the period elapsed since the last audit period (period effectively 
covered).
    (b) Financial statement audit option. Any federally-insured credit 
union, whether Federally- or State-chartered and regardless of asset 
size, may choose to fulfill its Supervisory Committee audit 
responsibility by obtaining an annual audit of its financial statements 
performed in accordance with GAAS by an independent person who is 
licensed to do so by the State or jurisdiction in which the credit union 
is principally located. (A ``financial statement audit'' is distinct 
from a ``supervisory committee audit,'' although a financial statement 
audit is included among the options for fulfilling the supervisory 
committee audit requirement. Compare Sec. 715.2(c) and (j).)
    (c) Other audit options. A federally insured credit union which does 
not choose to obtain a financial statement audit as permitted by 
subsection (b) must fulfill its supervisory audit responsibility under 
either of Sec. 715.5 or Sec. 715.6 of this part, whichever is 
applicable. See Table 1. For purposes of this part, a credit union's 
asset size is the amount of total assets reported in the year-end Call 
Report (NCUA form 5300) filed for the calendar year-end immediately 
preceding the period under audit.

    \1\ The Supervisory Committee audit responsibility under Part 715 
can always be fulfilled by obtaining a financial statement audit. Sec. 
715.4(b).

[[Page 563]]


<R05>
Sec. 715.5  Audit of Federal Credit Unions.

    (a) Total assets of $500 million or greater. To fulfill its 
Supervisory Committee audit responsibility, a federal credit union 
having total assets of $500 million or greater must obtain an annual 
audit of its financial statements performed in accordance with GAAS by 
an independent person who is licensed to do so by the State or 
jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally located.
    (b) Total assets of less than $500 million but more than $10 
million. To fulfill its Supervisory Committee audit responsibility, a 
Federally-chartered credit union having total assets of less than $500 
million but more than $10 Million which does not choose to obtain an 
audit under Sec. 715.5(a), must obtain an annual supervisory committee 
audit as prescribed in Sec. 715.7.
    (c) Total assets of $10 million or less. To fulfill its Supervisory 
Committee audit responsibility, a Federally-chartered credit union 
having total assets of $10 million or less must obtain an annual 
Supervisory Committee audit as prescribed in Sec. 715.7.
    (d) Other requirements. A federally chartered credit union, 
regardless of which audit it is required to obtain under this section, 
must meet other applicable requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 715.6  Audit of Federally-insured State-chartered credit unions.

    (a) Total assets of $500 million or greater. To fulfill its 
Supervisory Committee audit responsibility, a federally-insured State-
chartered credit union having total assets of $500 million or greater 
must obtain an annual audit of its financial statements performed in 
accordance with GAAS by an independent person who is licensed to do so 
by the State or jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally 
located.
    (b) Total assets of less than $500 million. To fulfill its 
Supervisory Committee audit responsibility, a federally-insured State-
chartered credit union having total assets of less than $500 million 
must obtain either an annual supervisory committee audit as prescribed 
under either Sec. 715.6(a) or Sec. 715.7, or an audit as prescribed by 
the State or jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally 
located, whichever audit is more stringent.
    (c) Other requirements. A federally-insured, state-chartered credit 
union, regardless of which audit it is required to obtain under this 
section, must meet other applicable requirements of this part except 
Sec. Sec. 715.5 and 715.12.


<R05>
Sec. 715.7  Supervisory Committee audit alternatives to a financial statement audit.

    A credit union which is not required to obtain a financial statement 
audit may fulfill its supervisory committee responsibility by any one of 
the following engagements:
    (a) Balance sheet audit. A balance sheet audit, as defined in Sec. 
715.2(a), performed by a person who is licensed to do so by the State or 
jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally located; or
    (b) Report on Examination of Internal Control over Call Reporting. 
An engagement and report on management's written assertions concerning 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the 
credit union's most recently filed semiannual or year-end call report 
(NCUA Form 5300), as defined in Sec. 715.2(j), performed by a person 
who is licensed to do so by the State or jurisdiction in which the 
credit union is principally located, and in which management specifies 
the criteria on which it based its evaluation of internal control; or
    (c) Audit per Supervisory Committee Guide. An audit performed by the 
supervisory committee, its internal auditor, or any other qualified 
person (such as a certified public accountant, public accountant, league 
auditor, credit union auditor consultant, retired financial institutions 
examiner, etc.) in accordance with the procedures prescribed in NCUA's 
Supervisory Committee Guide. Qualified persons who are not State-
licensed cannot provide assurance services under this subsection.


<R05>
Sec. 715.8  Requirements for verification of accounts and passbooks.

    (a) Verification obligation. The Supervisory Committee shall, at 
least once every two years, cause the passbooks (including any book, 
statements of account, or other record approved by the

[[Page 564]]

NCUA Board) and accounts of the members to be verified against the 
records of the treasurer of the credit union.
    (b) Methods. Any of the following methods may be used to verify 
members' passbooks and accounts, as appropriate:
    (1) Controlled verification. A controlled verification of 100 
percent of members' share and loan accounts;
    (2) Statistical method. A sampling method which provides for:
    (i) Random selection:
    (ii) A sample which is representative of the population from which 
it was selected;
    (iii) An equal chance of selecting each dollar in the population;
    (iv) Sufficient accounts in both number and scope on which to base 
conclusions concerning management's financial reporting objectives; and
    (v) Additional procedures to be performed if evidence provided by 
confirmations alone is not sufficient.
    (3) Non-statistical method. When the verification is performed by an 
Independent person licensed by the State or jurisdiction in which the 
credit union is principally located, the auditor may choose among the 
sampling methods set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
and non-statistical sampling methods consistent with GAAS if such 
methods provide for:
    (i) Sufficient accounts in both number and scope on which to base 
conclusions concerning management's financial reporting objectives to 
provide assurance that the General Ledger accounts are fairly stated in 
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole;
    (ii) Additional procedures to be performed by the auditor if 
evidence provided by confirmations alone is not sufficient; and
    (iii) Documentation of the sampling procedures used and of their 
consistency with GAAS (to be provided to the NCUA Board upon request).
    (c) Retention of records. The supervisory committee must retain the 
records of each verification of members' passbooks and accounts until it 
completes the next verification of members' passbooks and accounts.


<R05>
Sec. 715.9  Assistance from outside, compensated person.

    (a) Unrelated to officials. A compensated auditor who performs a 
Supervisory Committee audit on behalf of a credit union shall not be 
related by blood or marriage to any management employee, member of 
either the board of directors, the Supervisory Committee or the credit 
committee, or loan officer of that credit union.
    (b) Engagement letter. The engagement of a compensated auditor to 
perform all or a portion of the scope of a financial statement audit or 
supervisory committee audit shall be evidenced by an engagement letter. 
In all cases, the engagement must be contracted directly with the 
Supervisory Committee. The engagement letter must be signed by the 
compensated auditor and acknowledged therein by the Supervisory 
Committee prior to commencement of the engagement.
    (c) Contents of letter. The engagement letter shall:
    (1) Specify the terms, conditions, and objectives of the engagement;
    (2) Identify the basis of accounting to be used;
    (3) If a Supervisory Committee Guide audit, include an appendix 
setting forth the procedures to be performed;
    (4) Specify the rate of, or total, compensation to be paid for the 
audit;
    (5) Provide that the auditor shall, upon completion of the 
engagement, deliver to the Supervisory Committee a written report of the 
audit and notice in writing, either within the report or communicated 
separately, of any internal control reportable conditions and/or 
irregularities or illegal acts, if any, which come to the auditor's 
attention during the normal course of the audit (i.e., no notice 
required if none noted);
    (6) Specify a target date of delivery of the written reports, such 
target date not to exceed 120 days from date of calendar or fiscal year-
end under audit (period covered), unless the supervisory committee 
obtains a waiver from the supervising NCUA Regional Director;
    (7) Certify that NCUA staff and/or the State credit union 
supervisor, or designated representatives of each, will be provided 
unconditional access to the complete set of original working papers, 
either at the offices of the credit

[[Page 565]]

union or at a mutually agreed upon location, for purposes of inspection; 
and
    (8) Acknowledge that working papers shall be retained for a minimum 
of three years from the date of the written audit report.
    (d) Complete scope. If the engagement is to perform a Supervisory 
Committee Guide audit intended to fully meet the requirements of Sec. 
715.7(c), the engagement letter shall certify that the audit will 
address the complete scope of that engagement;
    (e) Exclusions from scope. If the engagement is to perform a 
Supervisory Committee Guide audit which will exclude any item required 
by the applicable section, the engagement letter shall:
    (1) Identify the excluded items;
    (2) State that, because of the exclusion(s), the resulting audit 
will not, by itself, fulfill the scope of a supervisory committee audit; 
and
    (3) Caution that the supervisory committee will remain responsible 
for fulfilling the scope of a supervisory committee audit with respect 
to the excluded items.


<R05>
Sec. 715.10  Audit report and working paper maintenance and access.

    (a) Audit report. Upon completion and/or receipt of the written 
report of a financial statement audit or a supervisory committee audit, 
the Supervisory Committee must verify that the audit was performed and 
reported in accordance with the terms of the engagement letter 
prescribed herein. The Supervisory Committee must submit the report(s) 
to the board of directors, and provide a summary of the results of the 
audit to the members of the credit union orally or in writing at the 
next annual meeting of the credit union. If a member so requests, the 
Supervisory Committee shall provide the member access to the full audit 
report. If the National Credit Union Administration (``NCUA'') so 
requests, the Supervisory Committee shall provide NCUA a copy of each of 
the audit reports it receives or produces.
    (b) Working papers. The supervisory committee shall be responsible 
for preparing and maintaining, or making available, a complete set of 
original working papers supporting each supervisory committee audit. The 
supervisory committee shall, upon request, provide NCUA staff 
unconditional access to such working papers, either at the offices of 
the credit union or at a mutually agreeable location, for purposes of 
inspecting such working papers.


<R05>
Sec. 715.11  Sanctions for failure to comply with this part.

    (a) Sanctions. Failure of a supervisory committee and/or its 
independent compensated auditor or other person to comply with the 
requirements of this section, or the terms of an engagement letter 
required by this section, is grounds for:
    (1) The regional director to reject the supervisory committee audit 
and provide a reasonable opportunity to correct deficiencies;
    (2) The regional director to impose the remedies available in Sec. 
715.12, provided any of the conditions specified therein is present; and
    (3) The NCUA Board to seek formal administrative sanctions against 
the supervisory committee and/or its independent, compensated auditor 
pursuant to section 206(r) of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 
1786(r).
    (b) State Charters. In the case of a federally-insured state 
chartered credit union, NCUA shall provide the state regulator an 
opportunity to timely impose a remedy satisfactory to NCUA before 
exercising it authority under Sec. 741.202 of this chapter to impose a 
sanction permitted under paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 715.12  Statutory audit remedies for Federal credit unions.

    (a) Audit by alternative licensed person. The NCUA Board may compel 
a federal credit union to obtain a supervisory committee audit which 
meets the minimum requirements of Sec. 715.5 or Sec. 715.7, and which 
is performed by an independent person who is licensed by the State or 
jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally located, for any 
fiscal year in which any of the following three conditions is present:
    (1) The Supervisory Committee has not obtained an annual financial 
statement audit or performed a supervisory committee audit; or

[[Page 566]]

    (2) The Supervisory Committee has obtained a financial statement 
audit or performed a supervisory committee audit which does not meet the 
requirements of part 715 including those in Sec. 715.8.
    (3) The credit union has experienced serious and persistent 
recordkeeping deficiencies as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Financial statement audit required. The NCUA Board may compel a 
federal credit union to obtain a financial statement audit performed in 
accordance with GAAS by an independent person who is licensed by the 
State or jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally located 
(even if such audit is not required by Sec. 715.5), for any fiscal year 
in which the credit union has experienced serious and persistent 
recordkeeping deficiencies as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. 
The objective of a financial statement audit performed under this 
paragraph is to reconstruct the records of the credit union sufficient 
to allow an unqualified or, if necessary, a qualified opinion on the 
credit union's financial statements. An adverse opinion or disclaimer of 
opinion should be the exception rather than the norm.
    (c) ``Serious and persistent recordkeeping deficiencies.'' A record-
keeping deficiency is ``serious'' if the NCUA Board reasonably believes 
that the board of directors and management of the credit union have not 
timely met financial reporting objectives and established practices and 
procedures sufficient to safeguard members' assets. A serious 
recordkeeping deficiency is ``persistent'' when it continues beyond a 
usual, expected or reasonable period of time.

Sec. 716.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. This part governs the treatment of nonpublic personal 
information about consumers by the credit unions listed in paragraph (b) 
of this section. This part:
    (1) Requires a credit union to provide notice to members about its 
privacy policies and practices;
    (2) Describes the conditions under which a credit union may disclose 
nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third 
parties; and
    (3) Provides a method for consumers to prevent a credit union from 
disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated third parties by 
``opting out'' of that disclosure, subject to the exceptions in Sec. 
Sec. 716.13, 716.14, and 716.15.

[[Page 567]]

    (b) Scope. (1) This part applies only to nonpublic personal 
information about individuals who obtain financial products or services 
for personal, family or household purposes. This part does not apply to 
information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial 
products or services for business, commercial or agricultural purposes. 
This part applies to federally-insured credit unions. This part refers 
to a federally-insured credit union as ``you'' or ``the credit union.''
    (2) Nothing in this part modifies, limits, or supersedes the 
standards governing individually identifiable financial information 
promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the 
authority of Sec. Sec. 262 and 264 of the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 1320d-1320d-8).


<R05>
Sec. 716.2  Rule of construction.

    The examples in this part and the sample clauses in appendix A of 
this part are not exclusive. Compliance with an example or use of a 
sample clause, to the extent applicable, constitutes compliance with 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 716.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part, unless the context requires otherwise:
    (a)(1) Affiliate means any company that controls, is controlled by, 
or is under common control with another company.
    (2) Examples. (i) An affiliate of a federal credit union is a credit 
union service organization (CUSO), as provided in 12 CFR part 712, that 
is controlled by the federal credit union.
    (ii) An affiliate of a federally-insured, state-chartered credit 
union is a company that is controlled by the credit union.
    (b)(1) Clear and conspicuous means that a notice is reasonably 
understandable and designed to call attention to the nature and 
significance of the information in the notice.
    (2) Examples. (i) Reasonably understandable. You make your notice 
reasonably understandable if you:
    (A) Present the information contained in the notice in clear, 
concise sentences, paragraphs and sections;
    (B) Use short, explanatory sentences or bullet lists whenever 
possible;
    (C) Use definite, concrete, everyday words and active voice whenever 
possible;
    (D) Avoid multiple negatives;
    (E) Avoid legal and highly technical business terminology wherever 
possible; and
    (F) Avoid explanations that are imprecise and readily subject to 
different interpretations.
    (ii) Designed to call attention. You design your notice to call 
attention to the nature and significance of the information in it if 
you:
    (A) Use a plain-language heading to call attention to the notice;
    (B) Use a typeface and type size that are easy to read;
    (C) Provide wide margins and ample line spacing;
    (D) Use boldface or italics for key words; and
    (E) In a form that combines your notice with other information, use 
distinctive type size, style, and graphic devices, such as shading or 
sidebars.
    (iii) Notices on web sites. If you provide notices on a web page, 
you design your notice to call attention to the nature and significance 
of the information in it if you use text or visual cues to encourage 
scrolling down the page if necessary to view the entire notice and 
ensure that other elements on the web site (such as text graphics, 
hyperlinks or sound) do not distract attention form the notice, and you 
either:
    (A) Place the notice on a screen frequently accessed by consumers, 
such as a home page or a page on which transactions are conducted; or
    (B) Place a link on a screen frequently accessed by consumers, such 
as a home page or a page on which transactions are conducted, that 
connects directly to the notice and is labeled appropriately to convey 
the importance, nature and relevance of the notice.
    (c) Collect means to obtain information that you organize or can 
retrieve by the name of an individual or by identifying number, symbol, 
or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, irrespective 
of the source of the underlying information.

business

[[Page 568]]

trust, general or limited partnership, association or similar 
organization.
    (e)(1) Consumer means an individual who obtains or has obtained a 
financial product or service from you, that is to be used primarily for 
personal, family or household purposes, or that individual's legal 
representative.
    (2) Examples. (i) An individual who provides nonpublic personal 
information to you in connection with obtaining or seeking to obtain 
credit union membership is your consumer regardless of whether you 
establish a member relationship.
    (ii) An individual who provides nonpublic personal information to 
you in connection with using your ATM is your consumer.
    (iii) If you hold ownership or servicing rights to an individual's 
loan, the individual is your consumer, even if you hold those rights in 
conjunction with one or more financial institutions. (The individual is 
also a consumer with respect to the other financial institutions 
involved). This applies, even if you, or another financial institution 
with those rights, hire an agent to collect on the loan or to provide 
processing or other services.
    (iv) An individual who is a consumer of another financial 
institution is not your consumer solely because you act as agent for, or 
provide processing or other services to, that financial institution.
    (v) An individual is not your consumer solely because he or she is a 
participant or a beneficiary of an employee benefit plan that you 
sponsor or for which you act as a trustee or fiduciary.

603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)).
    (g) Control of a company means:

directors, trustees or general partners (or individuals exercising 
similar functions) of the company; or
    (3) The power to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling 
influence over the management or policies of the company, as the NCUA 
determines. With respect to state-chartered credit unions, NCUA will 
consult with the appropriate state regulator prior to making its 
determination.
    (4) Example. NCUA will presume a credit union has a controlling 
influence over the management or policies of a CUSO, if the CUSO is 67% 
owned by credit unions.
    (h) Credit union means a federal or state-chartered credit union 
that the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund insures.

is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.);
    (ii) The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation or any entity 
chartered and operating under the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (12 U.S.C.

securitizations, secondary market sales (including sales of servicing 
rights) or similar transactions related to a transaction of a consumer,

information to a nonaffiliated third party.
    (m) (1) Financial product or service means any product or service

family or household purposes. As noted in the examples, this will

<R04>
                  Subpart A_Privacy and Opt Out Notices


<R05>
Sec. 716.4  Initial privacy notice to consumers required.

    (a) Initial notice requirement. You must provide a clear and 
conspicuous notice that accurately reflects your privacy policies and 
practices to a:
    (1) Member, not later than when you establish a member relationship, 
except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (2) Consumer, before you disclose any nonpublic personal information 
about the consumer to any nonaffiliated third party, if you make such a 
disclosure other than as authorized by Sec. Sec. 716.14 and 716.15.
    (b) When initial notice to a consumer is not required. You are not 
required to provide an initial notice to a consumer under paragraph (a) 
of this section if:
    (1) You do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about the 
consumer to any nonaffiliated third party, other than as authorized by 
Sec. Sec. 716.14 and 716.15; and
    (2) You do not have a member relationship with the consumer.
    (c) When you establish a member relationship--(1) General rule. You 
establish a member relationship when you and the consumer enter into a 
continuing relationship.
    (2) Special rule for loans. You establish a member relationship with 
a consumer when you originate, or acquire the servicing rights to a loan 
to the consumer for personal, household or family purposes and that is 
the only basis for the member relationship. If you subsequently transfer 
the servicing rights to that loan to another financial institution, the 
member relationship transfers with the servicing rights.
    (3)(i) Examples of establishing member relationship. You establish a 
member relationship when the consumer:
    (A) Becomes your member under your bylaws;
    (B) Is a nonmember and opens a credit card account with you jointly 
with a member under your procedures;
    (C) Is a nonmember and executes the contract to open a share or 
share draft account with you or obtains credit from you jointly with a 
member, including an individual acting as a guarantor;
    (D) Is a nonmember and opens an account with you and you are a 
credit union designated as a low-income credit union;
    (E) Is a nonmember and opens an account with you pursuant to state 
law and you are a state-chartered credit union.
    (ii) Examples of loan rule. You establish a member relationship with 
a consumer who obtains a loan for personal, family, or household 
purposes when you:
    (A) Originate the loan to the consumer and retain the servicing 
rights; or
    (B) Purchase the servicing rights to the consumer's loan.
    (d) Existing members. When an existing member obtains a new 
financial product or service that is to be used primarily for personal, 
family, or household purposes, you satisfy the initial notice 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as follows:
    (1) You may provide a revised policy notice, under Sec. 716.8, that 
covers the member's new financial product or service; or
    (2) If the initial, revised, or annual notice that you most recently 
provided to that member was accurate with respect to the new financial 
product or service, you do not need to provide a new privacy notice 
under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) Exceptions to allow subsequent delivery of notice. (1) You may 
provide the initial notice required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
within a reasonable time after you establish a member relationship if:

[[Page 572]]

    (i) Establishing the member relationship is not at the member's 
election;
    (ii) Providing notice not later than when you establish a member 
relationship would substantially delay the member's transaction and the 
member agrees to receive the notice at a later time.
    (2) Examples of exceptions. (i) Not at member's election. 
Establishing a member relationship is not at the member's election if 
you acquire a member's deposit liability from another financial 
institution and the member does not have a choice about your 
acquisition.
    (ii) Substantial delay of member's transaction. Providing notice not 
later than when you establish a member relationship would substantially 
delay the member's transaction when:
    (A) You and the individual agree over the telephone to enter into a 
member relationship involving prompt delivery of the financial product 
or service; or
    (B) You establish a member relationship with an individual under a 
program authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) or similar student loan programs where loan 
proceeds are disbursed promptly without prior communication between you 
and the member.
    (iii) No substantial delay of member's transaction. Providing notice 
not later than when you establish a member relationship would not 
substantially delay the member's transaction when the relationship is 
initiated in person at your office or through other means by which the 
member may view the notice, such as on a web site.
    (f)(1) Joint relationships. If two or more consumers jointly obtain 
a financial product or service, other than a loan, from you, you may 
satisfy the requirements of paragraph of this section by providing one 
initial notice to those consumers jointly.
    (2) Special rule for loans. (i) You are required to provide an 
initial notice to a borrower or guarantor on a loan if you share his or 
her nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties 
other than for purposes under Sec. Sec. 716.13, 716.14 and 716.15. (ii) 
You may satisfy the annual notice requirements of Sec. 716.5 by 
providing one notice to those borrowers and guarantors jointly.
    (g) Delivery. When you are required to deliver an initial privacy 
notice by this section, you must deliver it according to the methods in 
Sec. 716.9. If you use a short-form initial notice for nonmember 
consumers according to Sec. 716.6(c), you may deliver your privacy 
notice according to Sec. 716.6(c)(3).

[65 FR 31740, May 18, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 36783, June 12, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 716.5  Annual privacy notice to members required.

    (a)(1) General rule. You must provide a clear and conspicuous notice 
to members that accurately reflects your privacy policies and practices 
not less than annually during the continuation of the member 
relationship. Annually means at least once in any period of 12 
consecutive months during which that relationship exists. You may define 
the 12-consecutive-month period, but you must apply it to the member on 
a consistent basis.
    (2) Example. You provide a notice annually if you define the 12-
consecutive-month period as a calendar year and provide the annual 
notice to the member once in each calendar year following the calendar 
year in which you provide the initial notice. For example, if a member 
opens an account on any day of year one, you must provide an annual 
notice to that member by December 31 of year two.
    (b) (1) Termination of member relationship. You are not required to 
provide an annual notice to a former member.
    (2) Examples. Your member becomes your former member when:
    (i) An individual is no longer your member as defined in your 
bylaws;
    (ii) In the case of a nonmember's share or share draft account, the 
account is inactive under the credit union's policies;
    (iii) In the case of a nonmember's closed-end loan, the loan is paid 
in full, you charge off the loan, or you sell the loan without retaining 
servicing rights;
    (iv) In the case of a credit card relationship or other open-end 
credit relationship with a nonmember, you no longer provide any 
statements or notices to the nonmember concerning that relationship or 
you sell the credit

[[Page 573]]

card receivables without retaining servicing rights; or
    (v) You have not communicated with the nonmember about the 
relationship for a period of twelve consecutive months, other than to 
provide annual privacy notices or promotional material.
    (c) Delivery. When you are required to deliver an annual privacy 
notice by this section, you must deliver it according to the methods in 
Sec. 716.9.


<R05>
Sec. 716.6  Information to be included in initial and annual privacy notices.

    (a) General rule. The initial and annual privacy notices under 
Sec. Sec. 716.4 and 716.5 must include each of the following items of 
information that applies to you or to the consumers to whom you send 
your privacy notice, in addition to any other information you wish to 
provide:
    (1) The categories of nonpublic personal information that you 
collect;
    (2) The categories of nonpublic personal information that you 
disclose;
    (3) The categories of affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to 
whom you disclose nonpublic personal information, other than those 
parties to whom you disclose information under Sec. Sec. 716.14 and 
716.15;
    (4) The categories of nonpublic personal information about your 
former members that you disclose and the categories of affiliates and 
nonaffiliated third parties to whom you disclose it, other than those 
parties to whom you disclose information under Sec. Sec. 716.14 and 
716.15;
    (5) If you disclose nonpublic personal information to a 
nonaffiliated third party under Sec. 716.13 (and no other exception 
applies to that disclosure), a separate statement of the categories of 
information you disclose and the categories of third parties with whom 
you have contracted;
    (6) An explanation of the consumer's right under Sec. 716.10(a) to 
opt out of the disclosure of nonpublic personal information to 
nonaffiliated third parties, including the methods by which the consumer

    (7) Any disclosures that you make under section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of

parties as authorized under Sec. Sec. 716.14 and 716.15, you are not 
required to list those exceptions in the initial or annual privacy

consumers. (1) You may satisfy the initial notice requirements in

you disclose. You satisfy the requirement to categorize the affiliates

    (i) Financial service providers;
    (ii) Non-financial companies; and

Sec. 716.7  Form of opt out notice to consumers and opt out methods.

    (a)(1) Form of opt out notice. If you are required to provide an opt 
out notice under Sec. 716.10(a)(1), you must provide a clear and 
conspicuous notice to each of your consumers that accurately explains 
the right to opt out under that section. The notice must state:
    (i) That you disclose or reserve the right to disclose nonpublic 
personal information about your consumer to a nonaffiliated third party;
    (ii) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; 
and
    (iii) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt 
out right.
    (2) Examples. (i) Adequate opt out notice. You provide adequate 
notice that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of nonpublic 
personal information to a nonaffiliated third party if you:
    (A) Identify all of the categories of nonpublic personal information 
that you disclose or reserve the right to disclose and all of the 
categories of nonaffiliated third parties to whom you disclose the 
information, as described in Sec. 716.6(a)(2) and (3) and state that 
the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of that information; and
    (B) Identify the financial products or services that the consumer 
obtains from you, either singly or jointly, to which the opt out 
direction would apply.
    (ii) Reasonable opt out means. You provide a reasonable means to 
exercise an opt out right if you:
    (A) Designate check-off boxes in a prominent position on the 
relevant forms with the opt out notice;
    (B) Include a reply form together with the opt out notice;
    (C) Provide an electronic means to opt out, such as a form that can 
be sent via electronic mail or a process at your web site, if the 
consumer agrees to the electronic delivery of information; or
    (D) Provide a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call to 
opt out.
    (iii) Unreasonable opt out means. You do not provide a reasonable 
means of opting out if:
    (A) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or 
her own letter to exercise that opt out right; or
    (B) The only means of opting out as described in any notice 
subsequent to the initial notice is to use a check-off box that was 
provided with the initial notice but not included with the subsequent 
notice.
    (iv) Specific opt out means. You may require each consumer to opt 
out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable for 
that consumer.
    (b) Same form as initial notice permitted. You may provide the opt 
out notice together with or on the same written or electronic form as 
the initial notice you provide in accordance with Sec. 716.4.
    (c) Initial notice required when opt out notice delivered subsequent 
to initial notice. If you provide the opt out notice later than required 
for the initial notice in accordance with Sec. 716.4, you must also 
include a copy of the initial notice in writing or, if the consumer 
agrees, electronically.
    (d) Joint relationships. (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain 
a financial product or service, other than a loan, from you, you may 
provide only a single opt out notice. Your opt out notice must explain 
how you will treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer as explained 
in the examples in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
    (2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out. 
You may either:
    (i) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer to apply to all 
of the associated joint consumers; or
    (ii) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately.
    (3) If you permit each joint consumer to opt out separately, you 
must permit one of the joint consumers to opt out on behalf of all of 
the joint consumers.
    (4) You may not require all joint consumers to opt out before you 
implement any opt out direction.
    (5) Example. If John and Mary have a joint share account with you 
and arrange for you to send statements to John's address, you may do any 
of the following, but you must explain in your opt out notice which opt 
out policy you will follow:

[[Page 576]]

    (i) Send a single opt out notice to John's address, but you must 
accept an opt out direction from either John or Mary.
    (ii) Treat an opt out direction by either John or Mary as applying 
to the entire account. If you do so, and John opts out, you may not 
require Mary to opt out as well before implementing John's opt out 
direction.
    (iii) Permit John and Mary to make different opt out directions. If 
you do so, and if John and Mary both opt out, you must permit one or 
both of them to notify you in a single response (such as on a form or 
through a telephone call).
    (6) Special rule for loans. (i) You are required to provide an 
initial opt out notice to a borrower or guarantor on a loan if you share 
his or her nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third 
parties other than for purposes under Sec. Sec. 716.13, 716.14 and 
716.15.
    (ii) You may satisfy your annual opt out notice requirement by 
providing one notice to those borrowers and guarantors jointly.
    (e) Time to comply with opt out. You must comply with the consumer's 
opt out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after you receive 
it.
    (f) Continuing right to opt out. A consumer may exercise the right 
to opt out at any time.
    (g) Duration of consumer's opt out direction. (1) A consumer's 
direction to opt out under this section is effective until the consumer 
revokes it in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.
    (2) When a member relationship terminates, the member's opt out 
direction continues to apply to the nonpublic personal information that 
you collected during or related to the relationship. If the individual 
subsequently establishes a new member relationship with you, the opt out 
direction that applied to the former relationship does not apply to the 
new relationship.
    (h) Delivery. When you are required to deliver an opt out notice by 
this section, you must deliver it according to the methods in Sec. 
716.9.

adequately described in your prior notice.
    (c) Delivery. When you are required to deliver a revised privacy 
notice by this section, you must deliver it according to the methods in

<R05>
Sec. 716.9  Delivering privacy and opt out notices.

    (a) How to provide notices. You must provide any privacy notices and 
opt out notices, including short-form initial notices, that this part 
requires so that each consumer can reasonably be expected to receive 
actual notice in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.

[[Page 577]]

    (b) (1) Examples of reasonable expectation of actual notice. You may 
reasonably expect that a consumer will receive actual notice if you:
    (i) Hand-deliver a printed copy of the notice to the consumer;
    (ii) Mail a printed copy of the notice to the last known address of 
the consumer;
    (iii) For the consumer who conducts transactions electronically, 
post the notice on the electronic site and require the consumer to 
acknowledge receipt of the notice as a necessary step to obtaining a 
particular financial product or service;
    (iv) For an isolated transaction with the consumer, such as an ATM 
transaction, post the notice on the ATM screen and require the consumer 
to acknowledge receipt of the notice as a necessary step to obtaining 
the particular financial product or service.
    (2) Examples of unreasonable expectations of actual notice. You may 
not, however, reasonably expect that a consumer will receive actual 
notice if you:
    (i) Only post a sign in your branch or office or generally publish 
advertisements of your privacy policies and practices;
    (ii) Send the notice via electronic mail to a consumer who does not 
obtain a financial product or service from you electronically.
    (c) Annual notices only. You may reasonably expect that a member 
will receive actual notice of your annual privacy notice if:
    (1) The member uses your web site to access financial products and 
services electronically and agrees to receive notices at your web site 
and you post your current privacy notice continuously in a clear and 
conspicuous manner on your web site; or
    (2) The member has requested that you refrain from sending any 
information regarding the member relationship, and your current privacy 
notice remains available to the member upon request.
    (d) Oral description of notice insufficient. You may not provide any 
notice required by this part solely by orally explaining the notice, 
either in person or over the telephone.
    (e) Retention or accessibility of notices for members. (1) For 
members only, you must provide the initial notice required by Sec. 
716.4 (a)(1), the annual notice required by Sec. 716.5(a) and the 
revised notice required by Sec. 716.8 so that the member can retain 
them or obtain them later in writing or, if the member agrees, 
electronically.
    (2) Examples of retention or accessibility. You provide the privacy 
notice to the member so that the member can retain it or obtain it later 
if you:
    (i) Hand-deliver a printed copy of the notice to the member;
    (ii) Mail a printed copy of the notice to the last known address of 
the member upon request of the member; or
    (iii) Make your current privacy notice available on a web site (or a 
link to another web site) for the member who obtains a financial product 
or service electronically and agrees to receive the notice at the web 
site.

supersede the operation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681

regulation, order or interpretation is inconsistent with the provisions 
of this part, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.
    (b) Greater protection under state law. For purposes of this 
section, a state statute, regulation, order or interpretation is not 
inconsistent with the provisions of this part if the protection such 
statute, regulation, order or interpretation affords any consumer is

of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This part generally applies to federal 
credit unions that obtain and use information about consumers to 
determine the consumer's eligibility for products, services, or

paragraph and do not illustrate any other issue that may arise in this 
part.

seq.).
    (b) Affiliate means any company that is related by common ownership 
or common corporate control with another company. For example, an 
affiliate of a Federal credit union is a credit union service

    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Company means any corporation, limited liability company,

<R05>
Sec. 717.20  Coverage and definitions

    (a) Coverage. Subpart C of this part applies to federal credit 
unions and their affiliates as defined in Sec. 717.3(a) of Subpart A.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Clear and conspicuous. The term ``clear and conspicuous'' means 
reasonably understandable and designed to call attention to the nature 
and significance of the information presented.
    (2) Concise. (i) In general. The term ``concise'' means a reasonably 
brief expression or statement.
    (ii) Combination with other required disclosures. A notice required 
by this subpart may be concise even if it is combined with other 
disclosures required or authorized by federal or state law.
    (3) Eligibility information. The term ``eligibility information'' 
means any information the communication of which would be a consumer 
report if the exclusions from the definition of ``consumer report'' in 
section 603(d)(2)(A) of the Act did not apply. Eligibility information 
does not include aggregate or blind data that does not contain personal 
identifiers such as account numbers, names, or addresses.
    (4) Pre-existing business relationship. (i) In general. The term 
``pre-existing business relationship'' means a relationship between a 
person, or a person's licensed agent, and a consumer based on--
    (A) A financial contract between the person and the consumer which 
is in force on the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation 
covered by this subpart;
    (B) The purchase, rental, or lease by the consumer of the person's 
goods or services, or a financial transaction (including holding an 
active account or a policy in force or having another continuing 
relationship) between the consumer and the person, during the 18-month 
period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent

[[Page 586]]

a solicitation covered by this subpart; or
    (C) An inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a product or 
service offered by that person during the three-month period immediately 
preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered 
by this subpart.
    (ii) Examples of pre-existing business relationships. (A) If a 
consumer has a time deposit account, such as a share certificate, at a 
federal credit union that is currently in force, the federal credit 
union has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can 
use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make 
solicitations to the consumer about its products or services.
    (B) If a consumer obtained a share certificate from a federal credit 
union, but did not renew the certificate at maturity, the federal credit 
union has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can 
use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make 
solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 
months after the date of maturity of the share certificate.
    (C) If a consumer obtains a mortgage, the mortgage lender has a pre-
existing business relationship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender 
sells the consumer's entire loan to an investor, the mortgage lender has 
a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use 
eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make 
solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 
months after the date it sells the loan, and the investor has a pre-
existing business relationship with the consumer upon purchasing the 
loan. If, however, the mortgage lender sells a fractional interest in 
the consumer's loan to an investor but also retains an ownership 
interest in the loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-
existing business relationship with the consumer, but the investor does 
not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. If the 
mortgage lender retains ownership of the loan, but sells ownership of 
the servicing rights to the consumer's loan, the mortgage lender 
continues to have a pre-existing business relationship with the 
consumer. The purchaser of the servicing rights also has a pre-existing 
business relationship with the consumer as of the date it purchases 
ownership of the servicing rights, but only if it collects payments from 
or otherwise deals directly with the consumer on a continuing basis.
    (D) If a consumer applies to a federal credit union for a product or 
service that it offers, but does not obtain a product or service from or 
enter into a financial contract or transaction with the institution, the 
federal credit union has a pre-existing business relationship with the 
consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from 
an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or 
services for three months after the date of the application.
    (E) If a consumer makes a telephone inquiry to a federal credit 
union about its products or services and provides contact information to 
the institution, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter 
into a financial contract or transaction with the institution, the 
federal credit union has a pre-existing business relationship with the 
consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from 
an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or 
services for three months after the date of the inquiry.
    (F) If a consumer makes an inquiry to a federal credit union by e-
mail about its products or services, but does not obtain a product or 
service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the 
institution, the federal credit union has a pre-existing business 
relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility 
information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the 
consumer about its products or services for three months after the date 
of the inquiry.
    (G) If a consumer has an existing relationship with a federal credit 
union that is part of a group of affiliated companies, makes a telephone 
call to the centralized call center for the group of affiliated 
companies to inquire about products or services offered by the insurance 
brokerage affiliate,

[[Page 587]]

and provides contact information to the call center, the call 
constitutes an inquiry to the insurance brokerage affiliate that offers 
those products or services. The insurance brokerage affiliate has a pre-
existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use 
eligibility information it receives from its affiliated federal credit 
union to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or 
services for three months after the date of the inquiry.
    (iii) Examples where no pre-existing business relationship is 
created. (A) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a centralized call 
center for a group of affiliated companies to inquire about the 
consumer's existing account at a federal credit union, the call does not 
constitute an inquiry to any affiliate other than the federal credit 
union that holds the consumer's account and does not establish a pre-
existing business relationship between the consumer and any affiliate of 
the account-holding federal credit union.
    (B) If a consumer who has a deposit account with a federal credit 
union makes a telephone call to an affiliate of the institution to ask 
about the affiliate's retail locations and hours, but does not make an 
inquiry about the affiliate's products or services, the call does not 
constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business 
relationship between the consumer and the affiliate. Also, the 
affiliate's capture of the consumer's telephone number does not 
constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business 
relationship between the consumer and the affiliate.
    (C) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a federal credit union 
in response to an advertisement that offers a free promotional item to 
consumers who call a toll-free number, but the advertisement does not 
indicate that the federal credit union's products or services will be 
marketed to consumers who call in response, the call does not create a 
pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the federal 
credit union because the consumer has not made an inquiry about a 
product or service offered by the institution, but has merely responded 
to an offer for a free promotional item.
    (5) Solicitation. (i) In general. The term ``solicitation'' means 
the marketing of a product or service initiated by a person to a 
particular consumer that is--
    (A) Based on eligibility information communicated to that person by 
its affiliate as described in this subpart; and
    (B) Intended to encourage the consumer to purchase or obtain such 
product or service.
    (ii) Exclusion of marketing directed at the general public. A 
solicitation does not include marketing communications that are directed 
at the general public. For example, television, general circulation 
magazine, and billboard advertisements do not constitute solicitations, 
even if those communications are intended to encourage consumers to 
purchase products and services from the person initiating the 
communications.
    (iii) Examples of solicitations. A solicitation would include, for 
example, a telemarketing call, direct mail, e-mail, or other form of 
marketing communication directed to a particular consumer that is based 
on eligibility information received from an affiliate.
    (6) You means a person described in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 717.21  Affiliate marketing opt-out and exceptions.

    (a) Initial notice and opt-out requirement. (1) In general. You may 
not use eligibility information about a consumer that you receive from 
an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to the 
consumer, unless--
    (i) It is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer in 
writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically, in a concise notice 
that you may use eligibility information about that consumer received 
from an affiliate to make solicitations for marketing purposes to the 
consumer;
    (ii) The consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity and a 
reasonable and simple method to ``opt out,'' or prohibit you from using 
eligibility information to make solicitations for marketing purposes to 
the consumer; and
    (iii) The consumer has not opted out.

[[Page 588]]

    (2) Example. A consumer has a homeowner's insurance policy obtained 
through an insurance brokerage. The insurance brokerage furnishes 
eligibility information about the consumer to its affiliated federal 
credit union. Based on that eligibility information, the federal credit 
union wants to make a solicitation to the consumer about its home equity 
loan products. The federal credit union does not have a pre-existing 
business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions 
apply. The federal credit union is prohibited from using eligibility 
information received from its insurance brokerage affiliate to make 
solicitations to the consumer about its home equity loan products unless 
the consumer is given a notice and opportunity to opt out and the 
consumer does not opt out.
    (3) Affiliates who may provide the notice. The notice required by 
this paragraph must be provided:
    (i) By an affiliate that has or has previously had a pre-existing 
business relationship with the consumer; or
    (ii) As part of a joint notice from two or more members of an 
affiliated group of companies, provided that at least one of the 
affiliates on the joint notice has or has previously had a pre-existing 
business relationship with the consumer.
    (b) Making solicitations. (1) In general. For purposes of this 
subpart, you make a solicitation for marketing purposes if--
    (i) You receive eligibility information from an affiliate;
    (ii) You use that eligibility information to do one or more of the 
following:
    (A) Identify the consumer or type of consumer to receive a 
solicitation;
    (B) Establish criteria used to select the consumer to receive a 
solicitation; or
    (C) Decide which of your products or services to market to the 
consumer or tailor your solicitation to that consumer; and
    (iii) As a result of your use of the eligibility information, the 
consumer is provided a solicitation.
    (2) Receiving eligibility information from an affiliate, including 
through a common database. You may receive eligibility information from 
an affiliate in various ways, including when the affiliate places that 
information into a common database that you may access.
    (3) Receipt or use of eligibility information by your service 
provider. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, you 
receive or use an affiliate's eligibility information if a service 
provider acting on your behalf (whether an affiliate or a nonaffiliated 
third party) receives or uses that information in the manner described 
in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section. All relevant 
facts and circumstances will determine whether a person is acting as 
your service provider when it receives or uses an affiliate's 
eligibility information in connection with marketing your products and 
services.
    (4) Use by an affiliate of its own eligibility information. Unless 
you have used eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate 
in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, you do 
not make a solicitation subject to this subpart if your affiliate:
    (i) Uses its own eligibility information that it obtained in 
connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with 
the consumer to market your products or services to the consumer; or
    (ii) Directs its service provider to use the affiliate's own 
eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-
existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer to market 
your products or services to the consumer, and you do not communicate 
directly with the service provider regarding that use.
    (5) Use of eligibility information by a service provider. (i) In 
general. You do not make a solicitation subject to Subpart C of this 
part if a service provider (including an affiliated or third-party 
service provider that maintains or accesses a common database that you 
may access) receives eligibility information from your affiliate that 
your affiliate obtained in connection with a pre-existing business 
relationship it has or had with the consumer and uses that eligibility 
information to market your products or services to the consumer, so long 
as--
    (A) Your affiliate controls access to and use of its eligibility 
information by the service provider (including the

[[Page 589]]

right to establish the specific terms and conditions under which the 
service provider may use such information to market your products or 
services);
    (B) Your affiliate establishes specific terms and conditions under 
which the service provider may access and use the affiliate's 
eligibility information to market your products and services (or those 
of affiliates generally) to the consumer, such as the identity of the 
affiliated companies whose products or services may be marketed to the 
consumer by the service provider, the types of products or services of 
affiliated companies that may be marketed, and the number of times the 
consumer may receive marketing materials, and periodically evaluates the 
service provider's compliance with those terms and conditions;
    (C) Your affiliate requires the service provider to implement 
reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service 
provider uses the affiliate's eligibility information in accordance with 
the terms and conditions established by the affiliate relating to the 
marketing of your products or services;
    (D) Your affiliate is identified on or with the marketing materials 
provided to the consumer; and
    (E) You do not directly use your affiliate's eligibility information 
in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Writing requirements. (A) The requirements of paragraphs 
(b)(5)(i)(A) and (C) of this section must be set forth in a written 
agreement between your affiliate and the service provider; and
    (B) The specific terms and conditions established by your affiliate 
as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section must be set forth 
in writing.
    (6) Examples of making solicitations. (i) A consumer has a deposit 
account with a federal credit union, which is affiliated with an 
insurance brokerage. The insurance brokerage receives eligibility 
information about the consumer from the federal credit union. The 
insurance brokerage uses that eligibility information to identify the 
consumer to receive a solicitation about insurance brokerage services, 
and, as a result, the insurance brokerage provides a solicitation to the 
consumer about its services. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the insurance brokerage has made a solicitation to the 
consumer.
    (ii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this 
section, except that after using the eligibility information to identify 
the consumer to receive a solicitation about insurance brokerage 
services, the insurance brokerage asks the federal credit union to send 
the solicitation to the consumer and the federal credit union does so. 
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the insurance brokerage 
has made a solicitation to the consumer because it used eligibility 
information about the consumer that it received from an affiliate to 
identify the consumer to receive a solicitation about its products or 
services, and, as a result, a solicitation was provided to the consumer 
about the insurance brokerage's services.
    (iii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of 
this section, except that eligibility information about consumers that 
have deposit accounts with the federal credit union is placed into a 
common database that all members of the affiliated group of companies 
may independently access and use. Without using the federal credit 
union's eligibility information, the insurance brokerage develops 
selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and 
related instructions to the federal credit union. The federal credit 
union reviews eligibility information about its own consumers using the 
selection criteria provided by the insurance brokerage to determine 
which consumers should receive the insurance brokerage's marketing 
materials and sends marketing materials about the insurance brokerage's 
services to those consumers. Even though the insurance brokerage has 
received eligibility information through the common database as provided 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it did not use that information to 
identify consumers or establish selection criteria; instead, the federal 
credit union used its own eligibility information. Therefore, pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section,

[[Page 590]]

the insurance brokerage has not made a solicitation to the consumer.
    (iv) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of 
this section, except that the federal credit union provides the 
insurance brokerage's criteria to the federal credit union's service 
provider and directs the service provider to use the federal credit 
union's eligibility information to identify federal credit union 
consumers who meet the criteria and to send the insurance brokerage's 
marketing materials to those consumers. The insurance brokerage does not 
communicate directly with the service provider regarding the use of the 
federal credit union's information to market its services to the federal 
credit union's consumers. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this 
section, the insurance brokerage has not made a solicitation to the 
consumer.
    (v) An affiliated group of companies includes a federal credit 
union, an insurance brokerage, and a service provider. Each affiliate in 
the group places information about its consumers into a common database. 
The service provider has access to all information in the common 
database. The federal credit union controls access to and use of its 
eligibility information by the service provider. This control is set 
forth in a written agreement between the federal credit union and the 
service provider. The written agreement also requires the service 
provider to establish reasonable policies and procedures designed to 
ensure that the service provider uses the federal credit union's 
eligibility information in accordance with specific terms and conditions 
established by the federal credit union relating to the marketing of the 
products and services of all affiliates, including the insurance 
brokerage. In a separate written communication, the federal credit union 
specifies the terms and conditions under which the service provider may 
use the federal credit union's eligibility information to market the 
insurance brokerage's products and services to the federal credit 
union's consumers. The specific terms and conditions are: a list of 
affiliated companies (including the insurance brokerage) whose products 
or services may be marketed to the federal credit union's consumers by 
the service provider; the specific products or types of products that 
may be marketed to the federal credit union's consumers by the service 
provider; the categories of eligibility information that may be used by 
the service provider in marketing products or services to the federal 
credit union's consumers; the types or categories of the federal credit 
union's consumers to whom the service provider may market products or 
services of federal credit union affiliates; the number and/or types of 
marketing communications that the service provider may send to the 
federal credit union's consumers; and the length of time during which 
the service provider may market the products or services of the federal 
credit union's affiliates to its consumers. The federal credit union 
periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with these 
terms and conditions. The insurance brokerage asks the service provider 
to market insurance products to certain consumers who have deposit 
accounts with the federal credit union. Without using the federal credit 
union's eligibility information, the insurance brokerage develops 
selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and 
related instructions to the service provider. The service provider uses 
the federal credit union's eligibility information from the common 
database to identify the federal credit union's consumers to whom 
insurance brokerage services will be marketed. When the insurance 
brokerage's marketing materials are provided to the identified 
consumers, the name of the federal credit union is displayed on the 
brokerage marketing materials, an introductory letter that accompanies 
the marketing materials, an account statement that accompanies the 
marketing materials, or the envelope containing the marketing materials. 
The requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have been 
satisfied, and the insurance brokerage has not made a solicitation to 
the consumer.
    (vi) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this 
section, except that the terms and conditions permit the service 
provider to use the federal credit union's eligibility information to 
market the products and

[[Page 591]]

services of other affiliates to the federal credit union's consumers 
whenever the service provider deems it appropriate to do so. The service 
provider uses the federal credit union's eligibility information in 
accordance with the discretion afforded to it by the terms and 
conditions. Because the terms and conditions are not specific, the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have not been 
satisfied.
    (c) Exceptions. The provisions of this subpart do not apply to you 
if you use eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate:
    (1) To make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer with 
whom you have a pre-existing business relationship;
    (2) To facilitate communications to an individual for whose benefit 
you provide employee benefit or other services pursuant to a contract 
with an employer related to and arising out of the current employment 
relationship or status of the individual as a participant or beneficiary 
of an employee benefit plan;
    (3) To perform services on behalf of an affiliate, except that this 
subparagraph shall not be construed as permitting you to send 
solicitations on behalf of an affiliate if the affiliate would not be 
permitted to send the solicitation as a result of the election of the 
consumer to opt out under this subpart;
    (4) In response to a communication about your products or services 
initiated by the consumer;
    (5) In response to an authorization or request by the consumer to 
receive solicitations; or
    (6) If your compliance with this subpart would prevent you from 
complying with any provision of State insurance laws pertaining to 
unfair discrimination in any State in which you are lawfully doing 
business.
    (d) Examples of exceptions. (1) Example of the pre-existing business 
relationship exception. A consumer has a deposit account with a federal 
credit union. The consumer also has a relationship with the federal 
credit union's securities brokerage affiliate. The federal credit union 
receives eligibility information about the consumer from its securities 
brokerage affiliate and uses that information to make a solicitation to 
the consumer about the federal credit union's wealth management 
services. The federal credit union may make this solicitation even if 
the consumer has not been given a notice and opportunity to opt out 
because the federal credit union has a pre-existing business 
relationship with the consumer.
    (2) Examples of service provider exception. (i) A consumer has an 
insurance policy obtained through an insurance brokerage. The insurance 
brokerage furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to its 
affiliated federal credit union. Based on that eligibility information, 
the federal credit union wants to make a solicitation to the consumer 
about membership and its deposit products. The federal credit union does 
not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none 
of the other exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section apply. The 
consumer has been given an opt-out notice and has elected to opt out of 
receiving such solicitations. The federal credit union asks a service 
provider to send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The 
service provider may not send the solicitation on behalf of the federal 
credit union because, as a result of the consumer's opt-out election, 
the federal credit union is not permitted to make the solicitation.
    (ii) The same facts as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, 
except the consumer has been given an opt-out notice, but has not 
elected to opt out. The federal credit union asks a service provider to 
send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service 
provider may send the solicitation on behalf of the federal credit union 
because, as a result of the consumer's not opting out, the federal 
credit union is permitted to make the solicitation.
    (3) Examples of consumer-initiated communications. (i) A consumer 
who has a deposit account with a federal credit union initiates a 
communication with the federal credit union's credit card affiliate to 
request information about a credit card. The credit card affiliate may 
use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the 
federal credit union or any other affiliate to make solicitations 
regarding credit

[[Page 592]]

card products in response to the consumer-initiated communication.
    (ii) A consumer who has a deposit account with a federal credit 
union contacts the institution to request information about how to save 
and invest for a child's college education without specifying the type 
of product in which the consumer may be interested. Information about a 
range of different products or services offered by the federal credit 
union and one or more affiliates of the institution may be responsive to 
that communication. Such products or services may include the following: 
Mutual funds offered by the institution; section 529 plans offered by 
the institution or its securities brokerage affiliate; or trust services 
offered by the institution or its trust services affiliate. Any 
affiliate offering investment counseling services that would be 
responsive to the consumer's request for information about saving and 
investing for a child's college education may use eligibility 
information to make solicitations to the consumer in response to this 
communication.
    (iii) A credit card issuer makes a marketing call to the consumer 
without using eligibility information received from an affiliate. The 
issuer leaves a voice-mail message that invites the consumer to call a 
toll-free number to apply for the issuer's credit card. If the consumer 
calls the toll-free number to inquire about the credit card, the call is 
a consumer-initiated communication about a product or service and the 
credit card issuer may now use eligibility information it receives from 
its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer.
    (iv) A consumer calls a federal credit union to ask about retail 
locations and hours, but does not request information about products or 
services. The institution may not use eligibility information it 
receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about 
its products or services because the consumer-initiated communication 
does not relate to the federal credit union's products or services. 
Thus, the use of eligibility information received from an affiliate 
would not be responsive to the communication and the exception does not 
apply.
    (v) A consumer calls a federal credit union to ask about retail 
locations and hours. The customer service representative asks the 
consumer if there is a particular product or service about which the 
consumer is seeking information. The consumer responds that the consumer 
wants to stop in and find out about share certificates. The customer 
service representative offers to provide that information by telephone 
and mail additional information and application materials to the 
consumer. The consumer agrees and provides or confirms contact 
information for receipt of the materials to be mailed. The federal 
credit union may use eligibility information it receives from an 
affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about share certificates 
because such solicitations would respond to the consumer-initiated 
communication about products or services.
    (4) Examples of consumer authorization or request for solicitations. 
(i) A consumer who obtains a mortgage from a federal credit union 
authorizes or requests information about obtaining homeowner's insurance 
through the federal credit union's insurance brokerage affiliate. Such 
authorization or request, whether given to the federal credit union or 
to the insurance brokerage affiliate, would permit the insurance 
brokerage to use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains 
from the federal credit union or any other affiliate to make 
solicitations to the consumer about its homeowner's insurance services.
    (ii) A consumer completes an online application to apply for a 
credit card from a credit card issuer. The issuer's online application 
contains a blank check box that the consumer may check to authorize or 
request information from the credit card issuer's affiliates. The 
consumer checks the box. The consumer has authorized or requested 
solicitations from the card issuer's affiliates.
    (iii) A consumer completes an online application to apply for a 
credit card from a credit card issuer. The issuer's online application 
contains a pre-selected check box indicating that the consumer 
authorizes or requests information from the issuer's affiliates. The 
consumer does not deselect the check

[[Page 593]]

box. The consumer has not authorized or requested solicitations from the 
card issuer's affiliates.
    (iv) The terms and conditions of a credit card account agreement 
contain preprinted boilerplate language stating that by applying to open 
an account the consumer authorizes or requests to receive solicitations 
from the credit card issuer's affiliates. The consumer has not 
authorized or requested solicitations from the card issuer's affiliates.
    (e) Relation to affiliate-sharing notice and opt-out. Nothing in 
this subpart limits the responsibility of a person to comply with the 
notice and opt-out provisions of section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act 
where applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 717.22  Scope and duration of opt-out.

    (a) Scope of opt-out. (1) In general. Except as otherwise provided 
in this section, the consumer's election to opt out prohibits any 
affiliate covered by the opt-out notice from using eligibility 
information received from another affiliate as described in the notice 
to make solicitations to the consumer.
    (2) Continuing relationship. (i) In general. If the consumer 
establishes a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate, an 
opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in 
connection with--
    (A) A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing 
relationships that the consumer establishes with you or your affiliates, 
including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of 
the opt-out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the 
continuing relationships covered by the opt-out; or
    (B) Any other transaction between the consumer and you or your 
affiliates as described in the notice.
    (ii) Examples of continuing relationships. A consumer has a 
continuing relationship with you or your affiliate if the consumer--
    (A) Opens a deposit or investment account with you or your 
affiliate;
    (B) Obtains a loan for which you or your affiliate owns the 
servicing rights;
    (C) Purchases an insurance product from you or your affiliate;
    (D) Holds an investment product through you or your affiliate, such 
as when you act or your affiliate acts as a custodian for securities or 
for assets in an individual retirement arrangement;
    (E) Enters into an agreement or understanding with you or your 
affiliate whereby you or your affiliate undertakes to arrange or broker 
a home mortgage loan for the consumer;
    (F) Enters into a lease of personal property with you or your 
affiliate; or
    (G) Obtains financial, investment, or economic advisory services 
from you or your affiliate for a fee.
    (3) No continuing relationship. (i) In general. If there is no 
continuing relationship between a consumer and you or your affiliate, 
and you or your affiliate obtain eligibility information about a 
consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an 
isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out 
notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information 
obtained in connection with that transaction.
    (ii) Examples of isolated transactions. An isolated transaction 
occurs if--
    (A) The consumer uses your or your affiliate's ATM to withdraw cash 
from an account at another financial institution; or
    (B) You or your affiliate sells the consumer a cashier's check or 
money order, airline tickets, travel insurance, or traveler's checks in 
isolated transactions.
    (4) Menu of alternatives. A consumer may be given the opportunity to 
choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit 
solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from 
certain types of affiliates covered by the opt-out notice but not other 
types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit 
solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not 
other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit 
solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of 
delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to 
prohibit all solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered 
by the notice.

[[Page 594]]

    (5) Special rule for a notice following termination of all 
continuing relationships. (i) In general. A consumer must be given a new 
opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with you or your 
affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes 
another continuing relationship with you or your affiliate(s) and the 
consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. 
The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility 
information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. 
Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, the consumer's decision 
not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override 
a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility 
information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, 
regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility 
information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.
    (ii) Example. A consumer is a member of a federal credit union that 
is part of an affiliated group. The consumer terminates his membership. 
One year later, the consumer rejoins and opens a savings account with 
the same federal credit union. The consumer must be given a new notice 
and opportunity to opt out before the federal credit union's affiliates 
may make solicitations to the consumer using eligibility information 
obtained by the federal credit union in connection with the newly 
established account relationship, regardless of whether the consumer 
opted out in connection with accounts held during the previous member 
relationship.
    (b) Duration of opt-out. The election of a consumer to opt out must 
be effective for a period of at least five years (the ``opt-out 
period'') beginning when the consumer's opt-out election is received and 
implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out in 
writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out period of 
more than five years may be established, including an opt-out period 
that does not expire unless revoked by the consumer.
    (c) Time of opt-out. A consumer may opt out at any time.


<R05>
Sec. 717.23  Contents of opt-out notice; consolidated and equivalent notices.

    (a) Contents of opt-out notice. (1) In general. A notice must be 
clear, conspicuous, and concise, and must accurately disclose:
    (i) The name of the affiliate(s) providing the notice. If the notice 
is provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a 
common name, such as ``ABC,'' then the notice may indicate that it is 
being provided by multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple 
companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by 
stating that the notice is provided by ``all of the ABC companies,'' 
``the ABC federal credit union, credit card, insurance brokerage, and 
securities brokerage companies,'' or by listing the name of each 
affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates providing the 
joint notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either 
separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the 
common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the 
notice is provided by ``all of the ABC and XYZ companies'' or by ``the 
ABC federal credit union and credit card companies and the XYZ insurance 
brokerage company''
    (ii) A list of the affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of 
eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include 
companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the 
consumer. If each affiliate covered by the notice shares a common name, 
such as ``ABC,'' then the notice may indicate that it applies to 
multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC 
group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is 
provided by ``all of the ABC companies,'' ``the ABC federal credit 
union, credit card, insurance brokerage, and securities brokerage 
companies,'' or by listing the name of each affiliate providing the 
notice. But if the affiliates covered by the notice do not all share a 
common name, then the notice must either separately identify each 
covered affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by 
those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice applies to

[[Page 595]]

``all of the ABC and XYZ companies'' or to ``the ABC federal credit 
union and credit card companies and the XYZ insurance brokerage 
company''
    (iii) A general description of the types of eligibility information 
that may be used to make solicitations to the consumer;
    (iv) That the consumer may elect to limit the use of eligibility 
information to make solicitations to the consumer;
    (v) That the consumer's election will apply for the specified period 
of time stated in the notice and, if applicable, that the consumer will 
be allowed to renew the election once that period expires;
    (vi) If the notice is provided to consumers who may have previously 
opted out, such as if a notice is provided to consumers annually, that 
the consumer who has chosen to limit solicitations does not need to act 
again until the consumer receives a renewal notice; and
    (vii) A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.
    (2) Joint relationships. (i) If two or more consumers jointly obtain 
a product or service, a single opt-out notice may be provided to the 
joint consumers. Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to 
opt out.
    (ii) The opt-out notice must explain how an opt-out direction by a 
joint consumer will be treated. An opt-out direction by a joint consumer 
may be treated as applying to all of the associated joint consumers, or 
each joint consumer may be permitted to opt-out separately. If each 
joint consumer is permitted to opt out separately, one of the joint 
consumers must be permitted to opt out on behalf of all of the joint 
consumers and the joint consumers must be permitted to exercise their 
separate rights to opt out in a single response.
    (iii) It is impermissible to require all joint consumers to opt out 
before implementing any opt-out direction.
    (3) Alternative contents. If the consumer is afforded a broader 
right to opt out of receiving marketing than is required by this 
subpart, the requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing 
the consumer with a clear, conspicuous, and concise notice that 
accurately discloses the consumer's opt-out rights.
    (4) Model notices. Model notices are provided in Appendix C of this 
part.
    (b) Coordinated and consolidated notices. A notice required by this 
subpart may be coordinated and consolidated with any other notice or 
disclosure required to be issued under any other provision of law by the 
entity providing the notice, including but not limited to the notice 
described in section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act and the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act privacy notice.
    (c) Equivalent notices. A notice or other disclosure that is 
equivalent to the notice required by this subpart, and that is provided 
to a consumer together with disclosures required by any other provision 
of law, satisfies the requirements of this section.

Sec. 717.24  Reasonable opportunity to opt out.

    (a) In general. You must not use eligibility information about a 
consumer that you receive from an affiliate to make a solicitation to 
the consumer about your products or services, unless the consumer is 
provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out, as required by Sec. 
717.21(a)(1)(ii) of this part.
    (b) Examples of a reasonable opportunity to opt out. The consumer is 
given a reasonable opportunity to opt out if:
    (1) By mail. The opt-out notice is mailed to the consumer. The 
consumer is given 30 days from the date the notice is mailed to elect to 
opt out by any reasonable means.
    (2) By electronic means. (i) The opt-out notice is provided 
electronically to the consumer, such as by posting the notice at an 
Internet Web site at which the consumer has obtained a product or 
service. The consumer acknowledges receipt of the electronic notice. The 
consumer is given 30 days after the date the consumer acknowledges 
receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.
    (ii) The opt-out notice is provided to the consumer by e-mail where 
the consumer has agreed to receive disclosures by e-mail from the person 
sending the notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the e-mail is 
sent to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.

[[Page 596]]

    (3) At the time of an electronic transaction. The opt-out notice is 
provided to the consumer at the time of an electronic transaction, such 
as a transaction conducted on an Internet Web site. The consumer is 
required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the 
transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction. There 
is a simple process that the consumer may use to opt out at that time 
using the same mechanism through which the transaction is conducted.
    (4) At the time of an in-person transaction. The opt-out notice is 
provided to the consumer in writing at the time of an in-person 
transaction. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of 
proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing 
the transaction, and is not permitted to complete the transaction 
without making a choice. There is a simple process that the consumer may 
use during the course of the in-person transaction to opt out, such as 
completing a form that requires consumers to write a ``yes'' or ``no'' 
to indicate their opt-out preference or that requires the consumer to 
check one of two blank check boxes--one that allows consumers to 
indicate that they want to opt out and one that allows consumers to 
indicate that they do not want to opt out.
    (5) By including in a privacy notice. The opt-out notice is included 
in a Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy notice. The consumer is allowed to 
exercise the opt-out within a reasonable period of time and in the same 
manner as the opt-out under that privacy notice.


<R05>
Sec. 717.25  Reasonable and simple methods of opting out.

    (a) In general. You must not use eligibility information about a 
consumer that you receive from an affiliate to make a solicitation to 
the consumer about your products or services, unless the consumer is 
provided a reasonable and simple method to opt out, as required by Sec. 
717.21(a)(1)(ii) of this part.
    (b) Examples. (1) Reasonable and simple opt-out methods. Reasonable 
and simple methods for exercising the opt-out right include--
    (i) Designating a check-off box in a prominent position on the opt-
out form;
    (ii) Including a reply form and a self-addressed envelope together 
with the opt-out notice;
    (iii) Providing an electronic means to opt out, such as a form that 
can be electronically mailed or processed at an Internet Web site, if 
the consumer agrees to the electronic delivery of information;
    (iv) Providing a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call 
to opt out; or
    (v) Allowing consumers to exercise all of their opt-out rights 
described in a consolidated opt-out notice that includes the privacy 
opt-out under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. 6801 et seq., the 
affiliate sharing opt-out under the Act, and the affiliate marketing 
opt-out under the Act, by a single method, such as by calling a single 
toll-free telephone number.
    (2) Opt-out methods that are not reasonable and simple. Reasonable 
and simple methods for exercising an opt-out right do not include--
    (i) Requiring the consumer to write his or her own letter;
    (ii) Requiring the consumer to call or write to obtain a form for 
opting out, rather than including the form with the opt-out notice;
    (iii) Requiring the consumer who receives the opt-out notice in 
electronic form only, such as through posting at an Internet Web site, 
to opt out solely by paper mail or by visiting a different Web site 
without providing a link to that site.
    (c) Specific opt-out means. Each consumer may be required to opt out 
through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable and simple 
for that consumer.


<R05>
Sec. 717.26  Delivery of opt-out notices.

    (a) In general. The opt-out notice must be provided so that each 
consumer can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice. For opt-
out notices provided electronically, the notice may be provided in 
compliance with either the electronic disclosure provisions in this 
subpart or the provisions in section 101 of the Electronic

[[Page 597]]

Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.
    (b) Examples of reasonable expectation of actual notice. A consumer 
may reasonably be expected to receive actual notice if the affiliate 
providing the notice:
    (1) Hand-delivers a printed copy of the notice to the consumer;
    (2) Mails a printed copy of the notice to the last known mailing 
address of the consumer;
    (3) Provides a notice by e-mail to a consumer who has agreed to 
receive electronic disclosures by e-mail from the affiliate providing 
the notice; or
    (4) Posts the notice on the Internet Web site at which the consumer 
obtained a product or service electronically and requires the consumer 
to acknowledge receipt of the notice.
    (c) Examples of no reasonable expectation of actual notice. A 
consumer may not reasonably be expected to receive actual notice if the 
affiliate providing the notice:
    (1) Only posts the notice on a sign in a branch or office or 
generally publishes the notice in a newspaper;
    (2) Sends the notice via e-mail to a consumer who has not agreed to 
receive electronic disclosures by e-mail from the affiliate providing 
the notice; or
    (3) Posts the notice on an Internet Web site without requiring the 
consumer to acknowledge receipt of the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 717.27  Renewal of opt-out.

    (a) Renewal notice and opt-out requirement. (1) In general. After 
the opt-out period expires, you may not make solicitations based on 
eligibility information you receive from an affiliate to a consumer who 
previously opted out, unless:
    (i) The consumer has been given a renewal notice that complies with 
the requirements of this section and Sec. Sec. 717.24 through 717.26 of 
this part, and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple 
method to renew the opt-out, and the consumer does not renew the opt-
out; or
    (ii) An exception in Sec. 717.21(c) of this part applies.
    (2) Renewal period. Each opt-out renewal must be effective for a 
period of at least five years as provided in Sec. 717.22(b) of this 
part.
    (3) Affiliates who may provide the notice. The notice required by 
this paragraph must be provided:
    (i) By the affiliate that provided the previous opt-out notice, or 
its successor; or
    (ii) As part of a joint renewal notice from two or more members of 
an affiliated group of companies, or their successors, that jointly 
provided the previous opt-out notice.
    (b) Contents of renewal notice. The renewal notice must be clear, 
conspicuous, and concise, and must accurately disclose:
    (1) The name of the affiliate(s) providing the notice. If the notice 
is provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a 
common name, such as ``ABC,'' then the notice may indicate that it is 
being provided by multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple 
companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by 
stating that the notice is provided by ``all of the ABC companies,'' 
``the ABC federal credit union, credit card, insurance brokerage, and 
securities brokerage companies,'' or by listing the name of each 
affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates providing the 
joint notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either 
separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the 
common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the 
notice is provided by ``all of the ABC and XYZ companies'' or by ``the 
ABC federal credit union and credit card companies and the XYZ insurance 
brokerage company'';
    (2) A list of the affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of 
eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include 
companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the 
consumer. If each affiliate covered by the notice shares a common name, 
such as ``ABC,'' then the notice may indicate that it applies to 
multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC 
group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is 
provided by ``all of the ABC companies,'' ``the ABC

[[Page 598]]

federal credit union, credit card, insurance brokerage, and securities 
brokerage companies,'' or by listing the name of each affiliate 
providing the notice. But if the affiliates covered by the notice do not 
all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify 
each covered affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used 
by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice applies to 
``all of the ABC and XYZ companies'' or to ``the ABC federal credit 
union and credit card companies and the XYZ insurance brokerage 
company'';
    (3) A general description of the types of eligibility information 
that may be used to make solicitations to the consumer;
    (4) That the consumer previously elected to limit the use of certain 
information to make solicitations to the consumer;
    (5) That the consumer's election has expired or is about to expire;
    (6) That the consumer may elect to renew the consumer's previous 
election;
    (7) If applicable, that the consumer's election to renew will apply 
for the specified period of time stated in the notice and that the 
consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires; 
and
    (8) A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.
    (c) Timing of the renewal notice. (1) In general. A renewal notice 
may be provided to the consumer either--
    (i) A reasonable period of time before the expiration of the opt-out 
period; or
    (ii) Any time after the expiration of the opt-out period but before 
solicitations that would have been prohibited by the expired opt-out are 
made to the consumer.
    (2) Combination with annual privacy notice. If you provide an annual 
privacy notice under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. 6801 et seq., 
providing a renewal notice with the last annual privacy notice provided 
to the consumer before expiration of the opt-out period is a reasonable 
period of time before expiration of the opt-out in all cases.
    (d) No effect on opt-out period. An opt-out period may not be 
shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before expiration 
of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt out.


<R05>
Sec. 717.28  Effective date, compliance date, and prospective application.

    (a) Effective date. This subpart is effective January 1, 2008.
    (b) Mandatory compliance date. Compliance with this subpart is 
required not later than October 1, 2008.
    (c) Prospective application. The provisions of this subpart shall 
not prohibit you from using eligibility information that you receive 
from an affiliate to make solicitations to a consumer if you receive 
such information prior to October 1, 2008. For purposes of this section, 
you are deemed to receive eligibility information when such information 
is placed into a common database and is accessible by you.

Sec. 717.30  Obtaining or using medical information in connection with a determination of eligibility for credit.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to:
    (1) A Federal credit union that participates as a creditor in a 
transaction; or
    (2) Any other person that participates as a creditor in a 
transaction involving a person described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) General prohibition on obtaining or using medical information--
(1) In general. A creditor may not obtain or use medical information 
pertaining to a consumer in connection with any determination of the 
consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit, except as 
provided in this section.
    (2) Definitions. (i) Credit has the same meaning as in section 702 
of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. 1691a.
    (ii) Creditor has the same meaning as in section 702 of the Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. 1691a.
    (iii) Eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit means the 
consumer's qualification or fitness to receive, or continue to receive, 
credit, including the terms on which credit is offered. The term does 
not include:

[[Page 599]]

    (A) Any determination of the consumer's qualification or fitness for 
employment, insurance (other than a credit insurance product), or other 
non-credit products or services;
    (B) Authorizing, processing, or documenting a payment or transaction 
on behalf of the consumer in a manner that does not involve a 
determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, 
for credit; or
    (C) Maintaining or servicing the consumer's account in a manner that 
does not involve a determination of the consumer's eligibility, or 
continued eligibility, for credit.
    (c) Rule of construction for obtaining and using unsolicited medical 
information--(1) In general. A creditor does not obtain medical 
information in violation of the prohibition if it receives medical 
information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any 
determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, 
for credit without specifically requesting medical information.
    (2) Use of unsolicited medical information. A creditor that receives 
unsolicited medical information in the manner described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section may use that information in connection with any 
determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, 
for credit to the extent the creditor can rely on at least one of the 
exceptions in Sec. 717.30(d) or (e).
    (3) Examples. A creditor does not obtain medical information in 
violation of the prohibition if, for example:
    (i) In response to a general question regarding a consumer's debts 
or expenses, the creditor receives information that the consumer owes a 
debt to a hospital.
    (ii) In a conversation with the creditor's loan officer, the 
consumer informs the creditor that the consumer has a particular medical 
condition.
    (iii) In connection with a consumer's application for an extension 
of credit, the creditor requests a consumer report from a consumer 
reporting agency and receives medical information in the consumer report 
furnished by the agency even though the creditor did not specifically 
request medical information from the consumer reporting agency.
    (d) Financial information exception for obtaining and using medical 
information--(1) In general. A creditor may obtain and use medical 
information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any 
determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, 
for credit so long as:
    (i) The information is the type of information routinely used in 
making credit eligibility determinations, such as information relating 
to debts, expenses, income, benefits, assets, collateral, or the purpose 
of the loan, including the use of proceeds;
    (ii) The creditor uses the medical information in a manner and to an 
extent that is no less favorable than it would use comparable 
information that is not medical information in a credit transaction; and
    (iii) The creditor does not take the consumer's physical, mental, or 
behavioral health, condition or history, type of treatment, or prognosis 
into account as part of any such determination.
    (2) Examples. (i) Examples of the types of information routinely 
used in making credit eligibility determinations. Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of 
this section permits a creditor, for example, to obtain and use 
information about:
    (A) The dollar amount, repayment terms, repayment history, and 
similar information regarding medical debts to calculate, measure, or 
verify the repayment ability of the consumer, the use of proceeds, or 
the terms for granting credit;
    (B) The value, condition, and lien status of a medical device that 
may serve as collateral to secure a loan;
    (C) The dollar amount and continued eligibility for disability 
income, workers' compensation income, or other benefits related to 
health or a medical condition that is relied on as a source of 
repayment; or
    (D) The identity of creditors to whom outstanding medical debts are 
owed in connection with an application for credit, including but not 
limited to, a transaction involving the consolidation of medical debts.
    (ii) Examples of uses of medical information consistent with the 
exception. (A) A consumer includes on an application for credit 
information about two $20,000 debts. One debt is to a hospital; the

[[Page 600]]

other debt is to a retailer. The creditor contacts the hospital and the 
retailer to verify the amount and payment status of the debts. The 
creditor learns that both debts are more than 90 days past due. Any two 
debts of this size that are more than 90 days past due would disqualify 
the consumer under the creditor's established underwriting criteria. The 
creditor denies the application on the basis that the consumer has a 
poor repayment history on outstanding debts. The creditor has used 
medical information in a manner and to an extent no less favorable than 
it would use comparable non-medical information.
    (B) A consumer indicates on an application for a $200,000 mortgage 
loan that she receives $15,000 in long-term disability income each year 
from her former employer and has no other income. Annual income of 
$15,000, regardless of source, would not be sufficient to support the 
requested amount of credit. The creditor denies the application on the 
basis that the projected debt-to-income ratio of the consumer does not 
meet the creditor's underwriting criteria. The creditor has used medical 
information in a manner and to an extent that is no less favorable than 
it would use comparable non-medical information.
    (C) A consumer includes on an application for a $10,000 home equity 
loan that he has a $50,000 debt to a medical facility that specializes 
in treating a potentially terminal disease. The creditor contacts the 
medical facility to verify the debt and obtain the repayment history and 
current status of the loan. The creditor learns that the debt is 
current. The applicant meets the income and other requirements of the 
creditor's underwriting guidelines. The creditor grants the application. 
The creditor has used medical information in accordance with the 
exception.
    (iii) Examples of uses of medical information inconsistent with the 
exception. (A) A consumer applies for $25,000 of credit and includes on 
the application information about a $50,000 debt to a hospital. The 
creditor contacts the hospital to verify the amount and payment status 
of the debt, and learns that the debt is current and that the consumer 
has no delinquencies in her repayment history. If the existing debt were 
instead owed to a retail department store, the creditor would approve 
the application and extend credit based on the amount and repayment 
history of the outstanding debt. The creditor, however, denies the 
application because the consumer is indebted to a hospital. The creditor 
has used medical information, here the identity of the medical creditor, 
in a manner and to an extent that is less favorable than it would use 
comparable non-medical information.
    (B) A consumer meets with a loan officer of a creditor to apply for 
a mortgage loan. While filling out the loan application, the consumer 
informs the loan officer orally that she has a potentially terminal 
disease. The consumer meets the creditor's established requirements for 
the requested mortgage loan. The loan officer recommends to the credit 
committee that the consumer be denied credit because the consumer has 
that disease. The credit committee follows the loan officer's 
recommendation and denies the application because the consumer has a 
potentially terminal disease. The creditor has used medical information 
in a manner inconsistent with the exception by taking into account the 
consumer's physical, mental, or behavioral health, condition, or 
history, type of treatment, or prognosis as part of a determination of 
eligibility or continued eligibility for credit.
    (C) A consumer who has an apparent medical condition, such as a 
consumer who uses a wheelchair or an oxygen tank, meets with a loan 
officer to apply for a home equity loan. The consumer meets the 
creditor's established requirements for the requested home equity loan 
and the creditor typically does not require consumers to obtain a debt 
cancellation contract, debt suspension agreement, or credit insurance 
product in connection with such loans. However, based on the consumer's 
apparent medical condition, the loan officer recommends to the credit 
committee that credit be extended to the consumer only if the consumer 
obtains a debt cancellation contract, debt suspension agreement, or 
credit insurance product from a nonaffiliated third party. The credit 
committee agrees

[[Page 601]]

with the loan officer's recommendation. The loan officer informs the 
consumer that the consumer must obtain a debt cancellation contract, 
debt suspension agreement, or credit insurance product from a 
nonaffiliated third party to qualify for the loan. The consumer obtains 
one of these products and the creditor approves the loan. The creditor 
has used medical information in a manner inconsistent with the exception 
by taking into account the consumer's physical, mental, or behavioral 
health, condition, or history, type of treatment, or prognosis in 
setting conditions on the consumer's eligibility for credit.
    (e) Specific exceptions for obtaining and using medical 
information--(1) In general. A creditor may obtain and use medical 
information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any 
determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, 
for credit:
    (i) To determine whether the use of a power of attorney or legal 
representative that is triggered by a medical condition or event is 
necessary and appropriate or whether the consumer has the legal capacity 
to contract when a person seeks to exercise a power of attorney or act 
as legal representative for a consumer based on an asserted medical 
condition or event;
    (ii) To comply with applicable requirements of local, state, or 
Federal laws;
    (iii) To determine, at the consumer's request, whether the consumer 
qualifies for a legally permissible special credit program or credit-
related assistance program that is:
    (A) Designed to meet the special needs of consumers with medical 
conditions; and
    (B) Established and administered pursuant to a written plan that:
    (1) Identifies the class of persons that the program is designed to 
benefit; and
    (2) Sets forth the procedures and standards for extending credit or 
providing other credit-related assistance under the program;
    (iv) To the extent necessary for purposes of fraud prevention or 
detection;
    (v) In the case of credit for the purpose of financing medical 
products or services, to determine and verify the medical purpose of a 
loan and the use of proceeds;
    (vi) Consistent with safe and sound practices, if the consumer or 
the consumer's legal representative specifically requests that the 
creditor use medical information in determining the consumer's 
eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit, to accommodate the 
consumer's particular circumstances, and such request is documented by 
the creditor;
    (vii) Consistent with safe and sound practices, to determine whether 
the provisions of a forbearance practice or program that is triggered by 
a medical condition or event apply to a consumer;
    (viii) To determine the consumer's eligibility for, the triggering 
of, or the reactivation of a debt cancellation contract or debt 
suspension agreement if a medical condition or event is a triggering 
event for the provision of benefits under the contract or agreement; or
    (ix) To determine the consumer's eligibility for, the triggering of, 
or the reactivation of a credit insurance product if a medical condition 
or event is a triggering event for the provision of benefits under the 
product.
    (2) Example of determining eligibility for a special credit program 
or credit assistance program. A not-for-profit organization establishes 
a credit assistance program pursuant to a written plan that is designed 
to assist disabled veterans in purchasing homes by subsidizing the down 
payment for the home purchase mortgage loans of qualifying veterans. The 
organization works through mortgage lenders and requires mortgage 
lenders to obtain medical information about the disability of any 
consumer that seeks to qualify for the program, use that information to 
verify the consumer's eligibility for the program, and forward that 
information to the organization. A consumer who is a veteran applies to 
a creditor for a home purchase mortgage loan. The creditor informs the 
consumer about the credit assistance program for disabled veterans and 
the consumer seeks to qualify for the program. Assuming that the program 
complies with all applicable law, including applicable fair lending 
laws, the creditor may obtain and use

[[Page 602]]

medical information about the medical condition and disability, if any, 
of the consumer to determine whether the consumer qualifies for the 
credit assistance program.
    (3) Examples of verifying the medical purpose of the loan or the use 
of proceeds. (i) If a consumer applies for $10,000 of credit for the 
purpose of financing vision correction surgery, the creditor may verify 
with the surgeon that the procedure will be performed. If the surgeon 
reports that surgery will not be performed on the consumer, the creditor 
may use that medical information to deny the consumer's application for 
credit, because the loan would not be used for the stated purpose.
    (ii) If a consumer applies for $10,000 of credit for the purpose of 
financing cosmetic surgery, the creditor may confirm the cost of the 
procedure with the surgeon. If the surgeon reports that the cost of the 
procedure is $5,000, the creditor may use that medical information to 
offer the consumer only $5,000 of credit.
    (iii) A creditor has an established medical loan program for 
financing particular elective surgical procedures. The creditor receives 
a loan application from a consumer requesting $10,000 of credit under 
the established loan program for an elective surgical procedure. The 
consumer indicates on the application that the purpose of the loan is to 
finance an elective surgical procedure not eligible for funding under 
the guidelines of the established loan program. The creditor may deny 
the consumer's application because the purpose of the loan is not for a 
particular procedure funded by the established loan program.
    (4) Examples of obtaining and using medical information at the 
request of the consumer. (i) If a consumer applies for a loan and 
specifically requests that the creditor consider the consumer's medical 
disability at the relevant time as an explanation for adverse payment 
history information in his credit report, the creditor may consider such 
medical information in evaluating the consumer's willingness and ability 
to repay the requested loan to accommodate the consumer's particular 
circumstances, consistent with safe and sound practices. The creditor 
may also decline to consider such medical information to accommodate the 
consumer, but may evaluate the consumer's application in accordance with 
its otherwise applicable underwriting criteria. The creditor may not 
deny the consumer's application or otherwise treat the consumer less 
favorably because the consumer specifically requested a medical 
accommodation, if the creditor would have extended the credit or treated 
the consumer more favorably under the creditor's otherwise applicable 
underwriting criteria.
    (ii) If a consumer applies for a loan by telephone and explains that 
his income has been and will continue to be interrupted on account of a 
medical condition and that he expects to repay the loan by liquidating 
assets, the creditor may, but is not required to, evaluate the 
application using the sale of assets as the primary source of repayment, 
consistent with safe and sound practices, provided that the creditor 
documents the consumer's request by recording the oral conversation or 
making a notation of the request in the consumer's file.
    (iii) If a consumer applies for a loan and the application form 
provides a space where the consumer may provide any other information or 
special circumstances, whether medical or non-medical, that the consumer 
would like the creditor to consider in evaluating the consumer's 
application, the creditor may use medical information provided by the 
consumer in that space on that application to accommodate the consumer's 
application for credit, consistent with safe and sound practices, or may 
disregard that information.
    (iv) If a consumer specifically requests that the creditor use 
medical information in determining the consumer's eligibility, or 
continued eligibility, for credit and provides the creditor with medical 
information for that purpose, and the creditor determines that it needs 
additional information regarding the consumer's circumstances, the 
creditor may request, obtain, and use additional medical information 
about the consumer as necessary to verify the information provided by 
the consumer or to determine whether to make an accommodation for the 
consumer. The consumer may decline to

[[Page 603]]

provide additional information, withdraw the request for an 
accommodation, and have the application considered under the creditor's 
otherwise applicable underwriting criteria.
    (v) If a consumer completes and signs a credit application that is 
not for medical purpose credit and the application contains boilerplate 
language that routinely requests medical information from the consumer 
or that indicates that by applying for credit the consumer authorizes or 
consents to the creditor obtaining and using medical information in 
connection with a determination of the consumer's eligibility, or 
continued eligibility, for credit, the consumer has not specifically 
requested that the creditor obtain and use medical information to 
accommodate the consumer's particular circumstances.
    (5) Example of a forbearance practice or program. After an 
appropriate safety and soundness review, a creditor institutes a program 
that allows consumers who are or will be hospitalized to defer payments 
as needed for up to three months, without penalty, if the credit account 
has been open for more than one year and has not previously been in 
default, and the consumer provides confirming documentation at an 
appropriate time. A consumer is hospitalized and does not pay her bill 
for a particular month. This consumer has had a credit account with the 
creditor for more than one year and has not previously been in default. 
The creditor attempts to contact the consumer and speaks with the 
consumer's adult child, who is not the consumer's legal representative. 
The adult child informs the creditor that the consumer is hospitalized 
and is unable to pay the bill at that time. The creditor defers payments 
for up to three months, without penalty, for the hospitalized consumer 
and sends the consumer a letter confirming this practice and the date on 
which the next payment will be due. The creditor has obtained and used 
medical information to determine whether the provisions of a medically-
triggered forbearance practice or program apply to a consumer.

Sec. Sec. 717.80-717.81  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 717.82  Duties of users regarding address discrepancies.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to a user of consumer reports (user) 
that receives a notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting 
agency, and that is federal credit union.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of this section, a notice of address 
discrepancy means a notice sent to a user by a consumer reporting agency 
pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681c(h)(1), that informs the user of a 
substantial difference between the address for the consumer that the 
user provided to request the consumer report and the address(es) in the 
agency's file for the consumer.
    (c) Reasonable belief--(1) Requirement to form a reasonable belief. 
A user must develop and implement reasonable policies and procedures 
designed to enable the user to form a reasonable belief that a consumer 
report relates to the consumer about whom it has requested the report, 
when the user receives a notice of address discrepancy.
    (2) Examples of reasonable policies and procedures. (i) Comparing 
the information in the consumer report provided by the consumer 
reporting agency with information the user:
    (A) Obtains and uses to verify the consumer's identity in accordance 
with the requirements of the Customer Information Program (CIP) rules 
implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(l) (31 CFR 103.121);
    (B) Maintains in its own records, such as applications, change of 
address notifications, other member account records, or retained CIP 
documentation; or
    (C) Obtains from third-party sources; or
    (ii) Verifying the information in the consumer report provided by 
the consumer reporting agency with the consumer.
    (d) Consumer's address--(1) Requirement to furnish consumer's 
address to a consumer reporting agency. A user must develop and 
implement reasonable policies and procedures for furnishing an address 
for the consumer that the user has reasonably confirmed is accurate to 
the consumer reporting agency from whom it received the notice of 
address discrepancy when the user:
    (i) Can form a reasonable belief that the consumer report relates to 
the consumer about whom the user requested the report;
    (ii) Establishes a continuing relationship with the consumer; and
    (iii) Regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes 
information to the consumer reporting agency from which the notice of 
address discrepancy relating to the consumer was obtained.
    (2) Examples of confirmation methods. The user may reasonably 
confirm an address is accurate by:
    (i) Verifying the address with the consumer about whom it has 
requested the report;
    (ii) Reviewing its own records to verify the address of the 
consumer;
    (iii) Verifying the address through third-party sources; or
    (iv) Using other reasonable means.
    (3) Timing. The policies and procedures developed in accordance with 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section must provide that the user will furnish 
the consumer's address that the user has reasonably confirmed is 
accurate to the consumer reporting agency as part of the information it 
regularly furnishes for the reporting period in which it establishes a 
relationship with the consumer.

<R05>
Sec. 717.83  Disposal of consumer information.

    (a) In general. You must properly dispose of any consumer 
information that you maintain or otherwise possess in a

[[Page 605]]

manner consistent with the Guidelines for Safeguarding Member 
Information, in appendix A to part 748 of this chapter.
    (b) Examples. Appropriate measures to properly dispose of consumer 
information include the following examples. These examples are 
illustrative only and are not exclusive or exhaustive methods for 
complying with this section.
    (1) Burning, pulverizing, or shredding papers containing consumer 
information so that the information cannot practicably be read or 
reconstructed.
    (2) Destroying or erasing electronic media containing consumer 
information so that the information cannot practicably be read or 
reconstructed.
    (c) Rule of construction. This section does not:
    (1) Require you to maintain or destroy any record pertaining to a 
consumer that is not imposed under any other law; or
    (2) Alter or affect any requirement imposed under any other 
provision of law to maintain or destroy such a record.
    (d) Definitions. As used in this section:
    (1) Consumer information means any record about an individual, 
whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is a consumer report 
or is derived from a consumer report and that is maintained or otherwise 
possessed by or on behalf of the credit union for a business purpose. 
Consumer information also means a compilation of such records. The term 
does not include any record that does not identify an individual.
    (i) Consumer information includes:
    (A) A consumer report that you obtain;
    (B) Information from a consumer report that you obtain from your 
affiliate after the consumer has been given a notice and has elected not 
to opt out of that sharing;
    (C) Information from a consumer report that you obtain about an 
individual who applies for but does not receive a loan, including any 
loan sought by an individual for a business purpose;
    (D) Information from a consumer report that you obtain about an 
individual who guarantees a loan (including a loan to a business 
entity); or
    (E) Information from a consumer report that you obtain about an 
employee or prospective employee.
    (ii) Consumer information does not include:
    (A) Aggregate information, such as the mean credit score, derived 
from a group of consumer reports; or
    (B) Blind data, such as payment history on accounts that are not 
personally identifiable, you use for developing credit scoring models or 
for other purposes.
    (2) Consumer report has the same meaning as set forth in the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681a(d). The meaning of consumer report 
is broad and subject to various definitions, conditions and exceptions 
in the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It includes written or oral 
communications from a consumer reporting agency to a third party of 
information used or collected for use in establishing eligibility for 
credit or insurance used primarily for personal, family or household 
purposes, and eligibility for employment purposes. Examples include 
credit reports, bad check lists, and tenant screening reports.

                   Subpart J_Identity Theft Red Flags

    Source: 72 FR 63768, Nov. 9, 2007, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 717.90  Duties regarding the detection, prevention, and mitigation of identity theft.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to a financial institution or 
creditor that is a federal credit union.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section and Appendix J, the 
following definitions apply:
    (1) Account means a continuing relationship established by a person 
with a federal credit union to obtain a product or service for personal, 
family, household or business purposes. Account includes:
    (i) An extension of credit, such as the purchase of property or 
services involving a deferred payment; and
    (ii) A share or deposit account.
    (2) The term board of directors refers to a federal credit union's 
board of directors.
    (3) Covered account means:

[[Page 606]]

    (i) An account that a federal credit union offers or maintains, 
primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that involves or 
is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions, such as a 
credit card account, mortgage loan, automobile loan, checking account, 
or share account; and
    (ii) Any other account that the federal credit union offers or 
maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to members or 
to the safety and soundness of the federal credit union from identity 
theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or 
litigation risks.
    (4) Credit has the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(r)(5).
    (5) Creditor has the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(r)(5).

    (10) Service provider means a person that provides a service 
directly to the federal credit union.
    (c) Periodic Identification of Covered Accounts. Each federal credit 
union must periodically determine whether it offers or maintains covered 
accounts. As a part of this determination, a federal credit union must 
conduct a risk assessment to determine whether it offers or maintains 
covered accounts described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, 
taking into consideration:
    (1) The methods it provides to open its accounts;
    (2) The methods it provides to access its accounts; and
    (3) Its previous experiences with identity theft.
    (d) Establishment of an Identity Theft Prevention Program. (1) 
Program requirement. Each federal credit union that offers or maintains 
one or more covered accounts must develop and implement a written 
Identity Theft Prevention Program (Program) that is designed to detect, 
prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a 
covered account or any existing covered account. The Program must be 
appropriate to the size and complexity of the federal credit union and 
the nature and scope of its activities.
    (2) Elements of the Program. The Program must include reasonable 
policies and procedures to:
    (i) Identify relevant Red Flags for the covered accounts that the 
federal credit union offers or maintains, and incorporate those Red 
Flags into its Program;
    (ii) Detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Program 
of the federal credit union;
    (iii) Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section to prevent and mitigate

    (iv) Ensure the Program (including the Red Flags determined to be 
relevant) is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to 
members and to the safety and soundness of the federal credit union from 
identity theft.
    (e) Administration of the Program. Each federal credit union that is 
required to implement a Program must provide for the continued 
administration of the Program and must:

board of directors or an appropriate committee of the board of 
directors;
    (2) Involve the board of directors, an appropriate committee 
thereof, or a designated employee at the level of senior management in 
the oversight, development, implementation and administration of the 
Program;
    (3) Train staff, as necessary, to effectively implement the Program; 
and
    (4) Exercise appropriate and effective oversight of service provider 
arrangements.
    (f) Guidelines. Each federal credit union that is required to 
implement a Program must consider the guidelines in Appendix J of this 
part and include in its Program those guidelines that are appropriate.


<R05>
Pt. 717, App. C  Duties of card issuers regarding changes of address.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to an issuer of a debit or credit 
card (card issuer) that is a federal credit union.

[[Page 607]]

    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Cardholder means a member who has been issued a credit or debit 
card.
    (2) Clear and conspicuous means reasonably understandable and 
designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the 
information presented.
    (c) Address validation requirements. A card issuer must establish 
and implement reasonable policies and procedures to assess the validity 
of a change of address if it receives notification of a change of 
address for a member's debit or credit card account and, within a short 
period of time afterwards (during at least the first 30 days after it 
receives such notification), the card issuer receives a request for an 
additional or replacement card for the same account. Under these 
circumstances, the card issuer may not issue an additional or 
replacement card, until, in accordance with its reasonable policies and 
procedures and for the purpose of assessing the validity of the change 
of address, the card issuer:
    (1)(i) Notifies the cardholder of the request:
    (A) At the cardholder's former address; or
    (B) By any other means of communication that the card issuer and the 
cardholder have previously agreed to use; and
    (ii) Provides to the cardholder a reasonable means of promptly 
reporting incorrect address changes; or
    (2) Otherwise assesses the validity of the change of address in 
accordance with the policies and procedures the card issuer has 
established pursuant to Sec. 717.90 of this part.
    (d) Alternative timing of address validation. A card issuer may 
satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if it 
validates an address pursuant to the methods in paragraph (c)(1) or 
(c)(2) of this section when it receives an address change notification, 
before it receives a request for an additional or replacement card.
    (e) Form of notice. Any written or electronic notice that the card 
issuer provides under this paragraph must be clear and conspicuous and 
provided separately from its regular correspondence with the cardholder.

               Sec. Appendices A-B to Part 717 [Reserved]




<R05>
      Sec. Appendix C To Part 717--Model Forms for Opt-Out Notices

    a. Although use of the model forms is not required, use of the model 
forms in this Appendix (as applicable) complies with the requirement in 
section 624 of the Act for clear, conspicuous, and concise notices.
    b. Certain changes may be made to the language or format of the 
model forms without losing the protection from liability afforded by use 
of the model forms. These changes may not be so extensive as to affect 
the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the 
model forms. Persons making such extensive revisions will lose the safe 
harbor that this Appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for 
example:
    1. Rearranging the order of the references to ``your income,'' 
``your account history,'' and ``your credit score.''
    2. Substituting other types of information for ``income,'' ``account 
history,'' or ``credit score'' for accuracy, such as ``payment 
history,'' ``credit history,'' ``payoff status,'' or ``claims history.''
    3. Substituting a clearer and more accurate description of the 
affiliates providing or covered by the notice for phrases such as ``the 
[ABC] group of companies,'' including without limitation a statement 
that the entity providing the notice recently purchased the consumer's 
account.
    4. Substituting other types of affiliates covered by the notice for 
``credit card,'' ``insurance brokerage,'' or ``securities brokerage'' 
affiliates.
    5. Omitting items that are not accurate or applicable. For example, 
if a person does not limit the duration of the opt-out period, the 
notice may omit information about the renewal notice.
    6. Adding a statement informing consumers how much time they have to 
opt out before shared eligibility information may be used to make 
solicitations to them.
    7. Adding a statement that the consumer may exercise the right to 
opt out at any time.
    8. Adding the following statement, if accurate: ``If you previously 
opted out, you do not need to do so again.''
    9. Providing a place on the form for the consumer to fill in 
identifying information, such as his or her name and address:

               Sec. Appendices D-I to Part 717 [RESERVED]


<R05>
 Sec. Appendix J to Part 717--Interagency Guidelines on Identity Theft 
                  Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation

    Section 717.90 of this part requires each federal credit union that 
offers or maintains one or more covered accounts, as defined in Sec. 
717.90(b)(3) of this part, to develop and provide for the continued 
administration of a written Program to detect, prevent, and mitigate 
identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or 
any existing covered account. These guidelines are intended to assist 
federal credit unions in the formulation and maintenance of a Program 
that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 717.90 of this part.

                             I. The Program

    In designing its Program, a federal credit union may incorporate, as 
appropriate, its existing policies, procedures, and other arrangements 
that control reasonably foreseeable risks to members or to the safety 
and soundness of the federal credit union from identity theft.

                   II. Identifying Relevant Red Flags

    (a) Risk Factors. A federal credit union should consider the 
following factors in identifying relevant Red Flags for covered 
accounts, as appropriate:
    (1) The types of covered accounts it offers or maintains;
    (2) The methods it provides to open its covered accounts;
    (3) The methods it provides to access its covered accounts; and
    (4) Its previous experiences with identity theft.
    (b) Sources of Red Flags. Federal credit unions should incorporate 
relevant Red Flags from sources such as:
    (1) Incidents of identity theft that the federal credit union has 
experienced;
    (2) Methods of identity theft that the federal credit union has 
identified that reflect changes in identity theft risks; and
    (3) Applicable supervisory guidance.
    (c) Categories of Red Flags. The Program should include relevant Red 
Flags from the following categories, as appropriate. Examples of Red 
Flags from each of these categories are appended as Supplement A to this 
Appendix J.
    (1) Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer 
reporting agencies or service providers, such as fraud detection 
services;
    (2) The presentation of suspicious documents;

[[Page 610]]

    (3) The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, 
such as a suspicious address change;
    (4) The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a 
covered account; and
    (5) Notice from members, victims of identity theft, law enforcement 
authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in 
connection with covered accounts held by the federal credit union.

                        III. Detecting Red Flags

    The Program's policies and procedures should address the detection 
of Red Flags in connection with the opening of covered accounts and 
existing covered accounts, such as by:
    (a) Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the 
identity of, a person opening a covered account, for example, using the 
policies and procedures regarding identification and verification set 
forth in the Customer Identification Program rules implementing 31 
U.S.C. 5318(l) (31 CFR 103.121); and
    (b) Authenticating members, monitoring transactions, and verifying 
the validity of change of address requests, in the case of existing 
covered accounts.

              IV. Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft

    The Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate 
responses to the Red Flags the federal credit union has detected that 
are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In determining an 
appropriate response, a federal credit union should consider aggravating 
factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data 
security incident that results in unauthorized access to a member's 
account records held by the federal credit union or a third party, or 
notice that a member has provided information related to a covered 
account held by the federal credit union to someone fraudulently 
claiming to represent the federal credit union or to a fraudulent 
website. Appropriate responses may include the following:
    (a) Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;
    (b) Contacting the member;
    (c) Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security 
devices that permit access to a covered account;
    (d) Reopening a covered account with a new account number;
    (e) Not opening a new covered account;
    (f) Closing an existing covered account;
    (g) Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a 
covered account to a debt collector;
    (h) Notifying law enforcement; or
    (i) Determining that no response is warranted under the particular 
circumstances.

                         V. Updating the Program

    Federal credit unions should update the Program (including the Red 
Flags determined to be relevant) periodically, to reflect changes in 
risks to members or to the safety and soundness of the federal credit 
union from identity theft, based on factors such as:
    (a) The experiences of the federal credit union with identity theft;
    (b) Changes in methods of identity theft;
    (c) Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity 
theft;
    (d) Changes in the types of accounts that the federal credit union 
offers or maintains; and
    (e) Changes in the business arrangements of the federal credit 
union, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and 
service provider arrangements.

                VI. Methods for Administering the Program

    (a) Oversight of Program. Oversight by the board of directors, an 
appropriate committee of the board, or a designated employee at the 
level of senior management should include:
    (1) Assigning specific responsibility for the Program's 
implementation;
    (2) Reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance by the 
federal credit union with Sec. 717.90 of this part; and
    (3) Approving material changes to the Program as necessary to 
address changing identity theft risks.
    (b) Reports. (1) In general. Staff of the federal credit union 
responsible for development, implementation, and administration of its 
Program should report to the board of directors, an appropriate 
committee of the board, or a designated employee at the level of senior 
management, at least annually, on compliance by the federal credit union 
with Sec. 717.90 of this part.
    (2) Contents of report. The report should address material matters 
related to the Program and evaluate issues such as: the effectiveness of 
the policies and procedures of the federal credit union in addressing 
the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered 
accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider 
arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and 
management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the 
Program.
    (c) Oversight of service provider arrangements. Whenever a federal 
credit union engages a service provider to perform an activity in 
connection with one or more covered accounts the federal credit union 
should take steps to ensure that the activity of the service provider is 
conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed 
to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. For 
example, a federal

[[Page 611]]

credit union could require the service provider by contract to have 
policies and procedures to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in 
the performance of the service provider's activities, and either report 
the Red Flags to the federal credit union, or to take appropriate steps 
to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

                VII. Other Applicable Legal Requirements

    Federal credit unions should be mindful of other related legal 
requirements that may be applicable, such as:
    (a) Filing a Suspicious Activity Report under 31 U.S.C. 5318(g) and 
12 CFR 748.1(c);
    (b) Implementing any requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-1(h) 
regarding the circumstances under which credit may be extended when the 
federal credit union detects a fraud or active duty alert;
    (c) Implementing any requirements for furnishers of information to 
consumer reporting agencies under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, for example, to 
correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information, and to not 
report information that the furnisher has reasonable cause to believe is 
inaccurate; and
    (d) Complying with the prohibitions in 15 U.S.C. 1681m on the sale, 
transfer, and placement for collection of certain debts resulting from 
identity theft.

                       Supplement A to Appendix J

    In addition to incorporating Red Flags from the sources recommended 
in section II.b. of the Guidelines in Appendix J of this part, each 
federal credit union may consider incorporating into its Program, 
whether singly or in combination, Red Flags from the following 
illustrative examples in connection with covered accounts:

   Alerts, Notifications or Warnings From a Consumer Reporting Agency

    1. A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.
    2. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in 
response to a request for a consumer report.
    3. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address 
discrepancy, as defined in Sec. 717.82(b) of this part.
    4. A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is 
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an 
applicant or member, such as:
    a. A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
    b. An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
    c. A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect 
to recently established credit relationships; or
    d. An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of 
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.

                          Suspicious Documents

    5. Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered 
or forged.
    6. The photograph or physical description on the identification is 
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or member presenting 
the identification.
    7. Other information on the identification is not consistent with 
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or 
member presenting the identification.
    8. Other information on the identification is not consistent with 
readily accessible information that is on file with the federal credit 
union, such as a signature card or a recent check.
    9. An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives 
the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.

               Suspicious Personal Identifying Information

    10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when 
compared against external information sources used by the federal credit 
union. For example:
    a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or
    b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is 
listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.
    11. Personal identifying information provided by the member is not 
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the 
member. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN 
range and date of birth.
    12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with 
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party 
sources used by the federal credit union. For example:
    a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided 
on a fraudulent application; or
    b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number 
provided on a fraudulent application.
    13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly 
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-
party sources used by the federal credit union. For example:
    a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or 
prison; or
    b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or 
answering service.
    14. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons 
opening an account or other members.
    15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or 
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an 
unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or other 
members.

[[Page 612]]

    16. The person opening the covered account or the member fails to 
provide all required personal identifying information on an application 
or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.
    17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with 
personal identifying information that is on file with the federal credit 
union.
    18. For federal credit unions that use challenge questions, the 
person opening the covered account or the member cannot provide 
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be 
available from a wallet or consumer report.

 Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account

    19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a 
covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a 
new, additional, or replacement card or a cell phone, or for the 
addition of authorized users on the account.
    20. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly 
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example:
    a. The majority of available credit is used for cash advances or 
merchandise that is easily convertible to cash (e.g., electronics 
equipment or jewelry); or
    b. The member fails to make the first payment or makes an initial 
payment but no subsequent payments.
    21. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent 
with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for 
example:
    a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
    b. A material increase in the use of available credit;
    c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns;
    d. A material change in electronic fund transfer patterns in 
connection with a deposit account; or
    e. A material change in telephone call patterns in connection with a 
cellular phone account.
    22. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably 
lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of 
account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
    23. Mail sent to the member is returned repeatedly as undeliverable 
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the 
member's covered account.
    24. The federal credit union is notified that the member is not 
receiving paper account statements.
    25. The federal credit union is notified of unauthorized charges or 
transactions in connection with a member's covered account.

    Notice From Members, Victims of Identity Theft, Law Enforcement 
   Authorities, or Other Persons Regarding Possible Identity Theft in 
    Connection With Covered Accounts Held by the Federal Credit Union

    26. The federal credit union is notified by a member, a victim of 
identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it 
has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.

<R05>
Sec. 721.1  What does this part cover?

    This part authorizes a federal credit union (you) to engage in 
activities incidental to your business as set out in this part. This 
part also describes how interested parties may request a legal opinion 
on whether an activity is within a federal credit union's incidental 
powers or apply to add new activities or categories to the regulation. 
An activity approved in a legal opinion to an interested party or as a 
result of an application by an interested party to add new activities or 
categories is recognized as an incidental powers activity for all 
federal credit unions. This part does not apply to the activities of 
corporate credit unions.

[66 FR 40857, Aug. 6, 2001, as amended at 69 FR 45238, July 29, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 721.4  How may a credit union apply to engage in an activity that is not preapproved as within a credit union's incidental powers?

    (a) Application contents. To engage in an activity that may be 
within an FCU's incidental powers but that does not fall within a 
preapproved category listed in Sec. 721.3, you may submit an 
application by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the NCUA 
Board. Your application must describe the activity, your explanation, 
consistent with the test provided in paragraph (c) of this section, of 
why this activity is within your incidental powers, your plan for 
implementing the proposed activity, any state licenses you must obtain 
to conduct the activity, and any other information necessary to describe 
the proposed activity adequately. Before you engage in the petition 
process you should seek an advisory opinion from NCUA's Office of 
General Counsel, as to whether a proposed activity fits into one of the 
authorized categories or is otherwise within your incidental powers 
without filing a petition to amend the regulation.
    (b) Processing of application. Your application must be filed with 
the Secretary of the NCUA Board. NCUA will review your application for 
completeness and will notify you whether additional information is 
required or whether the activity requested is permissible under one of 
the categories listed in Sec. 721.3. If the activity falls within a 
category provided in Sec. 721.3, NCUA will notify you that the activity 
is permissible and treat the application as withdrawn. If the activity 
does not fall within a category provided in Sec. 721.3, NCUA staff will 
consider whether the proposed activity is legally permissible. Upon a 
recommendation by NCUA staff that the activity is within a credit 
union's incidental powers, the NCUA Board may amend Sec. 721.3 and will 
request public comment on the establishment of a new category of 
activities within Sec. 721.3. If the activity proposed in your 
application fails to meet

[[Page 615]]

the criteria established in paragraph (c) of this section, NCUA will 
notify you within a reasonable period of time.
    (c) Decision on application. In determining whether an activity is 
authorized as an appropriate exercise of a federal credit union's 
incidental powers, the Board will consider:
    (1) Whether the activity is convenient or useful in carrying out the 
mission or business of credit unions consistent with the Act;
    (2) Whether the activity is the functional equivalent or logical 
outgrowth of activities that are part of the mission or business of 
credit unions; and
    (3) Whether the activity involves risks similar in nature to those 
already assumed as part of the business of credit unions.


<R05>
Sec. 721.5  What limitations apply to a credit union engaging in activities approved under this part?

    You must comply with any applicable NCUA regulations, policies, and 
legal opinions, as well as applicable state and federal law, if an 
activity authorized under this part is otherwise regulated or 
conditioned.


<R05>
Sec. 721.6  May a credit union derive income from activities approved under this part?

    You may earn income for those activities determined to be incidental 
to your business.


<R05>
Sec. 721.7  What are the potential conflicts of interest for officials and employees when credit unions engage in activities approved under this part?

    (a) Conflicts. No official, employee, or their immediate family 
member may receive any compensation or benefit, directly or indirectly, 
in connection with your engagement in an activity authorized under this 
part, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
This section does not apply if a conflicts of interest provision within 
another section of this chapter applies to a particular activity; in 
such case, the more specific conflicts of interest provision controls. 
For example: An official or employee that refers loan-related products 
offered by a third-party to a member, in connection with a loan made by 
you, is subject to the conflicts of interest provision in Sec. 
701.21(c)(8) of this chapter.
    (b) Permissible payments. This section does not prohibit:
    (1) Payment, by you, of salary to your employees;
    (2) Payment, by you, of an incentive or bonus to an employee based 
on your overall financial performance;
    (3) Payment, by you, of an incentive or bonus to an employee, other 
than a senior management employee or paid official, in connection with 
an activity authorized by this part, provided that your board of 
directors establishes written policies and internal controls for the 
incentive program and monitors compliance with such policies and 
controls at least annually; and
    (4) Payment, by a person other than you, of any compensation or 
benefit to an employee, other than a senior management employee or paid 
official, in connection with an activity authorized by this part, 
provided that your board of directors establishes written policies and 
internal controls regarding third-party compensation and determines that 
the employee's involvement does not present a conflict of interest.
    (c) Business associates and family members. All transactions with 
business associates or family members not specifically prohibited by 
paragraph (a) of this section must be conducted at arm's length and in 
the interest of the credit union.
    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this part, the following 
definitions apply.
    (1) Senior management employee means your chief executive officer 
(typically, this individual holds the title of President or Treasurer/
Manager), any assistant chief executive officers (e.g. Assistant 
President, Vice President, or Assistant Treasurer/Manager), and the 
chief financial officer (Comptroller).
    (2) Official means any member of your board of directors, credit 
committee or supervisory committee.
    (3) Immediate family member means a spouse or other family member 
living in the same household.

Sec. 722.3  Appraisals required; transactions requiring a State certified or licensed appraiser.

    (a) Appraisals required. An appraisal performed by a State certified 
or licensed appraiser is required for all real estate-related financial 
transactions except those in which:
    (1) The transaction value is $250,000 or less;
    (2) A lien on real property has been taken as collateral through an 
abundance of caution and where the terms of the transaction as a 
consequence have not been made more favorable than they would have been 
in the absence of a lien;
    (3) A lien on real estate has been taken for purposes other than the 
real estate's value;
    (4) A lease of real estate is entered into, unless the lease is the 
economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased real estate;
    (5) The transaction involves an existing extension of credit at the 
credit union, provided that:
    (i) There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds 
necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; and
    (ii) There has been no obvious and material change in market 
conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens the 
adequacy of the credit union's real estate collateral protection after 
the transaction;

[[Page 618]]

    (6) The transaction involves the purchase, sale, investment in, 
exchange of, or extension of credit secured by, a loan or interest in a 
loan, pooled loans, or interests in real property, including mortgage-
backed securities, and each loan or interest in a loan, pooled loan, or 
real property interest met the requirements of this regulation, if 
applicable, at the time of origination;
    (7) The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by 
a United States government agency or United States government sponsored 
agency;
    (8) The transaction either:
    (i) Qualifies for sale to a United States government agency or 
United States government sponsored agency; or
    (ii) Involves a residential real estate transaction in which the 
appraisal conforms to the Federal National Mortgage Association or 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation appraisal standards applicable to 
that category of real estate; or
    (9) The regional director has granted a waiver from the appraisal 
requirement for a category of loans meeting the definition of a member 
business loan.
    (b) Transactions requiring a State-certified appraiser. (1) (All 
transactions of $1,000,000 or more) All federally related transactions 
having a transaction value of $1,000,000 or more shall require an 
appraisal prepared by a state-certified appraiser.
    (2) (Nonresidential transactions) All federally related transactions 
having a transaction value of more than $250,000, other than those 
involving appraisals of 1- to 4-family residential properties, shall 
require an appraisal prepared by a state-certified appraiser.
    (3) (Complex residential transactions of $250,000 or more) All 
complex 1- to 4-family residential property appraisals rendered in 
connection with federally related transactions shall require a state-
certified appraiser if the transaction value is $250,000 or more. A 
regulated institution may presume that appraisals of 1- to 4-family 
residential properties are not complex unless the institution has 
readily available information that a given appraisal will be complex. 
The regulated institution shall be responsible for making the final 
determination of whether the appraisal is complex. If, during the course 
of the appraisal, a licensed appraiser identifies factors that would 
result in the property, form of ownership, or market conditions being 
considered atypical, then either:
    (i) The regulated institution may ask the licensed appraiser to 
complete the appraisal and have a certified appraiser approve and cosign 
the appraisal; or
    (ii) The institution may engage a certified appraiser to complete 
the appraisal.
    (c) Transactions requiring either a State-certified or -licensed 
appraiser. All appraisals for federally related transactions not 
requiring the services of a state-certified appraiser shall be prepared 
by either a state-certified appraiser or a state-licensed appraiser.
    (d) Valuation requirement. Secured transactions exempted from 
appraisal requirements pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(5) of this 
section and not otherwise exempted from this regulation or fully insured 
shall be supported by a written estimate of market value, as defined in 
this regulation, performed by an individual having no direct or indirect 
interest in the property, and qualified and experienced to perform such 
estimates of value for the type and amount of credit being considered.
    (e) Appraisals to address safety and soundness concerns. NCUA 
reserves the right to require an appraisal under this subpart whenever 
the agency believes it is necessary to address safety and soundness 
concerns.

<R05>

    (c) Analyze and report appropriate deductions and discounts for 
proposed construction or renovation, partially leased buildings, non-

[60 FR 51894, Oct. 4, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 722.5  Appraiser independence.

    (a) Staff appraiser. If an appraisal is prepared by a staff 
appraiser, that appraiser must be independent of the lending, 
investment, and collection functions and not involved, except as an 
appraiser, in the federally related transaction, and have no direct or 
indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property. If the only 
qualified persons available to perform an appraisal are involved in the 
lending, investment, or collection functions of the credit union, the 
credit union shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the appraisers 
exercise independent judgment. Such steps include, but are not limited 
to, prohibiting an individual from performing an appraisal in connection 
with federally related transactions in which the appraiser is otherwise 
involved.
    (b) Fee Appraisers. (1) If an appraisal is prepared by a fee 
appraiser, the appraiser shall be engaged directly by the credit union 
or its agent and have no direct or indirect interest, financial or 
otherwise, in the property or the transaction.
    (2) A credit union also may accept an appraisal that was prepared by 
an appraiser engaged directly by another financial services institution; 
if:
    (i) The appraiser has no direct or indirect interest, financial or 
otherwise, in the property or transaction; and
    (ii) The credit union determines that the appraisal conforms to the 
requirement of this regulation and is otherwise acceptable.

[55 FR 30207, July 25, 1990, as amended at 60 FR 51895, Oct. 4, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 722.6  Professional association membership; competency.

    (a) Membership in appraisal organization. A state-certified 
appraiser or a state-licensed appraiser may not be excluded from 
consideration for an assignment for a federally related transaction 
solely by virtue of membership or lack of membership in any particular 
appraisal organization.
    (b) Competency. All staff and fee appraisers performing appraisals 
in connection with federally related transactions must be state-
certified or -licensed as appropriate. However, a state-certified or -
licensed appraiser may not be considered competent solely by virtue of 
being certified or licensed. Any determination of competency shall be 
based upon the individual's experience and educational background as 
they relate to the particular appraisal assignment for which he or she 
is being considered.


<R05>
Sec. 722.7  Enforcement.

    Credit unions and institution-affiliated parties, including staff 
appraisers and fee appraisers, may be subject to removal and/or 
prohibition orders, cease-and-desist orders, and the imposition of civil 
money penalties pursuant to section 1786 of the Federal Credit Union 
Act, or any other applicable law.

<R05>
Sec. 723.1  What is a member business loan?

    (a) General rule. A member business loan includes any loan, line of 
credit, or letter of credit (including any unfunded commitments) where 
the borrower uses the proceeds for the following purposes:
    (1) Commercial;
    (2) Corporate;
    (3) Other business investment property or venture; or
    (4) Agricultural.
    (b) Exceptions to the general rule. The following are not member 
business loans:
    (1) A loan fully secured by a lien on a 1 to 4 family dwelling that 
is the member's primary residence;
    (2) A loan fully secured by shares in the credit union making the 
extension of credit or deposits in other financial institutions;
    (3) Loan(s) to a member or an associated member which, when the net 
member business loan balances are added together, are equal to less than 
$50,000;
    (4) A loan where a federal or state agency (or its political 
subdivision) fully insures repayment, or fully guarantees repayment, or 
provides an advance commitment to purchase in full; or
    (5) A loan granted by a corporate credit union to another credit 
union.
    (c) Loans to credit unions and credit union service organizations. 
This part does not apply to loans made by federal credit unions to 
credit unions and credit union service organizations. This part does not 
apply to loans made by a federally insured, state-chartered credit union 
to credit unions and credit union service organizations if the credit 
union's supervisory authority determines that state law grants authority 
to lend to these entities other than the general authority to grant 
loans to members.
    (d) Purchase of member loans and member loan participations. Any 
interest a credit union obtains in a loan that was made by another 
lender to the credit union's member is a member business loan, for 
purposes of this rule and the risk weighting standards of part 702 of 
this chapter to the same extent as if made directly by the credit union 
to its member.
    (e) Purchases of nonmember loans and nonmember loan participations. 
Any interest a credit union obtains in a nonmember loan, pursuant to 
Sec. 701.22 or part 742 of this chapter or other authority, is treated 
the same as a member business loan for purposes of this rule and the 
risk weighting standards under part 702 of this chapter, except that the 
effect of such interest on a credit union's aggregate member business 
loan limit will be as set forth in Sec. 723.16(b) of this part.

[64 FR 28729, May 27, 1999, as amended at 64 FR 57365, Oct. 25, 1999; 68 
FR 56551, Oct. 1, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 723.2  What are the prohibited activities?

    (a) Who is ineligible to receive a member business loan? You may not 
grant a member business loan to the following:
    (1) Your chief executive officer (typically this individual holds 
the title of President or Treasurer/Manager);
    (2) Any assistant chief executive officers (e.g., Assistant 
President, Vice President, or Assistant Treasurer/Manager);
    (3) Your chief financial officer (Comptroller); or
    (4) Any associated member or immediate family member of anyone 
listed in paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section.
    (b) Equity agreements/joint ventures. You may not grant a member 
business loan if any additional income received by the credit union or 
senior management employees is tied to the profit or

[[Page 621]]

sale of the business or commercial endeavor for which the loan is made.
    (c) Loans to compensated directors. A credit union may not grant a 
member business loan to a compensated director unless the board of 
directors approves granting the loan and the compensated director is 
recused from the decision making process.


<R05>
Sec. 723.3  What are the requirements for construction and development lending?

    Except as provided in Sec. 723.4 or unless your Regional Director 
grants a waiver, loans granted for the construction or development of 
commercial or residential property are subject to the following 
additional requirements.
    (a) The aggregate of the net member business loan balances for all 
construction and development loans must not exceed 15% of net worth. In 
determining the aggregate balances for purposes of this limitation, a 
credit union may exclude any loan made to finance the construction of a 
single-family residence if a prospective homeowner has contracted to 
purchase the property and may also exclude a loan to finance the 
construction of one single-family residence per member-borrower or group 
of associated member-borrowers, irrespective of the existence of a 
contractual commitment from a prospective homeowner to purchase the 
property.
    (b) The borrower must have a minimum of 25% equity interest in the 
project being financed, the value of which is determined by the market 
value of the project at the time the loan is made, except that this 
requirement will not apply in the case of a loan made to finance the 
construction of a single-family residence if a prospective homeowner has 
contracted to purchase the property and in the case of one loan to a 
member-borrower or group of associated member-borrowers to finance the 
construction of a single-family residence, irrespective of the existence 
of a contractual commitment from a prospective homeowner to purchase the 
property. Instead, the collateral requirements of Sec. 723.7 will 
apply; and
    (c) The funds may be released only after on-site, written 
inspections by qualified personnel and according to a preapproved draw 
schedule and any other conditions as set forth in the loan 
documentation.

[64 FR 28729, May 27, 1999, as amended at 68 FR 56551, Oct. 1, 2003; 69 
FR 62565, Oct. 27, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 723.4  What other regulations apply to member business lending?

    (a) The provisions of Sec. 701.21(a) through (g) and part 702 of 
this chapter apply to member business loans granted by credit unions to 
the extent they are consistent with this part. Except as required by 
part 741 of this chapter, federally insured State-chartered credit 
unions are not required to comply with the provisions of Sec. 701.21(a) 
through (g) of this chapter.
    (b) If a federal credit union makes a member business loan as part 
of a Small Business Administration guaranteed loan program with loan 
requirements that are less restrictive than those required by NCUA, then 
the federal credit union may follow the loan requirements of the 
relevant Small Business Administration guaranteed loan program to the 
extent they are consistent with this part. A federally insured State-
chartered credit union that is subject to this part and makes a member 
business loan as part of a Small Business Administration guaranteed loan 
program with loan requirements that are less restrictive than those 
required by NCUA may follow the loan requirements of the relevant Small 
Business Administration guaranteed loan program to the extent they are 
consistent with this part if its state supervisory authority has 
determined that the credit union has authority to do so under State law.
    (c) The collateral and security requirements of Sec. 723.3 and 
Sec. 723.7 do not apply to member business loans made as part of a 
Small Business Administration guaranteed loan program.

[69 FR 62565, Oct. 27, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 723.5  How do you implement a member business loan program?

    (a) Generally. The board of directors must adopt specific business 
loan policies and review them at least annually. The board must also use 
the services of an individual with at least two years

[[Page 622]]

direct experience with the type of lending the credit union will be 
engaging in. The experience must provide the credit union sufficient 
expertise given the complexity and risk exposure of the loans in which 
the credit union intends to engage. Credit unions do not have to hire 
staff to meet the requirements of this section but must ensure that the 
expertise is available. A credit union can meet the experience 
requirement through various approaches. For example, a credit union can 
use the services of a credit union service organization (CUSO), an 
employee of another credit union, an independent contractor, or other 
third parties. However, the actual decision to grant a loan must reside 
with the credit union.
    (b) Conflicts of Interest. Any third party used by a credit union to 
meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must be 
independent from the transaction and is prohibited from having a 
participation in the loan or an interest in the collateral securing the 
loan that the third party is responsible for reviewing, with the 
following exceptions:
    (1) The third party may provide a service to the credit union 
related to the transaction, such as loan servicing;
    (2) The third party may provide the requisite experience to the 
credit union and purchase a loan or a participation interest in a loan 
originated by the credit union that the third party reviewed; or
    (3) A credit union may use the services of a CUSO that otherwise 
meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section even though the 
CUSO is not independent from the transaction, provided the credit union 
has a controlling financial interest in the CUSO as determined under 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

[68 FR 56551, Oct. 1, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 723.6  What must your member business loan policy address?

    At a minimum, your policy must address the following:
    (a) The types of business loans you will make;
    (b) Your trade area;
    (c) The maximum amount of your assets, in relation to net worth,

    (d) The maximum amount of your assets, in relation to net worth, 
that you will invest in a given category or type of business loan;

years) involved in making and administering business loans;
    (g) A requirement to analyze and document the ability of the 
borrower to repay the loan consistent with appropriate underwriting and 
due diligence standards, which also addresses the need for periodic 
financial statements, credit reports, and other data when necessary to 
analyze future loans and lines of credit, such as, borrower's history 
and experience, balance sheet, cash flow analysis, income statements, 
tax data, environmental impact assessment, and comparison with industry 
averages, depending upon the loan purpose;
    (h) The collateral requirements must include:

<R05>
Sec. 723.7  What are the collateral and security requirements?

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 723.3 or unless your Regional 
Director grants a waiver, all member business loans, except those made 
under paragraphs (c),

[[Page 623]]

(d), and (e) of this section, must be secured by collateral as follows:
    (1) The maximum loan-to-value ratio for all liens must not exceed 
80% unless the value in excess of 80% is covered through private 
mortgage insurance or equivalent type of insurance, or insured, 
guaranteed, or subject to advance commitment to purchase by an agency of 
the federal government, an agency of a state or any of its political 
subdivisions, but in no case may the ratio exceed 95%;
    (2) A borrower may not substitute any insurance, guarantee, or 
advance commitment to purchase by any agency of the federal government, 
a state or any political subdivision of such state for the collateral 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (b) Principals, other than a not for profit organization as defined 
by the Internal Revenue Service Code (26 U.S.C. 501) or those where the 
Regional Director grants a waiver, must provide their personal liability 
and guarantee. Federal credit unions and federally insured state-
chartered credit unions that meet RegFlex standards, as determined 
pursuant to Part 742 of this Chapter, are exempt from this requirement 
and may make their own determination whether to require the personal 
liability and guarantee of principals.

<R05>
Sec. 723.11  How do you obtain a waiver?

    To obtain a waiver, a federal credit union must submit a request to 
the Regional Director (a corporate federal credit union submits the 
waiver request to the Director of the Office of Corporate Credit 
Unions). A state chartered federally insured credit union must submit 
the request to its state supervisory authority. If the state supervisory 
authority approves the request, the state regulator will forward the 
request to the Regional Director (or if appropriate the Director of the 
Office of Corporate Credit Unions). A waiver is not effective until it 
is approved by the Regional Director (or in the case of a corporate 
federal credit union the Director of the Office of Corporate Credit 
Unions). The waiver request must contain the following:
    (a) A copy of your business lending policy;
    (b) The higher limit sought (if applicable);
    (c) An explanation of the need to raise the limit (if applicable);
    (d) Documentation supporting your ability to manage this activity; 
and
    (e) An analysis of the credit union's prior experience making member 
business loans, including as a minimum:
    (1) The history of loan losses and loan delinquency;
    (2) Volume and cyclical or seasonal patterns;
    (3) Diversification;
    (4) Concentrations of credit to one borrower or group of associated 
borrowers in excess of 15% of net worth;
    (5) Underwriting standards and practices;
    (6) Types of loans grouped by purpose and collateral; and
    (7) The qualifications of personnel responsible for underwriting and 
administering member business loans.


<R05>
Sec. 723.12  What will NCUA do with my waiver request?

    Your Regional Director (or the Director of the Office of Corporate 
Credit Unions) will:
    (a) Review the information you provided in your request;
    (b) Evaluate the level of risk to your credit union;
    (c) Consider your credit union's historical CAMEL composite and 
component ratings when evaluating your request; and
    (d) Notify you whenever your waiver request is deemed complete. 
Notify you of the action taken within 45 calendar days of receiving a 
complete request from the federal credit union or the state supervisory 
authority. If you do not receive notification within 45 calendar days of 
the date the complete request was received by the regional office, the 
credit union may assume approval of the waiver request.


<R05>
Sec. 723.13  What options are available if the NCUA Regional Director denies my waiver request, or a portion of it?

    You may appeal the Regional Director's (or the Director of the 
Office of Corporate Credit Unions) decision in writing to the NCUA 
Board. Your appeal must include all information requested in Sec. 
723.11 and why you disagree with your Regional Director's (or the Office 
of Corporate Credit Union Director's) decision.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 723.14-723.15  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 723.16  What is the aggregate member business loan limit for a credit union?

    (a) General. The aggregate limit on a credit union's net member 
business loan balances is the lesser of 1.75 times the credit union's 
net worth or 12.25% of the credit union's total assets. Loans that are 
exempt from the definition of member business loans are not counted for 
the purpose of the aggregate loan limit.
    (b) Effect of nonmember loans and nonmember participations. If a 
credit union holds any nonmember loans or nonmember loan participation 
interests that would constitute a member business loan if made to a 
member, those loans will affect the credit union's aggregate limit on 
net member business loan balances as follows:
    (1) The total of the credit union's net member business loan 
balances and the nonmember loan balances must not exceed the lesser of 
1.75 times the credit union's net worth or 12.25% of the credit union's 
total assets, unless the credit union has first received approval from 
the NCUA regional director.

[[Page 625]]

    (2) To request approval from the NCUA regional director, a credit 
union must submit an application that:
    (i) Includes a current copy of the credit union's member business 
loan policies;
    (ii) Confirms that the credit union is in compliance with all other 
aspects of this rule;
    (iii) States the credit union's proposed limit on the total amount 
of nonmember loans and participation interests that the credit union may 
acquire if the application is granted; and
    (iv) Attests that the acquisition of nonmember loans and 
participations is not being used, in conjunction with one or more other 
credit unions, to have the effect of trading member business loans that 
would otherwise exceed the aggregate limit.
    (3) A federal credit union must submit its request for approval to 
the regional director (a corporate federal credit union submits its 
request to the Director of the Office of Corporate Credit Unions). A 
state chartered federally insured credit union must submit the request 
to its state supervisory authority. If the state supervisory authority 
approves the request, the state regulator will forward the application 
and its decision to the regional director (or if appropriate, the 
Director of the Office of Corporate Credit Unions). An approved 
application is not effective until it is approved by the regional 
director (or in the case of a corporate federal credit union the 
Director of the Office of Corporate Credit Unions). The regional 
director will issue a decision within 30 days of receipt of a federal 
credit union's completed application or within 30 days of receipt of a 
completed application and the state supervisory authority's approval for 
a state chartered federally insured credit union.

<R05>
Sec. 723.17  Are there any exceptions to the aggregate loan limit?

    There are three circumstances where a credit union qualifies for an 
exception from the aggregate limit. Loans that are excepted from the 
definition of member business loans are not counted for the purpose of 
the exceptions. The three exceptions are:
    (a) Credit unions that have a low-income designation or participate 
in the Community Development Financial Institutions program;
    (b) Credit unions that were chartered for the purpose of making 
member business loans and can provide documentary evidence (such 
evidence includes but is not limited to the original charter, original 
bylaws, original business plan, original field of membership, board 
minutes and loan portfolio);
    (c) Credit unions that have a history of primarily making member 
business loans, meaning that either member business loans comprise at 
least 25% of the credit union's outstanding loans (as evidenced in any 
call report filed between January 1995 and September 1998 or any 
equivalent documentation including financial statements) or member 
business loans comprise the largest portion of the credit union's loan 
portfolio (as evidenced in any call report filed between January 1995 
and September 1998 or any equivalent documentation including financial 
statements). For example, if a credit union makes 23% member business 
loans, 22% first mortgage loans, 22% new automobile loans, 20% credit 
card loans, and 13% total other real estate loans, then the credit union 
meets this exception.


<R05>
Sec. 723.18  How do I obtain an exception?

    To obtain the exception, a federal credit union must submit 
documentation to the Regional Director, demonstrating that it meets the 
criteria of one of the exceptions. A state chartered federally insured 
credit union must submit documentation to its state supervisory 
authority. The state supervisory authority will forward its decision to 
NCUA. The exception does not expire unless revoked by the state 
supervisory authority for a state chartered federally insured credit 
union or the Regional Director for a federal credit union. If an 
exception request is denied for a federal credit union, it may be 
appealed to the NCUA Board within 60 days of the denial by the Regional 
Director. Until the NCUA Board acts on the appeal, the credit union can 
continue to make new member business loans.

[[Page 626]]


<R05>
Sec. 723.19  What are the recordkeeping requirements?

    You must separately identify member business loans in your records 
and in the aggregate on your financial reports.


<R05>
Sec. 723.20  How can a state supervisory authority develop and enforce a member business loan regulation?

    (a) The NCUA Board may exempt federally insured state chartered 
credit unions in a given state from NCUA's member business loan rule if 
NCUA approves the state's rule for use for state chartered federally 
insured credit unions. In making this determination, the Board is guided 
by safety and soundness considerations and reviews whether the state 
regulation minimizes the risk and accomplishes the overall objectives of 
NCUA's member business loan rule in this part. Specifically, the Board 
will focus its review on:
    (1) The definition of a member business loan;
    (2) Loan to one borrower limits;
    (3) Written loan policies;
    (4) Collateral and security requirements;
    (5) Construction and development lending; and
    (6) Loans to senior management.
    (b) To receive NCUA's approval of a state's member business loan 
rule, the state supervisory authority must submit its rule to the NCUA 
regional office. After reviewing the rule, the region will forward the 
request to the NCUA Board for a final determination.
    (c) A state supervisory authority that administers a state member 
business loans rule, approved by NCUA under Sec. Sec. 723.20(a) and 
(b), may rescind its rule without NCUA approval. A state supervisory 
authority should notify NCUA if it anticipates rescinding its rule to 
foster regulatory continuity and cooperation.

FR 75722, Dec. 21, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 723.21  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
    Associated member is any member with a shared ownership, investment, 
or other pecuniary interest in a business or commercial endeavor with 
the borrower.
    Construction or development loan is a financing arrangement for 
acquiring property or rights to property, including land or structures, 
with the intent to convert it to income-producing property such as 
residential housing for rental or sale; commercial use; industrial use; 
or similar uses. Construction or development loan includes a financing 
arrangement for the major renovation or development of property already 
owned by the borrower that will convert the property to income producing 
property or convert the use of income producing property to a different 
use from its use before the major renovation or development or is a 
major expansion of its current use. Construction or development loan 
does not include loans to finance maintenance, repairs, or improvements 
to an existing income producing property that do not change its use. 
Examples to illustrate when a loan is or is not a construction or 
development loan follow.

    Example 1. If a member borrows money to repair a roof on a barn on 
an existing farming operation, this is a member business loan but is not 
a construction or development loan. A construction or development loan 
does not include a loan for routine maintenance of a borrower's existing 
business or a loan to enhance or expand a borrower's existing business 
unless those renovations convert the property to a different use or are 
so major as to be considered the equivalent of converting the use of the 
property.
    Example 2. A loan to convert a movie theater into a restaurant is a 
construction or development loan. A loan to convert a large Victorian 
home used for residential purposes into a six-room inn also would be a 
construction or development loan. In both instances, the loans are for 
the purpose of converting the use of the properties. By contrast, a loan 
to repair the roof or replace the carpet and wallpaper of an operating 
inn would not be a construction or development loan as it neither 
converts the use of the property, nor is so major a renovation to be 
considered the equivalent of converting the use of the property.
    Example 3. A loan to expand the parking lot of a small strip 
shopping center would not be a construction or development loan, but a 
loan to renovate the small strip shopping center into a mega-mall would 
be a construction or development loan as it would be viewed as a major 
renovation that converts the use of the property.

[[Page 627]]

    Example 4. A hotel with a fair market value of $10 million borrows 
$1 million to build an exercise facility in the hotel to enhance the 
property. The loan amount is 10% of the fair market value of the 
property. This is not a construction or development loan. It is a member 
business loan to improve or renovate an existing incoming producing 
property, but it is not so major a renovation as to be considered the 
equivalent of converting the use of the property. In another scenario, a 
hotel with a fair market value of $10 million borrows $5 million to 
build a luxury health spa on the hotel grounds. The loan amount is 50% 
of the fair market value of the property. This is a construction or 
development loan, even if the use of the property has not been 
converted, as the renovation is so major as to be considered the 
equivalent of converting the use of the property.

    Immediate family member is a spouse or other family member living in 
the same household.
    Loan-to-value ratio is the aggregate amount of all sums borrowed 
including outstanding balances plus any unfunded commitment or line of 
credit from all sources on an item of collateral divided by the market 
value of the collateral used to secure the loan.
    Net member business loan balance means the outstanding loan balance 
plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by any portion of the loan that 
is secured by shares in the credit union, or by shares or deposits in 
other financial institutions, or by a lien on the member's primary 
residence, or insured or guaranteed by any agency of the federal 
government, a state or any political subdivision of such state, or 
subject to an advance commitment to purchase by any agency of the 
federal government, a state or any political subdivision of such state, 
or sold as a participation interest without recourse and qualifying for 
true sales accounting under generally accepted accounting principles.
    Net worth means the retained earnings balance of the credit union at 
quarter end as determined under generally accepted accounting 
principles. Retained earnings consists of undivided earnings, regular 
reserves, and any other appropriations designated by management or 
regulatory authorities. This means that only undivided earnings and 
appropriations of undivided earnings are included in net worth. For low 
income-designated credit unions, net worth also includes secondary 
capital accounts that are uninsured and subordinate to all other claims, 
including claims of creditors, shareholders and the NCUSIF. For any 
credit union, net worth does not include the allowance for loan and 
lease losses account.

401(d), 408, 408A and 530), for its members or groups of its members, 
provided the funds of such plans are invested in share accounts or share 
certificate accounts of the Federal credit union. Federal credit unions 
located in a territory, including the trust territories, or a possession 
of the United States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, are also 
authorized to act as trustee or custodian for such plans, if authorized 
under sections 223, 401(d), 408, 408A and 530 of the Internal Revenue 
Code as applied to the territory or possession under similar provisions 
of territorial law. All funds held in a trustee or custodial capacity 
must be maintained in accordance with applicable laws and

[[Page 628]]

rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, or any other authority exercising 
jurisdiction over such trust or custodial accounts. The federal credit 
union shall maintain individual records for each participant which show 
in detail all transactions relating to the funds of each participant or 
beneficiary.

share certificate account in the Federal credit union;
    (b) Any subsequent transfer of funds to other assets is solely at 
the direction of the member and the Federal credit union exercises no 
investment discretion and provides no investment advice with respect to 
plan assets (i.e., the credit union performs only custodial duties); and
    (c) The member is clearly notified of the fact that National Credit 
Union Share Insurance Fund coverage is limited to funds held in share or 
share certificate accounts of NCUSIF-insured credit unions.

<R05>
Sec. 740.0  Scope.

    This part applies to all federally insured credit unions. It 
prescribes the requirements for the official sign insured credit unions 
must display and the requirements with regard to the official 
advertising statement insured credit unions must include in their 
advertisements. It requires that all other kinds of advertisements be 
accurate. It also establishes requirements for advertisements of excess 
insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 740.1  Definitions.

    (a) Account or accounts as used in this part means share, share 
certificate or share draft accounts (or their equivalent under state 
law, as determined by the Board in the case of insured state credit 
unions) of a member (which includes other credit unions, public units, 
and nonmembers where permitted under the Act) in a credit union of a 
type approved by the Board which evidences money or its equivalent 
received or held by a credit union in the usual course of business and 
for which it has given or is obligated to give credit to the account of 
the member.
    (b) Insured credit union as used in this part means a credit union 
insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).


<R05>
Sec. 740.2  Accuracy of advertising.

    No insured credit union may use any advertising (which includes 
print, electronic, or broadcast media, displays and signs, stationery, 
and other promotional material) or make any representation which is 
inaccurate or deceptive in any particular, or which in any way 
misrepresents its services, contracts, or financial condition, or which 
violates the requirements of Sec. 707.8 of this subchapter, if 
applicable. This provision does not prohibit an insured credit union 
from using a trade name or a name other than its official charter name 
in advertising or signage, so long as it uses its official charter name 
in communications with NCUA and for share certificates or certificates 
of deposit, signature cards, loan agreements, account statements, 
checks, drafts and other legal documents.

[[Page 636]]


<R05>
Sec. 740.3  Advertising of excess insurance.

    Any advertising that mentions share or savings account insurance 
provided by a party other than the NCUA must clearly explain the type 
and amount of such insurance and the identity of the carrier and must 
avoid any statement or implication that the carrier is affiliated with 
the NCUA or the federal government.


<R05>
Sec. 740.4  Requirements for the official sign.

    (a) Each insured credit union must continuously display the official 
sign described in paragraph (b) of this section at each station or 
window where insured account funds or deposits are normally received in 
its principal place of business and in all its branches, 30 days after 
its first day of operation as an insured credit union. Each insured 
credit union must also display the official sign on its Internet page, 
if any, where it accepts deposits or open accounts, but it may vary the 
font sizes from that depicted in paragraph (b) of this section to ensure 
its legibility.
    (b) The official sign shall be as depicted below:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22NO06.012
    
    (1) NCUA will automatically supply all insured credit unions an 
initial supply of official signs with a blue background and white 
lettering at no cost for compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. 
If the initial supply is not adequate, the insured credit unions must 
immediately request additional signs from NCUA. Any credit union that 
does not have an adequate supply but requests additional signs from NCUA 
will not be considered to have violated paragraph (a) of this section 
unless the credit union fails to display the signs after receiving them.
    (2) An insured credit union may purchase signs from commercial 
suppliers or develop its own in any color scheme so long as they are 
legible and otherwise comply with this part. A credit union may alter 
the font size of the official sign to make it legible on its Internet 
page and on documents it provides to its members including 
advertisements, but it may not do so on signs to be placed at each 
station or window where the credit union normally receives insured funds 
or deposits in its principal place of business and all of its branches.
    (c) An insured credit union must not receive account funds at any 
teller's station or window where any noninsured credit union or 
institution receives deposits. Excepted from this prohibition are credit 
union centers, service centers, or branches servicing more than one 
credit union where only some of the credit unions are insured by the 
NCUA. In such instances, immediately above or beside each official sign 
there must be another sign stating, ``Only the following credit unions 
serviced by this facility are federally insured by the NCUA --'' (the 
full name of each credit union insured will follow the word NCUA). The 
lettering must be of such size and print to be clearly legible to all 
members conducting share or share deposit transactions.
    (d) The Board may require any insured credit union, upon at least 30 
days' written notice, to change the

[[Page 637]]

wording of its official signs in a manner deemed necessary for the 
protection of shareholders or others.
    (e) For purposes of this section, the terms ``branch,'' ``station,'' 
``teller station,'' and ``window'' do not include automated teller 
machines or point of sale terminals.
    (f) An insured credit union that fails to comply with Section 205(a) 
of the Federal Credit Union Act regarding the official sign, 12 U.S.C. 
1785(a), or any requirement in this part is subject to a penalty of up 
to $100 per day.

statement in its advertisements thirty (30) days after its first day of 
operations as an insured credit union unless the Regional Director 
grants it an extension.
    (2) If advertising copy without the official advertising statement 
is on hand on the date the requirements of this section become 
operative, the insured credit union may use an overstamp or other means 
to include the official advertising statement until the supplies are 
exhausted.
    (b) The official advertising statement is in substance as follows: 
This credit union is federally insured by the National Credit Union 
Administration. The short title ``Federally insured by NCUA'' and a 
reproduction of the official sign may be used by insured credit unions 
at their option as the official advertising statement. The official 
advertising statement must be in a size and print that is clearly 
legible.
    (c) The following advertisements need not include the official 
advertising statement:
    (1) Statements of condition and reports of condition of an insured 
credit union which are required to be published by state or federal law 
or regulation;
    (2) Credit union supplies such as stationery (except when used for 
circular letters), envelopes, deposit slips, checks, drafts, signature 
cards, account passbooks, and noninsurable certificates;
    (3) Signs or plates in the credit union office or attached to the 
building or buildings in which the offices are located;
    (4) Listings in directories;
    (5) Advertisements not setting forth the name of the insured credit 
union;
    (6) Display advertisements in credit union directories, provided the 
name of the credit union is listed on any page in the directory with a

credit union is insured by the National Credit Union Administration, or

safekeeping box business or services, traveler's checks on which the 
credit union is not primarily liable, and credit life or disability 
insurance.

Sec. 741.0  Scope.

    The provisions of this part apply to federal credit unions, 
federally insured state-chartered credit unions, and credit unions 
making application for insurance of accounts pursuant to Title II of the 
Act, unless the context of a provision indicates its application is 
otherwise limited. This part prescribes various requirements for 
obtaining and maintaining federal insurance and the payment of insurance 
premiums and capitalization deposit. Subpart A of this part contains 
substantive requirements that are not codified elsewhere in this 
chapter. Subpart B of this part lists additional regulations, set forth 
elsewhere in this chapter as applying to federal credit unions, that 
also apply to federally insured state-chartered credit unions. As used 
in this part, ``insured credit union'' means a credit union whose 
accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund 
(NCUSIF).


<R04>
   Subpart A_Regulations That Apply to Both Federal Credit Unions and 
    Federally Insured State-Chartered Credit Unions and That Are Not 
                Codified Elsewhere in NCUA's Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 741.1  Examination.

    As provided in Sections 201 and 204 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1781 and 
1784), the NCUA Board is authorized to examine any insured credit union 
or any credit union making application for insurance of its accounts. 
Such examination may require access to all records, reports, contracts 
to which the credit union is a party, and information concerning

[[Page 639]]

the affairs of the credit union. Upon request, such documentation must 
be provided to the NCUA Board or its representative. Any credit union 
which makes application for insurance will be required to pay the cost 
of such examination and processing. To the maximum extent feasible, the 
NCUA Board will utilize examinations conducted by state regulatory 
agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 741.2  Maximum borrowing authority.

    (a)Any credit union which makes application for insurance of its 
accounts pursuant to Title II of the Act, or any insured credit union, 
must not borrow, from any source, an aggregate amount in excess of 50 
per centum of its paid-in and unimpaired capital and surplus (shares and 
undivided earnings, plus net income or minus net loss).
    (b) A federally insured state-chartered credit union may apply to 
the regional director for a waiver of paragraph (a) of this section up 
to the amount permitted under the applicable state law or by the state 
regulator. The waiver request must include:
    (1) Written approval from the state regulator;
    (2) A detailed analysis of the safety and soundness implications of 
the proposed waiver;
    (3) A proposed aggregate dollar amount or percentage of paid-in and 
unimpaired capital and surplus limitation; and
    (4) An explanation demonstrating the need to raise the limit.
    (c) The regional director will approve the waiver request if the 
proposed borrowing limit will not adversely affect the safety and 
soundness of the federally insured state-chartered credit union.

[60 FR 58504, Nov. 28, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 8547, Feb. 25, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 741.3  Criteria.

    In determining the insurability of a credit union which makes 
application for insurance and in continuing the insurability of its 
accounts pursuant to Title II of the Act, the following criteria shall 
be applied:
    (a) Reserves--(1) General rule. State-chartered credit unions are 
subject to section 216 of the Act, 12 U.S.C. 1790d, and to part 702 and 
subpart L of part 747 of this chapter.
    (2) Special reserve for nonconforming investments. State-chartered 
credit unions (except state-chartered corporate credit unions) are 
required to establish an additional special reserve for investments if 
those credit unions are permitted by their respective state laws to make 
investments beyond those authorized in the Act or the NCUA Rules and 
Regulations. For any investment other than loans to members and 
obligations or securities expressly authorized in Title I of the Act and 
part 703 of this chapter, as amended, state-chartered credit unions 
(except state-chartered corporate credit unions) are required to 
establish and maintain at the end of each accounting period and prior to 
payment of any dividend, an Appropriation for Non-conforming Investments 
in an amount at least equal to the net excess of book value over current 
market value of the investments. If the market value cannot be 
determined, an amount equal to the full book value will be established. 
When at the end of any dividend period, the amount in the Appropriation 
for Non-conforming Investments exceeds the difference between book value 
and market value, the board of directors may authorize the transfer of 
the excess to Undivided Earnings.
    (b) Financial condition and policies. The following factors are to 
be considered in determining whether the credit union's financial 
condition and policies are both safe and sound:
    (1) The existence of unfavorable trends which may include excessive 
losses on loans (i.e., losses which exceed the regular reserve or its 
equivalent [in the case of state-chartered credit unions] plus other 
irrevocable reserves established as a contingency against losses on 
loans), the presence of special reserve accounts used specifically for 
charging off loan balances of deceased borrowers, and an expense ratio 
so high that the required transfers to reserves create a net operating 
loss for the period or that the net gain after these transfers is not 
sufficient to permit the payment of a nominal dividend;

[[Page 640]]

    (2) The existence of written lending policies, including adequate 
documentation of secured loans and the protection of security interests 
by recording, bond, insurance, or other adequate means, adequate 
determination of the financial capacity of borrowers and co-makers for 
repayment of the loan, and adequate determination of value of security 
on loans to ascertain that said security is adequate to repay the loan 
in the event of default;
    (3) Investment policies which are within the provisions of 
applicable law and regulations, i.e., the Act and part 703 of this 
chapter for federal credit unions and the laws of the state in which the 
credit union operates for state-chartered credit unions, except state-
chartered corporate credit unions. State-chartered corporate credit 
unions are permitted to make only those investments that are in 
conformance with part 704 of this chapter and applicable state laws and 
regulations;
    (4) The presence of any account or security, the form of which has 
not been approved by the Board, except for accounts authorized by state 
law for state-chartered credit unions.
    (c) Fitness of management. The officers, directors, and committee 
members of the credit union must have conducted its operations in 
accordance with provisions of applicable law, regulations, its charter 
and bylaws. No person shall serve as a director, officer, committee 
member, or employee of an insured credit union who has been convicted of 
any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust, except 
with the written consent of the Board.
    (d) Insurance of member accounts would not otherwise involve undue 
risk to the NCUSIF. The credit union must maintain adequate fidelity 
bond coverage as specified in Sec. 741.201. Any circumstances which may 
be unique to the particular credit union concerned shall also be 
considered in arriving at the determination of whether or not an undue 
risk to the NCUSIF is or may be present. For purposes of this section, 
the term ``undue risk to the NCUSIF'' is defined as a condition which 
creates a probability of loss in excess of that normally found in a 
credit union and which indicates a reasonably foreseeable probability of 
the credit union becoming insolvent because of such condition, with a 
resultant claim against the NCUSIF.
    (e) Powers and purposes. The credit union must not perform services 
other than those which are consistent with the promotion of thrift and 
the creation of a source of credit for its members, except as otherwise 
permitted by law or regulation.
    (f) Letter of disapproval. A credit union whose application for 
share insurance is disapproved shall receive a letter indicating the 
reasons for such disapproval, a citation of the authority for such 
disapproval, and suggested methods by which the applying credit union 
may correct its deficiencies and thereby qualify for share insurance.
    (g) Nothing in this section shall preclude the NCUA Board from 
imposing additional terms or conditions pursuant to the insurance 
agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 741.4  Insurance premium and one percent deposit.

    (a) Scope. This section implements the requirements of Section 202 
of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782) providing for capitalization of the NCUSIF 
through the maintenance of a deposit by each insured credit union in an 
amount equaling one percent of its insured shares and payment of an 
insurance premium.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Available assets ratio means the ratio of:
    (i) The amount determined by subtracting all liabilities of the 
NCUSIF, including contingent liabilities for which no provision for 
losses has been made, from the sum of cash and the market value of 
unencumbered investments authorized under 12 U.S.C. 1783(c), to:
    (ii) The aggregate amount of the insured shares in all insured 
credit unions.
    (iii) Shown as an abbreviated mathematical formula, the available 
assets ratio is:

[[Page 641]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18OC99.001

    (2) Equity ratio means the ratio of:
    (i) The amount of NCUSIF's capitalization, meaning insured credit 
unions' one percent capitalization deposits plus the retained earnings 
balance of the NCUSIF (less contingent liabilities for which no 
provision for losses has been made) to:
    (ii) The aggregate amount of the insured shares in all insured 
credit unions.
    (iii) Shown as an abbreviated mathematical formula, the equity ratio 
is:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18OC99.002

    (3) Insured shares means the total amount of a credit union's share, 
share draft and share certificate accounts, or their equivalent under 
state law (which may include deposit accounts), authorized to be issued 
to members, other credit unions, public units, or nonmembers (where 
permitted under the Act or equivalent state law). ``Insured shares'' 
does not include amounts in excess of insurance coverage as provided in 
part 745 of this chapter; and
    (4) Normal operating level means an equity ratio not less than 1.2 
percent and not more than 1.5 percent, as established by action of the 
NCUA Board.
    (5) Reporting period means calendar year for credit unions with 
total assets of less than $50,000,000 and means semiannual period for 
credit union with total assets of $50,000,000 or more.
    (c) One percent deposit. Each insured credit union shall maintain 
with the NCUSIF during each reporting period a deposit in an amount 
equaling one percent of the total of the credit union's insured shares 
at the close of the preceding reporting period. For credit unions with 
total assets of less than $50,000,000, insured shares will be measured 
and adjusted annually based on the insured shares reported in the credit 
union's semiannual 5300 report due in January of each year. For credit 
unions with total assets of $50,000,000 or more, insured shares will be 
measured and adjusted semiannually based on the insured shares reported 
in the credit union's quarterly 5300 reports due in January and July of 
each year.
    (d) Insurance premium charges--(1) In general. Each insured credit 
union will pay to the NCUSIF, on dates the NCUA Board determines, but 
not more than twice in any calendar year, an insurance premium in an 
amount stated as a percentage of insured shares, which will be the same 
for all insured credit unions.
    (2) Relation of premium charge to equity ratio of NCUSIF. (i) The 
NCUA Board may assess a premium charge only if the NCUSIF's equity ratio 
is less than 1.3 percent and the premium charge does not exceed the 
amount necessary to restore the equity ratio to 1.3 percent.
    (ii) If the equity ratio of NCUSIF falls below 1.2 percent, the NCUA 
Board is required to assess a premium in an amount it determines is 
necessary to restore the equity ratio to, and maintain that ratio at, 
1.2 percent.
    (e) Distribution of NCUSIF equity. If, as of the end of a calendar 
year, the NCUSIF exceeds its normal operating level and its available 
assets ratio exceeds 1.0 percent, the NCUA Board will make a 
proportionate distribution of NCUSIF equity to insured credit unions. 
The distribution will be the maximum amount possible that does not 
reduce the NCUSIF's equity ratio below its normal operating level and

[[Page 642]]

does not reduce its available assets ratio below 1.0 percent. The 
distribution will be after the calendar year and in the form determined 
by the NCUA Board. The form of the distribution may include a waiver of 
insurance premiums, premium rebates, or distributions from NCUSIF equity 
in the form of dividends. The NCUA Board will use the aggregate amount 
of the insured shares from all insured credit unions from the final 
reporting period of the calendar year in calculating the NCUSIF's equity 
ratio and available assets ratio for purposes of this paragraph.
    (f) Invoices. The NCUA provides invoices to all federally insured 
credit unions stating any change in the amount of a credit union's one 
percent deposit and the computation and funding of any premium payment 
due. Invoices for federal credit unions also include any annual 
operating fees that are due. Invoices are calculated based on a credit 
union's insured shares as of the most recently ended reporting period. 
The invoices may also provide for any distribution the NCUA Board 
declares in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, resulting in 
a single net transfer of funds between a credit union and the NCUA.
    (g) New charters. A newly-chartered credit union that obtains share 
insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year in which it 
has obtained its charter shall not be required to pay an insurance 
premium for that calendar year. The credit union shall fund its one 
percent deposit on a date to be determined by the NCUA Board in the 
following calendar year, but shall not participate in any distribution 
from NCUSIF equity related to the period prior to the credit union's 
funding of its deposit.
    (h) Conversion to Federal insurance. An existing credit union that 
converts to insurance coverage with the NCUSIF shall immediately fund 
its one percent deposit based on the total of its insured shares as of 
the close of the month prior to conversion and, if any premiums have 
been assessed in that calendar year, will pay a prorated premium amount 
to reflect the remaining number of months in that calendar year. The 
credit union will be entitled to a prorated share of any distribution 
from NCUSIF equity declared subsequent to the credit union's conversion.
    (i) Mergers of nonfederally insured credit unions. Where a 
nonfederally insured credit union merges into a federally insured credit 
union, the continuing federally insured credit union shall immediately 
pay to the NCUSIF a prorated insurance premium (unless waived in whole 
or in part for all federally insured credit unions), and an additional 
one percent deposit based upon the increase in insured shares resulting 
from the merger.
    (j) Return of deposit. Any insolvent credit union that is closed for 
involuntary liquidation will not be entitled to a return of its deposit. 
Any solvent credit union that is closed due to involuntary liquidation 
shall be entitled to a return of its deposit prior to final distribution 
of member shares. Any other credit union whose insurance coverage with 
the NCUSIF terminates will be entitled to a return of the full amount of 
its deposit immediately after the final date on which any shares of the 
credit union are insured, except that the NCUA Board reserves the right 
to delay payment by up to one year if it determines that immediate 
payment would jeopardize the financial condition of the NCUSIF. This 
includes termination of insurance due to mergers and consolidations. A 
credit union that receives a return of its deposit during a calendar 
year shall have the option of leaving a nominal sum on deposit with the 
NCUSIF until the next distribution from NCUSIF equity and will thus 
qualify for a prorated share of the distribution.
    (k) Assessment of administrative fee and interest for delinquent 
payment. Each federally insured credit union shall pay to the NCUA an 
administrative fee, the costs of collection, and interest on any 
delinquent payment of its capitalization deposit or insurance premium. A 
payment will be considered delinquent if it is postmarked later than the 
date stated in the invoice provided to the credit union. The NCUA may 
waive or abate charges or collection of interest, if circumstances 
warrant.
    (1) The administrative fee for a delinquent payment shall be an 
amount as fixed from time to time by the NCUA

[[Page 643]]

Board based upon the administrative costs of such delinquent payments to 
the NCUA in the preceding year.
    (2) The costs of collection shall be calculated as the actual hours 
expended by NCUA personnel multiplied by the average hourly cost of the 
salaries and benefits of such personnel.
    (3) The interest rate charged on any delinquent payment shall be the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury Tax and Loan Rate in effect on the date 
when the payment is due as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

[60 FR 58504, Nov. 28, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 56150, Oct. 18, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 741.5  Notice of termination of excess insurance coverage.

    In the event of a credit union's termination of share insurance 
coverage other than that provided by the NCUSIF, the credit union must 
notify all members in writing of such termination at least thirty days 
prior to the effective date of termination.


<R05>
Sec. 741.6  Financial and statistical and other reports.

    (a) Each operating insured credit union must file with the NCUA a 
quarterly Financial and Statistical Report on Form NCUA 5300 according 
to the deadlines published on the Form NCUA 5300, which occur in January 
(for quarter-end December 31), April (for quarter-end March 31), July 
(for quarter-end June 30), and October (for quarter-end September 30) of 
each year.
    (b) Consistency with GAAP. The accounts of financial statements and 
reports required to be filed quarterly under paragraph (a) of this 
section must reflect GAAP if the credit union has total assets of $10 
million or greater, but may reflect regulatory accounting principles 
other than GAAP if the credit union has total assets of less than $10 
million (except that a Federally-insured State-chartered credit union 
may be required by its state credit union supervisor to follow GAAP 
regardless of asset size).
    (c) GAAP sources. GAAP means generally accepted accounting 
principles, as defined in Sec. 715.2(e) of this chapter. GAAP is 
distinct from GAAS, which means generally accepted auditing standards, 
as defined in Sec. 715.2(f) of this chapter. Authoritative sources of 
GAAP include, but are not limited to, pronouncements of the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its predecessor organizations, the 
Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) of the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the FASB's Emerging 
Issues Task Force (EITF), and the applicable AICPA Audit and Accounting 
Guide.
    (d) Insured credit unions shall, upon written notice from the NCUA 
Board or Regional Director, file such financial or other reports in 
accordance with instructions contained in such notice.

[60 FR 58504, Nov. 28, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 41040, July 29, 1999; 
67 FR 12464, Mar. 19, 2002; 71 FR 4034, Jan. 25, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 741.7  Conversion to a state-chartered credit union.

    Any federal credit union that petitions to convert to a state-
chartered federally insured credit union is required to apply to the 
Regional Director for continued insurance of its accounts and meet the 
requirements as stated in the Act and this part. If the application for 
continued insurance is not approved, such insurance will terminate 
subject to the conditions set forth in section 206(d) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 741.8  Purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities.

    (a) Any credit union insured by the National Credit Union Share 
Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) must receive approval from the NCUA before 
purchasing loans or assuming an assignment of deposits, shares, or 
liabilities from:
    (1) Any credit union that is not insured by the NCUSIF;
    (2) Any other financial-type institution (including depository 
institutions, mortgage banks, consumer finance companies, insurance 
companies, loan brokers, and other loan sellers or liability traders); 
or
    (3) Any successor in interest to any institution identified in 
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Approval is not required for:
    (1) Purchases of student loans or real estate secured loans to 
facilitate the packaging of a pool of loans to be sold or pledged on the 
secondary market under Sec. 701.23(b)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this

[[Page 644]]

chapter or comparable state law for state-chartered credit unions, or 
purchases of member loans under Sec. 701.23(b)(1)(i) of this chapter or 
comparable state law for state-chartered credit unions;
    (2) Assumption of deposits, shares or liabilities as rollovers or 
transfers of member retirement accounts or in which a federally-insured 
credit union perfects a security interest in connection with an 
extension of credit to any member; or
    (3) Purchases of assets, including loans, or assumptions of 
deposits, shares, or liabilities by any credit union insured by the 
NCUSIF from another credit union insured by the NCUSIF, except a 
purchase or assumption as a part of a merger under Part 708b.
    (c) A credit union seeking approval under paragraph (a) of this 
section must submit a letter to the regional office with jurisdiction 
for the state where the credit union is headquartered. A corporate 
credit union seeking approval under paragraph (a) of this section must 
submit a letter to the Office of Corporate Credit Unions. The letter 
must request approval and state the nature of the transaction and 
include copies of relevant transaction documents. The regional director 
will make a decision to approve or disapprove the request as soon as 
possible depending on the complexity of the proposed transaction. Credit 
unions should submit a request for approval in sufficient time to close 
the transaction.

[70 FR 75725, Dec. 21, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 741.9  Uninsured membership shares.

    Any credit union that is insured pursuant to Title II of the Act may 
not offer membership shares that, due to the terms and conditions of the 
account, are not eligible for insurance coverage. This prohibition does 
not apply to shares that are uninsured solely because the amount is in 
excess of the maximum insurance coverage provided pursuant to part 745 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 741.10  Disclosure of share insurance.

    Any credit union which is insured pursuant to Title II of the Act 
and is permitted by state law to accept nonmember shares or deposits 
from sources other than other credit unions and public units (or, for 
low-income designated credit unions, any nonmembers), shall identify 
such nonmember accounts as nonmember shares or deposits on any statement 
or report required by the NCUA Board for insurance purposes. Immediately 
after a state-chartered credit union receives notice from NCUA that its 
member accounts are federally insured, the credit union shall advise any 
present nonmember share and deposit holders by letter that their 
accounts are not insured by the NCUSIF. Also, future nonmember share and 
deposit fund holders will be so advised by letter as they open accounts.


<R05>
Sec. 741.11  Foreign branching.

    (a) Application and Prior NCUA Approval Required. Any credit union 
insured under Title II of the Act must apply for and receive approval 
from the regional director before establishing a credit union branch 
outside the United States unless the foreign branch is located on a 
United States military instillation or embassy outside the United 
States. The regional director will have 60 days to approve or deny the 
request.
    (b) Contents of Application. The application must include a business 
plan, written approval by the state supervisory agency if the applicant 
is a state-chartered credit union, and documentation evidencing written 
permission from the host country to establish the branch that explicitly 
recognizes NCUA's authority to examine and take any enforcement action, 
including conservatorship and liquidation actions.
    (c) Contents of Business Plan. The written business plan must 
address the following:
    (1) Analysis of market conditions in the area where the branch is to 
be established;
    (2) The credit union's plan for addressing foreign currency risk;
    (3) Operating facilities, including office space/equipment and 
supplies;
    (4) Safeguarding of assets, bond coverage, insurance coverage, and 
records preservation;

[[Page 645]]

    (5) Written policies regarding the branch (shares, lending, capital, 
charge-offs, collections);
    (6) The field of membership or portion of the field of membership to 
be served through the foreign branch and the financial needs of the 
members to be served and services and products to be provided;
    (7) Detailed pro forma financial statements for branch operations 
(balance sheet and income and expense projections) for the first and 
second year including assumptions;
    (8) Internal controls including cash disbursal procedures for shares 
and loans at the branch;
    (9) Accounting procedures used to identify branch activity and 
performance; and
    (10) Foreign income taxation and employment law.
    (d) Revocation of Approval. A state regulator that revokes approval 
of the branch office must notify NCUA of the action once it issues the 
notice of revocation. The regional director may revoke approval of the 
branch office for failure to follow the business plan in a material 
respect or for substantive and documented safety and soundness reasons. 
If the regional director revokes the approval, the credit union will 
have six months from the date of the revocation letter to terminate the 
operations of the branch. The credit union can appeal this revocation 
directly to the NCUA Board within 30 days of the date of the revocation 
letter.
    (e) Insurance Coverage. Accounts at foreign branches are insured by 
the NCUSIF only if denominated in U.S. dollars and only if payable, by 
the terms of the account agreement, at a U.S. office of the credit 
union. If the host country requires insurance from its own system, 
accounts will not be insured by the National Credit Union Share 
Insurance Fund.

Sec. 741.203  Minimum loan policy requirements.

    Any credit union which is insured pursuant to Title II of the Act 
must:
    (a) Adhere to the requirements stated in part 723 of this chapter 
concerning member business loans, Sec. 701.21(c)(8) of this chapter 
concerning prohibited fees, and Sec. 701.21(d)(5) of this chapter 
concerning nonpreferential loans. State-chartered, NCUSIF-insured credit 
unions in a given state are exempt from these requirements if the state 
supervisory authority for that state adopts substantially equivalent 
regulations as determined by the NCUA Board or, in the case of the 
member business loan requirements, if the state supervisory authority 
adopts member business loan regulations that are approved by the NCUA 
Board pursuant to Sec. 723.20. In nonexempt states, all required NCUA 
reviews and approvals will be handled in coordination with the state 
credit union supervisory authority; and
    (b) Adhere to the requirements stated in part 722 of this chapter 
concerning appraisals.
    (c) Adhere to the requirements stated in Sec. 701.21(h) of this 
chapter concerning third-party servicing of indirect vehicle loans. 
Before a state-chartered credit union applies to a regional director for

supervisory authority. The regional director will not grant a waiver 
unless the appropriate state official concurs in the waiver. The 45-day 
period for the regional director to act on a waiver request, as 
described Sec. 701.21(h)(3), will not begin until the regional director 
has received the state official's concurrence and any other necessary 
information.

    (a) Adhere to the requirements of Sec. 701.32 of this chapter 
regarding public unit and nonmember accounts, provided it has the 
authority to accept such accounts. Requests by federally insured state-
chartered credit unions for an exemption from the limitation of Sec. 
701.32 of this chapter will be made and reviewed on the same basis as 
that provided in Sec. 701.32 of this chapter for federal credit unions, 
provided, however that NCUA will not grant an exemption without the 
concurrence of the appropriate state regulator.
    (b) Obtain a low-income designation in order to accept nonmember 
accounts, other than from public units or other credit unions, provided 
it has the authority to accept such accounts under state law. The state 
regulator shall make the low-income designation with the concurrence of 
the appropriate regional director. The designation will be made and 
reviewed by the state regulator on the same basis as that provided in 
Sec. 701.34(a) of this chapter for federal credit unions. Removal of 
the designation by the state regulator for such credit unions shall be 
with the concurrence of NCUA.
    (c) Receive secondary capital accounts only if the credit has a low-
income designation pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and then 
only in accordance with the terms and conditions authorized for Federal 
credit unions pursuant to Sec. 701.34(b)(1) of this chapter and to the 
extent not inconsistent with applicable state law and regulation. State 
chartered federally insured credit unions offering secondary capital 
accounts must submit the plan required by Sec. 701.34(b)(1) to both the 
state supervisory authority and the NCUA Regional Director for approval. 
The state supervisory authority must approve or disapprove the plan with 
the concurrence of the appropriate NCUA Regional Director.
    (d) Redeem secondary capital accounts only in accordance with the 
terms and conditions authorized for federal credit unions pursuant to 
Sec. 701.34(d) of this chapter and to the extent not inconsistent with 
applicable state law and regulation. State chartered federally insured 
credit unions seeking to redeem secondary capital accounts must submit 
the request required by Sec. 701.34(d)(1) to both the state supervisory

supervisor before making its determination pursuant to Sec. 701.14 
(d)(2) and (f) of this chapter. NCUA will notify the state supervisor of 
its approval/disapproval no later than the time that it notifies the

Sec.
742.1 Regulatory Flexibility Program.
742.2 Criteria to qualify for RegFlex designation.
742.3 Loss and revocation of RegFlex designation.
742.4 RegFlex relief.

    Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1756, 1766.

    Source: 71 FR 4039, Jan. 25, 2006, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 742.1  Regulatory Flexibility Program.

    NCUA's Regulatory Flexibility Program (RegFlex) exempts from all or 
part of the NCUA regulatory restrictions identified elsewhere in this 
part credit unions that demonstrate sustained superior performance as 
measured by CAMEL rating and net worth classification. RegFlex credit 
unions also are authorized to purchase and hold an expanded range of 
obligations.


<R05>
Sec. 742.2  Criteria to qualify for RegFlex designation.

    (a) Automatic qualification. A credit union automatically qualifies 
for RegFlex designation, without formal notification, when it has:
    (1) CAMEL. Received a composite CAMEL rating of ``1'' or ``2'' for 
the two (2) preceding examinations; and
    (2) Net worth. Maintained a net worth classification of ``well 
capitalized'' under part 702 of this chapter for six (6) consecutive 
preceding quarters or, if subject to a risk-based net worth (RBNW) 
requirement under part 702 of

[[Page 649]]

this chapter, has remained ``well capitalized'' for six (6) consecutive 
preceding quarters after applying the applicable RBNW requirement.
    (b) Application for designation. A credit union that does not 
automatically qualify under paragraph (a) of this section may apply for 
a RegFlex designation, which may be granted in whole or in part upon 
notification by the appropriate Regional Director, provided the credit 
union has either:
    (1) CAMEL. Received a composite CAMEL rating of ``3'' or better for 
the preceding examination; or
    (2) Net worth. Maintained a net worth classification of ``well 
capitalized'' under part 702 of this chapter for less than six (6) 
consecutive quarters or, if subject to an RBNW requirement under part 
702 of this chapter, has remained ``well capitalized'' for less than six 
(6) consecutive preceding quarters after applying the applicable RBNW 
requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 742.3  Loss and revocation of RegFlex designation.

    (a) Loss of authority. RegFlex authority is lost when a credit union 
that qualified automatically under the CAMEL and net worth criteria in 
Sec. 742.2(a) no longer meets either of those criteria. Once the 
authority is lost, the credit union may no longer claim the exemptions 
and authority set forth in Sec. 742.4.
    (b) Revocation of authority. The Regional Director may revoke a 
credit union's RegFlex authority under Sec. 742.2, in whole or in part, 
for substantive, documented safety and soundness reasons. When revoking 
RegFlex authority, the regional director must give written notice to the 
credit union stating the reasons for the revocation. The revocation is 
effective upon the credit union's receipt of notice from the Regional 
Director.
    (c) Appeal of revocation. A credit union has 60 days from the date 
of the regional director's determination to revoke RegFlex authority to 
appeal the action, in whole or in part, to NCUA's Supervisory Review 
Committee. The Regional Director's determination will remain in effect 
unless and until the Supervisory Review Committee issues a different 
determination. If the credit union is dissatisfied with the decision of 
the Supervisory Review Committee, the credit union has 60 days from the 
date of the Committee's decision to appeal to the NCUA Board.
    (d) Grandfathering of past actions. Any action duly taken in 
reliance upon RegFlex authority will not be affected or undone by 
subsequent loss or revocation of that authority. Any actions exercised 
after RegFlex authority is lost or revoked must comply with all 
applicable regulatory requirements and restrictions. Nothing in this 
part shall affect NCUA's authority to require a credit union to divest 
its investments or assets for substantive safety and soundness reasons.


<R05>
Sec. 742.4  RegFlex Relief.

    (a) Exemptions. RegFlex credit unions are exempt from the following 
regulatory restrictions:
    (1) Charitable contributions. Section 701.25 of this chapter 
concerning charitable contributions;
    (2) Nonmember deposits. Section 701.32(b) and (c) of this chapter 
concerning the maximum amount of non-member deposits a credit union can 
accept; and
    (3) Fixed assets. Section 701.36(a) of this chapter concerning the 
maximum amount of fixed assets a credit union can acquire;
    (4) Member business loans. Section 723.7(b) of this chapter 
concerning the personal liability and guarantee of principals for member 
business loans.

chapter concerning ``stress testing'' of securities holdings to assess 
the impact of an extreme interest rate shift;
    (7) Zero-coupon securities. Section 703.16(b) of this chapter 
concerning the maximum maturity length of zero-coupon securities;
    (8) Borrowing repurchase transactions. Section 703.13(d)(3) of this 
chapter, concerning the maturity of investments a credit union purchases 
with the proceeds received in a borrowing repurchase transaction, 
provided the value

[[Page 650]]

of the investments that mature later than the borrowing repurchase 
transaction does not exceed 100 percent of the federal credit union's 
net worth;
    (9) Commercial mortgage related security. Section 703.16(d) of this 
chapter prohibiting the purchase of a commercial mortgage related 
security of an issuer other than a government-sponsored enterprise 
enumerated in 12 U.S.C. 1757(7)(E), provided:
    (i) The security is rated in one of the two highest rating 
categories by at least one nationally-recognized statistical rating 
organization;
    (ii) The security meets the definition of mortgage related security 
as defined in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(41) and the definition of commercial 
mortgage related security as defined in Sec. 703.2 of this chapter;
    (iii) The security's underlying pool of loans contains more than 50 
loans with no one loan representing more than 10 percent of the pool; 
and
    (iv) The aggregate total of commercial mortgage related securities 
purchased by the Federal credit union does not exceed 50 percent of its 
net worth.
    (b) Purchase of obligations from a FICU. A RegFlex credit union is 
authorized to purchase and hold the following obligations, provided that 
it would be empowered to grant them:
    (1) Eligible obligations. Eligible obligations pursuant to Sec. 
701.23(b)(1)(i) of this chapter without regard to whether they are 
obligations of its members, provided they are purchased from a 
federally-insured credit union only;
    (2) Student loans. Student loans pursuant to Sec. 701.23(b)(1)(iii) 
of this chapter, provided they are purchased from a federally-insured 
credit union only;
    (3) Mortgage loans. Real-state secured loans pursuant to 
701.23(b)(1)(iv) of this chapter, provided they are purchased from a 
federally-insured credit union only;
    (4) Eligible obligations of a liquidating credit union. Eligible 
obligations of a liquidating credit union pursuant to Sec. 
701.23(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter without regard to whether they are 
obligations of the liquidating credit union's members, provided that 
such purchases do not exceed 5 percent (5%) of the unimpaired capital 
and surplus of the purchasing credit union.

  Subpart A_Clarification and Definition of Account Insurance Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 745.0  Scope.

    The regulation and appendix contained in this part describe the 
insurance coverage of various types of member accounts. In general, all 
types of member share accounts received by the credit union in its usual 
course of business, including regular shares, share certificates, and 
share draft accounts, represent equity and are insured. For the purposes 
of applying the rules in this part, it is presumed that the owner of 
funds in an account is an insured credit union member or otherwise 
eligible to maintain an insured account in a credit union. These rules 
do not extend insurance coverage to persons not entitled to maintain an 
insured account or to account relationships that have not been approved 
by the Board as an insured account. Where there are multiple owners of a 
single account, generally only that part which is allocable to the 
member(s) is insured.


<R05>
Sec. 745.1  Definitions.

    (a) The terms account or accounts as used in this part mean share, 
share certificate or share draft accounts (or their equivalent under 
state law, as determined by the Board in the case of insured state 
credit unions) of a member (which includes other credit unions, public 
units and nonmembers where permitted under the Act) in a credit union of 
a type approved by the Board which evidences money or its equivalent 
received or held by a credit union in the usual course of business and 
for which it has given or is obligated to give credit to the account of 
the member.
    (b) The terms member or members as used in this part mean those 
persons enumerated in the credit union's field of membership who have 
been elected to membership in accordance with the Act or state law in 
the case of state credit unions. It also includes those nonmembers 
permitted under the Act to maintain accounts in an insured credit union, 
including nonmember credit unions and nonmember public units and 
political subdivisions.
    (c) The term public unit means the United States, any state of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, any territory or possession of the United 
States, any county, municipality, or political subdivision thereof, or 
any Indian tribe as defined in section 3(c) of the Indian Financing Act 
of 1974.
    (d) The term political subdivision includes any subdivision of a 
public unit, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, or any 
principal department of such public unit, (1) the creation of which 
subdivision or department has been expressly authorized by state 
statute, (2) to which some functions of government have been delegated 
by state statute, and (3) to which funds have been allocated by statute 
or ordinance for its exclusive use and control. It also includes 
drainage, irrigation, navigation improvement, levee, sanitary, school or 
power districts and bridge or port authorities, and other special 
districts created by state statute or compacts between the states. 
Excluded from the term are subordinate or nonautonomous divisions, 
agencies, or boards within principal departments.
    (e) The term ``standard maximum share insurance amount'' or 
``SMSIA'' means $100,000, adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (F) of 
section 11(a)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
1821(a)(1)(F)). The current SMSIA is $100,000. All examples in this 
regulation (12 CFR part 745) and appendix, unless otherwise noted, use 
the current SMSIA of $100,000.

<R05>
Sec. 745.2  General principles applicable in determining insurance of accounts.

    (a) General. This part provides for determination by the Board of 
the amount of members' insured accounts. The rules for determining the 
insurance coverage of accounts maintained by members in the same or 
different rights and capacities in the same insured credit union are set 
forth in the following provisions of this part. The

[[Page 652]]

appendix provides examples of the application of these rules to various 
factual situations. While the provisions of this part govern in 
determining share insurance coverage, to the extent local law enters 
into a share insurance determination, the local law of the jurisdiction 
in which the insured credit union's principal office is located will 
control over the local law of other jurisdictions where the insured 
credit union has offices or service facilities.
    (b) The regulations in this part in no way are to be interpreted to 
authorize any type of account that is not authorized by Federal law or 
regulation or State law or regulation or by the bylaws of a particular 
credit union. The purpose is to be as inclusive as possible of all 
situations.
    (c) Records. (1) The account records of the insured credit union 
shall be conclusive as to the existence of any relationship pursuant to 
which the funds in the account are deposited and on which a claim for 
insurance coverage is founded. Examples would be trustee, agent, 
custodian, or executor. No claim for insurance based on such a 
relationship will be recognized in the absence of such disclosure.
    (2) If the account records of an insured credit union disclose the 
existence of a relationship which may provide a basis for additional 
insurance, the details of the relationship and the interest of other 
parties in the account must be ascertainable either from the records of 
the credit union or the records of the member maintained in good faith 
and in the regular course of business.
    (3) The account records of an insured credit union in connection 
with a trust account shall disclose the name of both the settlor 
(grantor) and the trustee of the trust and shall contain an account 
signature card executed by the trustee.
    (4) The interests of the co-owners of a joint account shall be 
deemed equal, unless otherwise stated on the insured credit union's 
records in the case of a tenancy in common.
    (d) Valuation of trust interests. (1) Trust interests in the same 
trust deposited in the same account will be separately insured if the 
value of the trust interest is capable of determination, without 
evaluation of contingencies, except for those covered by the present 
worth tables and rules of calculation for their use set forth in Sec. 
20.2031-7 of the Federal Estate Tax Regulations (26 CFR 20.2031-7).
    (2) In connection with any trust in which certain trust interests 
are not capable of evaluation in accordance with the foregoing rule, 
payment by the Board to the trustee with respect to all such trust 
interests shall not exceed the SMSIA.
    (3) Each trust interest in any trust established by two or more 
settlors shall be deemed to be derived from each settlor pro rata to his 
contribution to the trust.
    (4) The term ``trust interest'' means the interest of a beneficiary 
in an irrevocable express trust, whether created by trust instrument or 
statute, but does not include any interest retained by the settlor.
    (e) Continuation of insurance coverage following the death of a 
member. The death of a member will not affect the member's share 
insurance coverage for a period of six months following death unless the 
member's share accounts are restructured in that time period. If the 
accounts are restructured during the six-month grace period, or upon the 
expiration of the six months if not restructured, the share insurance 
coverage will be provided on the basis of actual ownership of the 
accounts in accordance with the provisions of this part. The operation 
of this grace period, however, will not result in a reduction of 
coverage.
    (f) Continuation of separate share insurance coverage after merger 
of insured credit unions. Whenever the liability to pay the member 
accounts of one or more insured credit unions is assumed by another 
insured credit union, whether by merger, consolidation, other statutory 
assumption or contract: The insured status of the credit unions whose 
member account liability has been assumed terminates, for purposes of 
this section, on the date of receipt by NCUA of satisfactory evidence of 
the assumption; and the separate insurance of member accounts assumed 
continues for six months from the date the assumption takes effect or, 
in the case of a share certificate, the earliest

[[Page 653]]

maturity date after the six-month period. In the case of a share 
certificate that matures within the six-month grace period that is 
renewed at the same dollar amount, either with or without accrued 
dividends having been added to the principal amount, and for the same 
term as the original share certificate, the separate insurance applies 
to the renewed share certificate until the first maturity date after the 
six-month period. A share certificate that matures within the six-month 
grace period that is renewed on any other basis, or that is not renewed, 
is separately insured only until the end of the six-month grace period.

Sec. 745.3  Single ownership accounts.

    (a) Funds owned by an individual and deposited in the manner set 
forth below shall be added together and insured up to the SMSIA in the 
aggregate.
    (1) Individual accounts. Funds owned by an individual (or by the 
husband-wife community of which the individual is a member) and 
deposited in one or more accounts in the individual's own name shall be 
insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate.
    (2) Accounts held by agents or nominees. Funds owned by a principal 
and deposited in one or more accounts in the name or names of agents or 
nominees shall be added to any individual account of the principal and 
insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate. This applies to interests 
created in qualified tuition savings programs established in connection 
with section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 529).
    (3) Custodial loan accounts. Loan payments received by a Federal 
credit union prior to remittance to other parties to whom the loan was 
sold pursuant to section 107(13) of the Federal Credit Union Act and 
Sec. 701.23 of NCUA's Regulations shall be considered to be funds owned 
by the borrower and shall be added to any individual accounts of the 
borrower and insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate.
    (b) Funds held by a guardian, custodian, or conservator for the 
benefit of his ward or for the benefit of a minor under a Uniform Gifts 
to Minors Act and deposited in one or more accounts in the name of the 
guardian, custodian, or conservator are insured up to the SMSIA in the 
aggregate, separately from any other accounts of the guardian, 
custodian, conservator, ward, or minor.

Sec. 745.4  Revocable trust accounts.

    (a) For purposes of this part, the term ``revocable trust account'' 
includes a testamentary account, tentative or ``Totten'' trust account, 
``payable-on-death'' account, or any similar account which evidences an 
intention that the funds shall pass on the death of the owner of the 
funds to a named beneficiary.
    (b) If the named beneficiary of a revocable trust account is a 
spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister of the account 
owner, the account shall be insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate as 
to each such beneficiary, separately from any other accounts of the 
owner or beneficiary, regardless of the membership status of the 
beneficiary.
    (c) If the named beneficiary of a revocable trust account is other 
than the spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister of the 
account owner, the funds corresponding to that beneficiary shall be 
treated as an individually owned account of the owner, aggregated with 
any other individually owned accounts of the owner, and insured up to 
the SMSIA. For example, if A establishes an account payable upon death 
to his nephew, the account would be insured as an individual account 
owned by A. Similarly, if B establishes an account payable upon death to 
her husband, son and nephew, two-thirds of the account balance would be 
eligible for revocable trust account coverage up to twice the SMSIA 
corresponding to the two qualifying beneficiaries, the spouse and child. 
The amount corresponding to the non-qualifying beneficiary, the nephew, 
would be deemed to be owned by B as an individual account and insured 
accordingly.
    (d) For purposes of this section, the term ``child'' includes the 
biological, adopted or step-child of the owner; the

[[Page 654]]

term ``grandchild'' includes the biological, adopted or step-child of 
any of the owner's children; the term ``parent'' includes the 
biological, adoptive or step-parent of the owner; the term ``brother'' 
includes a full brother, half brother, brother through adoption or step-
brother; and the term ``sister'' includes a full sister, half sister, 
sister through adoption or step-sister.
    (e) Living Trusts. Insurance treatment under this section also 
applies to revocable trust accounts held in connection with a so-called 
``living trust,'' meaning a formal trust that an owner creates and 
retains control over during his or her lifetime. If a named beneficiary 
in a living trust is a qualifying beneficiary under this section, then 
the share account held in connection with the living trust may be 
eligible for share insurance under this section, assuming compliance 
with all the provisions of this part. This coverage applies only if, at 
the time an insured credit union fails, a qualifying beneficiary would 
be entitled to his or her interest in the trust assets upon the 
grantor's death and that ownership interest would not depend upon the 
death of another beneficiary. If there is more than one grantor, the 
beneficiary's entitlement to the trust assets must be upon the death of 
the last grantor. The coverage provided in this paragraph (e) is 
irrespective of any other conditions in the trust that might prevent a 
beneficiary from acquiring an interest in the share account upon the 
account owner's death. The rules in paragraph (c) of this section on the 
interests of non-qualifying beneficiaries apply to living trust 
accounts. For living trust accounts that provide for a life estate 
interest for designated beneficiaries and a remainder interest for other 
beneficiaries, unless otherwise indicated in the trust, each life estate 
holder and each remainder-man will be deemed to have equal interests in 
the trust assets for share insurance purposes. Coverage will then be 
provided under the rules in this paragraph (e) up to the SMSIA per 
qualifying beneficiary. For a living trust account to qualify for 
coverage provided under this paragraph (e), the records of the credit 
union must reflect that the funds in the account are held pursuant to a 
formal revocable trust, but the credit union's records need not indicate 
the names of the beneficiaries of the living trust or their ownership 
interests in the trust. Effective April 1, 2004, this paragraph (e) will 
apply to all living trust accounts, unless, upon an insured credit union 
failure, a member who established a living trust before April 1, 2004, 
chooses coverage under the previous living trust account rules. For any 
insured credit union failures occurring between February 19, 2004 and 
April 1, 2004, the NCUA will apply the living trust account rules in 
this revised paragraph (e) if doing so would benefit living trust 
account holders of such insured credit union.
    (f) Joint revocable trust accounts. Where an account described in 
paragraph (a) of this section is established by more than one owner and 
held for the benefit of others, some or all of whom are within the 
qualifying degree of kinship, the respective interests of each owner 
held for the benefit of each qualifying beneficiary will be separately 
insured up to the SMSIA. The interest of each co-owner will be deemed 
equal unless otherwise stated in the share account records of the 
federally-insured credit union. Interests held for non-qualifying 
beneficiaries will be added to the individual accounts of the owners. 
Where a husband and a wife establish a revocable trust account naming 
themselves as the sole beneficiaries, the account will not be insured 
according to the provisions of this section, but will instead be insured 
in accordance with the joint account provisions of Sec. 745.8.

Sec. 745.5  Accounts held by executors or administrators.

    Funds of a decedent held in the name of the decedent or in the name

aggregate for all such accounts, separately from the individual accounts

Sec. 745.6  Accounts held by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association.

    Accounts of a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated 
association engaged in any independent activity shall be insured up to 
the SMSIA in the aggregate. The account of a corporation, partnership, 
or unincorporated association not engaged in an independent activity 
shall be deemed to be owned by the person or persons owning such 
corporation or comprising such partnership or unincorporated association 
and, for account insurance purposes, the interest of each person in such 
an account shall be added to any other account individually owned by 
such person and insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate. For purposes 
of this section, ``independent activity'' means an activity other than 
one directed solely at increasing insurance coverage.

<R05>
Sec. 745.7  Shares accepted in a foreign currency.

    An insured credit union may accept shares denominated in a foreign 
currency. Shares denominated in a foreign currency will be insured in 
accordance with this part to the same extent as shares denominated in 
U.S. dollars. Insurance for shares denominated in foreign currency will 
be determined and paid in the amount of United States dollars that is 
equivalent in value to the amount of the shares denominated in the 
foreign currency as of close of business on the date of default of the 
insured credit union. The exchange rates to be used for such conversions 
are the 12 p.m. rates (the ``noon buying rates for cable transfers'') 
quoted for major currencies by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on 
the date of default of the insured credit union, unless the share 
agreement provides that some other widely recognized exchange rates are 
to be used for all purposes under that agreement.

Sec. 745.8  Joint ownership accounts.

    (a) Separate insurance coverage. Qualifying joint accounts, whether 
owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the 
entireties, as tenants in common, or by husband and wife as community 
property, shall be insured separately from accounts individually owned 
by any of the co-owners. The interest of a co-owner in all qualifying 
joint accounts shall be added together and the total for that co-owner 
shall be insured up to the SMSIA.
    (b) Qualifying joint accounts. A joint account is a qualifying joint 
account if each of the co-owners has personally signed a membership or 
account signature card and has a right of withdrawal on the same basis 
as the other co-owners. The signature requirement does not apply to 
share certificates, or to any accounts maintained by an agent, nominee, 
guardian, custodian or conservator on behalf of two or more persons if 
the records of the credit union properly reflect that the account is so 
maintained.
    (c) Failure to qualify. A joint account that does not meet the 
requirements for a qualifying joint account shall be treated as owned by 
the named persons as individuals and the actual ownership interest of 
each such person in such account shall be added to any other accounts 
individually owned by such person and insured up to the SMSIA in the 
aggregate. An account will not fail to qualify as a joint account if a 
joint owner is a minor and applicable state law limits or restricts a 
minor's withdrawal rights.
    (d) Nonmember joint owners. A nonmember may become a joint owner 
with a member on a joint account with right of survivorship. The 
nonmember's interest in such accounts will be insured in the same manner 
as the member joint-owner's interest.

Sec. 745.9-1  Trust accounts.

    (b) All trust interests (as defined in Sec. 745.2(d)(4)), for the 
same beneficiary, deposited in an account and established

[[Page 656]]

shall be added together and insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate, 
separately from other accounts of the trustee of such trust funds or the 
settlor or beneficiary of such trust arrangements.
    (c) This section applies to trust interests created in Coverdell 
Education Savings Accounts, formerly Education IRAs, established in 
connection with section 530 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.

Sec. 745.9-2  Retirement and other employee benefit plan accounts.

    (a) Pass-through share insurance. Any shares of an employee benefit 
plan in an insured credit union shall be insured on a ``pass-through'' 
basis, in the amount of up to the SMSIA for the non-contingent interest 
of each plan participant, in accordance with Sec. 745.2 of this part. 
An insured credit union that is not ``well capitalized'' or ``adequately 
capitalized'', as those terms are defined in 12 U.S.C. 1790d(c), may not 
accept employee benefit plan deposits. The terms ``employee benefit 
plan'' and ``pass-through share insurance'' are given the same meaning 
in this section as in 12 U.S.C. 1787(k)(4).
    (b) Treatment of contingent interests. In the event that 
participants' interests in an employee benefit plan are not capable of 
evaluation in accordance with the provisions of this section, or an 
account established for any such plan includes amounts for future 
participants in the plan, payment by the NCUA with respect to all such 
interests shall not exceed the SMSIA in the aggregate.
    (c)(1) Certain retirement accounts. Shares in an insured credit 
union made in connection with the following types of retirement plans 
shall be aggregated and insured in the amount of up to $250,000 (which 
amount shall be subject to inflation adjustments as provided under 
section 11(a)(1)(F) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, except that 
$250,000 shall be substituted for $100,000 wherever such term appears in 
such section) per account:
    (i) Any individual retirement account described in section 408(a) 
(IRA) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 408(a)) or similar 
provisions of law applicable to a U.S. territory or possession;
    (ii) Any individual retirement account described in section 408A 
(Roth IRA) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 408A) or similar 
provisions of law applicable to a U.S. territory or possession; and
    (iii) Any plan described in section 401(d) (Keogh account) of the 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401(d)) or similar provisions of law 
applicable to a U.S. territory or possession.
    (2) Insurance coverage for the accounts enumerated in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section is based on the present vested ascertainable 
interest of a participant or designated beneficiary. For insurance 
purposes, IRA and Roth IRA accounts will be combined together and 
insured in the aggregate up to $250,000 (which amount shall be subject 
to inflation adjustments as provided under section 11(a)(1)(F) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, except that $250,000 shall be substituted 
for $100,000 wherever such term appears in such section). A Keogh 
account will be separately insured from an IRA account, Roth IRA account 
or, where applicable, aggregated IRA and Roth IRA accounts.

    (ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and 
regular share accounts;

lawfully investing the same in a federally-insured credit union in the 
District of Columbia will be separately insured in the amount of:
    (i) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share draft accounts; 
and
    (ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and 
regular share accounts;
    (4) Each official custodian of funds of the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, or any territory or possession of the 
United States, or any county, municipality, or political subdivision 
thereof lawfully investing the same in a federally-insured credit union 
in Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, or any such territory or 
possession, respectively, will be separately insured in the amount of:
    (i) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share draft accounts; 
and
    (ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and 
regular share accounts;
    (5) Each official custodian of tribal funds of any Indian tribe (as 
defined in section 3(c) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974) or agency 
thereof lawfully investing the same in a federally-insured credit union 
will be separately insured in the amount of:
    (i) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share draft accounts; 
and
    (ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and 
regular share accounts;
    (b) Each official custodian referred to in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), 
and (4) of this section lawfully investing such funds in share accounts 
in a federally-insured credit union outside of their respective 
jurisdictions shall be separately insured up to the SMSIA in the 
aggregate for all such accounts regardless of whether they are share 
draft, share certificate or regular share accounts.
    (c) For purposes of this section, if the same person is an official 
custodian of more than one public unit, he shall be separately insured 
with respect to the public funds held by him for each such unit, but he 
shall not be separately insured with respect to all public funds of the 
same public unit by virtue of holding different offices in such unit or 
by holding such funds for different purposes. Where an officer, agent or 
employee of a public unit has custody of certain funds which by law or 
under a bond indenture are required to be set aside to discharge a debt 
owed to the holders of notes or bonds issued by the public unit, any 
investment of such funds in an account in a federally-insured credit 
union will be deemed to be a share account established by a trustee of 
trust funds of which the noteholders or bondholders are pro rata 
beneficiaries, and the beneficial interest of each noteholder or 
bondholder in the share account will be separately insured up to the 
SMSIA.
    (d) For purposes of this section, ``lawfully investing'' means 
pursuant to the statutory or regulatory authority of the custodian or 
public unit.

Sec. 745.11  Accounts evidenced by negotiable instruments.

    If any insured account obligation of a credit union is evidenced by 
a negotiable certificate account, negotiable draft, negotiable cashier's 
or officer's check, negotiable certified check, or negotiable traveler's 
check or letter of credit, the owner of such account obligation will be 
recognized for all purposes of a claim for insured accounts to the same 
extent as if his name and interest were disclosed on the records of the 
credit union provided the instrument was in fact negotiated to such 
owner prior to the date of the closing of the credit union. Affirmative 
proof of such negotiation must be offered in all cases to substantiate 
the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 745.12  Account obligations for payment of items forwarded for collection by depository institution acting as agent.

    Where a closed credit union has become obligated for the payment of 
items forwarded for collection by a depository institution acting solely 
as agent, the owner of such items will be recognized for all purposes of 
a claim

[[Page 658]]

for insured accounts to the same extent as if his name and interest were 
disclosed on the records of the credit union when such claim for insured 
accounts, if otherwise payable, has been established by the execution 
and delivery of prescribed forms. Such depository institution forwarding 
such items for the owners thereof will be recognized as agent for such 
owners for the purpose of making an assignment of the rights of such 
owners against the closed insured credit union to the Board and for the 
purpose of receiving payment on behalf of such owners.

accomplished by placing either a copy of part 745 of these rules, the 
appendix, or one or more copies of the NCUA brochure ``Your Insured 
Funds'' in each branch office and main office of the credit union. 
Copies of these materials shall also be made available to members upon 
request. For purposes of this section, an automated teller machine or 
point of sale terminal is not a branch office.

    Source: 55 FR 5586, Feb. 16, 1990, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 745.200  General.

    (a) Payment. In the event of the liquidation of an insured credit 
union, the Board will promptly determine the insured accountholders 
thereof and the amount of the insured account or accounts of each such 
accountholder. Payment may be in cash, or its equivalent, or may be made 
by making available to each accountholder a transferred account in a new 
federally-insured credit union in the same community or in another 
federally-insured credit union or institution in an amount equal to the 
accountholder's insured account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
Board may withhold payment of such portion of the insured account of any 
member as may be required to provide for payment of any direct or 
indirect liability to the closed credit union or the liquidating agent, 
which is not offset against a claim due from such credit union, pending 
the determination and payment of such liability by the member of or any 
person liable therefor.
    (b) Amount of insurance. The amount of insurance on an insured 
account shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Subpart 
A of this part and the Federal Credit Union Act. For the purpose of 
determining insurance coverage, dividends earned in the ordinary course 
of business and posted to share accounts for any prior accounting or 
dividend period shall be deemed to be principal under this part. 
Dividends earned or accrued in the ordinary course of business, but not 
posted to share accounts, may be paid at the discretion of the 
liquidating agent. In making such determination, the liquidating agent 
will take into consideration whether the failure to post dividends 
earned or accrued was due to the fraud, embezzlement or accounting 
errors of credit union personnel. The liquidating agent may require an 
accountholder to submit documentation supporting any claim for unposted 
dividends not otherwise evidenced in the credit union records. However, 
in no event will dividend amounts be considered as principal for 
insurance purposes pursuant to this section if not consistent with the 
amounts paid on similar classes of shares.
    (c) Multiple accounts. In the event an insured member holds more 
than one insured account in the same capacity, and the aggregate amount 
of such accounts (including share draft accounts held in such capacity) 
exceeds the amount of insurance afforded thereon, the insurance coverage 
will be prorated among the member's interest in all accounts held in the 
same capacity. In the case of individual accounts, the insurance 
proceeds shall be paid to the holder of the account, whether or not the 
holder is the beneficial owner. In the case of accounts which are owned 
jointly, the insurance proceeds shall be paid to the owners jointly. In 
the case of trust estates, the insurance proceeds shall be paid to the 
indicated trustee unless otherwise provided for in the

[[Page 659]]

trust instrument or under state law. In the case of corporations, 
partnerships and unincorporated associations engaged in an independent 
activity, the insurance proceeds shall be paid to the indicated holder 
of the account. Where insurance payment is in the form of a transferred 
account to another insured institution, the same rules shall be applied.
    (d) Computing time. In computing any period of time prescribed by 
this subpart, the provisions of Sec. 747.12(a) shall apply.

uninsured, the Liquidating Agent shall so notify the accountholder in 
writing, stating the reason(s) for such initial determination, and shall 
provide the accountholder with a certificate of claim in liquidation in 
the amount of the uninsured account from the Board in its capacity as 
Liquidating Agent for the insured credit union to enable the 
accountholder to share in the proceeds of the liquidation of the credit 
union, if any, up to the amount of the uninsured account.
    (c) Request for reconsideration. An accountholder may, at his or her 
option, request reconsideration from the Liquidating Agent of the 
initial determination within 30 days of the date of the initial 
determination, or directly appeal the initial determination to the Board 
pursuant to Sec. 745.202 of this subpart. The Liquidating Agent shall 
act on the request for reconsideration within 30 days from its receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 745.202  Appeal.

    (a) Time for filing. Within 60 days after issuance of an initial 
determination, or of the determination on a request for reconsideration 
by the liquidating agent, the accountholder may appeal by filing with 
the Board a written request for appeal. The appeal may be filed with the 
Secretary of the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke 
Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3428.
    (b) Content of request. Any appeal must include:
    (1) A statement of the facts on which the claim for insurance is 
based;
    (2) A statement of the basis for the initial determination or 
determination on the request for reconsideration to which the 
accountholder objects and the alleged error in such determination, 
including citations to applicable statutes and regulations;
    (3) Any other evidence relied upon by the accountholder which was 
not previously provided to the Liquidating Agent.
    (c) Procedures for review of request. (1) Within 60 days of the date 
of the Board's receipt of an appeal, the Board may request in writing 
that the accountholder submit additional facts and records in support of 
its request. The accountholder shall have 45 days from the date of 
issuance of such written request to provide such additional information. 
Failure by the accountholder to provide additional information may, as 
determined solely by the Board, result in denial of the accountholder's 
appeal.
    (2) Within 60 days from the date of the Board's receipt of an 
appeal, the accountholder may amend or supplement the request in 
writing. In the event that the accountholder does amend or supplement 
the request, the provisons of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with 
respect to requests for additional information and responses to such 
requests shall apply with equal force to any such amendment or 
supplement to a request.
    (d) Determination on appeal. (1) Within 180 days from the date of 
the receipt of an appeal by the Board, the Board shall issue a decision 
determining the extent of the accountholder's insurance pursuant to the 
rules of this part.

[[Page 660]]

    (2) The determination by the Board on appeal shall be provided to 
the accountholder in writing, stating the reason(s) for the 
determination, and shall constitute a final Agency order regarding the 
accountholder's claim for insurance.
    (3) If the Board determines that the accountholder is entitled to 
the amount of insurance claimed or a portion thereof, upon payment of 
such insurance the accountholder shall promptly surrender to the Board 
the certificate of claim in liquidation provided in connection with the 
initial determination. In the event that the Board determines that the 
accountholder is only entitled to a portion of the amount of insurance 
claimed, upon the accountholder's surrender of such certificate a new 
certificate of claim in liquidation will be provided which reflects the 
revised amount of the uninsured account.
    (4) Failure by the Board to issue a determination on appeal of the 
accountholder's claim for insurance within the 180-day period provided 
for under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall be deemed to be a 
denial of such claim for purposes of Sec. 745.203 of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 745.203  Judicial review.

    (a) For purposes of seeking judicial review of actions taken 
pursuant to this subpart, only a determination on appeal issued by the 
Board pursuant to Sec. 745.202 of this subpart shall constitute a final 
determination regarding an accountholder's claim for insurance.
    (b) Failure to file an appeal with regard to an initial 
determination, or a decision rendered on a request for reconsideration 
with the applicable time periods shall constitute a failure by the 
accountholder to exhaust available administrative remedies and, due to 
such failure, any objections to the initial determination or request for 
reconsideration shall be deemed to be waived and such determination 
shall be deemed to have been accepted by, and binding upon, the 
accountholder.
    (c) Final determination by the Board is reviewable in accordance 
with the provisions of chapter 7, title 5, United States Code, by the 
United States district court for the Federal judicial district where the 
credit union's principal place of business is located. Such action must 
be filed not later than 60 days after such final determination is 
ordered.

   Sec. Appendix to Part 745--Examples of Insurance Coverage Afforded 
  Accounts in Credit Unions Insured by the National Credit Union Share 
                             Insurance Fund

                  What Is the Purpose of This Appendix?

    The following examples illustrate insurance coverage on accounts 
maintained in the same federally-insured credit union. They are intended 
to cover various types of ownership interests and combinations of 
accounts which may occur in connection with funds invested in insured 
credit unions. These examples interpret the rules for insurance of 
accounts contained in 12 CFR part 745.
    The examples, as well as the rules which they interpret, are 
predicated upon the assumption that: (1) Invested funds are actually 
owned in the manner indicated on the credit union's records and (2) the 
owner of funds in an account is a credit union member or otherwise 
eligible to maintain an insured account in a credit union. If available 
evidence shows that ownership is different from that on the 
institution's records, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund 
may pay claims for insured accounts on the basis of actual rather than 
ostensible ownership. Further, the examples and the rules which they 
interpret do not extend insurance coverage to persons otherwise not 
entitled to maintain an insured account or to account relationships that 
have not been approved by the Board as an insured account.

              A. How Are Single Ownership Accounts Insured?

    All funds owned by an individual member (or, in a community property 
state, by the husband-wife community of which the individual is a 
member) and invested in one or more individual accounts are added 
together and insured to the $100,000 maximum. This is true whether the 
accounts are maintained in the name of the individual member owning the 
funds, in the name of the member's agent or nominee, or in a custodial 
loan account on behalf of the member as a borrower. (Sec. 745.3(a) (1), 
(2) and (3).) All such accounts are added together and insured as one 
individual account. Funds held in one or more accounts in the name of a 
guardian, custodian, or conservator for the benefit of a ward

[[Page 661]]

or minor are added together and insured up to $100,000. However, such an 
account or accounts will not be added to any other individual accounts 
of the guardian, custodian, conservator, ward, or minor for purposes of 
determining insurance coverage. (Sec. 745.3(b).)

                                Example 1

    Question: Members A and B, husband and wife, each maintain an 
individual account containing $100,000. In addition, they hold a joint 
account containing $100,000. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Each account is separately insured up to $100,000, for a 
total coverage of $300,000. The coverage would be the same whether the 
individual accounts contain funds owned as community property or as 
individual property of the spouses (Sec. 745.3(a)(1) and Sec. 
745.8(a)).

                                Example 2

    Question: Members H and W, husband and wife, reside in a community 
property state. H maintains a $100,000 account consisting of his 
separately-owned funds and invests $100,000 of community property funds 
in another account, both of which are in his name alone. What is the 
insurance coverage?
    Answer: The two accounts are added together and insured to a total 
of $100,000. $100,000 is uninsured (Sec. 745.3(a)(1)).

                                Example 3

    Question: Member A has $92,500 invested in an individual account, 
and his agent, Member B, invests $25,000 of A's funds in a properly 
designated agency account. B also holds a $100,000 individual account. 
What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: A's individual account and the agency account are added 
together and insured to the $100,000 maximum, leaving $17,500 uninsured. 
The investment of funds through an agent does not result in additional 
insurance coverage for the principal (Sec. 745.3(a)(2)). B's individual 
account is insured separately from the agency account (Sec. 
745.3(a)(1)). However, if the account records of the credit union do not 
show the agency relationship under which the funds in the $25,000 
account are held, the $25,000 in B's name could, at the option of the 
NCUSIF, be added to his individual account and insured to $100,000 in 
the aggregate, leaving $25,000 uninsured (Sec. 745.2(c)).

                                Example 4

    Question: Member A holds a $100,000 individual account. Member B 
holds two accounts in his own name, the first containing $25,000 and the 
second containing $92,500. In processing the claims for payment of 
insurance on these accounts, the NCUSIF discovers that the funds in the 
$25,000 account actually belong to A and that B had invested these funds 
as agent for A, his undisclosed principal. What is the insurance 
coverage?
    Answer: Since the available evidence shows that A is the actual 
owner of the funds in the $25,000 account, those funds would be added to 
the $100,000 individual account held by A (rather than to B's $92,500 
account) and insured to the $100,000 maximum, leaving $25,000 uninsured. 
(Sec. 745.3(a)(2).) B's $92,500 individual account would be separately 
insured.

                                Example 5

    Question: Member C, a minor, maintains an individual account of 
$750. C's grandfather makes a gift to him of $100,000, which is invested 
in another account by C's father, designated on the credit union's 
records as custodian under a Uniform Gift to Minors Act. C's father, 
also a member, maintains an individual account of $100,000. What is the 
insurance coverage?
    Answer: C's individual account and the custodian account held for 
him by his father are each separately insured: The $100,000 maximum on 
the custodian account, and $750 on his individual account. The 
individual account held by C's father is also separately insured to the 
$100,000 maximum. (Sec. 745.3 (a)(1) and (b).)

                                Example 6

    Question: Member G, a court-appointed guardian, invests in a 
properly designated account $100,000 of funds in his custody which 
belong to member W, his ward. W and G each maintain $25,000 individual 
accounts. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: W's individual account and the guardianship account in G's 
name are each insured to $100,000 providing W with $125,000 in insured 
funds. G's individual account is also separately insured. (Sec. 745.3 
(a)(1) and (b).)

                                Example 7

    Question: X Credit Union acts as a servicer of FHA, VA, and 
conventional mortgage loans made to its members but sold to other 
parties. Each month X receives loan payments, for remittance to the 
other parties, from approximately 2,000 member mortgagors. The monies 
received each month total $1,000,000 and are maintained in a custodial 
loan account. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: X Credit Union acts as custodian for the 2,000 individual 
mortgagors. The interest of each mortgagor is separately insured as his 
individual account (but added to any other individual accounts which the 
mortgagor holds in the Credit Union) (Sec. 745.3(a)(3)).

              B. How Are Revocable Trust Accounts Insured?

    The term ``revocable trust account'' includes a testamentary 
account, tentative or

[[Page 662]]

``Totten'' trust account, ``payable-on-death'' account, or any similar 
account which evidences an intention that the funds shall pass on the 
death of the owner of the funds to a named beneficiary. If the named 
beneficiary is a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister 
(as defined in subsection 745.4(d)) of the owner, the funds in all such 
accounts are insured for the owner up to $100,000 in the aggregate as to 
each such beneficiary. If the named beneficiary of a revocable trust 
account is other than the spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother or 
sister of the account owner, the funds corresponding to that beneficiary 
shall be treated as an individually owned account of the owner, 
aggregated with any other individually owned accounts of the owner, and 
insured up to $100,000. If a revocable trust account is held in the name 
of a fiduciary other than the owner of the funds, any other accounts 
held by the fiduciary are insured separately from such revocable trust 
account.

                                Example 1

    Question: Member H invests $200,000 in a revocable trust account 
with his son, S, and his daughter, D, as named beneficiaries. What is 
the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Since S and D are children of H, the owner of the account, 
the funds are insured up to $100,000 as to each beneficiary (Sec. 
745.4(b)). Assuming that S and D have equal beneficial interests 
($100,000 each), H is fully insured for this account.

                                Example 2

    Question: Member H invests $100,000 in each of four ``payable-on-
death'' accounts. Under the terms of each account contract, H has the 
right to withdraw any or all of the funds in the account at any time. 
Any funds remaining in the account at the time of H's death are to be 
paid to a named beneficiary. The respective beneficiaries of the four 
accounts are H's wife, his mother, his brother, and his nephew. H also 
holds an individual account containing $100,000. What is the insurance 
coverage?
    Answer: The accounts payable on death to H's wife, mother and 
brother are each separately insured to the $100,000 maximum (Sec. 
745.4(b)). The account payable to H's nephew is added to H's individual 
account and insured to $100,000 in the aggregate, leaving $100,000 
uninsured (Sec. 745.4(c)).

                                Example 3

    Question: Member H and W jointly invest in a ``payable-on-death'' 
account for the benefit of their son, S, and daughter, D. The account is 
held by H and W with right of survivorship. What is the maximum 
insurance coverage available on the account?
    Answer: Since S and D are the children of H and W, the account will 
be insured up to $100,000 as to each beneficiary separately from any 
accounts of the owner, H and W (Sec. 745.4(b)). H would be entitled to 
$100,000 insurance for S and $100,000 for D. W would be entitled to the 
same coverage for a total of $400,000 on the account. However, upon the 
death of either H or W, insurance coverage would be reduced to $200,000.

                                Example 4

    Question: Member H invests $200,000 in a revocable trust account 
held in connection with a living trust with his son, S, and his 
daughter, D, as named beneficiaries. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Since S and D are children of H, the owner of the account, 
the funds would normally be insured under the rules governing revocable 
trust accounts up to $100,000 as to each beneficiary, (Sec. 745.4(b)). 
However, because this account is held in connection with a living trust 
whose named beneficiaries are qualifying beneficiaries under Sec. 
745.4, it must be scrutinized to determine whether the account complies 
with all other provisions of this part. Assuming that the account 
complies with all other requirements of this part, then it will be 
treated as any other revocable trust. In this instance, it will be 
insured up to $100,000 as to each beneficiary (Sec. 745.4(e)). Assuming 
that S and D have equal beneficial interests ($100,000 each), H is fully 
insured for this account.

                                Example 5

    Question: H creates a living trust providing for his wife to have a 
life estate interest in the trust assets with the remaining assets going 
to their two children upon the wife's death. The assets in the trust are 
$300,000 and a living trust share account is opened for that full 
amount. What is the coverage amount?
    Answer: Unless otherwise indicated in the trust, each beneficiary 
(all of whom here are qualifying beneficiaries) would be deemed to own 
an equal share of the $300,000; hence, the full amount would be insured. 
This result would be the same even if the wife has the power to invade 
the principal of the trust, inasmuch as defeating contingencies are not 
relevant for insurance purposes.

    C. How Are Accounts Held by Executors or Administrators Insured?

    All funds belonging to a decedent and invested in one or more 
accounts, whether held in the name of the decedent or in the name of his 
executor or administrator, are added together and insured to the 
$100,000 maximum. Such funds are insured separately from the individual 
accounts of any of the beneficiaries of the estate or of the executor or 
administrator.

[[Page 663]]

                                Example 1

    Question: Member A, administrator of Member D's estate, sells D's 
automobile and invests the proceeds of $12,500 in an account entitled 
``A Administrator of the estate of D.'' A has an individual account in 
that same credit union containing $100,000. Prior to his death, D had 
opened an individual account of $100,000. What is the insurance 
coverage?
    Answer: The $12,500 is added to D's individual account and insured 
to $100,000, leaving $12,500 uninsured. A's individual account is 
separately insured for $100,000 (Sec. 745.5).

D. How Are Accounts Held by a Corporation, Partnership or Unincorporated 
                          Association Insured?

    All funds invested in an account or accounts by a corporation, a 
partnership or an unincorporated association engaged in any independent 
activity are added together and insured to the $100,000 maximum. The 
term ``independent activity'' means any activity other than the one 
directed solely at increasing coverage. If the corporation, partnership 
or unincorporated association is not engaged in an independent activity, 
any account held by the entity is insured as if owned by the persons 
owning or comprising the entity, and the imputed interest of each such 
person is added for insurance purposes to any individual account which 
he maintains.

                                Example 1

    Question: Member X Corporation maintains a $100,000 account. The 
stock of the corporation is owned by members A, B, C, and D in equal 
shares. Each of these stockholders also maintains an individual account 
of $100,000 with the same credit union. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Each of the five accounts would be separately insured to 
$100,000 if the corporation is engaged in an independent activity and 
has not been established merely for the purpose of increasing insurance 
coverage. The same would be true if the business were operated as a bona 
fide partnership instead of as a corporation (Sec. 745.6). However, if 
X corporation was not engaged in an independent activity, then $25,000 
(\1/4\ interest) would be added to each account of A, B, C, and D. The 
accounts of A, B, C, and D would then each be insured to $100,000, 
leaving $25,000 in each account uninsured.

                                Example 2

    Question: Member C College maintains three separate accounts with 
the same credit union under the titles: ``General Operating Fund,'' 
``Teachers Salaries,'' and ``Building Fund.'' What is the insurance 
coverage?
    Answer: Since all of the funds are the property of the college, the 
three accounts are added together and insured only to the $100,000 
maximum (Sec. 745.6).

                                Example 3

    Question: The men's club of X Church carries on various social 
activities in addition to holding several fund-raising campaigns for the 
church each year. The club is supported by membership dues. Both the 
club and X Church maintain member accounts in the same credit union. 
What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: The men's club is an unincorporated association engaged in 
an independent activity. If the club funds are, in fact, legally owned 
by the club itself and not the church, each account is separately 
insured to the $100,000 maximum (Sec. 745.6).

                                Example 4

    Question: The PQR Union, a member of the ABC Federal Credit Union, 
has three locals in a certain city. Each of the locals maintains an 
account containing funds belonging to the parent organization. All three 
accounts are in the same insured credit union. What is the insurance 
coverage?
    Answer: The three accounts are added together and insured up to the 
$100,000 maximum (Sec. 745.6).

       E. How Are Accounts Held by Government Depositors Insured?

    For insurance purposes, the official custodian of funds belonging to 
a public unit, rather than the public unit itself, is insured as the 
account holder. All funds belonging to a public unit and invested by the 
same custodian in a federally-insured credit union are categorized as 
either share draft accounts or share certificate and regular share 
accounts. If these accounts are invested in a federally-insured credit 
union located in the jurisdiction from which the official custodian 
derives his authority, then the share draft accounts will be insured 
separately from the share certificate and regular share accounts. Under 
this circumstance, all share draft accounts are added together and 
insured to the $100,000 maximum and all share certificate and regular 
share accounts are also added together and separately insured up to the 
$100,000 maximum. If, however, these accounts are invested in a 
federally-insured credit union located outside of the jurisdiction from 
which the official custodian derives his authority, then insurance 
coverage is limited to $100,000 for all accounts regardless of whether 
they are share draft, share certificate or regular share accounts. If 
there is more than one official custodian for the same public unit, the 
funds invested by each custodian are separately insured. If the same 
person is custodian of funds for more than one public unit, he is 
separately insured with respect to the funds of each unit held by him in 
properly designated accounts.
    For insurance purposes, a ``political subdivision'' is entitled to 
the same insurance

[[Page 664]]

coverage as any other public unit. ``Political subdivision'' includes 
any subdivision of a public unit or any principal department of such 
unit: (1) The creation of which has been expressly authorized by state 
statute, (2) to which some functions of government have been allocated 
by state statute, and (3) to which funds have been allocated by statute 
or ordinance for its exclusive use and control.

                                Example 1

    Question: As Comptroller of Y Consolidated School District, A 
maintains a $125,000 account in the credit union containing school 
district funds. He also maintains his own $100,000 member account in the 
same credit union. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: The two accounts will be separately insured, assuming the 
credit union's records indicate that the account containing the school 
district funds is held by A in a fiduciary capacity. Thus, $100,000 of 
the school's funds and the entire $100,000 in A's personal account will 
be insured (Sec. 745.10(a)(2) and Sec. 745.3).

                                Example 2

    Question: A, as city treasurer, and B, as chief of the city police 
department, each have $100,000 in city funds invested in custodial 
accounts. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Assuming that both A and B have offical custody of the city 
funds, each account is separately insured to the $100,000 maximum (Sec. 
745.10(a)(2)).

                                Example 3

    Question: A is Treasurer of X County and collects certain tax 
assessments, a portion of which must be paid to the state under 
statutory requirement. A maintains an account for general funds of the 
county and establishes a separate account for the funds which belong to 
the State Treasurer. The credit union's records indicate that the 
separate account contains funds held for the State. What is the 
insurance coverage?
    Answer: Since two public units own the funds held by A, the accounts 
would each be separately insured to the $100,000 maximum (Sec. 
745.10(a)(2)).

                                Example 4

    Question: A city treasurer invests city funds in each of the 
following accounts: ``General Operating Account,'' ``School 
Transportation Fund,'' ``Local Maintenance Fund,'' and ``Payroll Fund.'' 
Each account is available to the custodian upon demand. By 
administrative direction, the city treasurer has allocated the funds for 
the use of and control by separate departments of the city. What is the 
insurance coverage?
    Answer: All of the accounts are added together and insured in the 
aggregate to $100,000. Because the allocation of the city's funds is not 
by statute or ordinance for the specific use of and control by separate 
departments of the city, separate insurance coverage to the maximum of 
$100,000 is not afforded to each account (Sec. Sec. 745.1(d) and 
745.10(a)(2)).

                                Example 5

    Question: A, the custodian of retirement funds of a military 
exchange, invests $1,000,000 in an account in an insured credit union. 
The military exchange, a non-appropriated fund instrumentally of the 
United States, is deemed to be a public unit. The employees of the 
exchange are the beneficiaries of the retirement funds but are not 
members of the credit union. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Because A invested the funds on behalf of a public unit, in 
his capacity as custodian, those funds qualify for $100,000 share 
insurance even though A and the public unit are not within the credit 
union's field of membership. Since the beneficiaries are neither public 
units nor members of the credit union they are not entitled to separate 
share insurance. Therefore, $900,000 is uninsured (Sec. 745.10(a)(1)).

                                Example 6

    Question: A is the custodian of the County's employee retirement 
funds. He deposits $1,000,000 in retirement funds in an account in an 
insured credit union. The ``beneficiaries'' of the retirement fund are 
not themselves public units nor are they within the credit union's field 
of membership. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Because A invested the funds on behalf of a public unit, in 
his capacity as custodian, those funds qualify for $100,000 share 
insurance even though A and the public unit are not within the credit 
union's field of membership. Since the beneficiaries are neither public 
units nor members of the credit union they are not entitled to separate 
share insurance. Therefore, $900,000 is uninsured (Sec. 745.10(a)(2)).

                                Example 7

    Question: A county treasurer establishes the following share draft 
accounts in an insured credit union each with $100,000:

    ``General Operating Fund''
    ``County Roads Department Fund''
    ``County Water District Fund''
    ``County Public Improvement District Fund''
    ``County Emergency Fund''
What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: The ``County Roads Department,'' ``County Water District'' 
and ``County Public Improvement District'' accounts would

[[Page 665]]

each be separately insured to $100,000 if the funds in each such account 
have been allocated by law for the exclusive use of a separate county 
department or subdivision expressly authorized by State statute. Funds 
in the ``General Operating'' and ``Emergency Fund'' accounts would be 
added together and insured in the aggregate to $100,000, if such funds 
are for countywide use and not for the exclusive use of any subdivision 
or principal department of the county, expressly authorized by State 
statute (Sec. Sec. 745.1(d) and 745.10(a)(2)).

                                Example 8

    Question: A, the custodian of Indian tribal funds, lawfully invests 
$1,000,000 in an account in an insured credit union on behalf of 15 
different tribes; the records of the credit union show that no tribe's 
interest exceeds $100,000. A, as official custodian, also invests 
$1,000,000 in the same credit union on behalf of 100 individual Indians, 
who are not members; each Indian's interest is $10,000. What is the 
insurance coverage?
    Answer: Because each tribe is considered a separate public unit, the 
custodian of each tribe, even though the same person, is entitled to 
separate insurance for each tribe (Sec. 745.10(a)(5)). Since the credit 
union's records indicate no tribe has more than $100,000 in the account, 
the $1,000,000 would be fully insured as 15 separate tribal accounts. If 
any one tribe had more than a $100,000 interest in the funds, it would 
be insured only to $100,000 and any excess would be uninsured.
    However, the $1,000,000 invested on behalf of the individual indians 
would not be insured since the individual indians are neither public 
units nor, in the example, members of the credit union. If A is the 
custodian of the funds in his capacity as an official of a governmental 
body that qualified as a public unit, then the account would be insured 
for $100,000, leaving $900,000 uninsured.

                                Example 9

    Question: A, an official custodian of funds of a state of the United 
States, lawfully invests $250,000 of state funds in a federally-insured 
credit union located in the state from which he derives his authority as 
an official custodian. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: If A invested the entire $250,000 in a share draft account, 
then $100,000 would be insured and $150,000 would be uninsured. If A 
invested $125,000 in share draft accounts and another $125,000 in share 
certificate and regular share accounts, then A would be insured for 
$100,000 for the share draft accounts and $100,000 for the share 
certificate and regular share accounts leaving $50,000 uninsured (Sec. 
745.10(a)(2)). If A had invested the $250,000 in a federally-insured 
credit union located outside the state from which he derives his 
authority as an official custodian, then $100,000 would be insured for 
all accounts regardless of whether they were share draft, share 
certificate or regular share accounts, leaving $150,000 uninsured (Sec. 
745.10(b)).

                   F. How Are Joint Accounts Insured?

    The interest of a co-owner in all accounts held under any form of 
joint ownership valid under state law (whether as joint tenants with 
right of survivorship, tenants by the entireties, tenants in common, or 
by husband and wife as community property) is insured up to $100,000. 
This insurance is separate from that afforded individual accounts held 
by any of the co-owners.
    An account is insured as a joint account only if each of the co-
owners has personally signed a membership card or an account signature 
card and possesses the same withdrawal rights as the other co-owners. 
(The signature requirement does not apply to share certificates, or to 
any accounts maintained by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian or 
conservator on behalf of two or more persons. However, the records of 
the credit union must show that the account is being maintained for 
joint owners. There is also another exception in the case of a minor 
discussed below.) An account owned jointly which does not qualify as a 
joint account for insurance purposes is insured as if owned by the named 
persons as individuals. In that case, the actual ownership interest in 
the account of each person is added to any other accounts individually 
owned by such person and insured up to $100,000 in the aggregate.
    Any individual, including a minor, may be a co-owner of a joint 
account. Although, generally, each co-owner must have signed an account 
signature card and must have the same rights of withdrawal as other co-
owners in order for the account to qualify for separate joint account 
insurance, there is an exception for minors. If state law limits or 
restricts a minor's withdrawal rights--for example, a minimum age 
requirement to make a withdrawal--the account will still be insured as a 
joint account.
    The interests of a co-owner in all joint accounts that qualify for 
separate insurance coverage are insured up to the $100,000 maximum. For 
insurance purposes, the co-owners of any joint account are deemed to 
have equal interests in the account, except in the case of a tenancy in 
common. With a tenancy in common, equal interests are presumed unless 
otherwise stated on the records of the credit union.

                                Example 1

    Question: Members A and B maintain an account as joint tenants with 
right of survivorship and, in addition, each holds an individual 
account. Is each account separately insured?

[[Page 666]]

    Answer: If both A and B have signed the membership or signature card 
and possess equal withdrawal rights with respect to the joint funds, 
their interests in the joint account are separately insured from their 
interests in the individual accounts. (Sec. 745.8 (a) and (b).) If the 
joint account is represented by a share certificate, their individual 
signatures are not required for that account.

                                Example 2

    Question: Members H and W, husband and wife, reside in a community 
property state. Each holds an individual account and, in addition, they 
hold a qualifying joint account. The funds in all three accounts consist 
of community property. Is each account separately insured?
    Answer: Yes. An account in the individual name of a spouse will be 
insured up to $100,000 whether the funds consist of community property 
or separate property of the spouse. A joint account containing community 
property is separately insured. Thus, community property can be used for 
individual accounts in the name of each spouse and for a joint account 
in the name of both spouses. In this example, each individual account is 
insured up to $100,000 (Sec. 745.3(a)(1)), and the interests of both 
the husband and wife in the joint account are each insured up to 
$100,000 (Sec. 745.8(a)).

                                Example 3

    Question: Two accounts of $100,000 each are held by a member husband 
and his wife under the following names: John Doe and Mary Doe, husband 
and wife, as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Mrs. John Doe and 
John Q. Doe (community property). How much insurance do the husband and 
wife have?
    Answer: They have $200,000 of insurance. Both the husband and wife 
are deemed to have a one half interest ($50,000) in each account. (Sec. 
745.2(c)(4).) The husband's interest in both accounts would be added 
together and insured for $100,000. The wife's insurance coverage would 
be determined the same way. (Sec. 745.8(a).)

                                Example 4

    Question: The following accounts are held by members A, B and C, 
each of whom has personally executed signature cards for the accounts in 
which he has an interest. Each co-owner of a joint account possesses the 
necessary withdrawals rights.

1. A, as an individual--$100,000.
2. B, as an individual--$100,000.
3. C, as an individual--$100,000.
4. A and B, as joint tenants w/r/o survivorship--$90,000.
5. A and C, as joint tenants w/r/o survivorship--$90,000.
6. B and C, as joint tenants w/r/o survivorship--$90,000.
7. A, B and C, as joint tenants w/r/o survivorship--$90,000.

    What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Accounts numbered 1, 2 and 3 are each separately insured for 
$100,000 as individual accounts held by A, B and C, respectively (Sec. 
745.3(a)(1)). The interest of the co-owners of each joint account are 
deemed equal for insurance purposes (Sec. 745.2(c)(4)). A's interest in 
accounts numbered 4, 5, and 7 are added together for insurance purposes 
(Sec. 745.8(e)). Thus, A has an interest of $45,000 in account No. 4, 
$45,000 in account No. 5 and $30,000 in account No. 7, for a total joint 
account interest of $120,000, of which $100,000 is insured. The interest 
of B and C are similarly insured.

                              Example 5(a)

    Question: A, B and C hold accounts as set forth in Example 4. 
Members A and B are husband and wife; C, their minor child, has failed 
to sign the signature card for Account No. 7. In Account No. 5, 
according to the terms of the account, C cannot make a withdrawal 
without A's written consent. (This is not a limitation imposed under 
state law.) In Account No. 6, the signatures of both B and C are 
required for withdrawal. A has provided all of the funds for Accounts 
numbered 5 and 7 and under state law has the entire actual ownership 
interest in these two accounts. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: If any of the co-owners of a joint account have failed to 
meet any of the joint account requirements, the account is not a 
qualifying joint account. Instead, the account is treated as if it 
consisted of commingled individual accounts of each of the co-owners in 
accordance with his or her actual ownership interest in the funds, as 
determined under applicable state law. (Sec. 745.8(c).)
    Account No. 5 is not a qualifying joint account because C does not 
have equal withdrawal rights with A. Based on the terms of the account, 
C can only make a withdrawal if he has A's written consent. Account No. 
7 is not a qualifying joint account because C did not personally sign 
the signature card. Therefore, all of the funds in Accounts 5 and 7 are 
treated as individually owned by A and added to A's individual account, 
Account No. 1. For insurance purposes then, A has $280,000 in one 
individual account that is insured for $100,000, leaving $180,000 
uninsured.
    Account 6 is a qualifying joint account for insurance purposes since 
each co-owner has the right to withdraw funds on the same basis. Account 
4 is also a qualifying joint account. A's interest in Account 4 is 
insured for $45,000. B's interest of $45,000 in Account 4 is added to 
her interest of $45,000 in Account 6 and insured for $90,000. C's 
interest in Account 6 is insured for $45,000.

[[Page 667]]

                              Example 5(b)

    Question: Assume the same accounts as Example 5(a) except that, on 
Account No. 5, C's right to make a withdrawal is limited by state law 
which precludes a minor from making a withdrawal without the co-owner's 
written consent. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: In this situation, Accounts 4, 5, and 6 all qualify as joint 
accounts. A, B, and C will each have $90,000 of insured funds based on: 
A's interest in Account 4 ($45,000) and 5 ($45,000), B's interest in 
Accounts 4 ($45,000) and 6 ($45,000), and C's interest in Accounts 5 
($45,000) and 6 ($45,000). As in Example 5(a), Account No. 7 does not 
qualify as a joint account and would be added to A's individual account 
for insurance purposes.

       G. How Are Trust Accounts and Retirement Accounts Insured?

    A trust estate is the interest of a beneficiary in an irrevocable 
express trust, whether created by trust instrument or statute, that is 
valid under state law. Thus, funds invested in an account by a trustee 
under an irrevocable express trust are insured on the basis of the 
beneficial interests under such trust. The interest of each beneficiary 
in an account (or accounts) established under such a trust arrangement 
is insured to $100,000 separately from other accounts held by the 
trustee, the settlor (grantor), or the beneficiary. However, in cases 
where a beneficiary has an interest in more than one trust arrangement 
created by the same settlor, the interests of the beneficiary in all 
accounts established under such trusts are added together for insurance 
purposes, and the beneficiary's aggregate interest derived from the same 
settlor is separately insured to the $100,000 maximum.
    A beneficiary's interest in an account established pursuant to an 
irrevocable express trust arrangement is insured separately from other 
beneficial interests (trust estates) invested in the same account if the 
value of the beneficiary's interest (trust estate) can be determined (as 
of the date of a credit union's insolvency) without evaluation of 
contingencies except for those covered by the present worth tables and 
rules of calculation for their use set forth in Sec. 20.2031-10 of the 
Federal Estate Tax Regulations (26 CFR 20.2031-10). If any trust estates 
in such an account cannot be so determined, the insurance with respect 
to all such trust estates together shall not exceed $100,000.
    In order for insurance coverage of trust accounts to be effective in 
accordance with the foregoing rules, certain recordkeeping requirements 
must be met. In connection with each trust account, the credit union's 
records must indicate the name of both the settlor and the trustee of 
the trust and must contain an account signature card executed by the 
trustee indicating the fiduciary capacity of the trustee. In addition, 
the interests of the beneficiaries under the trust must be ascertainable 
from the records of either the credit union or the trustee, and the 
settlor or beneficiary must be a member of the credit union. If there 
are two or more settlors or beneficiaries, then either all the settlors 
or all the beneficiaries must be members of the credit union.
    Although each ascertainable trust estate is separately insured, it 
should be noted that in short-term trusts the insurable interest or 
interests may be very small, since the interests are computed only for 
the duration of the trust. Thus, if a trust is made irrevocable for a 
specified period of time, the beneficial interest will be calculated in 
terms of the length of time stated. A reversionary interest retained by 
the settlor is treated in the same manner as an individual account of 
the settlor.
    As stated, the trust must be valid under local law. A trust which 
does not meet local requirements, such as one imposing no duties on the 
trustee or conveying no interest to the beneficiary, is of no effect for 
insurance purposes. An account in which such funds are invested is 
considered to be an individual account.
    An account established pursuant to a revocable trust arrangement is 
insured as a form of individual account and is treated under section B, 
supra, dealing with Testamentary Accounts.
    IRA and Keogh accounts are separately insured, each up to $250,000. 
Although credit unions may serve as trustees or custodians for self-
directed IRA, Roth IRA and Keogh accounts, once the funds in those 
accounts are taken out of the credit union, they are no longer insured.
    In the case of an employee retirement fund where only a portion of 
the fund is placed in a credit union account, the amount of insurance 
available to an individual member/beneficiary on his interest in the 
account will be in proportion to his interest in the entire employee 
retirement fund. If, for example, the member's interest represents 10% 
of the entire plan funds, then he is presumed to have only a 10% 
interest in the plan account. Said another way, if a member has a vested 
interest of $10,000 in a municipal employees retirement plan and the 
trustee invests 25% of the total plan funds in a credit union, the 
member would be insured for only $2,500 on that credit union account. 
There is an exception, however. The member would be insured for $10,000 
if the trustee can document, through records maintained in the ordinary 
course of business, that individual beneficiary's interests are 
segregated and the total vested interest of the member was, in fact, 
invested in that account.

[[Page 668]]

                                Example 1

    Question: Member S invests $45,000 in trust for B, the beneficiary. 
S also has an individual account containing $90,000 in the same credit 
union. What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Both accounts are fully insured. The trust account is 
separately insured from the individual account of S (Sec. Sec. 
745.3(a)(1) and 745.9-1).

                                Example 2

    Question: S invests funds in trust for A, B, C, D, and E. A, B, and 
C are members of the credit union, D, E and S are not. What is the 
insurance coverage?
    Answer: This is an uninsurable account. Where there is more than one 
settlor or more than one beneficiary, all the settlors or all the 
beneficiaries must be members to establish this type of account. Since 
D, E and S are not members, this account cannot legally be established 
or insured.

                              Example 3(a)

    Question: Member T invests $500,000 in trust for ABC Employees 
Retirement Fund. Some of the participants are members and some are not. 
What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: The account is insured as to the determinable interests of 
each participant to a maximum of $100,000 per participant regardless of 
credit union member status. T's member status is also irrelevant. 
Participant interests not capable of evaluation shall be added together 
and insured to a maximum of $100,000 in the aggregate (Sec. 745.9-2).

                              Example 3(b)

    Question: T is trustee for the ABC Employees Retirement Fund 
containing $1,000,000. Fund participant A has a determinable interest of 
$90,000 in the Fund (9% of the total). T invests $500,000 of the Fund in 
an insured credit union and the remaining $500,000 elsewhere. Some of 
the participants of the Fund are members of the credit union and some 
are not. T does not segregate each participant's interest in the Fund. 
What is the insurance coverage?
    Answer: The account is insured as to the determinable interest of 
each participant, adjusted in proportion to the Fund's investment in the 
credit union, regardless of the membership status of the participants or 
trustee. A's insured interest in the account is $45,000, or 9% of 
$500,000. This reflects the fact that only 50% of the Fund is in the 
account and A's interest in the account is in the same proportion as his 
interest in the overall plan. All other participants would be similarly 
insured. Participants' interests not capable of evaluation are added 
together and insured to a maximum of $100,000 in the aggregate (Sec. 
745.9-2).

                                Example 4

    Question: Member A has an individual account of $100,000 and 
establishes an IRA account and accumulates $250,000 in that account. 
Subsequently, A becomes self-employed and establishes a Keogh account in 
the same credit union and accumulates $250,000 in that account. What is 
the insurance coverage?
    Answer: Each of A's accounts would be separately insured as follows: 
The individual account for $100,000, the maximum for that type of 
account; the IRA account for $250,000, the maximum for that type of 
account; and the Keogh account for $250,000, the maximum for that type 
of account. (Sec. Sec. 745.3(a)(1) and 745.9-2).

                                Example 5

    Question: Member A has a self-directed IRA account with $70,000 in 
it. The FCU is the trustee of the account. Member transfers $40,000 into 
a blue chip stock; $30,000 remains in the FCU. What is the insurance 
coverage?
    Answer: Originally, the full $70,000 in A's IRA account is insured. 
The $40,000 is no longer insured once it is moved out of the FCU. The 
$30,000 remaining in the FCU is insured (Sec. 745.9-2).

Act (``the Act''), 12 U.S.C. 1766(b), 1782(a)(3), 1786. Should any 
provision of this part be inconsistent with these or any other 
provisions of the Act, as amended, the Act shall control. Judicial 
enforcement of any action or order described in this part, as well as 
judicial review thereof, shall be as prescribed under the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1751 et seq.) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 500 et 
seq.).
    (b) As used in this part, the term insured credit union means any 
Federal credit union or any state chartered credit union insured under 
subchapter II of the Act unless the context indicates otherwise.

before the NCUA.
    (2) By non-attorneys. An individual may appear on his or her own 
behalf; a member of a partnership may represent the partnership; a duly 
authorized officer, director, or employee of any government unit, 
agency, institution, corporation or authority may represent that unit,

or employee is not currently suspended or debarred from practice before

    (3) Notice of appearance. Any individual acting as counsel on behalf 
of a party, including the NCUA Board, shall file a notice of appearance 
with OFIA

[[Page 673]]

of appearance must include a written declaration that the individual is 
currently qualified as provided in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this 
section and is authorized to represent the particular party. By filing a 
notice of appearance on behalf of a party in an adjudicatory proceeding, 
the counsel agrees and represents that he or she is authorized to accept 
service on behalf of the represented party and that, in the event of 
withdrawal from representation, he or she will, if required by the 
administrative law judge, continue to accept service until new counsel 
has filed a notice of appearance or until the represented party 
indicates that he or she will proceed on a pro se basis.

contumacious conduct at any phase of any adjudicatory proceeding may be 
grounds for exclusion or suspension of counsel from the proceeding.

counsel's address and telephone number. A party who acts as his or her 
own counsel sign his or her individual name and state his or her address 
and telephone number on every filing or submission of record.
    (b) Effect of signature. (1) The signature of counsel or a party 
shall constitute a certification that: the counsel or party has read the 
filing or submission of record; to the best of his or her knowledge, 
information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the filing or 
submission of record is well-grounded in fact and is warranted by 
existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, 
or reversal of existing law; and the filing or submission of record is 
not made for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause 
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.

administrative law judge shall strike the filing or submission of 
record, unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the 
attention of the pleader or movant.
    (c) Effect of making oral motion or argument. The act of making any 
oral motion or oral argument by any counsel or party constitutes a 
certification that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and 
belief formed after reasonable inquiry, his or her statements are well-
grounded in fact and are warranted by existing law or a good faith 
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, 
and are not made for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause 
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 747.8  Conflicts of interest.

    (a) Conflict of interest in representation. No person shall appear 
as counsel for another person in an adjudicatory proceeding if it 
reasonably appears that such representation may be materially limited by 
that counsel's responsibilities to a third person or by the counsel's 
own interests. The administrative law judge may take corrective measures 
at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of interest in 
representation, including the issuance of an order limiting the scope of 
representation or disqualifying an individual from appearing in a 
representative capacity for the duration of the proceeding.
    (b) Certification and waiver. If any person appearing as counsel 
represents two or more parties to an adjudicatory proceeding or also 
represents a non-party on a matter relevant to an issue in the 
proceeding, counsel must certify in writing at the time of filing the 
notice of appearance required by Sec. 747.6(a):
    (1) That the counsel has personally and fully discussed the 
possibility of conflicts of interest with each such party and non-party; 
and
    (2) That each such party and non-party waives any right it might 
otherwise have had to assert any known conflicts of interest or to 
assert any non-

[[Page 674]]

material conflicts of interest during the course of the proceeding.

    (i) An interested person outside the NCUA (including such person's 
counsel); and
    (ii) The administrative law judge handling that proceeding, the NCUA 
Board, or a decisional employee.
    (2) Exception. A request for status of the proceeding does not 
constitute an ex parte communication.
    (b) Prohibition of ex parte communications. From the time the notice 
is issued by the NCUA Board until the date that the NCUA Board issues 
its final decision pursuant to Sec. 747.40(c):
    (1) No interested person outside the NCUA shall make or knowingly 
cause to be made an ex parte communication to any member of the NCUA 
Board, the administrative law judge, or a decisional employee; and
    (2) No member of the NCUA Board, administrative law judge, or 
decisional employee shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any 
interested person outside the NCUA any ex parte communication.
    (c) Procedure upon occurrence of ex parte communication. If an ex 
parte communication is received by the administrative law judge, a 
member of the NCUA Board or any other person identified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, that person shall cause all such written communications 
(or, if the communication is oral, a memorandum stating the substance of 
the communication) to be placed on the record of the proceeding and 
served on all parties. All other parties to the proceeding shall have an 
opportunity, within ten days of receipt of service of the ex parte 
communication, to file responses thereto and to recommend any sanctions, 
in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, that they believe to 
be appropriate under the circumstances.
    (d) Sanctions. Any party or his or her counsel who makes a 
prohibited ex parte communication, or who encourages or solicits another 
to make any such communication, may be subject to any appropriate 
sanction or sanctions imposed by the NCUA Board or the administrative 
law judge including, but not limited to, exclusion from the proceedings 
and an adverse ruling on the issue which is the subject of the 
prohibited communication.
    (e) Separation of functions. Except to the extent required for the 
disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law, the administrative 
law judge may not consult a person or party on any matter relevant to 
the merits of the adjudication, unless on notice and opportunity for all 
parties to participate. An employee or agent engaged in the performance 
of investigative or prosecuting functions for the NCUA in a case may 
not, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the 
decision, recommended decision, or agency review of the recommended 
decision under section 747.40, except as witness or counsel in public 
proceedings.

Sec. 747.12  Construction of time limits.

    (a) General rule. In computing any period of time prescribed by this 
subpart, the date of the act or event that commences the designated 
period of time is not included. The last day so computed is included 
unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. When the last day 
is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period runs until the end 
of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. 
Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are included in 
the computation of time. However, when the time period within which an 
act is to be performed is ten days or less, not including any additional 
time allowed for in Sec. 747.12(c), intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, 
and Federal holidays are not included.
    (b) When papers are deemed to be filed or served. (1) Filing and 
service are deemed to be effective:
    (i) In the case of personal service or same day commercial courier 
delivery, upon actual service;
    (ii) In the case of overnight commercial delivery service, U.S. 
Express Mail delivery, or first class, registered, or certified mail, 
upon deposit in or delivery to an appropriate point of collection;
    (iii) In the case of transmission by electronic media, as specified 
by the authority receiving the filing, in the case of filing, and as 
agreed among the parties, in the case of service.
    (2) The effective filing and service dates specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section may be modified by the NCUA Board or 
administrative law judge in the case of filing or by agreement of the 
parties in the case of service.
    (c) Calculation of time for service and filing of responsive papers. 
Whenever a time limit is measured by a prescribed period from the 
service of any notice or paper, the applicable time limits are 
calculated as follows:
    (1) If service is made by first class, registered, or certified 
mail, add three calendar days to the prescribed period;
    (2) If service is made by express mail or overnight delivery 
service, add one calendar day to the prescribed period; or
    (3) If service is made by electronic media transmission, add one 
calendar day to the prescribed period, unless otherwise determined by 
the NCUA Board or the administrative law judge in the case of filing, or 
by agreement among the parties in the case of service.

<R05>
Sec. 747.13  Change of time limits.

    Except as otherwise provided by law, the administrative law judge 
may, for good cause shown, extend the time limits prescribed by the 
Uniform Rules or by any notice or order issued in the proceedings. After 
the referral of the case to the NCUA Board pursuant to Sec. 747.38, the 
NCUA Board may grant extensions of the time limits for good cause shown. 
Extensions may be granted upon the motion of a party after notice and 
opportunity to respond is afforded all non-moving parties, or upon the 
NCUA Board's or the administrative law judge's own motion.


<R05>
Sec. 747.14  Witness fees and expenses.

    Witnesses subpoenaed for testimony or depositions shall be paid the 
same fees for attendance and mileage as are paid in the United States 
district courts in proceedings in which the United States is a party, 
provided that, in the case of a discovery subpoena addressed to a party, 
no witness fees or mileage need be paid. Fees for witnesses shall be 
tendered in advance by the party requesting the subpoena, except that 
fees and mileage need not be tendered in advance where the NCUA is the 
party requesting the subpoena. The NCUA shall not be required to pay any 
fees to, or expenses of, any witness not subpoenaed by the NCUA.

[[Page 677]]


<R05>
Sec. 747.15  Opportunity for informal settlement.

    Any respondent may, at any time in the proceeding, unilaterally 
submit to Enforcement Counsel written offers or proposals for settlement 
of a proceeding, without prejudice to the rights of any of the parties. 
No such offer or proposal shall be made to any NCUA representative other 
than Enforcement Counsel. Submission of a written settlement offer does 
not provide a basis for adjourning or otherwise delaying all or any 
portion of a proceeding under this part. No settlement offer or 
proposal, or any subsequent negotiation or resolution, is admissible as 
evidence in any proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 747.16  NCUA's right to conduct examination.

    Nothing contained in this subpart limits in any manner the right of 
the NCUA to conduct any examination, inspection, or visitation of any 
institution or institution-affiliated party, or the right of the NCUA to 
conduct or continue any form of investigation authorized by law.

[56 FR 37767, Aug. 8, 1991; 57 FR 523, Jan. 7, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 747.17  Collateral attacks on adjudicatory proceeding.

    If an interlocutory appeal or collateral attack is brought in any 
court concerning all or any part of an adjudicatory proceeding, the 
challenged adjudicatory proceeding shall continue without regard to the 
pendency of that court proceeding. No default or other failure to act as 
directed in the adjudicatory proceeding within the times prescribed in 
this subpart shall be excused based on the pendency before any court of 
any interlocutory appeal or collateral attack.


<R05>
Sec. 747.18  Commencement of proceeding and contents of notice.

    (a) Commencement of proceeding. (1) A proceeding governed by this 
subpart is commenced by issuance of a notice by the NCUA Board.
    (2) The notice must be served by the NCUA Board upon the respondent 
and given to any other appropriate financial institution supervisory 
authority where required by law.
    (3) The notice must be filed with the OFIA.
    (b) Contents of notice. The notice must set forth:
    (1) The legal authority for the proceeding and for the NCUA's 
jurisdiction over the proceeding;
    (2) A statement of the matters of fact or law showing that the NCUA 
is entitled to relief;
    (3) A proposed order or prayer for an order granting the requested 
relief;
    (4) The time, place, and nature of the hearing as required by law or 
regulation;
    (5) The time within which to file an answer as required by law or 
regulation;
    (6) The time within which to request a hearing as required by law or 
regulation; and
    (7) That the answer and/or request for a hearing shall be filed with 
OFIA.


<R05>
Sec. 747.19  Answer.

    (a) When. Within 20 days of service of the notice, respondent shall 
file an answer as designated in the notice. In a civil money penalty 
proceeding, respondent shall also file a request for a hearing within 20 
days of service of the notice.
    (b) Content of answer. An answer must specifically respond to each 
paragraph or allegation of fact contained in the notice and must admit, 
deny, or state that the party lacks sufficient information to admit or 
deny each allegation of fact. A statement of lack of information has the 
effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of each 
allegation of fact denied; general denials are not permitted. When a 
respondent denies part of an allegation, that part must be denied and 
the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation of fact in the 
notice which is not denied in the answer must be deemed admitted for 
purposes of the proceeding. A respondent is not required to respond to 
the portion of a notice that constitutes the prayer for relief or 
proposed order. The answer must set forth affirmative defenses, if any, 
asserted by the respondent.
    (c) Default--(1) Effect of failure to answer. Failure of a 
respondent to file an answer required by this section within the time 
provided constitutes a waiver

[[Page 678]]

of his or her right to appear and contest the allegations in the notice. 
If no timely answer is filed, the administrative law judge, upon motion 
of the Enforcement Counsel, shall file with the NCUA Board a recommended 
decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the notice. 
Any final order issued by the NCUA Board based upon a respondent's 
failure to answer is deemed to be an order issued upon consent.
    (2) Effect of failure to request a hearing in civil money penalty 
proceedings. If respondent fails to request a hearing as required by law 
within the time provided, the notice of assessment constitutes a final 
and unappealable order.


<R05>
Sec. 747.20  Amended pleadings.

    (a) Amendments. The notice or answer may be amended or supplemented 
at any stage of the proceeding. The respondent must answer an amended 
notice within the time remaining for the respondent's answer to the 
original notice, or within ten days after service of the amended notice, 
whichever period is longer, unless the NCUA Board or administrative law 
judge orders otherwise for good cause.
    (b) Amendments to conform to the evidence. When issues not raised in 
the notice or answer are tried at the hearing by express or implied 
consent of the parties, they will be treated in all respects as if they 
had been raised in the notice or answer, and no formal amendments are 
required. If evidence is objected to at the hearing on the ground that 
it is not within the issues raised by the notice or answer, the 
administrative law judge may admit the evidence when admission is likely 
to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action and the objecting 
party fails to satisfy the administrative law judge that the admission 
of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense 
upon the merits. The administrative law judge may grant a continuance to 
enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.

[61 FR 28026, June 4, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 747.21  Failure to appear.

    Failure of a respondent to appear in person at the hearing or by a 
duly authorized counsel constitutes a waiver of respondent's right to a 
hearing and is deemed an admission of the facts as alleged and consent 
to the relief sought in the notice. Without further proceedings or 
notice to the respondent, the administrative law judge shall file with 
the NCUA Board a recommended decision containing the findings and the 
relief sought in the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 747.22  Consolidation and severance of actions.

    (a) Consolidation. (1) On the motion of any party, or on the 
administrative law judge's own motion, the administrative law judge may 
consolidate, for some or all purposes, any two or more proceedings, if 
each such proceeding involves or arises out of the same transaction, 
occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences, or involves at 
least one common respondent or a material common question of law or 
fact, unless such consolidation would cause unreasonable delay or 
injustice.
    (2) In the event of consolidation under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, appropriate adjustment to the prehearing schedule must be made 
to avoid unnecessary expense, inconvenience, or delay.
    (b) Severance. The administrative law judge may, upon the motion of 
any party, sever the proceeding for separate resolution of the matter as 
to any respondent only if the administrative law judge finds that:
    (1) Undue prejudice or injustice to the moving party would result 
from not severing the proceeding; and
    (2) Such undue prejudice or injustice would outweigh the interests 
of judicial economy and expedition in the complete and final resolution 
of the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 747.23  Motions.

    (a) In writing. (1) Except as otherwise provided herein, an 
application or request for an order or ruling must be made by written 
motion.
    (2) All written motions must state with particularity the relief 
sought and must be accompanied by a proposed order.
    (3) No oral argument may be held on written motions except as 
otherwise directed by the administrative law judge.

[[Page 679]]

Written memorandum, briefs, affidavits or other relevant material or 
documents may be filed in support of or in opposition to a motion.
    (b) Oral motions. A motion may be made orally on the record unless 
the administrative law judge directs that such motion be reduced to 
writing.
    (c) Filing of motions. Motions must be filed with the administrative 
law judge, except that upon the filing of the recommended decision, 
motions must be filed with the NCUA Board.
    (d) Responses. (1) Except as otherwise provided herein, within ten 
days after service of any written motion, or within such other period of 
time as may be established by the administrative law judge or the NCUA 
Board, any party may file a written response to a motion. The 
administrative law judge shall not rule on any oral or written motion 
before each party has had an opportunity to file a response.
    (2) The failure of a party to oppose a written motion or an oral 
motion made on the record is deemed a consent by that party to the entry 
of an order substantially in the form of the order accompanying the 
motion.
    (e) Dilatory motions. Frivolous, dilatory or repetitive motions are 
prohibited. The filing of such motions may form the basis for sanctions.
    (f) Dispositive motions. Dispositive motions are governed by 
Sec. Sec. 747.29 and 747.30.


<R05>
Sec. 747.24  Scope of document discovery.

    (a) Limits on discovery. (1) Subject to the limitations set out in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, a party to a proceeding 
under this subpart may obtain document discovery by serving a written 
request to produce documents. For purposes of a request to produce 
documents, the term ``documents'' may be defined to include drawings, 
graphs, charts, photographs, recordings, data stored in electronic form, 
and other data compilations from which information can be obtained, or 
translated, if necessary, by the parties through detection devices into 
reasonably usable form, as well as written material of all kinds.
    (2) Discovery by use of deposition is governed by subpart I of this 
part.
    (3) Discovery by use of interrogatories is not permitted.
    (b) Relevance. A party may obtain document discovery regarding any 
matter, not privileged, that has material relevance to the merits of the 
pending action. Any request to produce documents that calls for 
irrelevant material, that is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in 
scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous requests, or that 
seeks to obtain privileged documents will be denied or modified. A 
request is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly 
burdensome if, among other things, it fails to include justifiable 
limitations on the time period covered and the geographic locations to 
be searched, the time provided to respond in the request is inadequate, 
or the request calls for copies of documents to be delivered to the 
requesting party and fails to include the requester's written agreement 
to pay in advance for the copying, in accordance with Sec. 747.25.
    (c) Privileged matter. Privileged documents are not discoverable. 
Privileges include the attorney-client privilege, work-product 
privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative-process 
privilege, and any other privileges the Constitution, any applicable act 
of Congress, or the principles of common law provide.
    (d) Time limits. All discovery, including all responses to discovery 
requests, shall be completed at least 20 days prior to the date 
scheduled for the commencement of the hearing, except as provided in the 
Local Rules. No exceptions to this time limit shall be permitted, unless 
the administrative law judge finds on the record that good cause exists 
for waiving the requirements of this paragraph.

[56 FR 37767, Aug. 8, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 28026, June 4, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 747.25  Request for document discovery from parties.

    (a) General rule. Any party may serve on any other party a request 
to produce for inspection any discoverable documents that are in the 
possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is 
served. The request must identify the documents to be produced either by 
individual item

[[Page 680]]

or by category, and must describe each item and category with reasonable 
particularity. Documents must be produced as they are kept in the usual 
course of business or must be organized to correspond with the 
categories in the request.
    (b) Production or copying. The request must specify a reasonable 
time, place, and manner for production and performing any related acts. 
In lieu of inspecting the documents, the requesting party may specify 
that all or some of the responsive documents be copied and the copies 
delivered to the requesting party. If copying of fewer than 250 pages is 
requested, the party to whom the request is addressed shall bear the 
cost of copying and shipping charges. If a party requests 250 pages or 
more of copying, the requesting party shall pay for the copying and 
shipping charges. Copying charges are the current per-page copying rate 
imposed by 12 CFR 792.5(b) implementing the Freedom of Information Act 
(5 U.S.C. 552). The party to whom the request is addressed may require 
payment in advance before producing the documents.
    (c) Obligation to update responses. A party who has responded to a 
discovery request with a response that was complete when made is not 
required to supplement the response to include documents thereafter 
acquired, unless the responding party learns that:
    (1) The response was materially incorrect when made; or
    (2) The response, though correct when made, is no longer true and a 
failure to amend the response is, in substance, a knowing concealment.
    (d) Motions to limit discovery. (1) Any party that objects to a 
discovery request may, within ten days of being served with such 
request, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 747.23 
to strike or otherwise limit the request. If an objection is made to 
only a portion of an item or category in a request, the portion objected 
to shall be specified. Any objections not made in accordance with this 
paragraph and Sec. 747.23 are waived.
    (2) The party who served the request that is the subject of a motion 
to strike or limit may file a written response within five days of 
service of the motion. No other party may file a response.
    (e) Privilege. At the time other documents are produced, the 
producing party must reasonably identify all documents withheld on the 
grounds of privilege and must produce a statement of the basis for the 
assertion of privilege. When similar documents that are protected by 
deliberative process, attorney work-product, or attorney-client 
privilege are voluminous, these documents may be identified by category 
instead of by individual document. The administrative law judge retains 
discretion to determine when the identification by category is 
insufficient.
    (f) Motions to compel production. (1) If a party withholds any 
documents as privileged or fails to comply fully with a discovery 
request, the requesting party may, within ten days of the assertion of 
privilege or of the time the failure to comply becomes known to the 
requesting party, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 747.23 for the issuance of a subpoena compelling production.
    (2) The party who asserted the privilege or failed to comply with 
the request may file a written response to a motion to compel within 
five days of service of the motion. No other party may file a response.
    (g) Ruling on motions. After the time for filing responses pursuant 
to this section has expired, the administrative law judge shall rule 
promptly on all motions filed pursuant to this section. If the 
administrative law judge determines that a discovery request, or any of 
its terms, calls for irrelevant material, is unreasonable, oppressive, 
excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous 
requests, or seeks to obtain privileged documents, he or she may deny or 
modify the request, and may issue appropriate protective orders, upon 
such conditions as justice may require. The pendency of a motion to 
strike or limit discovery or to compel production is not a basis for 
staying or continuing the proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the 
administrative law judge. Notwithstanding any other provision in this 
part, the

[[Page 681]]

administrative law judge may not release, or order a party to produce, 
documents withheld on grounds of privilege if the party has stated to 
the administrative law judge its intention to file a timely motion for 
interlocutory review of the administrative law judge's order to produce 
the documents, and until the motion for interlocutory review has been 
decided.
    (h) Enforcing discovery subpoenas. If the administrative law judge 
issues a subpoena compelling production of documents by a party, the 
subpoenaing party may, in the event of noncompliance and to the extent 
authorized by applicable law, apply to any appropriate United States 
district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena. A 
party's right to seek court enforcement of a subpoena shall not in any 
manner limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the administrative law 
judge against a party who fails to produce subpoenaed documents.

[56 FR 37767, Aug. 8, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 28026, June 4, 1996; 61 
FR 45876, Aug. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 747.26  Document subpoenas to nonparties.

    (a) General rules. (1) Any party may apply to the administrative law 
judge for the issuance of a document discovery subpoena addressed to any 
person who is not a party to the proceeding. The application must 
contain a proposed document subpoena and a brief statement showing the 
general relevance and reasonableness of the scope of documents sought. 
The subpoenaing party shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner 
for making production in response to the document subpoena.
    (2) A party shall only apply for a document subpoena under this 
section within the time period during which such party could serve a 
discovery request under Sec. 747.24(d). The party obtaining the 
document subpoena is responsible for serving it on the subpoenaed person 
and for serving copies on all parties. Document subpoenas may be served 
in any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law.
    (3) The administrative law judge shall promptly issue any document 
subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the administrative law 
judge determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis 
for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are 
unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he 
or she may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified 
form upon such conditions as may be consistent with the Uniform Rules.
    (b) Motion to quash or modify. (1) Any person to whom a document 
subpoena is directed may file a motion to quash or modify such subpoena, 
accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the 
subpoena. The movant shall serve the motion on all parties, and any 
party may respond to such motion within ten days of service of the 
motion.
    (2) Any motion to quash or modify a document subpoena must be filed 
on the same basis, including the assertion of privilege, upon which a 
party could object to a discovery request under Sec. 747.25(d), and 
during the same time limits during which such an objection could be 
filed.
    (c) Enforcing document subpoenas. If a subpoenaed person fails to 
comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of 
the administrative law judge which directs compliance with all or any 
portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other 
aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply 
to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring 
compliance with so much of the document subpoena as the administrative 
law judge has not quashed or modified. A party's right to seek court 
enforcement of a document subpoena shall in no way limit the sanctions 
that may be imposed by the administrative law judge on a party who 
induces a failure to comply with subpoenas issued under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 747.27  Deposition of witness unavailable for hearing.

    (a) General rules. (1) If a witness will not be available for the 
hearing, a party desiring that witness' testimony for the record may 
apply in accordance

[[Page 682]]

with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to 
the administrative law judge for the issuance of a subpoena, including a 
subpoena duces tecum, requiring the attendance of the witness at a 
deposition. The administrative law judge may issue a deposition subpoena 
under this section upon showing that:
    (i) The witness will be unable to attend or may be prevented from 
attending the hearing because of age, sickness or infirmity, or will 
otherwise be unavailable;
    (ii) The witness' unavailability was not procured or caused by the 
subpoenaing party;
    (iii) The testimony is reasonably expected to be material; and
    (iv) Taking the deposition will not result in any undue burden to 
any other party and will not cause undue delay of the proceeding.
    (2) The application must contain a proposed deposition subpoena and 
a brief statement of the reasons for the issuance of the subpoena. The 
subpoena must name the witness whose deposition is to be taken and 
specify the time and place for taking the deposition. A deposition 
subpoena may require the witness to be deposed at any place within the 
country in which that witness resides or has a regular place of 
employment or such other convenient place as the administrative law 
judge shall fix.
    (3) Any requested subpoena that sets forth a valid basis for its 
issuance must be promptly issued, unless the administrative law judge on 
his or her own motion, requires a written response or requires 
attendance at a conference concerning whether the requested subpoena 
should be issued.
    (4) The party obtaining a deposition subpoena is responsible for 
serving it on the witness and for serving copies on all parties. Unless 
the administrative law judge orders otherwise, no deposition under this 
section shall be taken on fewer than ten days' notice to the witness and 
all parties. Deposition subpoenas may be served in any state, territory, 
possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, on any 
person or company doing business in any state, territory, possession of 
the United States, or the District of Columbia, or as otherwise 
permitted by law.
    (b) Objections to deposition subpoenas. (1) The witness and any 
party who has not had an opportunity to oppose a deposition subpoena 
issued under this section may file a motion with the administrative law 
judge to quash or modify the subpoena prior to the time for compliance 
specified in the subpoena, but not more than ten days after service of 
the subpoena.
    (2) A statement of the basis for the motion to quash or modify a 
subpoena issued under this section must accompany the motion. The motion 
must be served on all parties.
    (c) Procedure upon deposition. (1) Each witness testifying pursuant 
to a deposition subpoena must be duly sworn, and each party shall have 
the right to examine the witness. Objections to questions or documents 
must be in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Failure to 
object to questions or documents is not deemed a waiver except where the 
ground for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had 
been timely presented. All questions, answers, and objections must be 
recorded.
    (2) Any party may move before the administrative law judge for an 
order compelling the witness to answer any questions the witness has 
refused to answer or submit any evidence the witness has refused to 
submit during the deposition.
    (3) The deposition must be subscribed by the witness, unless the 
parties and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the 
witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the 
deposition is not subscribed by the witness, the court reporter taking 
the deposition shall certify that the transcript is a true and complete 
transcript of the deposition.
    (d) Enforcing subpoenas. If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with 
any order of the administrative law judge which directs compliance with 
all or any portion of a deposition subpoena under paragraph (b) or 
(c)(3) of this section, the subpoenaing party or other aggrieved party 
may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to an appropriate 
United States district court for an order requiring compliance

[[Page 683]]

with the portions of the subpoena that the administrative law judge has 
ordered enforced. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a 
deposition subpoena in no way limits the sanctions that may be imposed 
by the administrative law judge on a party who fails to comply with, or 
procures a failure to comply with, a subpoena issued under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 747.28  Interlocutory review.

    (a) General rule. The NCUA Board may review a ruling of the 
administrative law judge prior to the certification of the record to the 
NCUA Board only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this 
section and Sec. 747.23.
    (b) Scope of review. The NCUA Board may exercise interlocutory 
review of a ruling of the administrative law judge if the NCUA Board 
finds that:
    (1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as 
to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;
    (2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the 
ultimate termination of the proceeding;
    (3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the 
proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or
    (4) Subsequent modification of the ruling would cause unusual delay 
or expense.
    (c) Procedure. Any request for interlocutory review shall be filed 
by a party with the administrative law judge within ten days of his or 
her ruling and shall otherwise comply with Sec. 747.23. Any party may 
file a response to a request for interlocutory review in accordance with 
Sec. 747.23(d). Upon the expiration of the time for filing all 
responses, the administrative law judge shall refer the matter to the 
NCUA Board for final disposition.
    (d) Suspension of proceeding. Neither a request for interlocutory 
review nor any disposition of such a request by the NCUA Board under 
this section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered 
by the administrative law judge or the NCUA Board.


<R05>
Sec. 747.29  Summary disposition.

    (a) In general. The administrative law judge shall recommend that 
the NCUA Board issue a final order granting a motion for summary 
disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, admissions, affidavits, 
stipulations, documentary evidence, matters as to which official notice 
may be taken, and any other evidentiary materials properly submitted in 
connection with a motion for summary disposition show that:
    (1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and
    (2) The moving part is entitled to a decision in its favor as a 
matter of law.
    (b) Filing of motions and responses. (1) Any party who believes that 
there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that he 
or she is entitled to a decision as a matter of law may move at any time 
for summary disposition in its favor of all or any part of the 
proceeding. Any party, within 20 days after service of such a motion, or 
within such time period as allowed by the administrative law judge, may 
file a response to such motion.
    (2) A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a 
statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends 
there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary 
evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, 
stipulations, depositions, investigatory depositions, transcripts, 
affidavits and any other evidentiary materials that the moving party 
contends support his or her position. The motion must also be 
accompanied by a brief containing the points and authorities in support 
of the contention of the moving party. Any party opposing a motion for 
summary disposition must file a statement setting forth those material 
facts as to which he or she contends a genuine dispute exists. Such 
opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as that 
submitted with the motion for summary disposition and a brief containing 
the points and authorities in support of the contention that summary 
disposition would be inappropriate.
    (c) Hearing on motion. At the request of any party or on his or her 
own motion, the administrative law judge may hear oral argument on the 
motion for summary disposition.

[[Page 684]]

    (d) Decision on motion. Following receipt of a motion for summary 
disposition and all responses thereto, the administrative law judge 
shall determine whether the moving party is entitled to summary 
disposition. If the administrative law judge determines that summary 
disposition is warranted, the administrative law judge shall submit a 
recommended decision to that effect to the NCUA Board. If the 
administrative law judge finds that no party is entitled to summary 
disposition, he or she shall make a ruling denying the motion.


<R05>
Sec. 747.30  Partial summary disposition.

    If the administrative law judge determines that a party is entitled 
to summary disposition as to certain claims only, he or she shall defer 
submitting a recommended decision as to those claims. A hearing on the 
remaining issues must be ordered. Those claims for which the 
administrative law judge has determined that summary disposition is 
warranted will be addressed in the recommended decision filed at the 
conclusion of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 747.31  Scheduling and prehearing conferences.

    (a) Scheduling conference. Within 30 days of service of the notice 
or order commencing a proceeding or such order time as parties may 
agree, the administrative law judge shall direct counsel for all parties 
to meet with him or her in person at a specified time and place prior to 
the hearing or to confer by telephone for the purpose of scheduling the 
recourse and conduct of the proceeding. This meeting or telephone 
conference is called a ``scheduling conference.'' The identification of 
potential witnesses, the time for and manner of discovery, and the 
exchange of any prehearing materials including witness lists, statements 
of issues, stipulations, exhibits and any other materials may also be 
determined at the scheduling conference.
    (b) Prehearing conferences. The administrative law judge may, in 
addition to the scheduling conference, on his or her own motion or at 
the request of any party, direct counsel for the parties to meet with 
him or her (in person or by telephone) at a prehearing conference to 
address any or all of the following:
    (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
    (2) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and the contents, authenticity 
and admissibility into evidence of documents;
    (3) Matters of which official notice may be taken;
    (4) Limitation of the number of witnesses;
    (5) Summary disposition of any or all issues;
    (6) Resolution of discovery issues or disputes;
    (7) Amendments to pleadings; and
    (8) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly disposition of the 
proceeding.
    (c) Transcript. The administrative law judge, in his or her 
discretion, may require that a scheduling or prehearing conference be 
recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the conference and any 
materials filed, including orders, becomes part of the record of the 
proceeding. A party may obtain a copy of the transcript at its expense.
    (d) Scheduling or prehearing orders. At or within a reasonable time 
following the conclusion of the scheduling conference or any prehearing 
conference, the administrative law judge shall serve on each party an 
order setting forth any agreements reached and any procedural 
determinations made.


<R05>
Sec. 747.32  Prehearing submissions.

    (a) Within the time set by the administrative law judge, but in no 
case later than 14 days before the start of the hearing, each party 
shall serve on every other party, his or her:
    (1) Prehearing statement;
    (2) Final list of witnesses to be called to testify at the hearing, 
including name and address of each witness and a short summary of the 
expected testimony of each witness;
    (3) List of the exhibits to be introduced at the hearing along with 
a copy of each exhibit; and
    (4) Stipulations of fact, if any.
    (b) Effect of failure to comply. No witness may testify and no 
exhibits may be introduced at the hearing if such witness or exhibit is 
not listed in the prehearing submissions pursuant to

[[Page 685]]

paragraph (a) of this section, except for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 747.33  Public hearings.

    (a) General rule. All hearings shall be open to the public, unless 
the NCUA Board, in its discretion, determines that holding an open 
hearing would be contrary to the public interest. Within 20 days of 
service of the notice, any respondent may file with the NCUA Board a 
request for a private hearing, and any party may file a reply to such a 
request. A party must serve on the administrative law judge a copy of 
any request or reply the party files with the NCUA Board. The form of, 
and procedure for, these requests and replies are governed by Sec. 
747.23. A party's failure to file a request or a reply constitutes a 
waiver of any objections regarding whether the hearing will be public or 
private.
    (b) Filing document under seal. Enforcement Counsel, in his or her 
discretion, may file any document or part of a document under seal if 
disclosure of the document would be contrary to the public interest. The 
administrative law judge shall take all appropriate steps to preserve 
the confidentiality of such documents or parts thereof, including 
closing portions of the hearing to the public.

<R05>
Sec. 747.34  Hearing subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. (1) Upon application of a party showing general 
relevance and reasonableness of scope of the testimony or other evidence 
sought, the administrative law judge may issue a subpoena or a subpoena 
duces tecum requiring the attendance of a witness at the hearing or the 
production of documentary or physical evidence at the hearing. The 
application for a hearing subpoena must also contain a proposed subpoena 
specifying the attendance of a witness or the production of evidence 
from any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law at any designated 
place where the hearing is being conducted. The party making the 
application shall serve a copy of the application and the proposed 
subpoena on every other party.
    (2) A party may apply for a hearing subpoena at any time before the 
commencement of a hearing. During a hearing, a party may make an 
application for a subpoena orally on the record before the 
administrative law judge.
    (3) The administrative law judge shall promptly issue any hearing 
subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the administrative law 
judge determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis 
for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are 
unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he 
or she may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified 
form upon any conditions consistent with this subpart. Upon issuance by 
the administrative law judge, the party making the application shall 
serve the subpoena on the person named in the subpoena and on each 
party.
    (b) Motion to quash or modify. (1) Any person to whom a hearing 
subpoena is directed or any party may file a motion to quash or modify 
the subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or 
modifying the subpoena. The movant must serve the motion on each party 
and on the person named in the subpoena. Any party may respond to the 
motion within ten days of service of the motion.
    (2) Any motion to quash or modify a hearing subpoena must be filed 
prior to the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, but not more 
than ten days after the date of service of the subpoena upon the movant.
    (c) Enforcing subpoenas. If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with 
any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of the 
administrative law judge which directs compliance with all or any 
portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other 
aggrieved party may seek enforcement of the subpoena pursuant to Sec. 
747.26(c).

<R05>
Sec. 747.35  Conduct of hearings.

    (a) General rules. (1) Hearings shall be conducted so as to provide 
a fair and

[[Page 686]]

expeditious presentation of the relevant disputed issues. Each party has 
the right to present its case or defense by oral and documentary 
evidence and to conduct such cross examination as may be required for 
full disclosure of the facts.
    (2) Order of hearing. Enforcement Counsel shall present its case-in-
chief first, unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge, 
or unless otherwise expressly specified by law or regulation. 
Enforcement Counsel shall be the first party to present an opening 
statement and a closing statement, and may make a rebuttal statement 
after the respondent's closing statement. If there are multiple 
respondents, respondents may agree among themselves as to their order of 
presentation of their cases, but if they do not agree the administrative 
law judge shall fix the order.
    (3) Examination of witnesses. Only one counsel for each party may 
conduct an examination of a witness, except that in the case of 
extensive direct examination, the administrative law judge may permit 
more than one counsel for the party presenting the witness to conduct 
the examination. A party may have one counsel conduct the direct 
examination and another counsel conduct re-direct examination of a 
witness, or may have one counsel conduct the cross examination of a 
witness and another counsel conduct the re-cross examination of a 
witness.
    (4) Stipulations. Unless the administrative law judge directs 
otherwise, all stipulations of fact and law previously agreed upon by 
the parties, and all documents, the admissibility of which have been 
previously stipulated, will be admitted into evidence upon commencement 
of the hearing.
    (b) Transcript. The hearing must be recorded and transcribed. The 
reporter will make the transcript available to any party upon payment by 
that party to the reporter of the cost of the transcript. The 
administrative law judge may order the record corrected, either upon 
motion to correct, upon stipulation of the parties, or following notice 
to the parties upon the administrative law judge's own motion.

<R05>
Sec. 747.36  Evidence.

    (a) Admissibility. (1) Except as is otherwise set forth in this 
section, relevant, material, and reliable evidence that is not unduly 
repetitive is admissible to the fullest extent authorized by the 
Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law.
    (2) Evidence that would be admissible under the Federal Rules of 
Evidence is admissible in a proceeding conducted pursuant to this 
subpart.
    (3) Evidence that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of 
Evidence may not be deemed or ruled to be inadmissible in a proceeding 
conducted pursuant to this subpart if such evidence is relevant, 
material, reliable and not unduly repetitive.
    (b) Official notice. (1) Official notice may be taken of any 
material fact which may be judicially noticed by a United States 
district court and any material information in the official public 
records of any Federal or state government agency.
    (2) All matters officially noticed by the administrative law judge 
or NCUA Board shall appear on the record.
    (3) If official notice is requested or taken of any material fact, 
the parties, upon timely request, shall be afforded an opportunity to 
object.
    (c) Documents. (1) A duplicate copy of a document is admissible to 
the same extent as the original, unless a genuine issue is raised as to 
whether the copy is in some material respect not a true and legible copy 
of the original.
    (2) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, 
any document, including a report of examination, supervisory activity, 
inspection or visitation, prepared by an appropriate Federal financial 
institution regulatory agency or by a state regulatory agency, is 
admissible either with or without a sponsoring witness.
    (3) Witnesses may use existing or newly created charts, exhibits, 
calendars, calculations, outlines or other graphic material to 
summarize, illustrate, or simplify the presentation of testimony. Such 
materials may, subject to the administrative law judge's discretion, be 
used with or without being admitted into evidence.

[[Page 687]]

    (d) Objections. (1) Objections to the admissibility of evidence must 
be timely made and rulings on all objections must appear on the record.
    (2) When an objection to a question or line of questioning 
propounded to a witness is sustained, the examining counsel may make a 
specific proffer on the record of what he or she expected to prove by 
the expected testimony of the witness, either by representation of 
counsel or by direct interrogation of the witness.
    (3) The administrative law judge shall retain rejected exhibits, 
adequately marked for identification, for the record, and transmit such 
exhibits to the NCUA Board.
    (4) Failure to object to admission of evidence or to any ruling 
constitutes a waiver of the objection.
    (e) Stipulations. The parties may stipulate as to any relevant 
matters of fact or the authentication of any relevant documents. Such 
stipulations must be received in evidence at a hearing, and are binding 
on the parties with respect to the matters therein stipulated.
    (f) Depositions of unavailable witnesses. (1) If a witness is 
unavailable to testify at a hearing, and that witness has testified in a 
deposition to which all parties in a proceeding had notice and an 
opportunity to participate, a party may offer as evidence all or any 
part of the transcript of the deposition, including deposition exhibits, 
if any.
    (2) Such deposition transcript is admissible to the same extent that 
testimony would have been admissible had that person testified at the 
hearing, provided that if a witness refused to answer proper questions 
during the depositions, the administrative law judge may, on that basis, 
limit the admissibility of the deposition in any manner that justice 
requires.
    (3) Only those portions of a deposition received in evidence at the 
hearing constitute a part of the record.


<R05>
Sec. 747.37  Post-hearing filings.

    (a) Proposed findings and conclusions and supporting briefs. (1) 
Using the same method of service for each party, the administrative law 
judge shall serve notice upon each party that the certified transcript, 
together with all hearing exhibits and exhibits introduced but not 
admitted into evidence at the hearing, has been filed. Any party may 
file with the administrative law judge proposed findings of fact, 
proposed conclusions of law, and a proposed order within 30 days 
following service of this notice by the administrative law judge or 
within such longer period as may be ordered by the administrative law 
judge.
    (2) Proposed findings and conclusions must be supported by citation 
to any relevant portions of the record. A post-hearing brief may be 
filed in support of proposed findings and conclusions, either as part of 
the same document or in a separate document. Any party who fails to file 
timely with the administrative law judge any proposed finding or 
conclusion is deemed to have waived the right to raise in any subsequent 
filing or submission any issue not addressed in such party's proposed 
finding or conclusion.
    (b) Reply briefs. Reply briefs may be filed within 15 days after the 
date on which the parties' proposed findings, conclusions, and order are 
due. Reply briefs must be strictly limited to responding to new matters, 
issues, or arguments raised in another party's papers. A party who has 
not filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law or a post-
hearing brief may not file a reply brief.
    (c) Simultaneous filing required. The administrative law judge shall 
not order the filing by any party of any brief or reply brief in advance 
of the other party's filing of its brief.

<R05>
Sec. 747.38  Recommended decision and filing of record.

    (a) Filing of recommended decision and record. Within 45 days after 
expiration of the time allowed for filing reply briefs under Sec. 
747.37(b), the administrative law judge shall file with and certify to 
the NCUA Board, for decision, the record of the proceeding. The record

recommended findings of fact, recommended conclusions of law, and 
proposed order; all prehearing and hearing transcripts, exhibits, and

[[Page 688]]

other supporting papers filed in connection with the hearing. The 
administrative law judge shall serve upon each party the recommended 
decision, findings, conclusions, and proposed order.
    (b) Filing of index. At the same time the administrative law judge 
files with and certifies to the NCUA Board for final determination the 
record of the proceeding, the administrative law judge shall furnish to 
the NCUA Board a certified index of the entire record of the proceeding. 
The certified index shall include, at a minimum, an entry for each 
paper, document or motion filed with the administrative law judge in the 
proceeding, the date of the filing, and the identity of the filer. The

for: Each exhibit introduced and admitted into evidence at the hearing; 
each exhibit introduced but not admitted into evidence at the hearing; 
each exhibit introduced and admitted into evidence after the completion 
of the hearing; and each exhibit introduced but not admitted into 
evidence after the completion of the hearing.

Sec. 747.39  Exceptions to recommended decision.

    (a) Filing exceptions. Within 30 days after service of the 
recommended decision, findings, conclusions, and proposed order under 
Sec. 747.38, a party may file with the NCUA Board written exceptions to 
the administrative law judge's recommended decision, findings, 
conclusions or proposed order, to the admission or exclusion of 
evidence, or to the failure of the administrative law judge to make a 
ruling proposed by a party. A supporting brief may be filed at the time 
the exceptions are filed, either as part of the same document or in a 
separate document.
    (b) Effect of failure to file or raise exceptions. (1) Failure of a 
party to file exceptions to those matters specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section within the time prescribed is deemed a waiver of objection 
thereto.
    (2) No exception need be considered by the NCUA Board if the party 
taking exception had an opportunity to raise the same objection, issue, 
or argument before the administrative law judge and failure to do so.
    (c) Contents. (1) All exceptions and briefs in support of such 
exceptions must be confined to the particular matters in, or omissions 
from, the administrative law judge's recommendations to which that party 
takes exception.
    (2) All exceptions and briefs in support of exceptions must set 
forth page or paragraph references to the specific parts of the 
administrative law judge's recommendations to which exception is taken, 
the page or paragraph references to those portions of the record relied 
upon to support each exception, and the legal authority relied upon to 
support each exception.

determines that the record in the proceeding is complete, the NCUA Board 
shall serve notice upon the parties that the proceedings has been 
submitted to the NCUA Board for final decision.
    (b) Oral argument before NCUA Board. Upon the initiative of the NCUA 
Board or on the written request of any party filed with the NCUA Board 
within the time for filing exceptions, the NCUA Board may order and hear 
oral argument on the recommended findings, conclusions, decision, and 
order of the administrative law judge. A written request by a party must 
show good cause for oral argument and state reasons why arguments cannot 
be presented adequately in writing. A denial of a request for oral 
argument may be set forth in the NCUA Board's final decision. Oral 
argument before the NCUA Board must be on the record.
    (c) Final Decision of NCUA Board. (1) Decisional employees may 
advise and assist the NCUA Board in the consideration and disposition of 
the case. The final decision of the NCUA Board will be based upon review 
of the entire record of the proceeding, except that the NCUA Board may 
limit the issues to be reviewed to those findings and conclusions to 
which opposing arguments or exceptions have been filed by the parties.

[[Page 689]]

    (2) The NCUA Board shall render a final decision within 90 days 
after notification of the parties that the case has been submitted for 
final decision, or 90 days after oral argument, whichever is later, 
unless the NCUA Board orders that the action or any aspect thereof be 
remanded to the administrative law judge for further proceedings. Copies 
of the final decision and order of the NCUA Board shall be served upon 
each party to the proceeding, upon other persons required by statute, 
and, if directed by the NCUA Board or required by statute, upon any 
appropriate state or Federal supervisory authority.

Sec. 747.41  Stays pending judicial review.

    The commencement of proceedings for judicial review of a final 
decision and order of the NCUA Board may not, unless specifically 
ordered by the NCUA Board or a reviewing court, operate as a stay of any 
order issued by the NCUA Board. The NCUA Board may, in its discretion, 
and on such terms as it finds just, stay the effectiveness of all or any 
part of its order pending a final decision on a petition for review of 
that order.

1786(b)), the NCUA Board may terminate the insured status of an insured 
credit union upon the grounds set forth therein and enumerated in Sec. 
747.202. The procedure for terminating the insured status of an insured 
credit union as therein prescribed will be followed and hearings

<R05>
Sec. 747.202  Grounds for termination of insurance.

    The NCUA Board may institute proceedings to terminate the insured 
status of an insured credit union whenever it determines that an insured 
credit union is:
    (a) Engaging or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in 
conducting its business;
    (b) In unsafe or unsound condition to continue as an insured credit 
union; or
    (c) Violating or has violated any applicable law, rule, regulation, 
order, written condition imposed by the NCUA Board in response to any 
action on any application, notice, or other request by the credit union 
or institution-affiliated party, or any written agreement entered into 
with the NCUA Board.

<R05>
Sec. 747.203  Notice of charges.

    (a) Whenever the NCUA Board determines that grounds for termination 
of insured status exists, it will, for the purpose of securing 
correction of errant or illegal conditions, serve a notice of charges 
upon the concerned credit union. This notice will contain a

[[Page 690]]

statement describing the unsafe or unsound practices, condition or the 
relevant violations.
    (b) In the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the NCUA 
Board shall send a copy of the Notice of Charges to the appropriate 
State authority, if any, having supervision over the credit union.


<R05>
Sec. 747.204  Notice of intention to terminate insured status.

    Unless correction of the practices, condition, or violations set 
forth in the Notice of Charges is made within 120 days after service of 
such statement, or within a shorter period of not less than 20 days 
after such service as the NCUA Board may require in any case where it 
determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union 
could be unduly jeopardized by further delay or as the appropriate State 
supervisory authority shall require in the case of an insured State-
chartered credit union, the Board, if it determines to proceed further, 
shall give to the credit union not less than 30 days written notice of 
its intent to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured 
credit union. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts 
constituting the alleged unsafe or unsound practices or conditions or 
violations on which a hearing will be held. Such hearing shall commence 
not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of 
service of such notice upon the credit union, unless an earlier or later 
date is set by the NCUA Board at the request of the credit union.


<R05>
Sec. 747.205  Order terminating insured status.

    If, upon the record of the hearing held pursuant to Sec. 747.204, 
the NCUA Board finds that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or 
violation specified in the notice has been established and has not been 
corrected within the time prescribed under Sec. 747.204, the NCUA Board 
may issue and serve upon the credit union an order terminating its 
status as an insured credit union on a date subsequent to the date of 
such finding and subsequent to the expiration of the time specified in 
the Notice.


<R05>
Sec. 747.206  Consent to termination of insured status.

    Unless the credit union appears at the hearing designated in the 
notice of hearing by a duly authorized representative, it will be deemed 
to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured credit 
union. In the event the credit union fails to so appear at such hearing, 
the administrative law judge shall forthwith report the matter to the 
NCUA Board and the NCUA Board may thereupon issue an order terminating 
the credit union's insured status.


<R05>
Sec. 747.207  Notice of termination of insured status.

    Prior to the effective date of the termination of the insured status 
of an insured credit union under section 206(b) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1786(b)) and at such time as the Board shall specify, the credit union 
shall mail to each member at his or her last address of record on the 
books of the credit union, and publish in not less than two issues of a 
local newspaper of general circulation, notices of the termination of 
its insured status, and the credit union shall furnish the NCUA Board 
with proof of publication of such notice. The notice shall be as 
follows:

Sec. 747.208  Duties after termination.

    (a) After the termination of the insured status of any credit union 
under section 206(b) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1786(b)), insurance of its 
member accounts to the extent they were insured on the effective date of 
such termination, less any amounts thereafter withdrawn which reduce the 
accounts below the amount covered by insurance on the effective date of 
such termination, shall continue for a period of one year, but no shares 
issued by the credit union or deposits made after the date of such 
termination shall be insured by the NCUA Board.
    (b) The credit union shall continue to pay premiums to the NCUA 
Board during such period and the Board shall have the right to examine 
the credit union from time to time during the period. The credit union 
shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations 
of an insured credit union during the one year period. If the credit 
union is closed for liquidation within this period, the Board shall have 
the same powers and rights with respect to such credit union as in the 
case of an insured credit union.

suspended pursuant to this subpart, the NCUA Board shall appoint persons 
to serve temporarily as directors in their place pending the termination

cease to be directors of the credit union and their respective 
successors have been elected by the members at an annual or special 
meeting and have taken office.
    (3) Directors appointed temporarily by the NCUA Board pursuant to

<R05>
Sec. 747.303  Notice of suspension or prohibition.

    Whenever an institution-affiliated party of an insured credit union 
is charged in any state, Federal or territorial information or 
indictment or complaint with the commission of or participation in a 
crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust, which crime is punishable 
by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under state or Federal 
law, the NCUA Board may, if continued service or participation by the 
concerned party may pose a threat to the interests of any credit union's 
members or may threaten to impair public confidence in any credit union, 
by written notice served upon such party, suspend him or her from 
office,

[[Page 693]]

or prohibit him or her from further participation in any manner in the 
affairs of any credit union, or both. A copy of the notice of suspension 
or prohibition shall also be served upon the credit union of which the 
subject of the order is, or most recently was, an institution-affiliated 
party.

[71 FR 67440, Nov. 22, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 747.304  Removal or permanent prohibition.

    (a) In the event that a judgment of conviction or an agreement to 
enter a pretrial diversion or other similar program is entered against 
the institution-affiliated party, and at such time as the judgment, if 
any, is not subject to further appellate review, the NCUA Board may, if 
continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to 
the interests of any credit union's members or may threaten to impair 
public confidence in any credit union, issue and serve upon the 
individual an order removing him or her from office or prohibiting him 
or her from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the 
affairs of any credit union except with the consent of the NCUA Board. A 
copy of such order will also be served upon the credit union of which 
the subject of the order is, or most recently was, an institution-
affiliated party.
    (b) The NCUA Board may issue such order with respect to an 
individual who is an institution-affiliated party at a credit union at 
the time of the offense without regard to whether such individual is an 
institution-affiliated party at any credit union at the time the order 
is considered or issued by the Board or whether the credit union at 
which the individual was an institution-affiliated party at the time of 
the offense remains in existence at the time the order is considered or 
issued by the board.
    (c) A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge will 
not preclude the Board from thereafter instituting proceedings, pursuant 
to the provisions of section 206(g) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1786(g)) and 
subpart A of this part, to remove such director, committee member, 
officer, or other person from office or to prohibit his or her further

Any notice of the opportunity for such a hearing shall be accompanied by 
a description of the hearing procedure and the criteria to be

    (a) Upon receipt of a request for a hearing which complies with 
Sec. 747.306, the NCUA Board will order an informal hearing to commence 
within the following 30 days in the Washington, DC metropolitan area or 
at such other place as the NCUA Board designates before a Presiding 
Officer designated by the NCUA Board to conduct the hearing. At the

the right to introduce relevant and material written materials (or, at 
the discretion of the NCUA Board, oral testimony), and to present an 
oral argument before the Presiding Officer. A member of the enforcement 
staff of the Office of General Counsel of the NCUA may attend the 
hearing and may participate as a party. Neither the formal rules of 
evidence nor the adjudicative procedures of the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557), nor subpart A of this part shall apply to the 
hearing. The proceedings shall be recorded and a transcript furnished to 
the individual upon request and after the payment of the cost thereof. 
The NCUA Board shall have the discretion to permit the presentation of 
witnesses, within specified time limits, so long as a list of such 
witnesses is furnished to the Presiding Officer at least ten days prior 
to the hearing. Witnesses shall not be sworn, unless specifically 
requested by either party or directed by the Presiding Officer. The 
Presiding Officer may examine any witnesses and each party shall have 
the opportunity to cross-examine any witness presented by an opposing 
party. Upon the request of either the subject individual or the 
representative of the Office of General Counsel, the record shall remain 
open for a period of five business days following the hearing, during 
which time the parties may make any additional submissions to the 
record. Thereafter, the record shall be closed.
    (d) In the course of or in connection with any proceeding under this 
subpart, the NCUA Board and the Presiding Officer will have the power to 
administer oaths and affirmations, to take or cause depositions to be 
taken, and to issue, revoke, quash, or modify subpoenas and subpoenas 
duces tecum. If the NCUA Board permits the presentation of witnesses, 
the NCUA Board or the Presiding Officer may require the attendance of 
witnesses from any place in any state or in any territory or other place 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at any designated place 
where such proceeding is being conducted. Witnesses subpoenaed shall be 
paid the same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the District 
Courts of the United States. The NCUA Board or the Presiding Officer may 
require the production of documents from any place in any such state, 
territory, or other place.
    (e) The Presiding Officer will make his or her recommendations to 
the Board, where possible, within ten business days following the close 
of the record.

basis of written submissions alone.
    (b) Should any concerned party fail to request in writing an oral 
hearing or consideration based on written submissions alone within 30 
days of service of the notice described in Sec. 747.306, he or she will 
be deemed to have consented to the NCUA Board's action.
    (c) Unless the concerned party appears at the hearing personally or 
by duly appointed representative, he or she will be deemed to have 
consented to the NCUA Board's action.

[[Page 695]]


<R05>
Sec. 747.309  Decision of the NCUA Board.

    Within 60 days following the hearing, or receipt of the subject 
individual's written submissions where hearing has been waived pursuant 
to Sec. 747.308, the NCUA Board shall notify the institution-affiliated 
party whether the suspension or prohibition will be continued, 
terminated, or otherwise modified, or whether the order of removal or 
prohibition will be rescinded or otherwise modified. Such notification 
shall contain a statement of the basis for the decision of the NCUA 
Board, if that decision is adverse to the respondent party. In the case 
of a decision favorable to the respondent on the subject of a prior 
order of removal or prohibition, the NCUA Board shall take prompt action 
to rescind or otherwise modify the order of removal or prohibition.


<R05>
Sec. 747.310  Reconsideration by the NCUA Board.

    (a) The subject individual shall have ten business days following 
receipt of the decision of the NCUA Board in which to petition the NCUA 
Board for initial reconsideration.
    (b) The subject individual also shall be entitled to petition the 
NCUA Board for reconsideration of its decision any time after the 
expiration of a 12-month period from the date of the NCUA Board's 
decision, but no petition for reconsideration may be made within 12 
months of a previous petition.
    (c) Any petition shall state with particularity the basis for 
reconsideration, the relief sought, and any exceptions the individual 
has to the NCUA Board's findings. An individual's petition may be 
accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities in support of his 
or her petition and any supporting documentation the individual may wish 
to have considered.
    (d) No hearing need be granted on such petition for reconsideration. 
Promptly following receipt of the petition, the Board shall render its 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 747.311  Relevant considerations.

    In deciding the question of suspension, prohibition, or removal 
under this subpart, the NCUA Board will consider the following:
    (a) Whether the alleged offense is a crime which is punishable by 
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under state or Federal law, 
and which involves dishonesty or breach of trust;
    (b) Whether the continued presence of the subject individual in his 
or her position may pose a threat to the interests of the credit union's 
members because of the nature and extent of the individual's 
participation in the affairs of the insured credit union and/or the 
nature of the offense with the commission of or participation in which 
the individual has been charged;
    (c) Whether there is cause to believe that there may be an erosion 
of public confidence in the integrity, safety, or soundness of a 
particular credit union (either generally or in the particular locality 
in which the credit union is situated) if the subject individual is 
permitted to remain in his or her position in an insured credit union;
    (d) Whether the individual is covered by the credit union's fidelity 
bond and, if so, whether the bond is likely to be revoked, or whether 
coverage under the bond will be affected adversely as a result of the 
information, indictment, complaint, judgment of conviction or entry into 
a pretrial diversion or other similar program; and
    (e) The NCUA Board may consider any other factors which, in the 
specific case, appear relevant to the decision to continue in effect, 
rescind, terminate, or modify a suspension, prohibition, or removal 
order, except that it shall not consider the ultimate question of the 
guilt or innocence of the subject individual with regard to the crime 
with which he or she has been charged.

    (a) Grounds in general. The NCUA Board may suspend or revoke the 
charter of any Federal credit union, and place such credit union into 
involuntary liquidation and appoint a liquidating agent therefor, upon 
its finding that the credit union has violated any provision of its 
charter or bylaws or of the FCUA or regulations issued thereunder.
    (b) Immediate suspension. In any case where the Board determines 
that the grounds set forth in paragraph (a) of this section exist and 
that immediate action is necessary in order to prevent further 
dissipation or credit union assets or earnings, or further weakening of 
the credit union's condition, or to otherwise protect the interest of 
the credit union's insured members or the National Credit Union Share 
Insurance Fund, it may order without prior notice the immediate 
suspension of the charter of such credit union, and if the circumstances 
so warrant, may take possession of all books, records, assets, and 
property of every description of such credit union.


<R05>
Sec. 747.403  Notice of intent to suspend or revoke charter; notice of suspension.

    (a) Upon its determination that one or more of the grounds listed in 
Sec. 747.402(a) exists, or that because of conditions described in 
Sec. 747.402(b) immediate suspension of charter is necessary, the NCUA 
Board shall cause to be served upon that credit union a notice of intent 
to suspend or revoke charter and of intent to place into involuntary 
liquidation, or a notice of suspension. Such notice shall contain a 
statement of the facts which constitute the grounds for this action, a 
recitation of the options available to the credit union under paragraph 
(b) of this section, and an explanation of the results that will occur 
if the credit union fails to exercise said options.
    (b) Not later than 40 days after the receipt of the notice provided 
for in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal credit union may file 
with the NCUA Board a statement in writing setting forth the grounds and 
reasons why its charter should not be suspended or revoked and why it 
should not be placed into involuntary liquidation; or in lieu of a 
written statement, request an oral hearing which shall be conducted in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart. This statement 
or request shall be accompanied by a certified copy of a resolution of 
the board of directors of the Federal credit union concerned authorizing 
such statement or request, such certification to be made by the 
president and secretary of the board of directors.
    (c) If the Federal credit union concerned does not exercise either 
alternative available in paragraph (b) of this section within the time 
required, it shall be deemed to have admitted the facts alleged in the 
notice and may be deemed to have consented to the relief sought.


<R05>
Sec. 747.404  Notice of hearing.

    (a) Upon receipt of a request for hearing which complies with Sec. 
747.403(b), the NCUA Board shall transmit the request to the Office of 
Financial Institution Adjudication (``OFIA''). Such hearing shall 
commence no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date 
the OFIA receives the request for a hearing, unless an earlier or later 
date is requested by the Federal credit union concerned and is granted 
by the NCUA Board in its discretion.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 747.405(b), the procedures of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) and subpart A of this 
part will apply to the hearing.
    (c) Unless the Federal credit union shall appear at such hearing by 
a duly authorized representative it shall be deemed to have consented to 
the suspension or revocation of its charter and to the placing of said 
credit union into involuntary liquidation.

<R05>
Sec. 747.405  Issuance of order.

    (a) In the event of such consent as referred to in Sec. 747.403(c) 
or Sec. 747.404(c), or if upon the record made at any such hearing as 
referred to in Sec. 747.403(b), the NCUA Board finds that the charter 
of the Federal credit union concerned should be suspended or revoked and 
the credit union closed and placed into involuntary liquidation, it 
shall cause to be served on such credit union an order directing the 
suspension or revocation of its charter and directing that it be closed 
and placed into involuntary liquidation. Such order shall contain a 
statement of the findings upon which the order is based. Additionally, 
the NCUA Board shall appoint a liquidating agent or agents.
    (b) The NCUA Board shall render its decision and cause such order to 
be served not later than 45 days after receipt of consent, or written 
submissions as the case may be, or in the case of a formal hearing after 
service or the notice of submission referred to in Sec. 747.40(a).
    (c) Upon the receipt of a copy of the order which provides that the 
Federal credit union concerned be placed into involuntary liquidation, 
the officers and directors of that Federal credit union shall 
immediately deliver to the agent for the liquidating agent possession 
and control of all books, records, assets, and property of every

Sec. 747.601  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart contains the regulations of the NCUA implementing the 
Equal Access to Justice Act (5 U.S.C. 504), as amended (``EAJA''). The 
EAJA provides for the award of attorneys fees and other expenses to 
eligible individuals and entities who are parties to proceedings 
conducted under this part. An eligible party may receive an award when 
it prevails over NCUA in a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete 
substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the NCUA 
was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award 
unjust. The rules in this subpart describe the parties eligible for fee 
awards, explain how to apply for awards and the procedures and standards 
that NCUA will use to make them. To the extent a rule or procedure set 
forth in subpart A of this part is inconsistent with a rule or procedure 
set forth in this subpart G, subpart G will control.


<R05>
Sec. 747.602  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorneys fees and expenses, an 
applicant must be a prevailing party in the proceeding for which it 
seeks an award and must be:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests and not more than 500 employees at the time the proceeding was 
commenced

(an applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as 
an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an unincorporated 
business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related 
primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests);
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees; or
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or 
private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and 
not more than 500 employees.
    (b) For the purpose of determining eligibility, the net worth of an 
applicant and the number of employees of an applicant shall be 
determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.
    (c) The applicant's net worth includes the value of any assets 
disposed of for the purpose of meeting an eligibility standard and 
excludes any obligations incurred for this purpose. Transfers of assets 
or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value will 
be presumed to have been made for this purpose.
    (d) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control; part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (e) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
subpart, unless the NCUA Board determines that such treatment would be 
unjust and contrary to the purposes of the EAJA in light of the actual 
relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the NCUA 
board may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other 
than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances 
that would make an award unjust.
    (f) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.


<R05>
Sec. 747.603  Prevailing party.

    An eligible applicant may be a ``prevailing party'' if the applicant 
wins an action after a full hearing or trial on the merits, if a 
settlement of the proceeding was effected on terms favorable to it, or 
if the proceeding against it has been dismissed. In appropriate 
situations an applicant may also have prevailed if the outcome of the 
proceeding has substantially vindicated the applicant's position on the 
significant substantive matters at issue, even though the applicant has 
not totally avoided adverse final action.


<R05>
Sec. 747.604  Standards for award.

    (a) A prevailing party may receive an award for fees and expenses 
incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and 
discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, by or against NCUA 
unless the position of NCUA during the proceeding was substantially 
justified. The burden of proving that an award should not be made is on 
counsel for NCUA. To avoid an award, counsel for NCUA must show that its 
position was reasonable in law and in fact.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.
    (c) Where an applicant has prevailed on one or more discrete 
substantive issues in a proceeding, even though all the issues were not 
resolved in its favor, any award shall be based on the fees and expenses 
incurred in connection with the discrete significant substantive issue 
or issues on which the applicant's position has been upheld. If such 
segregation of costs is not practicable, the award may be based on a

[[Page 699]]

fair proration of those fees and expenses incurred in the entire 
proceeding which would be recoverable under this section if proration 
were not performed.
    (d) Whether separate or prorated treatment under the preceding 
paragraph, including the applicable proration percentage, is appropriate 
shall be determined on the facts of the particular case. Attention shall 
be given to the significance and nature of the respective issues and 
their separability and interrelationship.


<R05>
Sec. 747.605  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Except as provided by Sec. 747.604(b), awards will be based on 
rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting 
as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were 
made available without charge or at a reduced rate.
    (b) No award under this subpart for the fee of an attorney or agent 
may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may 
exceed the highest rate at which NCUA is permitted to pay expert 
witnesses. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of 
the attorney, agent or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, 
agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such 
expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent, or expert witness, the NCUA Board shall consider the 
following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent, or expert witness is in private 
practice, his or her customary fee for like services, or, if he or she 
is an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the 
services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily performs 
services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, 
project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of the party may be 
awarded to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.


<R05>
Sec. 747.606  Contents of application.

    (a) A prevailing eligible party, as defined in Sec. Sec. 747.602, 
747.603, and 747.604, seeking an award under this section, must file an 
application for an award of fees and expenses with the Secretary of the 
NCUA Board. The application shall include the following information:
    (1) The identity of the applicant and the proceeding for which an 
award is sought;
    (2) A showing that the applicant has prevailed and an identification 
of the issues in the proceeding on which the applicant believes that the 
position of NCUA was not substantially justified;
    (3) A statement, with supporting documentation, that the applicant 
is an eligible party, as defined by Sec. 747.602. If the applicant is 
an individual, he or she must state that his or her net worth does not 
exceed $2 million. If the applicant is not an individual, it shall state 
the number of its employees and that its net worth does not exceed $7 
million as of the date the proceeding was initiated. However, an 
applicant may omit a statement of net worth if:
    (i) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
such section; or
    (ii) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a));
    (4) A Statement of the amount of fees and expenses for which an 
award is sought; and
    (5) Any other matters that the applicant believes may assist or 
wishes the NCUA Board to consider in determining whether and in what 
amount an award should be made.
    (b) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a

[[Page 700]]

written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the 
information provided in the application is true and correct.
    (c) The application and documentation requirements of this subpart 
are required by law as a prerequisite to obtaining a benefit under the 
EAJA and this subpart.

[56 FR 37767, Aug. 8, 1991; 57 FR 523, Jan. 7, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 747.607  Statement of net worth.

    (a) Each applicant (other than a qualified tax exempt organization 
or cooperative association) must provide a detailed statement showing 
the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates, as defined in Sec. 
747.602(a), when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any 
form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the 
applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient 
to determine whether the applicant is an eligible party. The 
administrative law judge or the NCUA Board may require additional 
information from the applicant to determine eligibility. Unless 
otherwise ordered by the Board or required by law, the statement shall 
be kept confidential and used by the NCUA Board only in making its 
determination of an award.
    (b) If the applicant or any of its affiliates is a Federal credit 
union, the portion of the statement of net worth which relates to the 
Federal credit union shall consist of a copy of the Federal credit 
union's last Statement of Financial Condition filed before the 
initiation of the underlying proceeding.
    (c) All statements of net worth shall describe any transfers of 
assets from or obligations incurred by the applicant or any affiliate, 
occurring in the six-month period prior to the date on which the 
proceeding was initiated, which reduced the net worth of the applicant 
and its affiliates below the applicable net-worth ceiling. If there were 
none, the applicant shall so state.


<R05>
Sec. 747.608  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, audit, 
test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought. A 
separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional 
firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, 
showing hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each 
individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate 
at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The administrative law judge or the NCUA Board 
may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other 
substantiation for any expenses claimed.


<R05>
Sec. 747.609  Filing and service of applications.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the Board's 
final disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision on 
which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award 
of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying 
controversy.
    (c) As used in this subpart, final disposition means the issuance of 
a final order or any other final resolution of a proceeding, such as a 
settlement or voluntary dismissal.
    (d) Any application for an award of fees and expenses shall be filed 
with the Secretary of the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 
1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. Any application for an 
award and any other pleading or document related to an application, 
shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding in the same 
manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, except as provided in Sec. 
747.607(a) for statements of net worth.

[56 FR 37767, Aug. 8, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 36041, July 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 747.610  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel for NCUA 
may file

[[Page 701]]

an answer to the application. Unless counsel for NCUA requests and is 
granted an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent 
to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an 
answer within the 30-day period will be treated as a consent to the 
award requested.
    (b) If counsel for NCUA and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, 
and further extensions may be granted by the NCUA Board upon the joint 
request of counsel for NCUA and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of counsel's 
position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, counsel shall include with the answer a 
request for further proceedings under Sec. 747.613.
    (d)(1) The applicant may file a reply if counsel for NCUA has 
addressed in his or her answer any of the following issues:
    (i) That the position of NCUA in the proceeding was substantially 
justified;
    (ii) That the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings; or
    (iii) That special circumstances make an award unjust.
    (2) The reply shall be filed within 15 days after service of the 
answer. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply a 
request for further proceedings under Sec. 747.613.


<R05>
Sec. 747.611  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and counsel for 
NCUA may file comments on an application within 30 days after service of 
the application or on an answer within 15 days after service of the 
answer. A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on 
the application unless the administrative law judge or the NCUA Board 
determines that the public interest requires such participation in order 
to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comment.


<R05>
Sec. 747.612  Settlement.

    The applicant and counsel for NCUA may agree on a proposed 
settlement of the award before final action on the application, either 
in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after 
the underlying proceeding has been concluded, in accordance with NCUA's 
standard settlement procedure. If a prevailing party and counsel for 
NCUA agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application 
has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed 
settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 747.613  Further proceedings.

    (a) After the expiration of the time allowed for the filing of all 
documents necessary for the determination of a recommended fee award, 
the NCUA Board shall transmit the entire record to the administrative 
law judge who presided at the underlying proceeding. Ordinarily, the 
determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written 
record. However, on request of either the applicant or counsel for NCUA, 
or on its own initiative, the administrative law judge or the NCUA Board 
may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral 
argument, additional written submissions or an evidentiary hearing. Such 
further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair 
resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be 
conducted as promptly as possible.
    (b) A request that the administrative law judge or the NCUA Board 
order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify 
the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the 
additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.


<R05>
Sec. 747.614  Recommended decision.

    The administrative law judge shall file a recommended decision on 
the application with the NCUA Board within

[[Page 702]]

60 days after completion of the proceedings on the application. The 
recommended decision shall include written findings and conclusions on 
the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an 
explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount 
requested and the amount awarded. The recommended decision shall also 
include, if at issue, findings on whether NCUA's position was 
substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the 
proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If 
the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the 
recommended decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any 
award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the 
allocation made. The administrative law judge shall file with and 
certify to the NCUA Board the record of the proceeding on the fee 
application, the recommended decision and proposed order. Promptly upon 
such filing, the NCUA Board shall serve upon each party to the 
proceeding a copy of the administrative law judge's recommended 
decision, findings, conclusions and proposed order. The provisions of 
this section and Sec. 747.613 shall not apply, however, in any case 
where the hearing was held before the NCUA Board.


<R05>
Sec. 747.615  Decision of the NCUA Board.

    Within 15 days after service of the recommended decision, findings, 
conclusions, and proposed order, the applicant or counsel for NCUA may 
file with the NCUA Board written exceptions thereto. A supporting brief 
may also be filed. The NCUA Board shall render its decision within 60 
days after the matter is submitted to it. The NCUA Board shall furnish 
copies of its decision and order to the parties. Judicial review of the 
NCUA Board's final decision and order may be obtained as provided in 5 
U.S.C. 504(c)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 747.616  Payment of award.

    An applicant seeking payment of an award granted by the NCUA Board 
shall submit to the NCUA's Office of the Controller a copy of the NCUA 
Board's Final Decision and Order granting the award, accompanied by a 
statement that it will not seek review of the decision and order in the 
United States court. All submissions shall be addressed to the Office of 
the Controller, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, 
Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. The NCUA will pay the amount awarded within 
60 days after receiving the applicant's statement, unless judicial 
review of the award or of the underlying decision of the adversary 
adjudication has been sought by the applicant or any other party to the 
proceeding.

<R04>
    Subpart H_Local Rules and Procedures Applicable to Investigations


<R05>
Sec. 747.701  Applicability.

    The rules in this subpart apply only to informal and formal 
investigations conducted by the NCUA Board itself or its delegates. They 
do not apply to adjudicative or rulemaking proceedings or to routine, 
periodic or special examinations conducted by the NCUA Board's staff.


<R05>
Sec. 747.702  Information obtained in investigations.

    Information and documents obtained by the Board in the course of any 
investigation, unless made a matter of public record by the NCUA Board, 
shall be deemed non-public, but the NCUA Board approves the practice 
whereby the General Counsel may engage in, and may authorize any person 
acting on his or her behalf or at his or her direction to engage in, 
discussions with representatives of domestic or foreign governmental 
authorities, self-regulatory organizations, and with receivers, 
trustees, masters and special counsels or special agents appointed by 
and subject to the supervision of the courts of the United States, 
concerning information obtained in individual investigations, including 
investigations conducted pursuant to any order entered by the NCUA Board 
or its General Counsel pursuant to delegated authority.

[[Page 703]]


<R05>
Sec. 747.703  Authority to conduct investigations.

    (a) The General Counsel and persons acting on his or her behalf and 
at his or her direction may conduct such investigations into the affairs 
of any insured credit union or institution-affiliated parties as deemed 
appropriate to determine whether such credit union or party has 
violated, is violating or is about to violate any provision of the Act, 
the NCUA Board's regulations or other relevant statutes or regulations 
that may bear on a party's fitness to participate in the affairs of a 
credit union. The General Counsel and persons acting on his or her 
behalf may investigate whether any party is unfit to participate in the 
affairs of a credit union, whether formal enforcement proceedings are 
warranted, or such other matters as the General Counsel or his or her 
designee, in his or her discretion, shall deem appropriate. Such 
investigations may be conducted either informally or formally.
    (b) Formal investigations involve the exercise of the NCUA Board's 
subpoena power and are referred to here as formal investigative 
proceedings. In formal investigative proceedings, the General Counsel 
and those to whom he or she delegates authority to act on his or her 
behalf and at his or her direction have augmented investigatory powers 
and need not rely on the powers available to them in informal 
investigations, and they may gather evidence through the issuance of 
subpoenas compelling the production of documents or testimony as well. 
In informal investigations evidence may be gathered ordinarily through 
the use of investigatory procedures or credit union examinations and 
through voluntary statements and submissions.
    (c) The NCUA Board has delegated authority to the General Counsel, 
or designee thereof, to institute formal investigative proceedings by 
the entry of an order indicating the purpose of the investigation and 
the designation of persons to conduct that investigation on his or her 
behalf and at his or her direction. This delegation also extends to the 
NCUA Board's role as liquidator and conservator of insured credit 
unions. The power to issue a subpoena may not be delegated outside the 
agency. The General Counsel may amend such order as he deems 
appropriate.

[56 FR 37767, Aug. 8, 1991; 57 FR 523, Jan. 7, 1992]


<R04>
  Subpart I_Local Rules Applicable to Formal Investigative Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 747.801  Applicability.

    The rules in this subpart are applicable to a witness who is sworn 
in a formal investigative proceeding. Formal investigative proceedings 
may be held before the NCUA Board, before one or more of its members, or 
before any officer designated by the NCUA Board or its General Counsel, 
as described in subpart H of this part, and with or without the 
assistance of such other counsel as the NCUA Board deems appropriate, 
for the purpose of taking testimony of witnesses, conducting an 
investigation and receiving other evidence. The term ``officer 
conducting the investigation'' shall mean any of the foregoing.


<R05>
Sec. 747.802  Non-public formal investigative proceedings.

    Unless otherwise ordered by the NCUA Board, all formal investigative 
proceedings shall be non-public.


<R05>
Sec. 747.803  Subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. In the course of a formal investigative proceeding the 
officer conducting the investigation may issue a subpoena directing the 
party named therein to appear before the officer conducting the 
investigation at a specified time and place to testify or to produce 
documentary evidence, or both, relating to any matter under 
investigation.
    (b) Service. Service of subpoenas shall be effected in the following 
manner:
    (1) Service upon a natural party. Delivery of a copy of a subpoena 
to a natural person may be effected by--
    (i) Handling it to the person;
    (ii) Leaving it at his or her office with the person in charge 
thereof or, if there is no one in charge, by leaving it at a conspicuous 
place there;
    (iii) Leaving it at his or her dwelling place or usual place of 
abode with some

[[Page 704]]

person of suitable age and discretion who is found there; or
    (iv) Mailing it be registered or certified mail to him or her at his 
or her last known address. In the event that personal service as 
described in this paragraph is impracticable, any other method whereby 
actual notice is given to the respondent may be employed.
    (2) Service upon other persons. When the person to be served is not 
a natural person, delivery of a copy of the subpoena may be effected 
by--
    (i) Handing it to a registered agent for service, or to any officer, 
director, or agent in charge of any office of such person;
    (ii) Mailing it by registered or certified mail to any such 
representative at his or her last known address; or
    (iii) Any other method whereby actual notice is given to any such 
representative.
    (c) Witness fees and mileage. Witnesses appearing pursuant to 
subpoena shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to 
witnesses in the United States district courts. Any such fees and 
mileage payments need be paid only upon submission of a properly 
completed application for reimbursement and in no event need they be 
paid sooner than 30 days after the appearance of the witness pursuant to 
subpoena.
    (d) Enforcement. Whenever it appears to the General Counsel that any 
person upon whom a subpoena was properly served pursuant to these Rules 
is refusing to fully comply with the terms of that subpoena, then the 
General Counsel, in his or her discretion, may apply to the courts of 
the United States for enforcement of such subpoena.

[56 FR 37767, Aug. 8, 1991; 57 FR 523, Jan. 7, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 747.804  Oath; false statements.

    At the discretion of the officer conducting the investigation, 
testimony of a witness may be taken under oath and administered by the 
officer. Any person making false statements under oath during the course 
of a formal investigative proceeding is subject to the criminal 
penalties for perjury in 18 U.S.C. 1621. Any person who knowingly and 
willfully makes false and fraudulent statements, whether under oath or 
otherwise, or who falsifies, conceals or covers up any material fact, or 
submits any false, fictitious or fraudulent information in connection 
with such a proceeding, is subject to the criminal penalties set forth 
in 18 U.S.C. 1001.


<R05>
Sec. 747.805  Self-incrimination; immunity.

    (a) Self-incrimination. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, a witness testifying or otherwise giving information in a 
formal investigative proceeding may refuse to answer questions on the 
basis of his or her right against self-incrimination granted by the 
Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
    (b) Immunity. (1) No officer conducting any formal investigative 
proceeding (or any other informal investigation or examination) shall 
have the power to grant or promise any party any immunity from criminal 
prosecution under the laws of the United States or of any other 
jurisdiction.
    (2) If the NCUA Board believes that the testimony or other 
information sought to be obtained from any party may be necessary to the 
public interest and that party has refused or is likely to refuse to 
testify or provide other information on the basis of his or her 
privilege against self-incrimination, the NCUA Board, with the approval 
of the Attorney General, may issue an order requiring the party to give 
testimony or provide other information that he or she has previously 
refused to provide on the basis of self-incrimination.
    (3) Whenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his privilege 
against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in a 
formal investigative proceeding, and the officer conducting the 
investigation communicates to that person an order of the NCUA Board 
requiring him or her to testify or provide other information, the 
witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his or 
her privilege against self-incrimination; but no testimony or other 
information compelled under the order (or any information directly or 
indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used 
against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for 
perjury, giving a false

[[Page 705]]

statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.


<R05>
Sec. 747.806  Transcripts.

    Transcripts, if any, of formal investigative proceedings shall be 
recorded solely by the official reporter, or by any other person or 
means designated by the officer conducting the investigation. A party 
who has submitted documentary evidence or testimony in a formal 
investigative proceeding shall be entitled, upon written request, to 
procure a copy of his or her documentary evidence or a transcript of his 
or her testimony on payment of the appropriate fees; provided, however, 
that in a non-public formal investigative proceeding the NCUA Board may 
for good cause deny such request or the NCUA Board may place reasonable 
limitations upon the use of the documentary evidence and transcript. In 
any event, any witness, upon proper identification, shall have the right 
to inspect the official transcript of the witness's own testimony.


<R05>
Sec. 747.807  Rights of witnesses.

    (a) In the event that a formal investigative proceeding is conducted 
pursuant to a specific order entered by the NCUA Board or by its General 
Counsel, then any party who is compelled or requested to provide 
documentary evidence or testimony as part of such proceeding shall, upon 
request, be shown a copy of the NCUA Board's or its delegate's order. 
Copies of such orders shall not be provided for their retention to such 
persons requesting same except in the sole discretion of the General 
Counsel or his designee.
    (b) Any party compelled to appear, or who appears by request or 
permission of the officer conducting the investigation, in person at a 
formal investigative proceeding may be accompanied, represented and 
advised by counsel who is a member of the bar of the highest court of 
any state; provided however, that all witnesses in such proceeding shall 
be sequestered, and unless permitted in the discretion of the officer 
conducting the investigation, no witness or the counsel accompanying any 
such witness shall be permitted to be present during the examination of 
any other witness called in such proceeding.
    (c)(1) The right of a witness to be accompanied, represented and 
advised by counsel shall mean the right to have an attorney present 
during any formal investigative proceeding and to have the attorney--
    (i) Advise such person before, during and after such testimony;
    (ii) Question such person briefly at the conclusion of his testimony 
to clarify any answers such person has given; and
    (iii) Make summary notes during such testimony solely for the use of 
such person.
    (2) From time to time, in the discretion of the officer, it shall be 
necessary for persons other than the witness and his or her counsel to 
attend non-public investigative proceedings. For example, the officer 
may deem it appropriate that outside counsel to the NCUA Board attend 
and advise him or her concerning the proceeding including the 
examination of a particular witness. In these circumstances, outside 
counsel would not be an officer as that term is used. In other 
circumstances, it may be appropriate that a technical expert (such as an 
accountant) accompany the witness and his or her counsel in order to 
assist counsel in understanding technical issues. These latter 
circumstances should be rare, are left to the discretion of the officer 
conducting the investigation, and shall not in any event be allowed to 
serve as a ruse to coordinate testimony between witnesses, to oversee or 
supervise the testimony of any witnesses, or otherwise defeat the 
beneficial effects of the witness sequestration rule.
    (d) The officer conducting the investigation may report to the NCUA 
Board any instances where any witness or counsel has been guilty of 
dilatory, obstructionist or contumacious conduct during the course of a 
formal investigative proceeding or any other instance of violations of 
these rules. The NCUA Board will thereupon take such further action as 
the circumstance may warrant including barring the offending person from 
further participation in the particular formal investigative proceeding 
or even from further practice before the Board.

with respect to a notice submitted by a credit union pursuant to section 
212 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1790a) and Sec. 701.14 of this chapter, where 
the competence, experience character or integrity of the individual with 
respect to whom such notice is submitted indicates that it would not be 
in the best interest of the members of the credit union or the public to 
permit the individual to be employed by or associated with, such credit 
union.

Disapproval or a determination on a request for reconsideration by the 
Regional Director, the individual or credit union (henceforth 
petitioner) may appeal by filing with the NCUA Board a written request 
for appeal.
    (b) Contents of request. Any appeal must be in writing and include:
    (1) The reasons why the NCUA Board should review the disapproval; 
and
    (2) Relevant, substantive and material facts that for good cause 
were not previously set forth in the notice required to be filed 
pursuant to section 212 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1790a) and Sec. 701.14 of 
this chapter.
    (c) Procedures for review of request. Within 30 days of the NCUA 
Board's receipt of an appeal, the NCUA Board may request in writing that 
the petitioner submit additional facts and records to support the 
appeal. The petitioner shall have 15 days from the date of issuance of 
such written request to provide such additional information. Failure by 
the petitioner to provide additional information may, as determined 
solely by the NCUA Board or its designee, result in denial of the 
petitioner's appeal.

[[Page 707]]

designee shall notify the petitioner whether the disapproval will be 
continued, terminated, or otherwise modified. The NCUA Board or its 
designee shall promptly rescind or modify the notice of disapproval 
where the decision is favorable to the petitioner.
    (2) The determination by the NCUA Board on the appeal shall be 
provided to the petitioner in writing, stating the basis for any 
decision of the NCUA Board or its designee that is adverse to the 
petitioner, and shall constitute a final order of the NCUA Board.
    (3) Failure by the NCUA Board to issue a determination on the 
petitioner's appeal within the 90-day period prescribed under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section shall be deemed a denial of the appeal for 
purpose of Sec. 747.905.

<R05>
Sec. 747.905  Judicial review.

    (a) Failure to file an appeal within the applicable time periods, 
either to the initial determination or to the decision on a request for 
reconsideration, shall constitute a failure by the petitioner to exhaust 
available administrative remedies and, due to such failure, any 
objections to the initial determination or request for reconsideration 
shall be deemed to be waived and such determination shall be deemed to 
have been accepted by, and shall be binding upon, the petitioner.
    (b) For purposes of seeking judicial review of actions taken 
pursuant to this section, suit may be filed in the United States 
District Court for the district where the requester resides, for the 
district where the credit union's principal place of business is 
located, or for the District of Columbia.

  Subpart L_Issuance, Review and Enforcement of Orders Imposing Prompt 
                            Corrective Action

    Source: 65 FR 8594, Feb. 18, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 747.2001  Scope.

    (a) Independent review process. The rules and procedures set forth 
in this subpart apply to federally-insured credit unions, whether 
federally- or state-chartered (other than corporate credit unions), 
which are subject to discretionary supervisory actions under part 702 of 
this chapter, and to reclassification under Sec. Sec. 702.102(b) and 
702.302(d) of this chapter, to facilitate prompt corrective action under 
section 216 of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1790d; and to 
senior executive officers and directors of such credit unions who are 
dismissed pursuant to a discretionary supervisory action imposed under 
part 702. NCUA staff decisions to impose discretionary supervisory 
actions under part 702 shall be considered material supervisory 
determinations for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1790d(k). Section 747.2002 of 
this subpart provides an independent appellate process to challenge such 
decisions.
    (b) Notice to State officials. With respect to a federally-insured 
State-chartered credit union under Sec. Sec. 747.2002, 747.2003 and 
747.2004 of this subpart, notices, directives and decisions on appeal 
served upon a credit union, or a dismissed director or officer thereof, 
by the NCUA Board shall also be served upon the appropriate State 
official. Responses, requests for a hearing and to present witnesses, 
requests to modify or rescind a discretionary supervisory action and 
requests for reinstatement served upon the NCUA Board by a credit union, 
or dismissed director or officer thereof, shall also be served upon the 
appropriate State official.


<R05>
Sec. 747.2002  Review of orders imposing discretionary supervisory action.

    (a) Notice of intent to issue directive--(1) Generally. Whenever the 
NCUA Board intends to issue a directive imposing a discretionary 
supervisory action under Sec. Sec. 702.202(b), 702.203(b) and 
702.204(b) of this chapter on a credit union classified 
``undercapitalized'' or lower, or under Sec. Sec. 702.304(b) or 
702.305(b) of this chapter on a new credit union classified ``moderately 
capitalized'' or lower, it must give the credit union prior notice of 
the proposed action and an opportunity to respond.
    (2) Immediate issuance of directive without notice. The NCUA Board 
may issue a directive to take effect immediately under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section without notice to the credit union if the NCUA Board 
finds it necessary in order to carry out the purposes of part 702 of 
this chapter. A credit union that is subject to a directive which takes 
effect immediately may appeal the directive in writing to the NCUA 
Board. Such an appeal must be received by the NCUA Board within 14 
calendar days after the directive was issued, unless the NCUA Board 
permits a longer period. Unless ordered by the NCUA Board, the directive 
shall remain in effect pending a decision on the appeal. The NCUA Board 
shall consider any such appeal, if timely filed, within 60 calendar days 
of receiving it.
    (b) Contents of notice. The NCUA Board's notice to a credit union of 
its intention to issue a directive imposing a discretionary supervisory 
action must state:
    (1) The credit union's net worth ratio and net worth category 
classification;
    (2) The specific restrictions or requirements that the NCUA Board 
intends to impose, and the reasons therefor;
    (3) The proposed date when the discretionary supervisory action 
would take effect and the proposed date for completing the required 
action or terminating the action; and
    (4) That a credit union must file a written response to a notice 
within 14 calendar days from the date of the notice, or within such 
shorter period as the NCUA Board determines is appropriate in light of 
the financial condition of the credit union or other relevant 
circumstances.
    (c) Contents of response to notice. A credit union's response to a 
notice under paragraph (b) of this section must:
    (1) Explain why it contends that the proposed discretionary 
supervisory action is not an appropriate exercise of discretion under 
this part;

[[Page 709]]

    (2) Request the NCUA Board to modify or to not issue the proposed 
directive;
    (3) Include other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, 
documentation, or other evidence in support of the credit union's 
position regarding the proposed directive; and
    (4) If desired, request the recommendation of NCUA's ombudsman 
pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.
    (d) NCUA Board consideration of response. The NCUA Board, or an 
independent person designated by the NCUA Board to act on its behalf, 
after considering a response under paragraph (c) of this section, may:
    (1) Issue the directive as originally proposed or as modified;
    (2) Determine not to issue the directive and to so notify the credit 
union; or
    (3) Seek additional information or clarification from the credit 
union or any other relevant source.
    (e) Failure to file response. A credit union which fails to file a 
written response to a notice of the NCUA Board's intention to issue a 
directive imposing a discretionary supervisory action, within the 
specified time period, shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to 
respond, and to have consented to the issuance of the directive.
    (f) Request to modify or rescind directive. A credit union that is 
subject to an existing directive imposing a discretionary supervisory 
action may request in writing that the NCUA Board reconsider the terms 
of the directive, or rescind or modify it, due to changed circumstances. 
Unless otherwise ordered by the NCUA Board, the directive shall remain 
in effect while such request is pending. A request under this paragraph 
which remains pending 60 days following receipt by the NCUA Board is 
deemed granted.
    (g) Ombudsman. A credit union may request in writing the 
recommendation of NCUA's ombudsman to modify or to not issue a proposed 
directive under paragraph (b) of this section, or to modify or rescind 
an existing directive due to changed circumstances under paragraph (f) 
of this section. A credit union which fails to request the ombudsman's 
recommendation in a response under paragraph (c) of this section, or in 
a request under paragraph (f) of this section, shall be deemed to have 
waived the opportunity to do so. The ombudsman shall promptly notify the 
credit union and the NCUA Board of his or her recommendation.


<R05>
Sec. 747.2003  Review of order reclassifying a credit union on safety and soundness criteria.

    (a) Notice of proposed reclassification based on unsafe or unsound 
condition or practice. When the NCUA Board proposes to reclassify a 
credit union or subject it to the supervisory actions applicable to the 
next lower net worth category pursuant to Sec. Sec. 702.102(b) and 
702.302(d) of this chapter (each such action hereinafter referred to as 
``reclassification''), the NCUA Board shall issue and serve on the 
credit union reasonable prior notice of the proposed reclassification.
    (b) Contents of notice. A notice of intention to reclassify a credit 
union based on unsafe or unsound condition or practice shall state:
    (1) The credit union's net worth ratio, current net worth category 
classification, and the net worth category to which the credit union 
would be reclassified;
    (2) The unsafe or unsound practice(s) and/or condition(s) justifying 
reasons for reclassification of the credit union;
    (3) The date by which the credit union must file a written response 
to the notice (including a request for a hearing), which date shall be 
no less than 14 calendar days from the date of service of the notice 
unless the NCUA Board determines that a shorter period is appropriate in 
light of the financial condition of the credit union or other relevant 
circumstances; and
    (4) That a credit union which fails to--
    (i) File a written response to the notice of reclassification, 
within the specified time period, shall be deemed to have waived the 
opportunity to respond, and to have consented to reclassification;
    (ii) Request a hearing shall be deemed to have waived any right to a 
hearing; and
    (iii) Request the opportunity to present witness testimony shall be

[[Page 710]]

deemed have waived any right to present such testimony.
    (c) Contents of response to notice. A credit union's response to a 
notice under paragraph (b) of this section must:
    (1) Explain why it contends that the credit union should not be 
reclassified;
    (2) Include any relevant information, mitigating circumstances, 
documentation, or other evidence in support of the credit union's 
position;
    (3) If desired, request an informal hearing before the NCUA Board 
under this section; and
    (4) If a hearing is requested, identify any witness whose testimony 
the credit union wishes to present and the general nature of each 
witness's expected testimony.
    (d) Order to hold informal hearing. Upon timely receipt of a written 
response that includes a request for a hearing, the NCUA Board shall 
issue an order commencing an informal hearing no later than 30 days 
after receipt of the request, unless the credit union requests a later 
date. The hearing shall be held in Alexandria, Virginia, or at such 
other place as may be designated by the NCUA Board, before a presiding 
officer designated by the NCUA Board to conduct the hearing and to 
recommend a decision.
    (e) Procedures for informal hearing. (1) The credit union may appear 
at the hearing through a representative or through counsel. The credit 
union shall have the right to introduce relevant documents and to 
present oral argument at the hearing. The credit union may introduce 
witness testimony only if expressly authorized by the NCUA Board or the 
presiding officer. Neither the provisions of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) governing adjudications required by 
statute to be determined on the record nor the Uniform Rules of Practice 
and Procedure (12 CFR part 747) shall apply to an informal hearing under 
this section unless the NCUA Board orders otherwise.
    (2) The informal hearing shall be recorded, and a transcript shall 
be furnished to the credit union upon request and payment of the cost 
thereof. Witnesses need not be sworn, unless specifically requested by a 
party or by the presiding officer. The presiding officer may ask 
questions of any witness.
    (3) The presiding officer may order that the hearing be continued 
for a reasonable period following completion of witness testimony or 
oral argument to allow additional written submissions to the hearing 
record.
    (4) Within 20 calendar days following the closing of the hearing and 
the record, the presiding officer shall make a recommendation to the 
NCUA Board on the proposed reclassification.
    (f) Time for final decision. Not later than 60 calendar days after 
the date the record is closed, or the date of receipt of the credit 
union's response in a case where no hearing was requested, the NCUA 
Board will decide whether to reclassify the credit union, and will 
notify the credit union of its decision. The decision of the NCUA Board 
shall be final.
    (g) Request to rescind reclassification. Any credit union that has 
been reclassified under this section may file a written request to the 
NCUA Board to reconsider or rescind the reclassification, or to modify, 
rescind or remove any directives issued as a result of the 
reclassification. Unless otherwise ordered by the NCUA Board, the credit 
union shall remain reclassified, and subject to any directives issued as 
a result, while such request is pending.
    (h) Non-delegation. The NCUA Board may not delegate its authority to 
reclassify a credit union into a lower net worth category or to treat a 
credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 702.102(b) or 702.302(d) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 747.2004  Review of order to dismiss a director or senior executive officer.

    (a) Service of directive to dismiss and notice. When the NCUA Board 
issues and serves a directive on a credit union requiring it to dismiss 
from office any director or senior executive officer under Sec. Sec. 
702.202(b)(7), 702.203(b)(8), 702.204(b)(8), 702.304(b) or 702.305(b) of 
this chapter, the NCUA Board shall also serve upon the person the credit 
union is directed to dismiss (Respondent) a copy of the directive (or 
the relevant portions, where appropriate) and notice of the Respondent's 
right to seek reinstatement.

[[Page 711]]

    (b) Contents of notice of right to seek reinstatement. A notice of a 
Respondent's right to seek reinstatement shall state:
    (1) That a request for reinstatement (including a request for a 
hearing) shall be filed with the NCUA Board within 14 calendar days 
after the Respondent receives the directive and notice under paragraph 
(a) of this section, unless the NCUA Board grants the Respondent's 
request for further time;
    (2) The reasons for dismissal of the Respondent; and
    (3) That the Respondent's failure to--
    (i) Request reinstatement shall be deemed a waiver of any right to 
seek reinstatement;
    (ii) Request a hearing shall be deemed a waiver of any right to a 
hearing; and
    (iii) Request the opportunity to present witness testimony shall be 
deemed a waiver of the right to present such testimony.
    (c) Contents of request for reinstatement. A request for 
reinstatement in response to a notice under paragraph (b) of this 
section must:
    (1) Explain why the Respondent should be reinstated;
    (2) Include any relevant information, mitigating circumstances, 
documentation, or other evidence in support of the Respondent's 
position;
    (3) If desired, request an informal hearing before the NCUA Board 
under this section; and
    (4) If a hearing is requested, identify any witness whose testimony 
the Respondent wishes to present and the general nature of each 
witness's expected testimony.
    (d) Order to hold informal hearing. Upon receipt of a timely written 
request from a Respondent for an informal hearing on the portion of a 
directive requiring a credit union to dismiss from office any director 
or senior executive officer, the NCUA Board shall issue an order 
directing an informal hearing to commence no later than 30 days after 
receipt of the request, unless the Respondent requests a later date. The 
hearing shall be held in Alexandria, Virginia, or at such other place as 
may be designated by the NCUA Board, before a presiding officer 
designated by the NCUA Board to conduct the hearing and recommend a 
decision.
    (e) Procedures for informal hearing. (1) A Respondent may appear at 
the hearing personally or through counsel. A Respondent shall have the 
right to introduce relevant documents and to present oral argument at 
the hearing. A Respondent may introduce witness testimony only if 
expressly authorized by the NCUA Board or by the presiding officer. 
Neither the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 
554-557) governing adjudications required by statute to be determined on 
the record nor the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (12 CFR part 
747) apply to an informal hearing under this section unless the NCUA 
Board orders otherwise.
    (2) The informal hearing shall be recorded, and a transcript shall 
be furnished to the Respondent upon request and payment of the cost 
thereof. Witnesses need not be sworn, unless specifically requested by a 
party or the presiding officer. The presiding officer may ask questions 
of any witness.
    (3) The presiding officer may order that the hearing be continued 
for a reasonable period following completion of witness testimony or 
oral argument to allow additional written submissions to the hearing 
record.
    (4) A Respondent shall bear the burden of demonstrating that his or 
her continued employment by or service with the credit union would 
materially strengthen the credit union's ability to--
    (i) Become ``adequately capitalized,'' to the extent that the 
directive was issued as a result of the credit union's net worth 
category classification or its failure to submit or implement a net 
worth restoration plan or revised business plan; and
    (ii) Correct the unsafe or unsound condition or unsafe or unsound 
practice, to the extent that the directive was issued as a result of 
reclassification of the credit union pursuant to Sec. Sec. 702.102(b) 
and 702.302(d) of this chapter.
    (5) Within 20 calendar days following the date of closing of the 
hearing and the record, the presiding officer shall make a 
recommendation to the NCUA

[[Page 712]]

Board concerning the Respondent's request for reinstatement with the 
credit union.
    (f) Time for final decision. Not later than 60 calendar days after 
the date the record is closed, or the date of the response in a case 
where no hearing was requested, the NCUA Board shall grant or deny the 
request for reinstatement and shall notify the Respondent of its 
decision. If the NCUA Board denies the request for reinstatement, it 
shall set forth in the notification the reasons for its decision. The 
decision of the NCUA Board shall be final.
    (g) Effective date. Unless otherwise ordered by the NCUA Board, the 
Respondent's dismissal shall take and remain in effect pending a final 
decision on the request for reinstatement.


<R05>
Sec. 747.2005  Enforcement of orders.

    (a) Judicial remedies. Whenever a credit union fails to comply with 
a directive imposing a discretionary supervisory action, or enforcing a 
mandatory supervisory action under part 702 of this chapter, the NCUA 
Board may seek enforcement of the directive in the appropriate United 
States District Court pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(k)(1).
    (b) Administrative remedies--(1) Failure to comply with directive. 
Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(k)(2)(A), the NCUA Board may assess a civil 
money penalty against any credit union that violates or otherwise fails 
to comply with any final directive issued under part 702 of this 
chapter, or against any institution-affiliated party of a credit union 
(per 12 U.S.C. 1786(r)) who participates in such violation or 
noncompliance.
    (2) Failure to implement plan. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(k)(2)(A), 
the NCUA Board may assess a civil money penalty against a credit union 
which fails to implement a net worth restoration plan under subpart B of 
part 702 of this chapter or a revised business plan under subpart C of 
part 702, regardless whether the plan was published.
    (c) Other enforcement action. In addition to the actions described 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the NCUA Board may seek 
enforcement of the directives issued under part 702 of this chapter 
through any other judicial or administrative proceeding authorized by 
law.

2005]


<R05>
Sec. 748.1  Filing of reports.

    (a) Compliance report. Each federally insured credit union shall 
file with the regional director an annual statement certifying its 
compliance with the requirements of this part. The statement shall be 
dated and signed by the president or other managing officer of the 
credit union. The statement is contained on the Report of Officials 
which is submitted annually by federally insured credit unions after the 
election of officials. In the case of federally insured state-chartered 
credit unions, this statement can be mailed to the regional director via 
the state supervisory authority, if desired. In any event, a copy of the 
statement shall always be sent to the appropriate state supervisory 
authority.
    (b) Catastrophic act report. Each federally insured credit union 
will notify the regional director within 5 business days of any 
catastrophic act that occurs at its office(s). A catastrophic act is any 
disaster, natural or otherwise, resulting in physical destruction or 
damage to the credit union or causing an interruption in vital member 
services, as defined in Sec. 749.1 of this chapter, projected to last 
more than two consecutive business days. Within a reasonable time after 
a catastrophic act occurs, the credit union shall ensure that a record 
of the incident is prepared and filed at its main office. In the 
preparation of such record, the credit union should include information 
sufficient to indicate the office where the catastrophic act occurred; 
when it took place; the amount of the loss, if any; whether any 
operational or mechanical deficiency(ies) might have contributed to the 
catastrophic act; and what has been done or is planned to be done to 
correct the deficiency(ies).
    (c) Suspicious Activity Report. A credit union must file a report if 
it knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that any crime or any 
suspicious transaction related to money laundering activity or a 
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act has occurred. For the purposes of this 
paragraph (c) credit union means a federally-insured credit union and 
official means any member of the board of directors or a volunteer 
committee.
    (1) Reportable activity. Transaction for purposes of this paragraph 
means a deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, exchange of 
currency, loan, extension of credit, purchase or sale of any stock, 
bond, share certificate, or other monetary instrument or investment 
security, or any other payment, transfer, or delivery by, through, or to 
a financial institution, by whatever means effected. A credit union must 
report any known or suspected crime or any suspicious transaction 
related to money laundering or other illegal activity, for example, 
terrorism financing, loan fraud, or embezzlement, or a violation of the 
Bank Secrecy Act by sending a completed suspicious activity report (SAR) 
to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the following 
circumstances:
    (i) Insider abuse involving any amount. Whenever the credit union 
detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violations, or pattern 
of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the credit union 
or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the credit 
union, where the credit union believes it was either an actual or 
potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal 
violations, or that the credit union was used to facilitate a criminal 
transaction, and the credit union has a substantial basis for 
identifying one of the credit union's officials, employees, or agents as 
having committed or aided in the commission of the criminal violation, 
regardless of the amount involved in the violation;
    (ii) Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more where a suspect can be 
identified. Whenever the credit union detects any known or suspected 
Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed 
or attempted against the credit union or involving a transaction or 
transactions conducted through the credit union, and involving or 
aggregating $5,000 or more in funds

[[Page 714]]

or other assets, where the credit union believes it was either an actual 
or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal 
violations, or that the credit union was used to facilitate a criminal 
transaction, and the credit union has a substantial basis for 
identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. If it is determined 
before filing this report that the identified suspect or group of 
suspects has used an alias, then information regarding the true identity 
of the suspect or group of suspects, as well as alias identifiers, such 
as drivers' licenses or social security numbers, addresses and telephone 
numbers, must be reported;
    (iii) Transactions aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of 
potential suspects. Whenever the credit union detects any known or 
suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, 
committed or attempted against the credit union or involving a 
transaction or transactions conducted through the credit union, 
involving or aggregating $25,000 or more in funds or other assets, where 
the credit union believes it was either an actual or potential victim of 
a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the 
credit union was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, even though 
the credit union has no substantial basis for identifying a possible 
suspect or group of suspects; or
    (iv) Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential 
money laundering or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Any transaction 
conducted or attempted by, at or through the credit union and involving 
or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the credit 
union knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect:
    (A) The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities 
or is intended or conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets 
derived from illegal activities (including, without limitation, the 
ownership, nature, source, location, or control of such funds or assets) 
as part of a plan to violate or evade any Federal law or regulation or 
to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under Federal law;
    (B) The transaction is designed to evade any regulations promulgated 
under the Bank Secrecy Act; or
    (C) The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is 
not the sort of transaction in which the particular member would 
normally be expected to engage, and the credit union knows of no 
reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available 
facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.
    (v) Exceptions. A credit union is not required to file a SAR for a 
robbery or burglary committed or attempted that is reported to 
appropriate law enforcement authorities, or for lost, missing, 
counterfeit, or stolen securities and the credit union files a report 
pursuant to the reporting requirements of 17 CFR 240.17f-1.
    (2) Filing Procedures. (i) Timing. A credit union must file a SAR 
with FinCEN no later than 30 calendar days from the date the suspicious 
activity is initially detected, unless there is no identified suspect on 
the date of detection. If no suspect is identified on the date of 
detection, a credit union may use an additional 30 calendar days to 
identify a suspect before filing a SAR. In no case may a credit union 
take more than 60 days from the date it initially detects a reportable 
transaction to file a SAR. In situations involving violations requiring 
immediate attention, such as ongoing money laundering schemes, a credit 
union must immediately notify, by telephone, an appropriate law 
enforcement authority and its supervisory authority, in addition to 
filing a SAR.
    (ii) Content. A credit union must complete, fully and accurately, 
SAR form TDF 90-22.47, Suspicious Activity Report (also known as NCUA 
Form 2362) in accordance with the form's instructions and 31 CFR Part 
103.18. A copy of the SAR form may be obtained from the credit union 
resources section of NCUA's Web site, http://www.ncua.gov, or the 
regulatory section of FinCEN's Web site, http://www.fincen.gov. These 
sites include other useful guidance on SARs, for example, forms and 
filing instructions, Frequently Asked Questions, and the FFIEC Bank 
Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual.
    (iii) Compliance. Failure to file a SAR as required by the form's 
instructions

[[Page 715]]

and 31 CFR Part 103.18 may subject the credit union, its officials, 
employees, and agents to the assessment of civil money penalties or 
other administrative actions.
    (3) Retention of Records. A credit union must maintain a copy of any 
SAR that it files and the original or business record equivalent of all 
supporting documentation to the report for a period of five years from 
the date of the report. Supporting documentation must be identified and 
maintained by the credit union as such. Supporting documentation is 
considered a part of the filed report even though it should not be 
actually filed with the submitted report. A credit union must make all 
supporting documentation available to appropriate law enforcement 
authorities and its regulatory supervisory authority upon request.
    (4) Notification to board of directors. (i) Generally. The 
management of the credit union must promptly notify its board of 
directors, or a committee designated by the board of directors to 
receive such notice, of any SAR filed.
    (ii) Suspect is a director or committee member. If a credit union 
files a SAR and the suspect is a director or member of a committee 
designated by the board of directors to receive notice of SAR filings, 
the credit union may not notify the suspect, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 
5318(g)(2), but must notify the remaining directors, or designated 
committee members, who are not suspects.
    (5) Confidentiality of reports. SARs are confidential. Any credit 
union, including its officials, employees, and agents, subpoenaed or 
otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the information in a SAR must 
decline to produce the SAR or to provide any information that would 
disclose that a SAR was prepared or filed, citing this part, applicable 
law, for example, 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), or both, and notify NCUA of the 
request. A credit union must make the filed report and all supporting 
documentation available to appropriate law enforcement authorities and 
its regulatory supervisory authority upon request.
    (6) Safe Harbor. Any credit union, including its officials, 
employees, and agents, that makes a report of suspected or known 
criminal violations and suspicious activities to law enforcement and 
financial institution supervisory authorities, including supporting 
documentation, are protected from liability for any disclosure in the 
report, or for failure to disclose the existence of the report, or both, 
to the full extent provided by 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3). This protection 
applies if the report is filed pursuant to this part or is filed on a 
voluntary basis.

                             I. Introduction

    The Guidelines for Safeguarding Member Information (Guidelines) set 
forth standards pursuant to sections 501 and 505(b), codified at 15 
U.S.C. 6801 and 6805(b), of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These Guidelines 
provide guidance standards for developing and implementing 
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the 
security, confidentiality, and integrity of member information. These 
Guidelines also address standards with respect to the proper disposal of 
consumer information pursuant to sections 621(b) and 628 of the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s(b) and 1681w).
    A. Scope. The Guidelines apply to member information maintained by 
or on behalf of federally-insured credit unions. Such entities are 
referred to in this appendix as ``the credit union.'' These Guidelines 
also apply to the proper disposal of consumer information by such 
entities.
    B. Definitions. 1. In general. Except as modified in the Guidelines 
or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms used in these 
Guidelines have the same meanings as set forth in 12 CFR part 716.
    2. For purposes of the Guidelines, the following definitions apply:
    a. Consumer information means any record about an individual, 
whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is a consumer report 
or is derived from a consumer report and that is maintained or otherwise 
possessed by or on behalf of the credit union for a business purpose. 
Consumer information also means a compilation of such records. The term 
does not include any record that does not identify an individual.
    b. Consumer report has the same meaning as set forth in the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681a(d). The meaning of consumer report 
is broad and subject to various definitions, conditions and exceptions 
in the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It includes written or oral 
communications from a consumer reporting agency to a third party of 
information used or collected for use in establishing eligibility for 
credit or insurance used primarily for personal, family or household 
purposes, and eligibility for employment purposes. Examples include 
credit reports, bad check lists, and tenant screening reports.
    c. Member means any member of the credit union as defined in 12 CFR 
716.3(n).
    d. Member information means any records containing nonpublic 
personal information, as defined in 12 CFR 716.3(q), about a member, 
whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is maintained by or on 
behalf of the credit union.
    e. Member information system means any method used to access, 
collect, store, use, transmit, protect, or dispose of member 
information.
    f. Service provider means any person or entity that maintains, 
processes, or otherwise is permitted access to member information 
through its provision of services directly to the credit union.

            II. Standards for Safeguarding Member Information

    A. Information Security Program. A comprehensive written information 
security program includes administrative, technical, and physical 
safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the credit union 
and the nature and scope of its activities. While all parts of the 
credit union are not required to

[[Page 717]]

implement a uniform set of policies, all elements of the information 
security program must be coordinated.
    B. Objectives. A credit union's information security program should 
be designed to: ensure the security and confidentiality of member 
information; protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the 
security or integrity of such information; protect against unauthorized 
access to or use of such information that could result in substantial 
harm or inconvenience to any member; and ensure the proper disposal of 
member information and consumer information. Protecting confidentiality 
includes honoring members' requests to opt out of disclosures to 
nonaffiliated third parties, as described in 12 CFR 716.1(a)(3).

   III. Development and Implementation of Member Information Security 
                                 Program

    A. Involve the Board of Directors. The board of directors or an 
appropriate committee of the board of each credit union should:
    1. Approve the credit union's written information security policy 
and program; and
    2. Oversee the development, implementation, and maintenance of the 
credit union's information security program, including assigning 
specific responsibility for its implementation and reviewing reports 
from management.
    B. Assess Risk. Each credit union should:
    1. Identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats 
that could result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or 
destruction of member information or member information systems;
    2. Assess the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, 
taking into consideration the sensitivity of member information; and
    3. Assess the sufficiency of policies, procedures, member 
information systems, and other arrangements in place to control risks.
    C. Manage and Control Risk. Each credit union should:
    1. Design its information security program to control the identified 
risks, commensurate with the sensitivity of the information as well as 
the complexity and scope of the credit union's activities. Each credit 
union must consider whether the following security measures are 
appropriate for the credit union and, if so, adopt those measures the 
credit union concludes are appropriate:
    a. Access controls on member information systems, including controls 
to authenticate and permit access only to authorized individuals and 
controls to prevent employees from providing member information to 
unauthorized individuals who may seek to obtain this information through 
fraudulent means;
    b. Access restrictions at physical locations containing member 
information, such as buildings, computer facilities, and records storage 
facilities to permit access only to authorized individuals;
    c. Encryption of electronic member information, including while in 
transit or in storage on networks or systems to which unauthorized 
individuals may have access;
    d. Procedures designed to ensure that member information system 
modifications are consistent with the credit union's information 
security program;
    e. Dual controls procedures, segregation of duties, and employee 
background checks for employees with responsibilities for or access to 
member information;
    f. Monitoring systems and procedures to detect actual and attempted 
attacks on or intrusions into member information systems;
    g. Response programs that specify actions to be taken when the 
credit union suspects or detects that unauthorized individuals have 
gained access to member information systems, including appropriate 
reports to regulatory and law enforcement agencies; and
    h. Measures to protect against destruction, loss, or damage of 
member information due to potential environmental hazards, such as fire 
and water damage or technical failures.
    2. Train staff to implement the credit union's information security 
program.
    3. Regularly test the key controls, systems and procedures of the 
information security program. The frequency and nature of such tests 
should be determined by the credit union's risk assessment. Tests should 
be conducted or reviewed by independent third parties or staff 
independent of those that develop or maintain the security programs.
    4. Develop, implement, and maintain, as part of its information 
security program, appropriate measures to properly dispose of member 
information and consumer information in accordance with the provisions 
in paragraph III.
    D. Oversee Service Provider Arrangements. Each credit union should:
    1. Exercise appropriate due diligence in selecting its service 
providers;
    2. Require its service providers by contract to implement 
appropriate measures designed to meet the objectives of these 
guidelines; and
    3. Where indicated by the credit union's risk assessment, monitor 
its service providers to confirm that they have satisfied their 
obligations as required by paragraph D.2. As part of this monitoring, a 
credit union should review audits, summaries of test results, or other 
equivalent evaluations of its service providers.
    E. Adjust the Program. Each credit union should monitor, evaluate, 
and adjust, as appropriate, the information security program

[[Page 718]]

in light of any relevant changes in technology, the sensitivity of its 
member information, internal or external threats to information, and the 
credit union's own changing business arrangements, such as mergers and 
acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures, outsourcing arrangements, 
and changes to member information systems.
    F. Report to the Board. Each credit union should report to its board 
or an appropriate committee of the board at least annually. This report 
should describe the overall status of the information security program 
and the credit union's compliance with these guidelines. The report 
should discuss material matters related to its program, addressing 
issues such as: risk assessment; risk management and control decisions; 
service provider arrangements; results of testing; security breaches or 
violations and management's responses; and recommendations for changes 
in the information security program.
    G. Implement the Standards.
    1. Effective date. Each credit union must implement an information 
security program pursuant to the objectives of these Guidelines by July 
1, 2001.
    2. Two-year grandfathering of agreements with service providers. 
Until July 1, 2003, a contract that a credit union has entered into with 
a service provider to perform services for it or functions on its behalf 
satisfies the provisions of paragraph III.D., even if the contract does 
not include a requirement that the servicer maintain the security and 
confidentiality of member information, as long as the credit union 
entered into the contract on or before March 1, 2001.
    3. Effective date for measures relating to the disposal of consumer 
information. Each Federal credit union must properly dispose of consumer 
information in a manner consistent with these Guidelines by July 1, 
2005.
    4. Exception for existing agreements with service providers relating 
to the disposal of consumer information. Notwithstanding the requirement 
in paragraph III.G.3., a Federal credit union's existing contracts with 
its service providers with regard to any service involving the disposal 
of consumer information should implement the objectives of these 
Guidelines by July 1, 2006.

     Sec. Appendix B to Part 748--Guidance on Response Programs for 
       Unauthorized Access to Member Information and Member Notice

                              I. Background

    This Guidance in the form of Appendix B to NCUA's Security Program, 
Report of Crime and Catastrophic Act and Bank Secrecy Act Compliance 
regulation,\29\ interprets section 501(b) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
(``GLBA'') and describes response programs, including member 
notification procedures, that a federally insured credit union should 
develop and implement to address unauthorized access to or use of member 
information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a 
member. The scope of, and definitions of terms used in, this Guidance 
are identical to those of Appendix A to Part 748 (Appendix A). For 
example, the term ``member information'' is the same term used in 
Appendix A, and means any record containing nonpublic personal 
information about a member, whether in paper, electronic, or other form, 
maintained by or on behalf of the credit union.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ 12 CFR Part 748.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         A. Security Guidelines

    Section 501(b) of the GLBA required the NCUA to establish 
appropriate standards for credit unions subject to its jurisdiction that 
include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect 
the security and confidentiality of member information. Accordingly, the 
NCUA amended Part 748 of its rules to require credit unions to develop 
appropriate security programs, and issued Appendix A, reflecting its 
expectation that every federally insured credit union would develop an 
information security program designed to:
    1. Ensure the security and confidentiality of member information;
    2. Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the 
security or integrity of such information; and
    3. Protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information 
that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any member.

                     B. Risk Assessment and Controls

    1. Appendix A directs every credit union to assess the following 
risks, among others, when developing its information security program:
    a. Reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats that could 
result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of 
member information or member information systems;
    b. The likelihood and potential damage of threats, taking into 
consideration the sensitivity of member information; and
    c. The sufficiency of policies, procedures, member information 
systems, and other arrangements in place to control risks.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ See 12 CFR Part 748, Appendix A, Paragraph III.B.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Following the assessment of these risks, Appendix A directs a 
credit union to design a program to address the identified risks.

[[Page 719]]

The particular security measures a credit union should adopt will depend 
upon the risks presented by the complexity and scope of its business. At 
a minimum, the credit union should consider the specific security 
measures enumerated in Appendix A,\31\ and adopt those that are 
appropriate for the credit union, including:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See Appendix A, paragraph III.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    a. Access controls on member information systems, including controls 
to authenticate and permit access only to authorized individuals and 
controls to prevent employees from providing member information to 
unauthorized individuals who may seek to obtain this information through 
fraudulent means;
    b. Background checks for employees with responsibilities for access 
to member information; and
    c. Response programs that specify actions to be taken when the 
credit union suspects or detects that unauthorized individuals have 
gained access to member information systems, including appropriate 
reports to regulatory and law enforcement agencies.\32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ See Appendix A, Paragraph III.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          C. Service Providers

    Appendix A advises every credit union to require its service 
providers by contract to implement appropriate measures designed to 
protect against unauthorized access to or use of member information that 
could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any member.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See Appendix A, Paragraph III.B. and III.D. Further, the NCUA 
notes that, in addition to contractual obligations to a credit union, a 
service provider may be required to implement its own comprehensive 
information security program in accordance with the Safeguards Rule 
promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC''), 12 CFR Part 314.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          II. Response Program

    i. Millions of Americans, throughout the country, have been victims 
of identity theft.\34\ Identity thieves misuse personal information they 
obtain from a number of sources, including credit unions, to perpetrate 
identity theft. Therefore, credit unions should take preventative 
measures to safeguard member information against such attempts to gain 
unauthorized access to the information. For example, credit unions 
should place access controls on member information systems and conduct 
background checks for employees who are authorized to access member 
information.\35\ However, every credit union should also develop and 
implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of 
unauthorized access to member information in member information systems 
that occur nonetheless.\36\ A response program should be a key part of a 
credit union's information security program.\37\ The program should be 
appropriate to the size and complexity of the credit union and the 
nature and scope of its activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ The FTC estimates that nearly 10 million Americans discovered 
they were victims of some form of identify theft in 2002. See The 
Federal Trade Commission, Identity Theft Survey Report, (September 
2003), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/09synovatereport.pdf.
    \35\ Credit unions should also conduct background checks of 
employees to ensure that the credit union does not violate 12 U.S.C. 
1785(d), which prohibits a credit union from hiring an individual 
convicted of certain criminal offenses or who is subject to a 
prohibition order under 12 U.S.C. 1786(g).
    \36\ Under 12 CFR Part 748, Appendix A, a credit union's member 
information systems consists of all of the methods used to access, 
collect, store, use, transmit, protect, or dispose of member 
information, including the systems maintained by its service providers. 
See 12 CFR Part 748, Appendix A, Paragraph I.C.2.d.
    \37\ See FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook, 
Information Security Booklet, (December, 2002), available at http://
www.ffiec.gov/ffiecinfobase/html--pages/it--01.htm1#infosec, for 
additional guidance on preventing, detecting, and responding to 
intrusions into financial institution computer systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ii. In addition, each credit union should be able to address 
incidents of unauthorized access to member information in member 
information systems maintained by its domestic and foreign service 
providers. Therefore, consistent with the obligations in this Guidance 
that relate to these arrangements, and with existing guidance on this 
topic issued by the NCUA,\38\ a credit union's contract with its service 
provider should require the service provider to take appropriate actions 
to address incidents of unauthorized access to or use of the credit 
union's member information, including notification of the credit union 
as soon as possible of any such incident, to enable the institution to 
expeditiously implement its response program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ See FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook, 
Outsourcing Technology Services Booklet, (June 2004), available at 
http://www.ffiec.gov/ffiecinfobase/html--pages/it--01.htm1#outscouring 
for additional guidance on managing outsourced relationships.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   A. Components of a Response Program

    1. At a minimum, a credit union's response program should contain 
procedures for the following:

[[Page 720]]

    a. Assessing the nature and scope of an incident, and identifying 
what member information systems and types of member information have 
been accessed or misused;
    b. Notifying the appropriate NCUA Regional Director, and, in the 
case of state-chartered credit unions, its applicable state supervisory 
authority, as soon as possible when the credit union becomes aware of an 
incident involving unauthorized access to or use of sensitive member 
information as defined below.
    c. Consistent with the NCUA's Suspicious Activity Report (``SAR'') 
regulations,\39\ notifying appropriate law enforcement authorities, in 
addition to filing a timely SAR in situations involving Federal criminal 
violations requiring immediate attention, such as when a reportable 
violation is ongoing;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ A credit union's obligation to file a SAR is set out in the 
NCUA's SAR regulations and guidance. See 12 CFR Part 748.1(c); NCUA 
Letter to Credit Unions No. 04-CU-03, Suspiciouis Activity Reports, 
March 2004; NCUA Regulatory Alert No. 04-RA-01, The Suspicious Activity 
Report (SAR) Activity Review--Trends, Tips, & Isues, Issue 6, November 
2003, February 2004.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    d. Taking appropriate steps to contain and control the incident to 
prevent further unauthorized access to or use of member information, for 
example, by monitoring, freezing, or closing affected accounts, while 
preserving records and other evidence; \40\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \40\ See FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook, 
Information Security Booklet, (December 2002), pp. 68-74.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    e. Notifying members when warranted.
    2. Where an incident of unauthorized access to member information 
involves member information systems maintained by a credit union's 
service providers, it is the responsibility of the credit union to 
notify the credit union's members and regulator. However, a credit union 
may authorize or contract with its service provider to notify the credit 
union's members or regulators on its behalf.

                           III. Member Notice

    i. Credit unions have an affirmative duty to protect their members' 
information against unauthorized access or use. Notifying members of a 
security incident involving the unauthorized access or use of the 
member's information in accordance with the standard set forth below is 
a key part of that duty.
    ii. Timely notification of members is important to manage a credit 
union's reputation risk. Effective notice also may reduce a credit 
union's legal risk, assist in maintaining good member relations, and 
enable the credit union's members to take steps to protect themselves 
against the consequences of identity theft. When member notification is 
warranted, a credit union may not forgo notifying its customers of an 
incident because the credit union believes that it may be potentially 
embarrassed or inconvenienced by doing so.

                    A. Standard for Providing Notice

    When a credit union becomes aware of an incident of unauthorized 
access to sensitive member information, the credit union should conduct 
a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that the 
information has been or will be misused. If the credit union determines 
that misuse of its information about a member has occurred or is 
reasonably possible, it should notify the affected member as soon as 
possible. Member notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement 
agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal 
investigation and provides the credit union with a written request for 
the delay. However, the credit union should notify its members as soon 
as notification will no longer interfere with the investigation.

                     1. Sensitive Member Information

    Under Part 748.0, a credit union must protect against unauthorized 
access to or use of member information that could result in substantial 
harm or inconvenience to any member. Substantial harm or inconvenience 
is most likely to result from improper access to sensitive member 
information because this type of information is most likely to be 
misused, as in the commission of identity theft.
    For purposes of this Guidance, sensitive member information means a 
member's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the 
member's social security number, driver's license number, account 
number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number 
or password that would permit access to the member's account. Sensitive 
member information also includes any combination of components of member 
information that would allow someone to log onto or access the member's 
account, such as user name and password or password and account number.

                           2. Affected Members

    If a credit union, based upon its investigation, can determine from 
its logs or other data precisely which members' information has been 
improperly accessed, it may limit notification to those members with 
regard to whom the credit union determines that misuse of their 
information has occurred or is reasonably possible. However, there may 
be situations where the credit union determines that a group of files 
has been accessed improperly, but is unable to identify which specific 
member's information has been

[[Page 721]]

accessed. If the circumstances of the unauthorized access lead the 
credit union to determine that misuse of the information is reasonably 
possible, it should notify all members in the group.

                       B. Content of Member Notice

    1. Member notice should be given in a clear and conspicuous manner. 
The notice should describe the incident in general terms and the type of 
member information that was the subject of unauthorized access or use. 
It also should generally describe what the credit union has done to 
protect the members' information from further unauthorized access. In 
addition, it should include a telephone number that members can call for 
further information and assistance.\41\ The notice also should remind 
members of the need to remain vigilant over the next twelve to twenty-
four months, and to promptly report incidents of suspected identity 
theft to the credit union. The notice should include the following 
additional items, when appropriate:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ The credit union should, therefore, ensure that it has 
reasonable policies and procedures in place, including trained 
personnel, to respond appropriately to member inquiries and requests for 
assistance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    a. A recommendation that the member review account statements and 
immediately report any suspicious activity to the credit union;
    b. A description of fraud alerts and an explanation of how the 
member may place a fraud alert in the member's consumer reports to put 
the member's creditors on notice that the member may be a victim of 
fraud;
    c. A recommendation that the member periodically obtain credit 
reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency and have 
information relating to fraudulent transactions deleted;
    d. An explanation of how the member may obtain a credit report free 
of charge; and
    e. Information about the availability of the FTC's online guidance 
regarding steps a consumer can take to protect against identity theft. 
The notice should encourage the member to report any incidents of 
identity theft to the FTC, and should provide the FTC's Web site address 
and toll-free telephone number that members may use to obtain the 
identity theft guidance and report suspected incidents of identity 
theft.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ Currently, the FTC Web site for the ID Theft brochure and the 
FTC Hotline phone number are http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft and 1-877-
IDTHEFT. The credit union may also refer members to any materials 
developed pursuant to section 15(1)(b) of the FACT Act (educational 
materials developed by the FTC to teach the public how to prevent 
identity theft).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. NCUA encourages credit unions to notify the nationwide consumer 
reporting agencies prior to sending notices to a large number of members 
that include contact information for the reporting agencies.

                      C. Delivery of Member Notice

    Member notice should be delivered in any manner designed to ensure 
that a member can reasonably be expected to receive it. For example, the 
credit union may choose to contact all members affected by telephone or 
by mail, or by electronic mail for those members for whom it has a valid 
e-mail address and who have agreed to receive communications 
electronically.

<R05>
Sec. 749.0  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part describes the obligations of all federally-insured 
credit unions to maintain a records preservation program to identify, 
store and reconstruct vital records in the event that the credit union's 
records are destroyed and provides recommendations for restoring vital 
member services. All credit unions must have a written program that 
includes plans for safeguarding records and reconstructing vital 
records. To complement these plans, it is recommended a credit union 
develop a method for restoring vital member services in the event of a 
catastrophic act as defined in Sec. 748.1(b) of

[[Page 722]]

this chapter. Additionally, the regulation establishes flexibility in 
the format credit unions may use for maintaining writings, records or 
information required by other NCUA regulations.
    (b) Appendix A to this part provides guidance concerning the 
appropriate length of time credit unions should retain various types of 
operational records. Appendix B to this part also provides guidance for 
developing a program for responding to a catastrophic act to ensure 
duplicate vital records can be used for restoration of vital member 
services.

[72 FR 42273, Aug. 2, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 749.1  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part:
    Vital member services mean informational account inquiries, share 
withdrawals and deposits, and loan payments and disbursements.
    Vital records refer to the following records:
    (a) A list of share, deposit, and loan balances for each member's 
account as of the close of the most recent business day that:
    (1) Shows each balance individually identified by a name or number;
    (2) Lists multiple loans of one account separately; and
    (3) Contains information sufficient to enable the credit union to 
locate each member, such as address and telephone number.
    (b) A financial report, which lists all of the credit union's asset 
and liability accounts and bank reconcilements, current as of the most 
recent month-end.
    (c) A list of the credit union's accounts at financial institutions, 
insurance policies, and investments along with related contact 
information, current as of the most recent month-end.
    (d) Emergency contact information for employees, officials, 
regulatory offices, and vendors used to support vital records.

[72 FR 42273, Aug. 2, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 749.2  Vital records preservation program.

    The board of directors of a credit union is responsible for 
establishing a vital records preservation program within 6 months after 
its insurance certificate is issued. The program must be in writing and 
contain procedures for maintaining duplicate vital records at a vital 
records center. The procedures must include: designated staff 
responsible for vital records preservation, a schedule for the storage 
and destruction of records, and a records preservation log detailing for 
each record stored, its name, storage location, storage date, and name 
of the person sending the record for storage. It is recommended credit 
unions include in these procedures a method for using duplicate records 
to restore vital member services in the event of catastrophic act. 
Credit unions which have some or all of their records maintained by an 
off-site data processor are considered to be in compliance for the 
storage of those records if the service agreement specifies the data 
processor safeguards against the simultaneous destruction of production 
and back-up information.

[72 FR 42273, Aug. 2, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 749.3  Vital records center.

    A vital records center is defined as a storage facility, which may 
include another federally-insured credit union, at any location far 
enough from the credit union's offices to avoid the simultaneous loss of 
both sets of records in the event of a catastrophic act. A credit union 
must maintain or contract with a third party to maintain any equipment 
or software for its vital records center necessary to access records.

[72 FR 42273, Aug. 2, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 749.4  Format for vital records preservation.

    Preserved records may be in any format that can be used to 
reconstruct the credit union's records. The format used must accurately 
reflect the information in the record, remain accessible to all persons 
entitled to access by statute, regulation or rule of law, and be capable 
of reproduction by transmission, printing, or otherwise.

[72 FR 42273, Aug. 2, 2007]

[[Page 723]]


<R05>
Sec. 749.5  Format for records required by other NCUA regulations.

    Where NCUA regulations require credit unions to retain certain 
writings, records or information, credit unions may use any format that 
accurately reflects the information in the record, is accessible to all 
persons entitled to access by statute, regulation or rule of law, and is 
capable of being reproduced by transmission, printing, or otherwise. The 
credit union must maintain the necessary equipment or software to permit 
an examiner to access the records during the examination process.

[72 FR 42273, Aug. 2, 2007]


<R05>
        Sec. Appendix A to Part 749--Record Retention Guidelines

    Credit unions often look to NCUA for guidance on the appropriate 
length of time to retain various types of operational records. NCUA does 
not regulate in this area, but as an aid to credit unions it is 
publishing this appendix of suggested guidelines for record retention. 
NCUA recognizes that credit unions must strike a balance between the 
competing demands of space, resource allocation and the desire to retain 
all the records that they may need to conduct their business 
successfully. Efficiency requires that all records that are no longer 
useful be discarded, just as both efficiency and safety require that 
useful records be preserved and kept readily available.

    A. What Format Should the Credit Union Use for Retaining Records?

    NCUA does not recommend a particular format for record retention. If 
the credit union stores records on microfilm, microfiche, or in an 
electronic format, the stored records must be accurate, reproducible and 
accessible to an NCUA examiner. If records are stored on the credit 
union premises, they should be immediately accessible upon the 
examiner's request; if records are stored by a third party or off-site, 
then they should be made available to the examiner within a reasonable 
time after the examiner's request. The credit union must maintain the 
necessary equipment or software to permit an examiner to review and 
reproduce stored records upon request. The credit union should also 
ensure that the reproduction is acceptable for submission as evidence in 
a legal proceeding.

  B. Who Is Responsible for Establishing a System for Record Disposal?

    The credit union's board of directors may approve a schedule 
authorizing the disposal of certain records on a continuing basis upon 
expiration of specified retention periods. A schedule provides a system 
for disposal of records and eliminates the need for board approval each 
time the credit union wants to dispose of the same types of records 
created at different times.

C. What Procedures Should a Credit Union Follow When Destroying Records?

    The credit union should prepare an index of any records destroyed 
and retain the index permanently. Destruction of records should 
ordinarily be carried out by at least two persons whose signatures, 
attesting to the fact that records were actually destroyed, should be 
affixed to the listing.

          D. What Are the Recommended Minimum Retention Times?

    Record destruction may impact the credit union's legal standing to 
collect on loans or defend itself in court. Since each state can impose 
its own rules, it is prudent for a credit union to consider consulting 
with local counsel when setting minimum retention periods. A record 
pertaining to a member's account that is not considered a vital record 
may be destroyed once it is verified by the supervisory committee. 
Individual Share and Loan Ledgers should be retained permanently. 
Records, for a particular period, should not be destroyed until both a 
comprehensive annual audit by the supervisory committee and a 
supervisory examination by the NCUA have been made for that period.

             E. What Records Should Be Retained Permanently?

    1. Official records of the credit union that should be retained 
permanently are:

  Sec. Appendix B to Part 749--Catastrophic Act Preparedness Guidelines

    Credit unions often look to NCUA for guidance on preparing for a 
catastrophic act. While NCUA has minimal regulation in this area,\1\ as 
an aid to credit unions it is publishing this appendix of suggested 
guidelines. It is recommended that all credit unions develop a program 
to prepare for a catastrophic act. The program should be developed with 
oversight and approval of the board of directors. It is recommended the 
program address the following five elements:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 12 CFR 748.1(b) concerning a FICU's reporting of any 
catastrophic act that occurs at its office to its regional director and 
12 CFR 749.3 concerning the location of a FICU's vital records center to 
avoid the simultaneous loss of both sets of records in the event of 
disaster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A business impact analysis to evaluate potential threats;
    (2) A risk assessment to determine critical systems and necessary 
resources;
    (3) A written plan addressing:
    i. Persons with authority to enact the plan;
    ii. Preservation and ability to restore vital records;
    iii. A method for restoring vital member services through 
identification of alternate operating location(s) or mediums to provide 
services, such as telephone centers, shared service centers, agreements 
with other credit unions, or other appropriate methods;
    iv. Communication methods for employees and members;
    v. Notification of regulators as addressed in 12 CFR 748.1(b);
    vi. Training and documentation of training to ensure all employees 
and volunteer officials are aware of procedures to follow in the event 
of destruction of vital records or loss of vital member services; and
    vii. Testing procedures, including a means for documenting the 
testing results.
    (4) Internal controls for reviewing the plan at least annually and 
for revising the plan as circumstances warrant, for example, to address 
changes in the credit union's operations; and
    (5) Annual testing.

statements for those accounts, only if the loan is otherwise subject to 
RESPA. Following receipt of a notice from the Director of FEMA or other 
provider of flood insurance that premiums are due, the credit union, or

<R05>
Sec. 760.7  Forced placement of flood insurance.

    If a credit union, or a servicer acting on behalf of the credit 
union, determines, at any time during the term of a designated loan that 
the building or mobile home and any personal property securing the 
designated loan is not covered by flood insurance or is covered by flood 
insurance in an amount less than the amount required under Sec. 760.3, 
then the credit union or its servicer shall notify the borrower that the 
borrower should obtain flood insurance, at the borrower's expense, in an 
amount at least equal to the amount required under Sec. 760.3, for the 
remaining term of the loan. If the borrower fails to obtain flood 
insurance within 45 days after notification, then the credit union or 
its servicer shall purchase insurance on the borrower's behalf. The 
credit union or its servicer may charge the borrower for the cost of 
premiums and fees incurred in purchasing the insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 760.8  Determination fees.

    (a) General. Notwithstanding any Federal or State law other than the

any credit union, or a servicer acting on behalf of the credit union, 
may charge a reasonable fee for determining whether the building or 
mobile home securing the loan is located or will be located in a special 
flood hazard area. A determination fee may also include, but is not 
limited to, a fee for life-of-loan monitoring.
    (b) Borrower fee. The determination fee authorized by paragraph (a) 
of this section may be charged to the borrower if the determination:
    (1) Is made in connection with a making, increasing, extending, or 
renewing of the loan that is initiated by the borrower;

[[Page 727]]

    (2) Reflects the Director of FEMA's revision or updating of 
floodplain areas or flood-risk zones;
    (3) Reflects the Director of FEMA's publication of a notice or 
compendium that:
    (i) Affects the area in which the building or mobile home securing 
the loan is located; or
    (ii) By determination of the Director of FEMA, may reasonably 
require a determination whether the building or mobile home securing the 
loan is located in a special flood hazard area; or
    (4) Results in the purchase of flood insurance coverage by the 
credit union or its servicer on behalf of the borrower under Sec. 
760.7.
    (c) Purchaser or transferee fee. The determination fee authorized by

transferee of a loan in the case of the sale or transfer of the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 760.9  Notice of special flood hazards and availability of Federal disaster relief assistance.

    (a) Notice requirement. When a credit union makes, increases, 
extends, or renews a loan secured by a building or a mobile home located 
or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the credit union shall 
mail or deliver a written notice to the borrower and to the servicer in 
all cases whether or not flood insurance is available under the Act for 
the collateral securing the loan.
    (b) Contents of notice. The written notice must include the 
following information:
    (1) A warning, in a form approved by the Director of FEMA, that the 
building or the mobile home is or will be located in a special flood 
hazard area;
    (2) A description of the flood insurance purchase requirements set 
forth in section 102(b) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4012a(b));
    (3) A statement, where applicable, that flood insurance coverage is 
available under the NFIP and may also be available from private 
insurers; and
    (4) A statement whether Federal disaster relief assistance may be 
available in the event of damage to the building or mobile home caused 
by flooding in a Federally-declared disaster.
    (c) Timing of notice. The credit union shall provide the notice 
required by paragraph (a) of this section to the borrower within a 
reasonable time before the completion of the transaction and to the 
servicer as promptly as practicable after the credit union provides 
notice to the borrower and in any event no later than the time the 
credit union provides other similar notices to the servicer concerning 
hazard insurance and taxes. Notice to the servicer may be made 
electronically or may take the form of a copy of the notice to the 
borrower.
    (d) Record of receipt. The credit union shall retain a record of the 
receipt of the notices by the borrower and the servicer for the period 
of time the credit union owns the loan.
    (e) Alternate method of notice. Instead of providing the notice to 
the borrower required by paragraph (a) of this section, a credit union 
may obtain satisfactory written assurance from a seller or lessor that, 
within a reasonable time before the completion of the sale or lease 
transaction, the seller or lessor has provided such notice to the 
purchaser or lessee. The credit union shall retain a record of the 
written assurance from the seller or lessor for the period of time the 
credit union owns the loan.
    (f) Use of prescribed form of notice. A credit union will be 
considered to be in compliance with the requirement for notice to the 
borrower of this section providing written notice to the borrower 
containing the language presented in the appendix to this part within a 
reasonable time before the completion of the transaction. The notice 
presented in the appendix to this part satisfies the borrower notice 
requirements of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 760.10  Notice of servicer's identity.

    (a) Notice requirement. When a credit union makes, increases, 
extends, renews, sells, or transfers a loan secured by a building or 
mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the 
credit union shall notify

[[Page 728]]

the Director of FEMA (or the Director's designee) in writing of the 
identity of the servicer of the loan. The Director of FEMA has 
designated the insurance provider to receive the credit union's notice 
of the servicer's identity. This notice may be provided electronically 
if electronic transmission is satisfactory to the Director of FEMA's 
designee.
    (b) Transfer of servicing rights. The credit union shall notify the 
Director of FEMA (or the Director's designee) of any change in the 
servicer of a loan described in paragraph (a) of this section within 60 
days after the effective date of the change. This notice may be provided 
electronically if electronic transmission is satisfactory to the 
Director of FEMA's designee. Upon any change in the servicing of a loan 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the duty to provide notice 
under this paragraph (b) shall transfer to the transferee servicer.


<R05>
   Sec. Appendix to Part 760--Sample Form of Notice of Special Flood 
     Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance

    We are giving you this notice to inform you that:
    The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have 
applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.
    The area has been identified by the Director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using 
FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map or the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for the 
following community: --------------. This area has at least a one 
percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood 
elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-
year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood 
hazard area is 26 percent (26%).
    Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the 
Director of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property 
securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you 
would like to make such a request, please contact us for further 
information.
    ------ The community in which the property securing the loan is 
located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 
Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied 
for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be 
maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew 
flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us 
to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be 
purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either 
directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that 
participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance also may be available from 
private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must 
cover the lesser of:
    (1) the outstanding principal balance of the loan; or
    (2) the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property 
under the NFIP.
    Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the overall 
value of the property securing the loan minus the value of the land on 
which the property is located.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in 
the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred 
in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in 
the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.
    ------ Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for 
the property securing the loan because the community in which the 
property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if 
the non-participating community has been identified for at least one 
year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in 
the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief 
assistance in the event of a Federally-declared flood disaster.

development credit unions, including those credit unions designated as

                 Subpart A_Rules of NCUA Board Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 791.1  Scope.

    The rules contained in this subpart are the rules of procedure 
governing how the Board conducts its business. These rules concern the 
Board's exercise of its authority to act on behalf of NCUA; the conduct, 
scheduling and subject matter of Board meetings; and the recording of 
Board action.


<R05>
Sec. 791.2  Number of votes required for board action.

    The agreement of at least two of the three Board members is required 
for any action by the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 791.3  Voting by proxy.

    Proxy voting shall not be allowed for any action by the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 791.4  Methods of acting.

    (a) Board meetings--(1) Applicability of the Sunshine Act. The 
Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b, ``Sunshine Act'') 
requires that joint deliberations of the Board be held in accordance 
with its open meetings provisions (5 U.S.C. 552b (b) through (f)). 
(Subpart C of this part contains NCUA's regulations implementing the 
Sunshine Act.)
    (2) Presiding officer. The Chairman is the presiding officer, and in 
the Chairman's absence, the designated Vice Chairman shall preside. The 
presiding officer shall make procedural rulings. Any Board member may 
appeal a ruling made by the presiding officer. The appeal of a 
procedural ruling by the presiding officer shall be immediately 
considered by the Board, and a majority decision by the Board shall 
decide the procedural ruling.

[[Page 734]]

    (b) Notation voting. Notation voting is the circulation of written 
memoranda and voting sheets to the office of each Board member 
simultaneously and the tabulation of responses.
    (1) Matters that may be decided by notation voting. Notation voting 
may be used only for administrative or time sensitive, for example, 
enforcement or interagency actions requiring prompt Board action 
matters.
    (2) Notation vote sheets. Notation vote sheets will be used to 
record the vote tally on a notation vote. The Secretary of the Board has 
administrative responsibility over notation voting, including the 
authority to establish deadlines for voting, receive notation vote 
sheets, count votes, and determine whether further action is required.
    (3) Veto of notation voting. In view of public policy for openness 
reflected in the Sunshine Act, each Board member is authorized to veto 
the use of notation voting for the consideration of any particular 
matter, and thus requires that the matter be placed on the agenda of the 
next regularly scheduled Board meeting that is held at least ten days 
after the date of the veto.
    (4) Disclosure of result. A record is to be maintained of Board 
transactions by use of the notation voting procedure. Public disclosure 
of this record is determined by the provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).

    (a) Meeting calls--(1) Regular meetings. The Board will hold regular 
meetings each month unless there is no business or a quorum is not 
available. The Secretary of the Board will coordinate the dates for 
meetings.
    (2) Special meetings. The Chairman shall call special meetings 
either on the Chairman's own initiative or within fourteen days of a 
request from two Board members that is accompanied by an NCUA B-1 form 
and a Board Action Memorandum that states the specific issue(s) or 
action(s) to be considered by the Board.
    (b) Notice of meetings--(1) Notifying the public. The Sunshine Act 
and subpart C set forth the procedures for notifying the public of Board 
meetings.
    (2) Notifying board members--(i) Special meetings. Except in cases 
of emergency as determined by a majority of the Board, each Board member 
is entitled to receive notice of any special meeting at least twenty-
four hours in advance of such meeting. The notice shall set forth the 
place, day, hour, and nature of business to be transacted at the 
meeting. In cases of emergency a record of the vote, including a 
statement explaining the decision that an emergency exists, will be 
maintained.
    (ii) Regular meetings. Each Board member is entitled to receive 
notice of the agenda and/or notice of any changes in the subject matter 
of such meetings concurrent with the public release of such notices 
under the Sunshine Act. Each Board member shall be entitled to at least 
twenty-four hours advance notice of the consideration of a particular 
subject matter, except in cases of emergency as determined by a majority 
of the Board. In cases of emergency, a record of the vote, including a 
statement explaining the decision that an emergency exists, will be 
maintained.

to the procedures in section 554 of title 5 of the United States Code or 
otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for 
a hearing.
    (b) Prior to closing a meeting whose discussions are likely to fall 
within the exemptions stated in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board 
will balance the public interest in observing the deliberations of an 
exemptible matter and the agency need for confidentiality of the 
exemptible matter. In weighing these interests, the Board is assisted by 
the General Counsel as provided in Sec. 791.16, by expressions of the 
public interest set forth in requests for open meetings as provided by 
Sec. 791.15(b), and by the brief staff analysis of public interest 
which will accompany each staff recommendation that an agenda item be 
considered in a closed meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 791.13  Public announcement of meetings.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Board shall, 
for each meeting, make a public announcement, at least one week in 
advance of the meeting, of the time, place and subject matter of the 
meeting, whether it will be open or closed to public observation, and 
the name and telephone number of the Secretary of the Board or the 
person designated by the Board to respond to requests for information 
about the meeting.
    (b) Advance notice is required unless a majority of the members of 
the Board determine by a recorded vote that agency business requires 
that a meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case, the 
information to be announced in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
publicly announced at the earliest practicable time.
    (c) A change, including a postponement or a cancellation, in the 
time or place of a meeting after a published announcement may be made 
only if announced at the earliest practicable time.
    (d) A change in or deletion of the subject matter of a meeting or 
any portion of a meeting or a redetermination to open or close a meeting 
or any portion of a meeting after a published announcement may be made 
only if:
    (1) A majority of the Board determines by recorded vote that agency 
business so requires and that no earlier

[[Page 738]]

announcement of the change was possible and
    (2) Public announcement of the change and of the vote of each member 
on such change shall be made at the earliest practicable time.
    (e) Each meeting announcement or amendment thereof shall be posted 
on the Public Notice Bulletin Board in the reception area of the agency 
headquarters and may be made available by other means deemed desirable 
by the Board. Immediately following each public announcement required by 
this section, the stated information shall be submitted to the Federal 
Register for publication.
    (f) No announcement shall contain information which is determined to 
be exempt from disclosure under Sec. 791.12(a).
    (g) The agency shall maintain a mailing list of names and addresses 
of all persons who wish to receive copies of agency announcements of 
meetings open to public observation and amendments to such 
announcements. Requests to be placed on the mailing list should be made 
by telephoning or by writing to the Secretary of the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 791.14  Regular procedure for closing meeting discussions or limiting the disclosure of information.

    (a) A decision to close any portion of a meeting and to withhold 
information about any portion of a meeting closed pursuant to Sec. 
791.12(a) will be taken only when a majority of the entire Board votes 
to take such action. In deciding whether to close a meeting or any 
portion of a meeting or to withhold information, the Board shall 
independently consider whether the public interest requires an open 
meeting. A separate vote of the Board will be taken and recorded for 
each portion of a meeting to be closed to public observation pursuant to 
Sec. 791.12(a) or to withhold information from the public pursuant to 
Sec. 791.12(a). A single vote may be taken and recorded with respect to 
a series of meetings, or any portions of meetings which are proposed to 
be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning 
the series of meetings, so long as each meeting in the series involves 
the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than 
thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. No proxies shall 
be allowed.
    (b) Any person whose interests may be directly affected by any 
portion of a meeting for any of the reasons stated in Sec. 791.12(a) 
(5), (6) or (7) may request that the Board close such portion of the 
meeting. After receiving notice of a person's desire for any specified 
portion of a meeting to be closed, the Board, upon a request by one 
member, will decide by recorded vote whether to close the relevant 
portion or portions of the meeting. This procedure applies to requests 
received either prior or subsequent to the announcement of a decision to 
hold an open meeting.
    (c) Within one day after any vote is taken pursuant to paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section, the Board shall make publicly available a 
written copy of the vote taken indicating the vote of each Board member. 
Except to the extent that such information is withheld and exempt from 
disclosure, for each meeting or any portion of a meeting closed to the 
public, the Board shall make publicly available within one day after the 
required vote, a written explanation of its action, together with a list 
of all persons expected to attend the closed meeting and their 
affiliation. The list of persons to attend need not include the names of 
individual staff, but shall state the offices of the agency expected to 
participate in the meeting discussions.


<R05>
Sec. 791.15  Requests for open meeting.

    (a) Following any announcement that the Board intends to close a 
meeting or any portion of any meeting, any person may make a written 
request to the Secretary of the Board that the meeting or a portion of 
the meeting be open. The request shall be circulated to the members of 
the Board, and the Board, upon the request of one member, shall 
reconsider its action under Sec. 791.14 before the meeting or before 
discussion of the matter at the meeting. If the Board decides to open a 
portion of a meeting proposed to be closed, the Board shall publicly 
announce its decision in accordance with Sec. 791.13(e). If no request 
is received from a Board member to reconsider the decision to close

[[Page 739]]

a meeting or portion thereof prior to the meeting discussion, the 
Chairman of the Board shall certify that the Board did not receive a 
request to reconsider its decision to close the discussion of the 
matter.
    (b) The request to open a portion of a meeting shall be submitted to 
the Secretary of the Board in advance of the meeting in question. The 
request shall set forth the requestor's interest in the matter to be 
discussed and the reasons why the requestor believes that the public 
interest requires that the meeting or portions thereof be open to public 
observation.
    (c) The submission of a request to open a portion of a meeting shall 
not act to stay the effectiveness of Board action or to postpone or 
delay the meeting unless the Board decides otherwise.
    (d) The Secretary of the Board shall advise the requestor of the 
Board's consideration of the request to open a portion of the meeting as 
soon as practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 791.16  General counsel certification.

    For each meeting or any portion of a meeting closed to public 
observation under Sec. 791.14, the General Counsel shall publicly 
certify, whether in his or her opinion, the meeting or portion thereof 
may be closed to public observation and shall state each relevant 
exemption provision of law. A copy of the certification, together with a 
statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the 
time and place of the meeting and the persons present, shall be retained 
as a part of the permanent meeting records. As part of the 
certification, the General Counsel shall recommend to the Board whether 
the public interest requires that the meeting or portions thereof 
proposed to be closed to public observation be held in the open.


<R05>
Sec. 791.17  Maintenance of meeting records.

    (a) Except in those circumstances which are beyond the control of 
the agency, the Board shall maintain a complete transcript or electronic 
recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or 
any portion thereof, closed to public observation. However, for meetings 
closed under Sec. 791.12(a) (8), (9)(i) or (10), the Board shall 
maintain either a transcript, a recording or a set of minutes. The Board 
shall maintain a complete electronic recording for each open meeting or 
any portion thereof. All records shall clearly identify each speaker.
    (b) A set of minutes shall fully and clearly describe all matters 
discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions 
taken, and the reasons for taking such action. Minutes shall also 
include a description of each of the views expressed by each person in 
attendance on any item and the record of any roll call vote, reflecting 
the vote of each member. All documents considered in connection with any 
action shall be identified in the minutes.
    (c) The agency shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the 
transcript, a complete copy of the minutes or a complete electronic 
recording of each meeting, or any portion of a meeting, closed to public 
observation, for at least two years after such meeting or for one year 
after the conclusion of any agency proceeding with respect to which the 
meeting or any portion was held, whichever occurs later. The agency 
shall maintain a complete electronic recording of each open meeting for 
at least three months after the meeting date. A complete set of minutes 
shall be maintained on a permanent basis for all meetings.


<R05>
Sec. 791.18  Public availability of meeting records and other documents.

    (a) The agency shall make promptly available to the public, in the 
Public Reference Room, the transcript, electronic recording, or minutes 
of any meeting, deleting any agenda item or any item of the testimony of 
a witness received at a closed meeting which the Board determined, 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, was exempt from disclosure 
under Sec. 791.12(a). The exemption or exemptions relied upon for any 
deleted information shall be reflected on any record or recording.
    (b) Copies of any transcript, minutes or transcription of a 
recording, disclosing the identity of each speaker,

[[Page 740]]

shall be furnished to any person requesting such information in the form 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Copies shall be furnished at 
the actual cost of duplication or transcription unless waived by the 
Secretary of the Board.
    (c) Following each meeting or any portion of a meeting closed 
pursuant to Sec. 791.12(a), the General Counsel or his designee, after 
consultation with the Secretary of the Board, shall determine which, if 
any, portions of the meeting transcript, electronic recording or minutes 
not otherwise available under 5 U.S.C. 552a (the Privacy Act) contain 
information which should be withheld pursuant to Sec. 791.12(a). If, at 
a later time, the Board determines that there is no further 
justification for withholding any meeting record or other item of 
information from the public which has previously been withheld, then 
such information shall be made available to the public.
    (d) Except for information determined by the Board to be exempt from 
disclosure pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, meeting records 
shall be promptly available to the public in the Public Reference Room. 
Meeting records include but are not limited to: The transcript, 
electronic recording or minutes of each meeting, as required by Sec. 
791.17(a); the notice requirements of Sec. Sec. 791.13 and 791.14(c); 
and the General Counsel Certification along with the presiding officer's 
statement, as required by Sec. 791.16.
    (e) These provisions do not affect the procedures set forth in part 
792, subpart A, governing the inspection and copying of agency records, 
except that the exemptions set forth in Sec. 791.12(a) of this subpart 
and in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) shall govern in the case of a request made 
pursuant to part 792, subpart A, to copy or inspect the meeting records 
described in this section. Any documents considered or mentioned at 
Board meetings may be obtained subject to the procedures set forth in 
part 792, subpart A.

                             General Purpose


<R05>
Sec. 792.01  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart describes the procedures you must follow to obtain 
records from NCUA under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), (5 U.S.C. 
552).

                       Records Publicly Available


<R05>
Sec. 792.02  What records does NCUA make available to the public for inspection and copying?

    Except for records that are exempt from public disclosure under FOIA 
as amended (5 U.S.C. 552) or are promptly published and copies are 
available for purchase, NCUA routinely makes the following five types of 
records available for you to inspect and copy:

[[Page 742]]

    (a) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, 
and orders made in the adjudication of cases;
    (b) Statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted 
by the agency but not published in the Federal Register;
    (c) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that 
affect a member of the public;
    (d) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have 
been released after March 31, 1997, in response to a FOIA request and 
which, because of the nature of their subject matter, NCUA determines 
have been or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests; 
and
    (e) Indices of the documents referred to in this paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 792.03  How will I know which records to request?

    NCUA maintains current indices providing identifying information for 
the public for any matter referred to in Sec. 792.02, issued, adopted, 
or promulgated after July 4, 1967. The listing of material in an index 
is for the convenience of possible users and does not constitute a 
determination that all of the items listed will be disclosed. NCUA has 
determined that publication of the indices is unnecessary and 
impractical. You may obtain copies of indices by making a request to the 
Office of Administration, at NCUA, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 
22314-2387 or, as indicated, on the NCUA web site. The indices are 
available for public inspection and copying and are provided at their 
duplication cost. The indices are:
    (a) NCUA Publications List: Manuals relating to general and 
technical information, booklets published by NCUA, and the Credit Union 
Directory. The NCUA Publications list is available on the NCUA web site.
    (b) Directives Control Index: A list of statements of policy, NCUA 
Instructions, Bulletins, Letters to Credit Unions, and certain internal 
manuals.
    (c) Popular FOIA Index: Records released in response to a FOIA 
request, that NCUA determines are likely to be the subject of subsequent 
requests because of the nature of their subject matter. The Popular FOIA 
Index will be available on the NCUA web site on or before December 31, 
1999.


<R05>
Sec. 792.04  How can I obtain these records?

    You may obtain these types of records or information in the 
following ways:
    (a) You may obtain copies of the records referenced in Sec. 792.02 
by obtaining the index referred to in Sec. 792.03 and following the 
ordering instructions it contains, or by making a request to the FOIA 
Officer, NCUA, Office of General Counsel at 1775 Duke Street, 
Alexandria, Virginia 22314-3428.
    (b) If they were created by NCUA on or after November 1, 1996, 
records referenced in Sec. 792.02 are available on the NCUA web site, 
found at http://www.ncua.gov.


<R05>
Sec. 792.05  What is the significance of records made available and indexed?

    The records referred to in Sec. 792.02 may be relied on, used, or 
cited as precedent by NCUA against a party, provided:
    (a) The materials have been indexed and either made available or 
published; or
    (b) The party has actual and timely notice of the materials' 
contents.

                     Records Available Upon Request


<R05>
Sec. 792.06  Can I obtain other records?

    Except with respect to records routinely made available under Sec. 
792.02 or published in the Federal Register, or to the extent that 
records are exempt under the FOIA, if you make a request for records in 
accordance with this subpart, NCUA will make such records available to 
you, including records maintained in electronic format, as long as you 
agree to pay the actual, direct costs.


<R05>
Sec. 792.07  Where do I send my request?

    (a) You must send your request to one of NCUA's Information Centers. 
The Central Office and Office of Inspector General are designated as 
Information Centers for the NCUA. The Freedom of Information Officer of 
the Office of General Counsel is responsible for the operation of the 
Information

[[Page 743]]

Center maintained at the Central Office. The Inspector General is 
responsible for the operation of the Inspector General Information 
Center.
    (b) If you are seeking any NCUA record, other than those maintained 
by the Office of Inspector General, you should send your request to the 
Freedom of Information Officer at NCUA, Office of the General Counsel, 
1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314-3428. You may also send 
your request by electronic mail to FOIA@NCUA.gov.
    (c) If you are seeking a record you think may be maintained by the 
NCUA Office of Inspector General, then you should send your request to 
the Inspector General, NCUA, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 
22314-3428.

[68 FR 61737, Oct. 30, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 792.08  What must I include in my request?

    Your request must include the following:
    (a) Your name, address and telephone number where you can be reached 
during normal business hours. If you would like us to respond to your 
FOIA request by electronic mail (e-mail), you should include your e-mail 
address.
    (b) A reasonable description of the records you seek. A reasonable 
description is one that enables an NCUA employee, who is familiar with 
the subject area of the request, to locate the record with a reasonable 
amount of effort.
    (c) A statement agreeing to pay all applicable fees or to pay fees 
up to a certain maximum amount, or requesting a fee reduction or waiver 
in accordance with Sec. 792.27. If the actual fees are expected to 
exceed the maximum amount you indicate in your request, NCUA will 
contact you to see if you are willing to pay the estimated fees. If you 
do not want to pay the estimated fees, your request will be closed and 
no bill will be sent.
    (d) If other than paper copy, you must identify the form and format 
of responsive information you are requesting.

[63 FR 14338, Mar. 25, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 61737, Oct. 30, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 792.09  What if my request does not meet the requirements of this subpart?

    NCUA need not accept or process your request if it does not comply 
with the requirements of this subpart. NCUA may return such a request to 
you with an explanation of the deficiency. You may then submit a 
corrected request, which will be treated as a new request.


<R05>
Sec. 792.10  What will NCUA do with my request?

    (a) On receipt of any request, the Information Center assigns it to 
the appropriate processing schedule, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section. The date of receipt for any request, including one that is 
addressed incorrectly or that is referred to NCUA by another agency, is 
the date the appropriate Information Center actually receives the 
request.
    (b) NCUA has a multi-track processing system. Requests for records 
that are readily identifiable by the Information Center and have already 
been cleared for public release may qualify for fast track processing. 
Requests which meets the requirements of Sec. 792.18 will be processed 
on the expedited track. All other requests will be handled under normal 
processing procedures.
    (c) The Information Center will make the determination whether a 
request qualifies for fast track processing or expedited track 
processing. You may contact the Information Center to learn to which 
track your request has been assigned. If your request has not qualified 
for fast track processing, you will have an opportunity to limit the 
scope of material requested to qualify for fast track processing. 
Limitations of requests must be in writing. If your request for 
expedited processing is not granted, you will be advised of your right 
to appeal.
    (d) The Information Center will normally process requests in the 
order they are received in the separate processing tracks. However, in 
NCUA's discretion, a particular request may be processed out of turn.
    (e) Upon a determination by the appropriate Information Center to 
comply with your initial request for

[[Page 744]]

records, the records will be made promptly available to you. If we 
notify you of a denial of your request, we will include the names and 
titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial.
    (f) The Information Center will search for records responsive to 
your request and will generally include all records in existence at the 
time the search begins. If we use a different search cut-off date, we 
will inform you of that date.

[63 FR 14338, Mar. 25, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 61737, Oct. 30, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 792.11  What kind of records are exempt from public disclosure?

    (a) All records of NCUA or any officer, employee, or agent thereof, 
are confidential, privileged and exempt from disclosure, except as 
otherwise provided in this subpart, if they are:
    (1) Records specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to an 
Executive Order.
    (2) Records related solely to NCUA internal personnel rules and 
practices. This exemption applies to internal rules or instructions 
which must be kept confidential in order to assure effective performance 
of the functions and activities for which NCUA is responsible and which 
do not materially affect members of the public. This exemption also 
applies to manuals and instructions to the extent that release of the 
information would permit circumvention of laws or regulations.
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, where the 
statute either makes nondisclosure mandatory or establishes particular 
criteria for withholding information.
    (4) Records which contain trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information which relate to the business, personal or financial affairs 
of any person or organization, are furnished to NCUA, and are 
confidential or privileged. This exemption includes, but is not limited 
to, various types of confidential sales and cost statistics, trade 
secrets, and names of key customers and personnel. Assurances of 
confidentiality given by staff are not binding on NCUA.
    (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would 
not be available by law to a private party in litigation with NCUA. This 
exemption preserves the existing freedom of NCUA officials and employees 
to engage in full and frank written or taped communications with each 
other and with officials and employees of other agencies. It includes, 
but is not limited to, inter-agency and intra-agency reports, memoranda, 
letters, correspondence, work papers, and minutes of meetings, as well 
as staff papers prepared for use within NCUA or in concert with other 
governmental agencies.
    (6) Personnel, medical, and similar files (including financial 
files), the disclosure of which without written permission would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Files 
exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to:
    (i) The personnel records of the NCUA;
    (ii) The personnel records voluntarily submitted by private parties 
in response to NCUA's requests for proposals; and
    (iii) Files containing reports, records or other material pertaining 
to individual cases in which disciplinary or other administrative action 
has been or may be taken.
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a state, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a

[[Page 745]]

criminal investigation on or by an agency conducting a lawful national 
security intelligence investigation, information furnished by the 
confidential source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigation or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual. This includes, but is not limited to, 
information relating to enforcement proceedings upon which NCUA has 
acted or will act in the future.
    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating or condition 
reports prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of NCUA or any 
agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial 
institutions. This includes all information, whether in formal or 
informal report form, the disclosure of which would harm the financial 
security of credit unions or would interfere with the relationship 
between NCUA and credit unions.
    (b) We will provide any reasonably segregable portion of a requested 
record after deleting those portions that are exempt from disclosure 
under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 792.12  How will I know what records NCUA has determined to be exempt?

    As long as it is technically feasible and does not threaten an 
interest protected by the FOIA, we will:
    (a) Mark the place where we redacted information from documents 
released to you and note the exemption that protects the information 
from public disclosure; or
    (b) Make reasonable efforts to include with our response to you an 
estimate of the volume of information withheld.


<R05>
Sec. 792.13  Can I get the records in different forms or formats?

    NCUA will provide a copy of the record in any form or format 
requested, such as computer disk, if the record is readily reproducible 
by us in that form or format, but we will not provide more than one copy 
of any record.


<R05>
Sec. 792.14  Who is responsible for responding to my request?

    The Freedom of Information Officer or designee is responsible for 
making the initial determination whether to grant or deny a request for 
information submitted to the Central Office Information Center. The 
Inspector General or designee is responsible for making the initial 
determination whether to grant or deny a request for information 
submitted to the Inspector General Information Center. This official may 
refer a request to an NCUA employee who is familiar with the subject 
area of the request. Other NCUA staff members may aid the official by 
providing information, advice, recommending a decision, or implementing 
a decision, but no NCUA employee other than an authorized official may 
make the initial determination. Referral of a request by the official to 
an employee will not affect the time limitation imposed in Sec. 792.15 
unless the request involves an unusual circumstance as provided in Sec. 
792.16.

[63 FR 14338, Mar. 25, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 61737, Oct. 30, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 792.15  How long will it take to process my request?

    NCUA will respond to requests within 20 working days, except:
    (a) Where the running of such time is suspended for payment of fees 
pursuant to Sec. 792.26;
    (b) In unusual circumstances, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) 
and Sec. 792.16, the time limit may be extended for:
    (1) An additional 10 working days as provided by written notice to 
you, stating the reasons for the extension and the date on which a 
determination will be sent; or
    (2) Such alternative time period as mutually agreed by you and the 
Information Office, when NCUA notifies you that the request cannot be 
processed in the specified time limit.

[[Page 746]]


<R05>
Sec. 792.16  What unusual circumstances can delay NCUA's response?

    (a) In unusual circumstances, the time limits for responding to your 
request (or your appeal) may be extended by NCUA. If NCUA extends the 
time it will provide you with written notice, setting forth the reasons 
for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to 
be dispatched. Our notice will not specify a date that would result in 
an extension for more than 10 working days, except as set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section. The unusual circumstances that can delay 
NCUA's response to your request are:
    (1) The need to search for, and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of NCUA 
having a substantial interest in the subject matter.
    (b) If you, or you and a group of others acting in concert, submit 
multiple requests that NCUA believes actually constitute a single 
request, which would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances 
criteria specified in this section, and the requests involve related 
matters, then NCUA may aggregate those requests and the provisions of 
Sec. 792.15(b) will apply.
    (c) If NCUA sends you an extension notice, it will also advise you 
that you can either limit the scope of your request so that it can be 
processed within the statutory time limit or agree to an alternative 
time frame for processing your request.


<R05>
Sec. 792.17  What can I do if the time limit passes and I still have not received a response?

    You can file suit against NCUA because you will be deemed to have 
exhausted your administrative remedies if NCUA fails to comply with the 
time limit provisions of this subpart. If NCUA can show that exceptional 
circumstances exist and that it is exercising due diligence in 
responding to your request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow 
NCUA to complete its review of the records. In determining whether 
exceptional circumstances exist, the court may consider your refusal to 
modify the scope of your request or arrange an alternative time frame 
for processing after being given the opportunity to do so by NCUA, when 
it notifies you of the existence of unusual circumstances as set forth 
in Sec. 792.16.

                          Expedited Processing


<R05>
Sec. 792.18  What if my request is urgent and I cannot wait for the records?

    You may request expedited processing of your request if you can show 
a compelling need for the records. In cases where your request for 
expedited processing is granted or if NCUA has determined to expedite 
the response, it will be processed as soon as practicable.
    (a) To demonstrate a compelling need for expedited processing, you 
must provide a certified statement. The statement, certified by you to 
be true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief, must 
demonstrate that:
    (1) The failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis could 
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (2) The requester is a representative of the news media, as defined 
in Sec. 792.20, and there is urgency to inform the public concerning 
actual or alleged NCUA activity.
    (b) In response to a request for expedited processing, the 
Information Center will notify you of the determination within ten days 
of receipt of the request. If the Information Center denies your request 
for expedited processing, you may file an appeal pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 792.28, and NCUA will expeditiously 
respond to the appeal.
    (c) The Information Center will normally process requests in the 
order

[[Page 747]]

they are received in the separate processing tracks. However, in NCUA's 
discretion, a particular request may be processed out of turn.

                                  Fees


<R05>
Sec. 792.19  How does NCUA calculate the fees for processing my request?

    We will charge you our allowable direct costs, unless they are less 
than the cost of billing you. Direct costs means those expenditures that 
NCUA actually incurs in searching for, duplicating and reviewing 
documents to respond to a FOIA request. Search means all time spent 
looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-
page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. 
Searches may be done manually or by computer. Search does not include 
modification of an existing program or system that would significantly 
interfere with the operation of an automated information system. Review 
means examining documents to determine whether any portion should be 
withheld and preparing documents for disclosure. Fees are subject to 
change as costs increase. The current rate schedule is available on our 
web site at http://www.ncua.gov. We may contract with the private sector 
to locate, reproduce or disseminate records. NCUA will not contract out 
responsibilities that FOIA requires it to discharge, such as determining 
the applicability of an exemption, or determining whether to waive or 
reduce fees. The following labor and duplication rate calculations 
apply:
    (a) NCUA will charge fees at the following rates for manual searches 
for and review of records:
    (1) If search/review is done by clerical staff, the hourly rate for 
CU-5, plus 16% of that rate to cover benefits;
    (2) If search/review is done by professional staff, the hourly rate 
for CU-13, plus 16% of that rate to cover benefits.
    (b) NCUA will charge fees at the hourly rate for CU-13, plus 16% of 
that rate to cover benefits, plus the hourly cost of operating the 
computer for computer searches for records.
    (c) NCUA will charge the following duplication fees:
    (1) The per-page fee for paper copy reproduction of a document is 
$.05;
    (2) The fee for documents generated by computer is the hourly fee 
for the computer operator, plus the cost of materials (computer paper, 
tapes, labels, etc.);
    (3) If any other method of duplication is used, NCUA will charge the 
actual direct cost of duplication.


<R05>
Sec. 792.20  What are the charges for each fee category?

    The fee category definitions are:
    (a) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of one 
who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, 
trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose 
behalf the request is made.
    (b) Educational institution means a preschool, an elementary or 
secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional 
education, and an institution of vocational education operating a 
program or programs of scholarly research.
    (c) Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated for a ``commercial'' purpose as that term is used in 
paragraph (a) of this section and is operated solely for the purpose of 
conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to 
promote any particular product or industry.
    (d) Representative of the news media means any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. Included within the meaning of public 
is the credit union community. The term news means information that is 
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. 
You may consult the following chart to find the fees applicable to your 
request:

<R05>
Sec. 792.21  Will NCUA provide a fee estimate?

    NCUA will notify you of the estimated amount if fees are likely to 
exceed $25, unless you have indicated in advance a willingness to pay 
fees as high as those anticipated. You will then have the opportunity to 
confer with NCUA personnel to reformulate the request to meet your needs 
at a lower cost.


<R05>
Sec. 792.22  What will NCUA charge for other services?

    Complying with requests for special services is entirely at the 
discretion of NCUA. NCUA will recover the full costs of providing such 
services to the extent it elects to provide them.


<R05>
Sec. 792.23  Can I avoid charges by sending multiple, small requests?

    You may not file multiple requests, each seeking portions of a 
document or similar documents, solely to avoid payment of fees. If this 
is done, NCUA may aggregate any such requests and charge you 
accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 792.24  Can NCUA charge me interest if I fail to pay my bill?

    NCUA can assess interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 
31st day following the date of the bill. If you fail to pay your bill 
within 30 days, interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 
3717, and will accrue from the date of the billing.


<R05>
Sec. 792.25  Will NCUA charge me if the records are not found or are determined to be exempt?

    NCUA may assess fees for time spent searching and reviewing, even if 
it fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to 
be exempt from disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 792.26  Will I be asked to pay fees in advance?

    NCUA will require you to give an assurance of payment or an advance 
payment only when:
    (a) NCUA estimates or determines that allowable charges that you may 
be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. NCUA will notify you of 
the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where 
you have a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance 
payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case where 
you have no history of payment; or
    (b) You have previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely 
fashion. NCUA may require you to pay the full amount owed, plus any 
applicable interest, or demonstrate that you have, in fact, paid the 
fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated 
fee before we begin to process a new request or a pending request from 
you.
    (c) If you are required to make an advance payment of fees, then the 
administrative time limits prescribed in Sec. 792.16 will begin only 
after NCUA has received the fee payments described.

                         Fee Waiver or Reduction


<R05>
Sec. 792.27  Can fees be reduced or waived?

    You may request that NCUA waive or reduce fees if disclosure of the 
information you request is in the public interest because it is likely 
to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government, and is not primarily in your commercial 
interest.
    (a) NCUA will make a determination of whether the public interest 
requirement above is met based on the following factors:

[[Page 749]]

    (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the 
operations or activities of the government;
    (2) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an 
understanding of government operations or activities;
    (3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute 
to public understanding; and
    (4) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of government operations or activities,
    (b) If the public interest requirement is met, NCUA will make a 
determination on the commercial interest requirement based upon the 
following factors:
    (1) Whether you have a commercial interest that would be furthered 
by the requested disclosure; and if so
    (2) Whether the magnitude of your commercial interest is 
sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, 
that disclosure is primarily in your commercial interest.
    (c) If the required public interest exists and your commercial 
interest is not primary in comparison, NCUA will waive or reduce fees.
    (d) If you are not satisfied with our determination on your fee 
waiver or reduction request, you may submit an appeal to the General 
Counsel in accordance with Sec. 792.28.

                                 Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 792.28  What if I am not satisfied with the response I receive?

    If you are not satisfied with NCUA's response to your request, you 
can file an administrative appeal. Your appeal must be in writing and 
must be filed within 30 days from receipt of the initial determination 
(in cases of denials of an entire request, or denial of a request for 
fee waiver or reduction), or from receipt of any records being made 
available pursuant to the initial determination (in cases of partial 
denials.) In its response to your initial request, the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer or the Inspector General (or designee), will 
notify you that you may appeal any adverse determination to the Office 
of General Counsel. The General Counsel, or designee, as set forth in 
this paragraph, will:
    (a) Make a determination with respect to any appeal within 20 days 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the 
receipt of such appeal. If, on appeal, the denial of the request for 
records is, in whole or in part, upheld, the Office of General Counsel 
will notify you of the provisions for judicial review of that 
determination under FOIA. Where you do not address your request or 
appeal to the proper official, the time limitations stated above will be 
computed from the receipt of the request or appeal by the proper 
official.
    (b) The General Counsel is the official responsible for determining 
all appeals from initial determinations. In case of this person's 
absence, the appropriate officer acting in the General Counsel's stead 
will make the appellate determination, unless such officer was 
responsible for the initial determination, in which case the Vice-
Chairman of the NCUA Board will make the appellate determination.
    (c) All appeals should be addressed to the General Counsel in the 
Central Office and should be clearly identified as such on the envelope 
and in the letter of appeal by using the indicator ``FOIA-APPEAL.'' 
Failure to address an appeal properly may delay commencement of the time 
limitation stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to take account 
of the time reasonably required to forward the appeal to the Office of 
General Counsel.

                            Submitter Notice


<R05>
Sec. 792.29  If I send NCUA confidential commercial information, can it be disclosed under FOIA?

    (a) If you submit confidential commercial information to NCUA, it 
may be disclosed in response to a FOIA request in accordance with this 
section.
    (b) For purposes of this section:
    (1) Confidential commercial information means commercial or 
financial information provided to NCUA by a submitter that arguably is 
protected from disclosure under Sec. 792.11(a)(4) because disclosure 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

[[Page 750]]

    (2) Submitter means any person or entity who provides business 
information, directly or indirectly, to NCUA.
    (c) Submitters of business information must use good faith efforts 
to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission 
or at a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions 
deemed to be protected from disclosure under Sec. 792.11(a)(4). Such a 
designation shall expire ten years after the date of submission.
    (d) We will provide a submitter with written notice of a FOIA 
request or administrative appeal encompassing designated business 
information when:
    (1) The information has been designated in good faith by the 
submitter as confidential commercial information deemed protected from 
disclosure under Sec. 792.11(a)(4); or
    (2) NCUA has reason to believe that the information may be protected 
from disclosure under Sec. 792.11(a)(4).
    (e) A copy of the notice to the submitter will also be provided to 
the FOIA requester.
    (f) Through the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section, 
NCUA will afford the submitter a reasonable period of time within which 
to provide a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. 
The statement must describe why the information is confidential 
commercial information and why it should not be disclosed.
    (g) Whenever we decide that we must disclose confidential commercial 
information over the objection of the submitter, we will send both the 
submitter and the FOIA requester, within a reasonable number of days 
prior to the specified disclosure date, a written notice which will 
include:
    (1) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure 
objection was not sustained; and
    (2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and
    (3) A specified disclosure date.
    (h) If a requester brings suit to compel disclosure of confidential 
commercial information, we will promptly notify the submitter.
    (i) The notice requirements of paragraph (d) of this section do not 
apply if:
    (1) We determine that the information should not be disclosed;
    (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been 
officially made available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law; or
    (4) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that 
in such case, NCUA will provide the submitter with written notice of any 
final administrative decision to disclose the information within a 
reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date.

                      Release of Exempt Information


<R05>
Sec. 792.30  Is there a prohibition against disclosure of exempt records?

    Except those authorized officials listed in Sec. 792.14, or as 
provided in Sec. Sec. 792.31-792.32, and subpart C of this part, no 
officer, employee, or agent of NCUA or of any federally-insured credit 
union shall disclose or permit the disclosure of any exempt records of 
NCUA to any person other than those NCUA or credit union officers, 
employees, or agents properly entitled to such information for the 
performance of their official duties.


<R05>
Sec. 792.31  Can exempt records be disclosed to credit unions, financial institutions and state or federal agencies?

    The NCUA Board, in its sole discretion, or any person designated by 
it in writing, may make available to certain governmental agencies and 
insured financial institutions copies of reports of examination and 
other documents, papers or information for their use, when necessary, in 
the performance of their official duties or functions. All reports, 
documents and papers made available pursuant to this paragraph shall 
remain the property of NCUA. No person, agency or employee shall 
disclose the reports or exempt records without NCUA's express written 
authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 792.32  Can exempt records be disclosed to investigatory agencies?

    The NCUA Board, or any person designated by it in writing, in its 
discretion and in appropriate circumstances, may disclose to proper 
federal or state authorities copies of exempt records pertaining to 
irregularities discovered

[[Page 751]]

in credit unions which may constitute either unsafe or unsound practices 
or violations of federal or state, civil or criminal law.

Subpart B [Reserved]


<R04>
    Subpart C_Production of Nonpublic Records and Testimony of NCUA 
                     Employees in Legal Proceedings

    Source: 62 FR 56054, Oct. 29, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 792.40  What does this subpart prohibit?

    This subpart prohibits the release of nonpublic records or the 
appearance of an NCUA employee to testify in legal proceedings except as 
provided in this subpart. Any person possessing nonpublic records may 
release them or permit their disclosure only as provided in this 
subpart.
    (a) Duty of NCUA employees. (1) If an NCUA employee is served with a 
subpoena requiring him or her to appear as a witness or produce records, 
the employee must promptly notify the Office of General Counsel. The 
General Counsel has the authority to instruct NCUA employees to refuse 
appearing as a witness or to withhold nonpublic records. The General 
Counsel may let an NCUA employee provide testimony, including expert or 
opinion testimony, if the General Counsel determines that the need for 
the testimony clearly outweighs contrary considerations.
    (2) If a court or other appropriate authority orders or demands 
expert or opinion testimony or testimony beyond authorized subjects 
contrary to the General Counsel's instructions, an NCUA employee must 
immediately notify the General Counsel of the order and respectfully 
decline to comply. An NCUA employee must decline to answer questions on 
the grounds that this subpart forbids such disclosure and should produce 
a copy of this subpart, request an opportunity to consult with the 
Office of General Counsel, and explain that providing such testimony 
without approval may expose him or her to disciplinary or other adverse 
action.
    (b) Duty of persons who are not NCUA employees. (1) If you are not 
an NCUA employee but have custody of nonpublic records and are served 
with a subpoena requiring you to appear as a witness or produce records, 
you must promptly notify the NCUA about the subpoena. Also, you must 
notify the issuing court or authority and the person or entity for whom 
the subpoena was issued of the contents of this subpart. Notice to the 
NCUA is made by sending a copy of the subpoena to the General Counsel of 
the NCUA, Office of General Counsel, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, 
Virginia 22314-3428. After receiving notice, the NCUA may advise the 
issuing court or authority and the person or entity for whom the 
subpoena was issued that this subpart applies and, in addition, may 
intervene, attempt to have the subpoena quashed or withdrawn, or 
register appropriate objections.
    (2) After notifying the Office of General Counsel, you should 
respond to a subpoena by appearing at the time and place stated in the 
subpoena. Unless authorized by the General Counsel, you should decline 
to produce any records or give any testimony, basing your refusal on 
this subpart. If the issuing court or authority orders the disclosure of 
records or orders you to testify, you should continue to decline to 
produce records or testify and should advise the Office of General 
Counsel.
    (c) Penalties. Anyone who discloses nonpublic records or gives 
testimony related to those records, except as expressly authorized by 
the NCUA or as ordered by a federal court after NCUA has had the 
opportunity to be heard, may face the penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 
641 and other applicable laws. Also, former NCUA employees, in addition 
to the prohibition contained in this subpart, are subject to the 
restrictions and penalties of 18 U.S.C. 207.


<R05>
Sec. 792.41  When does this subpart apply?

    This subpart applies if you want to obtain nonpublic records or 
testimony of an NCUA employee for legal proceedings. It doesn't apply to 
the release of records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 
U.S.C. 552, or the

[[Page 752]]

Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or the release of records to federal or 
state investigatory agencies under Sec. 792.32.

[62 FR 56054, Oct. 29, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 63789, Oct. 25, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 792.42  How do I request nonpublic records or testimony?

    (a) To request nonpublic records or the testimony of an NCUA 
employee, you must submit a written request to the General Counsel of 
the NCUA. If you serve a subpoena on the NCUA or an NCUA employee before 
submitting a written request and receiving a final determination, the 
NCUA will oppose the subpoena on the grounds that you failed to follow 
the requirements of this subpart. You may serve a subpoena as long as it 
is accompanied by a written request that complies with this subpart.
    (b) To request nonpublic records that are part of the records of the 
Office of the Inspector General or the testimony of an NCUA employee on 
matters within the knowledge of the NCUA employee as a result of his or 
her employment with the Office of the Inspector General, you must submit 
a written request to the Office of the Inspector General. Your request 
will be handled in accordance with the provisions of this subpart except 
that the Inspector General will be responsible for those determinations 
that would otherwise be made by the General Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 792.43  What must my written request contain?

    Your written request for records or testimony must include:
    (a) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name of 
the court or other authority involved.
    (b) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the 
assertions in the case and any other pleading or document necessary to 
show relevance.
    (c) A list of categories of records sought, a detailed description 
of how the information sought is relevant to the issues in the legal 
proceeding, and a specific description of the substance of the testimony 
or records sought.
    (d) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs the 
need to maintain the confidentiality of the information and outweighs 
the burden on the NCUA to produce the records or provide testimony.
    (e) A statement indicating that the information sought is not 
available from another source, such as a credit union's own books and 
records, other persons or entities, or the testimony of someone other 
than an NCUA employee, for example, retained experts.
    (f) A description of all prior decisions, orders, or pending motions 
in the case that bear upon the relevance of the records or testimony you 
want.
    (g) The name, address, and telephone number of counsel to each party 
in the case.
    (h) An estimate of the amount of time you anticipate that you and 
other parties will need with each NCUA employee for interviews, 
depositions, or testifying.


<R05>
Sec. 792.44  When should I make a request?

    You should submit your request at least 45 days before the date that 
you need the records or testimony. If you want to have your request 
processed in less time, you must explain why you couldn't submit the 
request earlier and why you need expedited processing. If you are 
requesting the testimony of an NCUA employee, the NCUA expects you to 
anticipate your need for the testimony in sufficient time to obtain it 
by a deposition. The General Counsel may deny a request for testimony at 
a legal proceeding unless you explain why you could not use deposition 
testimony. The General Counsel will determine the location of a 
deposition taking into consideration the NCUA's interest in minimizing 
the disruption for an NCUA employee's work schedule and the costs and 
convenience of other persons attending the deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 792.45  Where do I send my request?

    You must send your request or subpoena for records or testimony to 
the attention of the General Counsel for the NCUA, Office of General 
Counsel, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314-3428. You must 
send your request or subpoena for records or testimony

[[Page 753]]

from the Office of the Inspector General to the attention of the NCUA 
Inspector General, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314-3428.


<R05>
Sec. 792.46  What will the NCUA do with my request?

    (a) Factors the NCUA will consider. The NCUA may consider various 
factors in reviewing a request for nonpublic records or testimony of 
NCUA employees, including:
    (1) Whether disclosure would assist or hinder the NCUA in performing 
its statutory duties or use NCUA resources unreasonably, including 
whether responding to the request will interfere with NCUA employees' 
ability to do their work.
    (2) Whether disclosure is necessary to prevent the perpetration of a 
fraud or other injustice in the matter or if you can get the records or 
testimony you want from sources other than the NCUA.
    (3) Whether the request is unduly burdensome.
    (4) Whether disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, or 
regulation, for example, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (5) Whether disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive or 
privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential 
commercial or financial information, or would otherwise be inappropriate 
for release and, if so, whether a confidentiality agreement or 
protective order as provided in Sec. 792.48(a) can adequately limit the 
disclosure.
    (6) Whether the disclosure would interfere with law enforcement 
proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, or hamper NCUA research 
or investigatory activities.
    (7) Whether the disclosure could result in NCUA appearing to favor 
one litigant over another.
    (8) Any other factors the NCUA determines to be relevant to the 
interests of the NCUA.
    (b) Review of your request. The NCUA will process your request in 
the order it is received. The NCUA will try to respond to your request 
within 45 days, but this may vary depending on the scope of your 
request.
    (c) Final determination. The General Counsel makes the final 
determination on requests for nonpublic records or NCUA employee 
testimony. All final determinations are in the sole discretion of the 
General Counsel. The General Counsel will notify you and the court or 
other authority of the final determination of your request. In 
considering your request, the General Counsel may contact you to inform 
you of the requirements of this subpart, ask that the request or 
subpoena be modified or withdrawn, or may try to resolve the request or 
subpoena informally without issuing a final determination. You may seek 
judicial review of the final determination under the Administrative 
Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. 702.


<R05>
Sec. 792.47  If my request is granted, what fees apply?

    (a) Generally. You must pay any fees associated with complying with 
your request, including copying fees for records and witness fees for 
testimony. The General Counsel may condition the production of records 
or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable 
estimate of the fees.
    (b) Fees for records. You must pay all fees for searching, reviewing 
and duplicating records produced in response to your request. The fees 
will be the same as those charged by the NCUA under its Freedom of 
Information Act regulations, Sec. 792.19.
    (c) Witness fees. You must pay the fees, expenses, and allowances 
prescribed by the court's rules for attendance by a witness. If no such 
fees are prescribed, the local federal district court rule concerning 
witness fees, for the federal district court closest to where the 
witness appears, will apply. For testimony by current NCUA employees, 
you must pay witness fees, allowances, and expenses to the General 
Counsel by check made payable to the ``National Credit Union 
Administration'' within 30 days from receipt of NCUA's billing 
statement. For the testimony of a former NCUA employee, you must pay 
witness fees, allowances, and expenses directly to the former employee, 
in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.

[[Page 754]]

    (d) Certification of records. The NCUA may authenticate or certify 
records to facilitate their use as evidence. If you require 
authenticated records, you must request certified copies at least 45 
days before the date they will be needed. The request should be sent to 
the General Counsel. You will be charged a certification fee of $5.00 
per document.
    (e) Waiver of fees. A waiver or reduction of any fees in connection 
with the testimony, production, or certification or authentication of 
records may be granted in the discretion of the General Counsel. Waivers 
will not be granted routinely. If you request a waiver, your request for 
records or testimony must state the reasons why a waiver should be 
granted.

<R05>
Sec. 792.48  If my request is granted, what restrictions apply?

    (a) Records. The General Counsel may impose conditions or 
restrictions on the release of nonpublic records, including a 
requirement that you obtain a protective order or execute a 
confidentiality agreement with the other parties in the legal proceeding 
that limits access to and any further disclosure of the nonpublic 
records. The terms of a confidentiality agreement or protective order 
must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective 
orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, the 
NCUA may condition the release of nonpublic records on an amendment to 
the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.
    (b) Testimony. The General Counsel may impose conditions or 
restrictions on the testimony of NCUA employees, including, for example, 
limiting the areas of testimony or requiring you and the other parties 
to the legal proceeding to agree that the transcript of the testimony 
will be kept under seal or will only be used or made available in the 
particular legal proceeding for which you requested the testimony. The 
General Counsel may also require you to provide a copy of the transcript 
of the testimony to the NCUA at your expense.


<R05>
Sec. 792.49  Definitions.

    Legal proceedings means any matter before any federal, state or 
foreign administrative or judicial authority, including courts, 
agencies, commissions, boards or other tribunals, involving such 
proceedings as lawsuits, licensing matters, hearings, trials, discovery, 
investigations, mediation or arbitration. When the NCUA is a party to a 
legal proceeding, it will be subject to the applicable rules of civil 
procedure governing production of documents and witnesses, however, this 
subpart will still apply to the testimony of former NCUA employees.
    NCUA employee means current and former officials, members of the 
Board, officers, directors, employees and agents of the National Credit 
Union Administration, including contract employees and consultants and 
their employees. This definition does not include persons who are no 
longer employed by the NCUA and are retained or hired as expert 
witnesses or agree to testify about general matters, matters available 
to the public, or matters with which they had no specific involvement or 
responsibility during their employment.
    Nonpublic records means any NCUA records that are exempt from 
disclosure under Sec. 792.11, the NCUA regulations implementing the 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. For example, this means 
records created in connection with NCUA's examination and supervision of 
insured credit unions, including examination reports, internal 
memoranda, and correspondence, and, also, records created in connection 
with NCUA's enforcement and investigatory responsibilities.
    Subpoena means any order, subpoena for records or other tangible 
things or for testimony, summons, notice or legal process issued in a 
legal proceeding.
    Testimony means any written or oral statements made by an individual 
in connection with a legal proceeding including personal appearances in 
court or at depositions, interviews in person or by telephone, responses 
to written

[[Page 755]]

interrogatories or other written statements such as reports, 
declarations, affidavits, or certifications or any response involving 
more than the delivery of records.

is designated as the person responsible for implementation and oversight 
of NCUA's program for maintaining the security of confidential 
information regarding national defense and foreign relations. The Chief 
Financial Officer receives questions, suggestions and complaints 
regarding all elements of this program. The Chief Financial Officer is 
solely responsible for changes to the program and assures that the 
program is consistent with legal requirements.
    (b) The Chief Financial Officer is the Agency's official contact for 
declassification requests regardless of the point of origin of such 
requests.

[54 FR 18476, May 1, 1989, as amended at 59 FR 36042, July 15, 1994; 67

<R05>
Sec. 792.51  Procedures.

    (a) Mandatory review. All declassification requests made by a member 
of the public, by a government employee or by an agency shall be handled 
by the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Financial Officer's 
designee. Under no circumstances shall the Chief Financial Officer 
refuse to confirm the existence or nonexistence of a document under the 
Freedom of Information Act or the mandatory review provisions of other 
applicable law, unless the fact of its existence or nonexistence would 
itself be classifiable under applicable law. Although NCUA has no 
authority to classify or declassify information, it occasionally handles 
information classified by another agency. The Chief Financial Officer 
shall refer all declassification requests to the agency that originally 
classified the information. The Chief Financial Officer or the Chief 
Financial Officer's designee shall notify the requesting person or 
agency that the request has been referred to the originating agency and 
that all further inquiries and appeals must be made directly to the 
other agency.
    (b) Handling and safeguarding national security information. All 
information classified ``Top Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential'' 
shall be delivered to the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Financial 
Officer's designee immediately upon receipt. The Chief Financial Officer 
shall advise those who may come into possession of such information of 
the name of the current designee. If the Chief Financial Officer is 
unavailable, the designee shall lock the documents, unopened, in the 
combination safe located in the Office of Chief Financial Officer. If 
the Chief Financial Officer or the designee is unavailable to receive 
such documents, the documents shall be delivered to the Chief Financial 
Officer of the Personnel Office who shall lock them, unopened, in the 
combination safe in the Personnel Office. Under no circumstances shall 
classified materials that cannot be delivered to the Chief Financial 
Officer be stored other than in the two designated safes.
    (c) Storage. All classified documents shall be stored in the 
combination safe located in the Chief Financial Officer's Office, except 
as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The combination shall be 
known only to the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer's designee holding the proper security clearance.
    (d) Employee education. The Chief Financial Officer shall send a 
memo to every NCUA employee who:
    (1) Has a security clearance and
    (2) May handle classified materials.

This memo shall describe NCUA procedures for handling, reproducing and 
storing classified documents. The Chief Financial Officer shall require 
each such employee to review Executive Order 12356.
    (e) Agency terminology. The National Credit Union Administration's 
Central Office shall use the terms ``Top Secret,'' ``Secret'' or 
``Confidential'' only in relation to materials classified for national 
security purposes.

records from which information may be retrieved by use of an identifying 
particular; sets forth procedures whereby individuals may seek and gain 
access to records concerning themselves and request amendments of those 
records; and sets forth requirements applicable to NCUA employees' 
maintaining, collecting, using, or disseminating such records.


<R05>

Sec. 792.54  Procedures for requests pertaining to individual records in a system of records.

    (a) An individual seeking notification of whether a system of 
records contains a record pertaining to that individual, or an 
individual seeking access to information or records pertaining to that 
individual which are available under the Privacy Act shall present a 
request to the NCUA official identified in the access procedure section 
of the ``Notice of Systems of Records'' published in the Federal 
Register which describes the system of records to which the individual's 
request relates. An individual who does not have access to the Federal 
Register and who is unable to determine the appropriate official to whom 
a request should be submitted may submit a request to the Privacy Act 
Officer, Office of General Counsel, National Credit Union 
Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3428, in which 
case the request will then be referred to the appropriate NCUA official 
and the date of receipt of the request will be determined as the date of 
receipt by the official.
    (b) In addition to meeting the identification requirements set forth 
in Sec. 792.55, an individual seeking notification or access, either in 
person or by mail, shall describe the nature of the record sought, the

Sec. 792.55  Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests and identification of records requested.

    (a) The following standards are applicable to an individual 
submitting requests either in person or by mail under Sec. 792.54:
    (1) If not personally known to the NCUA official responding to the 
request, an individual seeking access to records about that individual 
in person shall establish identity by the presentation of a single 
document bearing a

[[Page 757]]

photograph (such as a passport or identification badge) or by the 
presentation of two items of identification which do not bear a 
photograph but do bear both a name and address (such as a driver's 
license or credit card);
    (2) An individual seeking access to records about that individual by 
mail may establish identity by a signature, address, date of birth, 
employee identification number if any, and one other identifier such as 
a photocopy of driver's license or other document. If less than all of 
this requisite identifying information is provided, the NCUA official 
responding to the request may require further identifying information 
prior to any notification or responsive disclosure.
    (3) An individual seeking access to records about himself by mail or 
in person, who cannot provide the required documentation or 
identification, may provide an unsworn declaration subscribed to as true 
under penalty of perjury.
    (b) The parent or guardian of a minor or a person judicially 
determined to be incompetent shall, in addition to establishing identity 
of the minor or other person as required in paragraph (a) of this 
section, furnish a copy of a birth certificate showing parentage or a 
court order establishing guardianship.
    (c) An individual may request by telephone notification of the 
existence of and access to records about that individual and contained 
in a system of records. In such a case, the NCUA official responding to 
the request shall require, for the purpose of comparison and 
verification of identity, at least two items of identifying information 
(such as date of birth, home address, social security number) already 
possessed by the NCUA. If the requisite identifying information is not 
provided, or otherwise at the discretion of the responsible NCUA 
official, an individual may be required to submit the request by mail or 
in person in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) An individual seeking to review records about that individual 
may be accompanied by another person of their own choosing. In such 
cases, the individual seeking access shall be required to furnish a 
written statement authorizing discussion of that individual's records in 
the accompanying person's presence.
    (e) In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) 
and (c) of this section, the published ``Notice of System of Records'' 
for individual systems may include further requirements of 
identification where necessary to retrieve the individual records from 
the system.

    (1) For determining whether access is available under the Privacy 
Act; (2) for notifying the requesting individual of that determination; 
and (3) for providing access to information determined to be available. 
In the case of an individual access request made in person, information 
determined to be available shall be provided by allowing a personal 
review of the record or portion of a record containing the information 
requested and determined to be available, and the individual shall be 
allowed to have a copy of all or any portion of available information 
made in a form comprehensible to him. In the case of an individual 
access request made by mail, information determined to be available 
shall be provided by mail, unless the individual has requested 
otherwise.
    (b) The following time limits shall be applicable to the required 
determinations, notification and provisions of access set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) A request concerning a single system of records which does not 
require consultation with or requisition of records from another agency

involved are exempt from disclosure, the Privacy Act Officer, in the 
Office of General Counsel, may extend the time period established by the 
regulations by 10 working days.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow an 
individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation

    (a) When a request for records or information from NCUA includes 
information furnished by other Federal agencies, the NCUA official 
responsible for action on the request shall consult with the appropriate 
agency prior to making a decision to disclose or refuse access to the 
record, but the decision whether to disclose the record shall be made in 
the first instance by the NCUA official.
    (b) When an individual requests medical records concerning himself, 
the NCUA official responsible for action on the request may advise the 
individual that the records to be released will be provided first to a 
physician designated in writing by the individual. The physician will 
provide the records to the individual.

Sec. 792.58  Requests for correction or amendment to a record; administrative review of requests.

    (a) An individual may request amendment of a record concerning that 
individual by addressing a request, either in person or by mail, to the 
NCUA official identified in the ``contesting record procedures'' section 
of the ``Notice of Systems of Records'' published in the Federal 
Register and describing the system of records which contains the record 
sought to be amended. The request must indicate the particular record 
involved, the nature of the correction sought, and the justification for 
the correction or amendment. Requests made by mail should be addressed 
to the responsible NCUA official at the address specified in the 
``Notice of Systems of Records'' describing the system of records which 
contains the contested record. An individual who does not have access to 
NCUA's ``Notice of Systems of Records,'' and to whom the appropriate 
address is otherwise unavailable, may submit a request to the Privacy 
Act Officer, Office of General Counsel, National Credit Union 
Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia, 22314-3428, in 
which case the request will then be referred to the appropriate NCUA 
official. The date of receipt of the request will be determined as of 
the date of receipt by that official.
    (b) Within 10 working days of receipt of the request, the 
appropriate NCUA official shall advise the individual that the request 
has been received. The appropriate NCUA official shall then promptly 
(under normal circumstances, not later than 30 working days after 
receipt of the request) advise the individual that the record is to be 
amended or corrected, or inform the individual of rejection of the 
request to amend the record, the reason for the rejection, and the 
procedures established by Sec. 792.27 for the individual to request a 
review of that rejection.

Sec. 792.59  Appeal of initial determination.

    (a) A rejection, in whole or in part, of a request to amend or 
correct a record may be appealed to the General Counsel within 30 
working days of receipt of notice of the rejection. Appeals shall be in 
writing, and shall set forth the specific item of information sought to

shall

[[Page 759]]

be addressed to the Office of General Counsel, National Credit Union 
Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. Appeals 
shall be decided within 30 working days of receipt unless the General 
Counsel, for good cause, extends such period for an additional 30 
working days.
    (b) Within the time limits set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the General Counsel shall either advise the individual of a 
decision to amend or correct the record, or advise the individual of a 
determination that an amendment or correction is not warranted on the 
facts, in which case the individual shall be advised of the right to 
provide for the record a ``Statement of Disagreement'' and of the right 
to further appeal pursuant to the Privacy Act. For records under the 
jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management, appeals will be made 
pursuant to that agency's regulations.
    (c) A statement of disagreement may be furnished by the individual. 
The statement must be sent, within 30 days of the date of receipt of the 
notice of General Counsel refusal to authorize correction, to the 
General Counsel, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, 
Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. Upon receipt of a statement of disagreement 
in accordance with this section, the General Counsel shall take steps to 
ensure that the statement is included in the system of records 
containing the disputed item and that the original item is so marked to 
indicate that there is a statement of dispute and where, within the 
system of records, that statement may be found.
    (d) When a record has been amended or corrected or a statement of 
disagreement has been furnished, the system manger for the system of 
records containing the record shall, within 30 days thereof, advise all 
prior recipients of information to which the amendment or statement of 
disagreement relates whose identity can be determined by an accounting 
made as required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or any other accounting 
previously made, of the amendment or statement of disagreement. When a 
statement of disagreement has been furnished, the system manager shall 
also provide any subsequent recipient of a disclosure containing 
information to which the statement relates with a copy of the statement 
and note the disputed portion of the information disclosed. A concise 
statement of the reasons for not making the requested amendment may also 
be provided if deemed appropriate.
    (e) If access is denied because of an exemption, the individual will 
be notified of the right to appeal that determination to the General 
Counsel within 30 days after receipt. Appeals will be determined within 
20 working days.

Sec. 792.60  Disclosure of record to person other than the individual to whom it pertains.

    No record or item of information concerning an individual which is 
contained in a system of records maintained by NCUA shall be disclosed 
by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, 
without the prior written consent of the individual to whom the record 
or item of information pertains, unless the disclosure would be--
    (a) To an employee of the NCUA who has need for the record in the 
performance of duty;
    (b) Required by the Freedom of Information Act;
    (c) For a routine use as described in the ``Notice of Systems of 
Records,'' published in the Federal Register, which describes the system 
of records in which the record or item of information is contained;
    (d) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying 
out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of 
title 13 of the United States Code;
    (e) To a recipient who has provided the NCUA with advance adequate

statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be 
transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable;
    (f) To the National Archives and Records Administration as a record 
or item which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its 
continued

[[Page 760]]

preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the 
Archivist of the United States or the designee of the Archivist to 
determine whether the record has such value;
    (g) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental 
jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a 
civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized 
by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a 
written request to NCUA specifying the particular portion desired and 
the law enforcement activity for which the record or item is sought;
    (h) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances 
affecting the health or safety of an individual if, upon such 
disclosure, notification is transmitted to the last known address of 
such individual;
    (i) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within 
its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint 
committee of Congress or subcommittee of any such joint committee;
    (j) To the Comptroller General, or any of his authorized 
representatives, in the course of the performance of the duties of the

3711(f) of title 31 of the United States Code (31 U.S.C. 3711(f)).


<R05>
Sec. 792.61  Accounting for disclosures.

    (a) Each system manager identified in the ``Notice of Systems of 
Records'' as published in the Federal Register for each system of 
records maintained by the NCUA, shall establish a system of accounting 
for all disclosures of information or records concerning individuals and 
contained in the system of records, made outside NCUA. Accounting 
procedures may be established in the least expensive and most convenient 
form that will permit the system manager to advise individuals, promptly 
upon request, of the persons or agencies to which records concerning 
them have been disclosed.
    (b) Accounting records, at a minimum, shall include the information 
disclosed, the name and address of the person or agency to whom 
disclosure was made, and the date of disclosure. When records are 
transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration for 
storage in records centers, the accounting pertaining to those records 
shall be transferred with the records themselves.
    (c) Any accounting made under this section shall be retained for at 
least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after 
the disclosure for which the accounting is made.


<R05>
Sec. 792.62  Requests for accounting for disclosures.

    At the time of the request for access or correction or at any other 
time, an individual may request an accounting of disclosures made of the 
individual's record outside the NCUA. Request for accounting shall be 
directed to the system manager. Any available accounting, whether kept 
in accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act or under 
procedures established prior to September 27, 1975, shall be made 
available to the individual, except that an accounting need not be made 
available if it relates to:
    (a) A disclosure made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552);
    (b) A disclosure made within the NCUA;
    (c) A disclosure made to a law enforcement agency pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a(b)(7);
    (d) A disclosure which has been exempted from the provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) or (k).


<R05>
Sec. 792.63  Collection of information from individuals; information forms.

    (a) The system manager, as identified in the ``Notice of Systems of 
Records'' published in the Federal Register for each system of records 
maintained by the Administration, shall be responsible for reviewing all 
forms developed and used to collect information from or about 
individuals for incorporation into the system of records.

[[Page 761]]

    (b) The purpose of the review shall be to eliminate any requirement 
for information that is not relevant and necessary to carry out an NCUA 
function and to accomplish the following objectives:
    (1) To ensure that no information concerning religion, political 
beliefs or activities, association memberships (other than those 
required for a professional license), or the exercise of other First 
Amendment rights is required to be disclosed unless such requirement of 
disclosure is expressly authorized by statute or is pertinent to and 
within the scope of any authorized law enforcement activity;
    (2) To ensure that the form or accompanying statement makes clear to 
the individual which information by law must be disclosed and the 
authority for that requirement, and which information is voluntary;
    (3) To ensure that the form or accompanying statement makes clear 
the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is being 
collected, and states concisely the routine uses that will be made of 
the information;
    (4) To ensure that the form or accompanying statement clearly 
indicates to the individual the existing rights, benefits or privileges 
not to provide all or part of the requested information; and
    (5) To ensure that any form requesting disclosure of a social 
security number, or an accompanying statement, clearly advises the 
individual of the statute or regulation requiring disclosure of the 
number, or clearly advises the individual that disclosure is voluntary 
and that no consequence will flow from a refusal to disclose it, and the 
uses that will be made of the number whether disclosed mandatorily or 
voluntarily.
    (c) Any form which does not meet the objectives specified in the 
Privacy Act and this section shall be revised to conform thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 792.64  Contracting for the operation of a system of records.

    (a) No NCUA component shall contract for the operation of a system 
of records by or on behalf of the Agency without the express approval of 
the NCUA Board.
    (b) Any contract which is approved shall continue to ensure 
compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Act. The contracting 
component shall have the responsibility for ensuring that the contractor 
complies with the contract requirements relating to the Privacy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 792.65  Fees.

    (a) Fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5) shall be assessed for 
actual copies of records provided to individuals on the following basis, 
unless the NCUA official determining access waives the fee because of 
the inability of the individual to pay or the cost of collecting the fee 
exceeds the fee:
    (1) For copies of documents provided, copy fees as stated in NCUA's 
current FOIA fee schedule; and
    (2) For copying information, if any, maintained in nondocument form, 
the direct cost to NCUA may be assessed.
    (b) If it is determined that access fees chargeable under this 
section will amount to more than $25, and the individual has not 
indicated in advance willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, 
the individual shall be notified of the amount of the anticipated fees 
before copies are made, and the individual's access request shall not be 
considered to have been received until receipt by NCUA of written 
agreement to pay.

<R05>
Sec. 792.66  Exemptions.

    (a) NCUA maintains four systems of records that are exempted from 
some provisions of the Privacy Act. In paragraph (b) of this section, 
those systems of records are identified by System Name and System 
Number, as stated in the NCUA's ``Notice of Systems of Records,'' 
published in the Federal Register. The provisions from which each system 
is exempted and the reasons therefor are also set forth.
    (b)(1) System NCUA-1, entitled ``Employee Suitability Security 
Investigations Containing Adverse Information,'' consists of adverse 
information about NCUA employees that had been obtained as a result of 
routine U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)

[[Page 762]]

security Investigations. To the extent that NCUA maintains records in 
this system pursuant to OPM guidelines that may require retrieval of 
information by use of individual identifiers, those records are 
encompassed by and included in the OPM Central system of records number 
Central-9 entitled, ``Personnel Investigations Records,'' and thus are 
subject to the exemptions promulgated by OPM. Additionally, in order to 
ensure the protection of properly confidential sources, particularly as 
to those records which are not maintained pursuant to such Office of 
Personnel Management requirements, the records in these systems of 
records are exempted, pursuant to section k(5) of the Privacy Act (5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(5)), from section (d) of the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)). To 
the extent that disclosure of a record would reveal the identity of a 
confidential source, NCUA need not grant access to that record by its 
subject. Information which would reveal a confidential source shall, 
however, whenever possible, be extracted or summarized in a manner which 
protects the source and the summary or extract shall be provided to the 
requesting individual.
    (2) System NCUA-8, entitled, ``Investigative Reports Involving Any 
Crime or Suspicious Activity Against a Credit Union, NCUA,'' consists of 
investigatory or enforcement records about individuals suspected of 
involvement in violations of laws or regulations, whether criminal or 
administrative. These records are maintained in an overall context of 
general investigative information concerning crimes against credit 
unions. To the extent that individually identifiable information is 
maintained, however, for purposes of protecting the security of any 
investigations by appropriate law enforcement authorities and promoting 
the successful prosecution of all actual criminal activity, the records 
in this system are exempted, pursuant to section k(2) of the Privacy Act 
(5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)), from sections (c)(3), and (d)). NCUA need not 
make an accounting of previous disclosures of a record in this system of 
records available to its subject, the NCUA need not grant access to any 
records in this system of records by their subject. Further, whenever 
individuals request records about themselves and maintained in this 
system of records, the NCUA shall, to the extent necessary to realize 
the above-stated purposes, neither confirm nor deny the existence of the 
records but shall advise the individuals only that no records available 
to them pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 have been identified. 
However, should review of the record reveal that the information 
contained therein has been used or is being used to deny the individuals 
any right, privilege or benefit for which they are eligible or to which 
they would otherwise be entitled under Federal law, the individuals 
shall be advised of the existence of the information and shall be 
provided the information, except to the extent disclosure would identify 
a confidential source. Information which would identify a confidential 
source shall, if possible, be extracted or summarized in a manner which 
protects the source and the summary or extract shall be provided to the 
requesting individual.
    (3) System NCUA-20, entitled, ``Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
Investigative Records,'' consists of OIG records of closed and pending 
investigations of individuals alleged to have been involved in criminal 
violations. The records in this system are exempted pursuant to Sections 
(k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), from sections (c)(3); 
(d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G); (e)(4)(H); (e)(4)(I); and (f). The records in 
this system are also exempted pursuant to Section (j)(2) of the Privacy 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), from sections (c)(3); (c)(4); (d); (e)(1); 
(e)(2); (e)(3); and (g).
    (4) System NCUA-13, entitled, ``Litigation Case Files,'' consists of 
investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes. Records 
in the Litigation Case Files system are used in connection with the 
execution of NCUA's legal and enforcement responsibilities. Because the 
system covers investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, it is eligible for exemption under subsection (k)(2) of the 
Privacy Act. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The Litigation Case Files system is 
exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), (I) and (f) 
of the Privacy Act. 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1),

[[Page 763]]

(e)(4)(G), (H), (I) and (f). However, if an individual is denied any 
right, privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be entitled by 
federal law, or for which he otherwise would be eligible, as a result of 
the maintenance of such records, the records or information will be made 
available to him, provided the identity of a confidential source is not 
disclosed.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a ``confidential source'' means a 
source who furnished information to the Government under an express 
promise that the identity of the source would remain confidential, or, 
prior to September 27, 1976, under an implied promise that the identity 
of the source would be held in confidence.

<R05>
Sec. 792.67  Security of systems of records.

    (a) Each system manager, with the approval of the head of that 
Office, shall establish administrative and physical controls to insure 
the protection of a system of records from unauthorized access or 
disclosure and from physical damage or destruction. The controls 
instituted shall be proportional to the degree of sensitivity of the 
records, but at a minimum must insure: that records are enclosed in a 
manner to protect them from public view; that the area in which the 
records are stored is supervised during all business hours to prevent 
unauthorized personnel from entering the area or obtaining access to the 
records; and that the records are inaccessible during nonbusiness hours.
    (b) Each system manager, with the approval of the head of that 
Office, shall adopt access restriction to insure that only those 
individuals within the agency who have a need to have access to the 
records for the performance of duty have access. Procedures shall also 
be adopted to prevent accidental access to or dissemination of records.


<R05>
Sec. 792.68  Use and collection of Social Security numbers.

    The head of each NCUA Office shall take such measures as are 
necessary to ensure that employees authorized to collect information 
from individuals are advised that individuals may not be required 
without statutory or regulatory authorization to furnish Social Security 
numbers, and that individuals who are requested to provide Social 
Security numbers voluntarily must be advised that furnishing the number 
is not required and that no penalty or denial of benefits will flow from 
the refusal to provide it.


<R05>
Sec. 792.69  Training and employee standards of conduct with regard to privacy.

    (a) The Director of the Office of Human Resources, with advice from 
the General Counsel, is responsible for training NCUA employees in the 
obligations imposed by the Privacy Act and this subpart.
    (b) The head of each NCUA Office shall be responsible for assuring 
that employees subject to that person's supervision are advised of the 
provisions of the Privacy Act, including the criminal penalties and 
civil liabilities provided therein, and that such employees are made 
aware of their responsibilities to protect the security of personal 
information, to assure its accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and 
completeness, to avoid unauthorized disclosure either orally or in 
writing, and to insure that no information system concerning 
individuals, no matter how small or specialized, is maintained without 
public notice.
    (c) With respect to each system of records maintained by NCUA, 
Agency employees shall:
    (1) Collect no information of a personal nature from individuals 
unless authorized to collect it to achieve a function or carry out an 
NCUA responsibility;
    (2) Collect from individuals only that information which is 
necessary to NCUA functions or responsibilities;
    (3) Collect information, wherever possible, directly from the 
individual to whom it relates;
    (4) Inform individuals from whom information is collected of the 
authority for collection, the purposes thereof, the routine uses that 
will be made of the information, and the effects, both legal and 
practical of not furnishing the information;

[[Page 764]]

    (5) Not collect, maintain, use, or disseminate information 
concerning an individual's religious or political beliefs or activities 
or his membership in associations or organizations, unless:
    (i) The individual has volunteered such information for his own 
benefit;
    (ii) The information is expressly authorized by statute to be 
collected, maintained, used, or disseminated; or
    (iii) Activities involved are pertinent to and within the scope of 
an authorized investigation or adjudication.
    (6) Advise their supervisors of the existence or contemplated 
development of any record system which retrieves information about 
individuals by individual identifier.
    (7) Maintain an accounting, in the prescribed form, of all 
dissemination of personal information outside NCUA, whether made orally 
or in writing;
    (8) Disseminate no information concerning individuals outside NCUA 
except when authorized by 5 U.S.C. 552a or pursuant to a routine use as 
set forth in the ``routine use'' section of the ``Notice of Systems of 
Records'' published in the Federal Register.
    (9) Maintain and process information concerning individuals with 
care in order to ensure that no inadvertent disclosure of the 
information is made either within or outside NCUA; and
    (10) Call to the attention of the proper NCUA authorities any 
information in a system maintained by NCUA which is not authorized to be 
maintained under the provisions of the Privacy Act, including 
information on First Amendment activities, information that is 
inaccurate, irrelevant or so incomplete as to risk unfairness to the 
individuals concerned.
    (c) Heads of offices within NCUA shall, at least annually, review 
the record systems subject to their supervision to ensure compliance 
with the provisions of the Privacy Act.

subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity 
conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures

established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 794.141-794.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 794.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 794.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 794.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 794.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock,

[[Page 772]]

or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities 
readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 794.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped 
persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is 
not required because of Sec. 794.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 794.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 794.152-794.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 794.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for

[[Page 773]]

personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 794.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

restrictions as they apply to NCUA employees.


<R05>
Sec. 796.2  Who is considered a senior examiner of the NCUA?

    For purposes of this part, an NCUA employee is considered to be the 
``senior examiner'' for a federally insured credit union if the 
employee--
    (a) Has been authorized by NCUA to conduct examinations or 
inspections of federally insured credit unions on behalf of NCUA;
    (b) Has continuing, broad, and lead responsibility for examining or 
inspecting that federally insured credit union;
    (c) Routinely interacts with officers or employees of that federally

<R05>

or employee of the NCUA who performs work (onsite or offsite) as the 
senior examiner of a federally insured credit union for a total of two 
or more months during the last 12 months of individual's employment with 
NCUA may not, within one year after leaving NCUA employment, knowingly 
accept compensation as an employee, officer, director, or consultant 
from that credit union.
    (b) Example. An NCUA resident corporate credit union examiner

December 17, 2005; or
    (b) The Chairman of the NCUA Board certifies in writing and on a

restrictions would not affect the integrity of the NCUA's supervisory 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 796.5  What are the penalties for violating these special post-employment restrictions?

    (a) Penalties under section 1786(w)(5) of the Act. An NCUA senior

criminal remedies and penalties as provided in law.


<R05>
Sec. 796.6  What other definitions and rules of construction apply for purposes of this part?

<R05>
Sec. 811.1  Authority of Reserve Banks.

    Each Reserve Bank is hereby authorized, in accordance with the 
provisions of this part, to: (a) Issue book-entry Federal Financing Bank 
securities by means of entries on its records which shall include the 
name of the depositor, the amount, the loan title (or series)

[[Page 781]]

and maturity date; (b) effect conversions between book-entry Federal 
Financing Bank securities and definitive Federal Financing Bank 
securities; (c) otherwise service and maintain book-entry Federal 
Financing Bank securities; and (d) issue a confirmation of transaction 
in the form of a written advice (serially numbered or otherwise) which 
specifies the amount and description of any securities, that is, loan 
title (or series) and maturity date, sold or transferred and the date of 
the transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 811.2  Scope and effect of book-entry procedure.

    (a) A Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent of the United States acting on 
behalf of the Federal Financing Bank, may apply the book-entry procedure 
provided for in this part to any Federal Financing Bank securities which 
have been or are hereafter deposited for any purpose in accounts with it 
in its individual capacity under terms and conditions which indicate 
that the Reserve Bank will continue to maintain such deposit accounts in 
its individual capacity, notwithstanding application of the book-entry 
procedure to such securities. This paragraph is applicable, but not 
limited, to securities deposited:
    (1) As collateral pledged to a Reserve Bank (in its individual 
capacity) for advances by it;
    (2) By a member bank for its sole account;
    (3) By a member bank held for the account of its customers;
    (4) In connection with deposits in a member bank of funds of States, 
municipalities, or other political subdivisions; or,
    (5) In connection with the performance of an obligation or duty 
under Federal, State, municipal, or local law, or judgments or decrees 
of courts.

The application of the book-entry procedure under this paragraph shall 
not derogate from or adversely affect the relationship that would 
otherwise exist between a Reserve Bank in its individual capacity and 
its depositors covering any deposits under this paragraph. Whenever the 
book-entry procedure is applied to such Federal Financing Bank 
securities, the Reserve Bank is authorized to take all action necessary 
in respect of the book-entry procedure to enable such Reserve Bank in 
its individual capacity to perform its obligations as depositary with 
respect to such Federal Financing Bank securities.
    (b) A Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent of the United States acting on 
behalf of the Federal Financing Bank, shall apply the book-entry 
procedure to Federal Financing Bank securities deposited as collateral 
pledged to the United States under current revisions of Department of 
the Treasury Circulars Nos. 92 and 176 (31 CFR, parts 203 and 202), and 
may apply the book-entry procedure, with the approval of the Secretary 
of the Treasury, to any other Federal Financing Bank securities 
deposited with a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent of the United States.
    (c) Any person having an interest in Federal Financing Bank 
securities which are deposited with a Reserve Bank (in either its 
individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States) for any 
purpose shall be deemed to have consented to their conversion to book-
entry Federal Financing Bank securities pursuant to the provisions of 
this part, and in the manner and under the procedures prescribed by the 
Reserve Bank.
    (d) No deposits shall be accepted under this section on or after the 
date of maturity or call of the securities.


<R05>
Sec. 811.3  Transfer or pledge.

    (a) A transfer or a pledge of book-entry Federal Financing Bank 
securities to a Reserve Bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal 
agent of the United States), or to the United States, or to any 
transferee or pledgee eligible to maintain an appropriate book-entry 
account in its name with a Reserve Bank under this part, is effected and 
perfected, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, by a 
Reserve Bank making an appropriate entry in its records of the 
securities transferred or pledged. The making of such an entry in the 
records of a Reserve Bank shall:
    (1) Have the effect of a delivery in bearer form of definitive 
Federal Financing Bank securities; (2) have the effect of a taking of 
delivery by the transferee or pledgee; (3) constitute the

[[Page 782]]

transferee or pledgee a holder; and (4) if a pledge, effect a perfected 
security interest therein in favor of the pledgee. A transfer or pledge 
of book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities effected under this 
paragraph shall have priority over any transfer, pledge, or other 
interest, theretofore or thereafter effected or perfected under 
paragraph (b) of this section or in any other manner.
    (b) A transfer or a pledge of transferable Federal Financing Bank 
securities, or any interest therein, which is maintained by a Reserve 
Bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United 
States) in a book-entry account under this part, including securities in 
book-entry form under Sec. 811.2(a)(3), is effected, and a pledge is 
perfected, by any means that would be effective under applicable law to 
effect a transfer or to effect and perfect a pledge of the Federal 
Financing Bank securities, or any interest therein, if the securities 
were maintained by the Reserve Bank in bearer definitive form. For 
purposes of transfer or pledge hereunder, book-entry Federal Financing 
Bank securities maintained by a Reserve Bank shall, notwithstanding any 
provision of law to the contrary, be deemed to be maintained in bearer 
definitive form. A Reserve Bank maintaining book-entry Federal Financing 
Bank securities either in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of 
the United States is not a bailee for purposes of notification of 
pledges of those securities under this subsection, or a third person in 
possession for purposes of acknowledgement of transfers thereof under 
this subsection. Where transferable Federal Financing Bank securities 
are recorded on the books of a depositary (a bank, banking institution, 
financial firm, or a similar party, which regularly accepts in the 
course of its business Federal Financing Bank securities as a custodial 
service for customers, and maintains accounts in the names of such 
customers reflecting ownership of or interest in such securities) for 
account of the pledgor or transferor thereof and such securities are on 
deposit with a Reserve Bank in a book-entry account hereunder, such 
depositary shall, for purposes of perfecting a pledge of such securities 
or effecting delivery of such securities to a purchaser under applicable 
provisions of law, be the bailee to which notification of the pledge of 
the securities may be given or the third person in possession from which 
acknowledgment of the holding of the securities for the purchaser may be 
obtained. A Reserve Bank will not accept notice or advice of a transfer 
or pledge effected or perfected under this subsection, and any such 
notice or advice shall have no effect. A Reserve Bank may continue to 
deal with its depositor in accordance with the provisions of this part, 
notwithstanding any transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this 
subsection.
    (c) No filing or recording with a public recording office or officer 
shall be necessary or effective with respect to any transfer or pledge 
of book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities or any interest therein.
    (d) A Reserve Bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate instructions, 
convert book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities into definitive 
Federal Financing Bank securities and deliver them in accordance with 
such instructions; no such conversion shall affect existing interests in 
such Federal Financing Bank securities.
    (e) A transfer of book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities 
within a Reserve Bank shall be made in accordance with procedures 
established by the Bank not inconsistent with this part. The transfer of 
book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities by a Reserve Bank may be 
made through a telegraphic transfer procedure.
    (f) All requests for transfer or withdrawal must be made prior to 
the maturity or date of call of the securities.


<R05>
Sec. 811.4  Withdrawal of Federal Financing Bank securities.

    (a) A depositor of book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities may 
withdraw them from a Reserve Bank by requesting delivery of like 
definitive Federal Financing Bank securities to itself or on its order 
to a transferee.
    (b) Federal Financing Bank securities which are actually to be 
delivered upon withdrawal may be issued either in registered or in 
bearer form, except

[[Page 783]]

that Federal Financing Bank bills will be issued in bearer form only.


<R05>
Sec. 811.5  Delivery of Federal Financing Bank securities.

    A Reserve Bank which has received Federal Financing Bank securities 
and effected pledges, made entries regarding them, or transferred or 
delivered them according to the instructions of its depositor is not 
liable for conversion or for participation in breach of fiduciary duty 
even though the depositor had no right to dispose of or take other 
action in respect of the securities. A Reserve Bank shall be fully 
discharged of its obligations under this part by the delivery of Federal 
Financing Bank securities in definitive form to its depositor or upon 
the order of such depositor. Customers of a member bank or other 
depository (other than a Reserve Bank) may obtain Federal Financing Bank 
securities in definitive form only by causing the depositor of the 
Reserve Bank to order the withdrawal thereof from the Reserve Bank.


<R05>
Sec. 811.6  Registered bonds and notes.

    Registered Federal Financing Bank securities deposited with a 
Reserve Bank for any purpose specified in Sec. 811.2 shall be assigned 
for conversion to book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities. The 
assignment, which shall be executed in accordance with the provisions of 
subpart F of 31 CFR, part 306, so far as applicable, shall be to--

    Federal Reserve Bank of ------------, as fiscal agent of the United 
States acting on behalf of the Federal Financing Bank for conversion to 
book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities.


<R05>
Sec. 811.7  Servicing book-entry Federal Financing Bank securities; payment of interest; payment at maturity or upon call.

    Interest becoming due on book-entry Federal Financing Bank 
securities shall be charged against the special agent account maintained 
by the Department of the Treasury for the Federal Financing Bank on the 
interest due date and remitted or credited in accordance with the 
depositor's instructions. Such securities shall be redeemed and charged 
against the above said account on the date of maturity or call, and the 
redemption proceeds, principal and interest, shall be disposed of in 
accordance with the depositor's instructions.
