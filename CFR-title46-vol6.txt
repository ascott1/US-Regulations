                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

preserver failed the buoyancy test, the sample shall consist of not less 
than ten specimen life preservers to be tested for buoyancy in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Buoyancy test. The buoyancy of the life preservers must be 
determined by measuring the upward force exerted by the individual 
submerged unit. The buoyancy measurement must be made at the end of the 
24 or 48 hours of submersion, as specified in the applicable approval 
subpart, during which period the pad inserts must not be disturbed.
    (g) Buoyancy required. The buoyancy must meet the requirements of 
the applicable approval subpart.
    (h) Lot inspection. On each lot, the laboratory inspector shall 
perform a final lot inspection to be satisfied that the life preservers 
meet this subpart. Each lot must demonstrate--
    (1) First quality workmanship;
    (2) That the general arrangement and attachment of all components, 
such as body straps, closures, tie tapes, and drawstrings, are as 
specified in the approved plans and specifications;
    (3) Compliance with the marking requirements in the applicable 
approval subpart; and
    (4) The information pamphlet specified in 33 CFR part 181 subpart G, 
if required, is securely attached to the device, with the PFD selection 
information visible and accessible prior to purchase.
    (i) Lot acceptance. When the independent laboratory has determined 
that the life preservers in the lot are of a type officially approved in 
the name of the company, and that such life preservers meet the 
requirements of this subpart, they shall be plainly marked in waterproof 
ink with the independent laboratory's name or identifying mark.
    (j) Lot rejection. Each nonconforming unit must be rejected. If 
three or more nonconforming units are rejected for the same kind of 
defect, lot inspection must be discontinued and the lot rejected. The 
inspector must discontinue lot inspection and reject the lot if 
examination of individual units or the records for the lot shows 
noncompliance with either this subchapter or the laboratory's or the 
manufacturer's quality control procedures. A rejected unit or lot may be 
resubmitted for testing and inspection if the manufacturer first removes 
and destroys each defective unit or, if authorized by the laboratory, 
reworks the unit or lot to correct the defect. A rejected lot or 
rejected unit may not be sold or offered for sale under the 
representation that it meets this subpart or that it is Coast Guard-
approved.

divisor must be changed to 180 (40 if buoyancy is measured in pounds) if 
the apparatus is designed so that persons supported are only partially 
immersed or where facilities are provided for climbing on top of the 
apparatus.
    (2) Number of 300 mm (1 ft.) increments in the outside perimeter of 
the buoyant apparatus. The inside edge of

[[Page 35]]

peripheral-body type buoyant apparatus is not considered in determining 
the capacity.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 160.010-7  Methods of sampling, inspections and tests.

    (a) General. Production tests must be conducted under the procedures 
in subpart 159.007 of this chapter. An inspector from the independent 
laboratory must inspect the place of manufacture, observe the various 
operations involved in the construction process and determine that 
buoyant apparatus are made in accordance with this subpart and of 
materials and parts conforming strictly with the plans and 
specifications submitted by the manufacturer and approved by the 
Commandant (G-MSE).
    (b) Sampling of production lots. A production lot must consist of 
not more than 300 buoyant apparatus of the same design and capacity 
manufactured by one factory. Samples for production tests must be 
selected at random from each lot. The required sample size for various 
lot sizes is given in Table 160.010-7(b).

91 to 300.....................................................         4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Testing of sample buoyant apparatus from production lots. Each 
sample buoyant apparatus selected for test from a production lot must be 
subjected to the tests described in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this 
section. The stability test in paragraph (h) must be performed whenever 
a question of stability arises.
    (d) Strength tests. The buoyant apparatus tested for approval must 
be subjected to the drop test. Buoyant apparatus tested for production 
lot inspections must also be subjected to the drop test except that in 
the case of peripheral body type apparatus, the beam loading test may be 
substituted.
    (1) Drop test. Drop the complete sample buoyant apparatus into still 
water from a height of 18 m (60 ft.) twice, once flat and once endwise. 
There must be no damage that would render the apparatus unserviceable.
    (2) Beam loading test. The buoyant apparatus must be stood on edge 
on one of its longer sides. A wood block 600 mm (24 in.) long and wide 
enough to cover the body of the apparatus must be centered on the top 
edge of the apparatus. A loading beam must be set at right angles to the 
float at a height so that the beam is in a horizontal position with its 
center on the center of the wood block. The loading beam must be hinged 
at one end and a load applied at the other end at a uniform rate of 225 
kg (500 lb.) per minute until the load at the end of the beam as shown 
on Table 160.010-7(d)(2) is reached. The beam is then held stationary 
for 10 minutes. The device used to apply the load must be a chain fall, 
hydraulic cylinder or other device that allows the device to unload as 
the strain on the buoyant apparatus relieves. At the end of the 10 
minute period, the drop in the load on the device must not exceed the 
maximum permissible drop shown in Table 160.010-7(d)(2). If the buoyant 
apparatus is not one of the sizes listed in the table, the loads must be 
determined by linear interpolation.

    Note: Because of the lever ratio of the beam loading apparatus 
described here, the actual loads applied to the apparatus are twice the 
loads shown in the Table.

    (e) Buoyancy test. Known weights are loaded on the sample buoyant 
apparatus until it is awash. The buoyancy is the downward force exerted 
by the weights loaded on the apparatus. A raised platform of known 
weight having two runners on edge spaced so as to bear on the apparatus 
may be used to support the weights out of water to

[[Page 36]]

avoid the necessity for making allowances for the displacement of 
submerged weights. This test is not a required production test if the 
manufacturer--
    (1) Uses the same plastic buoyancy foam used in previous production 
lots,
    (2) Determines that the density of each batch of foam used is within 
a range specified on the approved plans, and
    (3) Closely controls the amount of foam used in each apparatus.
    (f) Watertight integrity test. The buoyant apparatus is submerged 
for 24 hours at a depth of 3 m (10 ft.) or equivalent water pressure. 
The final buoyancy of the buoyant apparatus is determined in accordance 
with paragraph (e) of this section. The final buoyancy must be at least 
145 N (32 lb.) per person capacity of the buouyant apparatus or 180 N 
(40 lb.) per person capacity if the apparatus is designed so that 
persons supported are only partially immersed or if facilities are 
provided for climbing on top of the apparatus. The loss of buoyancy must 
not exceed 5 percent of the initial buoyancy. This test is not a 
required production test if the manufacturer uses the plastic buoyancy 
foam controls permitted as an alternative to the buoyancy test in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Painter attachment strength test. The apparatus must be 
positioned with its painter attachment fitting at the lowest point of 
the apparatus, directly below the center of buoyancy. The apparatus must 
be suspended in this position from the highest side. A load equal to 
twice the buoyancy of the apparatus must be suspended from the painter 
attachment fitting for 10 minutes. The fitting must remain firmly 
attached to the buoyant apparatus and the apparatus must not sustain any 
visible damage.
    (h) Stability test. With the sample buoyant apparatus floating in 
water, a weight of 22.5 kg of iron per meter of length (15 lb. per foot) 
must be suspended in the water from the life lines along one of the 
longer edges. The same test must be performed along one of the shorter 
edges. The minimum weight along any one edge must be 27 kg (60 lb.). The 
buoyant apparatus must neither capsize nor become partially awash under 
either of these tests.
    (i) Weight test. One buoyant apparatus of the lot submitted for

<R05>
Sec. 160.015-5  Inspection and testing of lifeboat winches.

    (a) Material testing. (1) The manufacturer shall furnish affidavits 
relative to the physical and chemical properties of the materials. Such 
affidavits shall be furnished by the foundry or mill supplying the 
material.
    (b) Factory test for initial approval. (1) Lifeboat winches shall be 
tested for strength and operation at a place chosen by the manufacturer 
of the winch in the presence of an inspector. The lifeboat winch under 
test shall be set up similar to the intended shipboard installation. In 
the case of a lifeboat winch with nongrooved drums, the drums shall be 
built up or sufficiently filled with wire to simulate the maximum number 
of wraps for which the winch is to be approved. The tests to be 
conducted are as noted in paragraphs (b)(2) to (8) of this section. The 
limiting values of velocities and the 2 foot braking distance set forth 
in the following paragraphs of this section are the values to be 
actually achieved with the specific arrangement of falls contemplated 
for the shipboard installation. If a different arrangement of falls is 
used to facilitate testing, due consideration shall be given to the use 
of limiting velocities, braking distances, and test weights which will 
be equivalent to the test performed with an arrangement of falls 
identical to that used for the shipboard installation.
    (2) A pull of 2.2 times the working load, equally divided between 
drums, shall be applied in a direction similar to a shipboard 
installation. The test weight producing this load shall be dropped 
through a distance of not less than 15 feet, at which time this weight 
shall be stopped within a distance of 2 feet by action of the 
counterweight alone on the hand brake.
    (3) A test identical to that noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section shall be conducted after the braking surfaces have been 
thoroughly wetted. The test weight shall be stopped by the action of the 
counterweight alone within a distance of 6 feet. The test need only be 
applied to lifeboat winches having external brakes.
    (4) With a pull equal to the working load, it shall be determined 
that the governor brake will limit the speed of lowering of the test 
weight to a maximum of 120 feet per minute, except that, in the case of 
winches designed for use with emergency lifeboats aboard passenger 
vessels, the speed of lowering shall not exceed 160 feet per minute.
    (5) With a pull equal to 0.3 times the working load, it shall be 
determined that the winch will lower the test weight at not less than 40 
feet per minute, except that, in the case of winches designed for use 
with emergency lifeboats aboard passenger vessels, the speed of lowering 
shall not be less than 60 feet per minute.
    (6) With a pull equal to the working load, the test weight shall be 
lowered and raised a sufficient number of times so that the combined 
lowering distance is not less than 500 feet. This test is to

[[Page 41]]

determine the efficiency of the lifeboat winch for prolonged service.
    (7) With a pull equal to 0.5 times the working load, it shall be 
demonstrated that the lifeboat winch can be hand operated by hoisting 
the test weight without undue effort. For gravity davits, it shall be 
demonstrated that this test weight can be carried easily from a point at 
which the traveling blocks of the falls are 1 foot below their outboard, 
two-blocked position, and then up and around the bend of the trackways 
to the stowed position of the lifeboat.
    (8) Where a quick return mechanism is installed it shall be 
demonstrated that a weight equal to 2.2 times the weight of the empty 
blocks can be handily retrieved through the regular reeving of the falls 
at a rate of not less than 40 feet per minute at the drum by one man.
    (9) The following test applies to a lifeboat winch used for hoisting 
an emergency lifeboat of a passenger vessel. With a weight equal to the 
weight of the emergency lifeboat and its full complement of persons and 
equipment, it shall be demonstrated that the weight can be hoisted 
through the regular reeving of the falls at a rate of not less than 20 
feet per minute, to the embarkation position.
    (10) After the tests noted in paragraphs (b)(2) to (9) of this 
section have been conducted, the winch shall be completely disassembled 
and the marine inspector shall ascertain that no undue stress or wear 
has been incurred.
    (c) Factory testing after approval. (1) After a design of a lifeboat 
winch has been approved, subsequent winches of the same design shall be 
individually tested as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Each lifeboat winch shall be set up in a manner similar to that 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. With a pull equal to 1.1 
times the working load, the test weight shall be dropped through a 
distance of not less than 15 feet, at which time the load shall be 
stopped by the action of the counterweight alone. This test is to 
demonstrate the operation of the winch, and if satisfactory, no further 
test need be required. However, if the inspector is not satisfied with 
the operation of the winch, a complete test as noted in paragraph (b) of 
this section may be required.
    (d) Name plate. (1) A corrosion resistant name plate shall be 
affixed to each lifeboat winch on which shall be stamped the name of the 
manufacturer, approval number, maximum working load in pounds pull at 
the drums, maximum working load in pounds pull per fall type and serial 
number, together with the Marine Inspection Office identification 
letters, the date, and the letters U.S.C.G.

    (b) Metal parts. Each metal part of a ladder must be made of 
corrosion-resistant metal or of steel galvanized by the hot dip process 
after the part is formed. If the ends of galvanized fasteners are peened 
over to lock them in place, a corrosion resisting surface treatment must 
be applied to each peened surface.
    (c) Wooden parts. Each wooden part of a ladder must be made of 
hardwood that is free of defects affecting its strength or durability.
    (d) Wood preservative. After each wooden part is formed and 
finished, it must be treated with water-repellant wood preservative that 
is properly applied.
    (e) Lashing rings. The inside diameter of each lashing ring must be 
at least 75 mm (3 in.). Each lashing ring must have a minimum breaking 
strength of at least 16 kN (3,560 lbs.).

Sec. 160.017-13  Construction.

    (a) General. Each chain ladder must have two suspension members. 
Each step in the ladder must be supported at each end by a suspension 
member.
    (b) Suspension member. The distance between the two suspension 
members must be at least 400 mm (16 in.), but not more than 480 mm (19 
in.). The chain between each top lashing ring and the first step must be 
long enough so that the distance between the center of the lashing ring 
and the top of the first step is approximately 600 mm (24 in.).
    (c) Lashing rings. A lashing ring must be securely attached to the 
top and bottom of each suspension member. The means of attachment must 
be at least as strong as the chain and the lashing ring.
    (d) Thimble or wear plate. A thimble or wear plate must be attached 
to the chain where it can slide on its connections to the lashing rings.
    (e) Steps. Each step of a ladder must have two rungs arranged to 
provide a suitable handhold and stepping surface. The distance between 
steps must be uniform. This distance must be between 300 mm (12 in.) and 
380 mm (15 in.).
    (f) Rungs. Step rungs must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Each rung must be wooden, or a material of equivalent strength, 
durability, handhold, and step surface characteristics.
    (2) In order to provide a suitable handhold and step surface, the 
width of each rung must be at least 40 mm (1\1/2\ in.) and the thickness 
must be at least 25 mm (1 in.), but not more than 40 mm (1\1/2\ in.).
    (3) The distance between the rungs in each step must be uniform. 
This distance must be between 40 mm (1\1/2\ in.) and 65 mm (2\1/2\ in.).
    (4) Each rung must be attached to a spacer ear by a method that 
prevents the rung from rotating and that supports it in a horizontal 
position when the ladder is hung vertically.
    (g) Spacer ears. Spacer ears must meet the following requirements:
    (1) All spacer ears on a ladder must be the same size and shape.
    (2) The top and bottom of each spacer ear must be attached to a 
suspension member.
    (3) The top point of attachment must be at least 100 mm (4 in.) 
above the top surfaces of the rungs attached to the spacer ear.
    (4) Each spacer ear made of sheet metal must have features such as 
formed ribs, rolled flange edges, and stress relief holes at the ends of 
cuts, to prevent the ear from bending or tearing.
    (h) Fasteners. Each fastening device must have a means to prevent 
the device from loosening.
    (i) Workmanship. A ladder must not have splinters, burrs, sharp 
edges, corners, projections, or other defects that could injure a person 
using the ladder.

<R05>
Sec. 160.017-15  Performance.

    (a) Each chain ladder must be capable of being rolled up for 
storage.
    (b) Each ladder when rolled up must be able to unroll freely and 
hang vertically.


<R05>
Sec. 160.017-17  Strength.

    (a) Each chain ladder must be designed to pass the approval tests in 
Sec. 160.17-21.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 160.017-21  Approval tests.

    (a) General. Each approval test must be conducted on a ladder of the 
longest length for which approval has been requested. If a ladder fails 
one of the tests in this section, the cause of the failure must be 
identified and any needed changes made. After a test failure and any 
design change, the failed test, and any other previously completed tests 
affected by the design change, must be rerun.
    (b) Visual examination. Before starting the tests described in this 
section, an assembled chain ladder is examined for evidence of 
noncompliance with the requirements in Secs. 160.017.11, 160.017-13, and 
160.017-15.
    (c) The following approval tests must be conducted:
    (1) Strength test 1. An assembled ladder is supported so that a 
static load, if placed on any of its steps, would exert a force both on 
the step and each suspension member. A static load of 315 kg (700 lb.) 
is then placed on one step for at least one minute. The load must be 
uniformly distributed over a contact surface that is approximately 100 
mm (4 in.) wide. The center of the contact surface must be at the center 
of the step. This test is performed on six different steps. No step may 
break, crack, or incur any deformation that remains after the static 
load is removed. No attachment between any step and a suspension member 
may loosen or break during this test.
    (2) Strength test 2. A ladder is suspended vertically to its full 
length from its top lashing rings. A static load of 900 kg (2000 lbs.) 
is then applied to the bottom lashing rings so that it is distributed 
equally between the suspension members. The suspension members, lashing 
rings, and spacer ears must not break, incur any elongation or 
deformation that remains after the test load is removed, or be damaged 
in any other way during this test.
    (3) Strength test 3. A rolled-up ladder is attached by its top 
lashing rings to anchoring fixtures in a location away from any wall or 
structure that would prevent it from falling freely, and where it can 
hang to its full length vertically. The ladder when dropped must unroll 
freely. When unrolling the ladder, its steps and attachments must not 
become cracked, broken, or loosened. Other similar damage making the 
ladder unsafe to use must likewise not occur.


<R05>
Sec. 160.017-25  Marking.

    (a) Each chain ladder step manufactured under Coast Guard approval 
must be branded or otherwise permanently and legibly marked on the 
bottom with--
    (1) The name of the manufacturer;
    (2) The manufacturer's brand or model designation;
    (3) The lot number and date of manufacture; and
    (4) The Coast Guard approval number.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 160.017-27  Production tests and examination.

    (a) General. Each ladder manufactured under Coast Guard approval 
must be tested in accordance with this section and subpart 159.007 of 
this chapter. Steps that fail testing may not be marked with the Coast 
Guard approval number and each assembled ladder that fails testing may 
not be sold as Coast Guard approved.
    (b) Test 1: Steps. Steps must be separated into lots of 100 steps 
or less. One step from each lot must be selected at random and tested as 
described in Sec. 106.017-21(c)(1), except that the step may be 
supported at the points where it would be attached to suspension members 
in an assembled ladder. If the step fails the test, ten more steps must 
be selected at random from the lot and tested. If one or more of the ten 
steps fails the test, each step in the lot must be tested.

[[Page 45]]

    (c) Test 2: Ladders. Assembled ladders must be separated into lots 
of 20 ladders or less One ladder must be selected at random from the 
ladders in the lot. The ladder selected must be at least 3 m (10 ft.) 
long or, if each ladder in the lot is less than 3 m long, a ladder of 
the longest length in the lot must be selected. The ladder must be 
tested as prescribed in Sec. 160.017-21(c)(2), except that only a 3 m 
section of the ladder need be subjected to the static load. If the 
ladder fails the test each other ladder in the lot must be tested.
    (d) Independent laboratory. Each production test must be conducted 
or supervised by an independent laboratory. However, if a test is 
performed more than 4 different times per year, laboratory participation 
is required only 4 times per year. If the laboratory does not 
participate in all tests, the times of laboratory participation must be 
as selected by the laboratory. The times selected must provide for 
effective monitoring throughout the production schedule.
    (e) Visual examination. The visual examination described in 
Sec. 160.017-21(b) must be conducted as a part of each production test.

<R05>
Sec. 160.021-2  Type.

    (a) Hand red flare distress signals specified by this subpart shall 
be of one type which shall consist essentially of a wooden handle to 
which is attached a tubular casing having a sealing plug at the handle 
end, the casing being filled with a flare composition and having a 
button of ignition material at the top, with a removable cap having a 
friction striking material on its top which may be exposed for use by 
pulling a tear strip. The flare is ignited by scraping the friction 
striker on top of the cap against the igniter button on top of the 
flare. The general arrangement of the flare is shown by Figure No. 
160.021-2(a). Alternate arrangements which conform to all the 
performance requirements of this specification (and other arrangements 
which conform with all performance requirements except candlepower and 
burning time, but provide not less than 3,000 candela-minutes with a 
minimum of \1/3\ minute burning time) will be given special 
consideration.

<R05>
Sec. 160.021-3  Materials, workmanship, construction and performance requirements.

    (a) Materials. The materials shall conform strictly to the 
specifications and drawings submitted by the manufacturer and approved 
by the Commandant. The color of the tube shall be red. Flare 
compositions containing sulphur shall not contain more than 2.6 percent 
of potassium chlorate or an equivalent amount of any other chlorate. 
Flare compositions containing chlorates in any quantity shall not 
contain any ammonium salts.
    (b) Workmanship. Hand red flare distress signals shall be of first 
class workmanship and shall be free from imperfections of manufacture 
affecting their appearance or that may affect their serviceability. 
Moistureproof coatings shall be applied uniformly and shall be free from 
pinholes or other visible defects which would impair their usefulness.
    (c) Construction. The casing shall be fitted and secured to the 
handle with not less than a 25 mm (1 in.) overlap and shall be attached 
to the handle in such a manner that failure of the joint will not occur 
during tests, ignition, or operation. The plug shall be securely affixed 
in the casing to separate the flare composition from the wooden handle. 
The flare composition shall be thoroughly mixed and be uniformly 
compressed throughout to preclude variations of density which may 
adversely affect uniformity of its burning characteristics. The cap 
shall have a lap fit of not less than 25 mm (1 in.) over the end of the 
casing and flare composition to entirely and securely protect the 
exposed surface of the igniter button and end of flare composition and 
casing, and shall have an inner shoulder so constructed that it is 
mechanically impossible for the inner surface of the cap to come in 
contact with the igniter button. The cap shall be securely attached to 
the casing in such manner as to preclude its accidental detachment. The 
cap shall be provided on its top with a friction striking material which 
shall, by a pull of the tear strip, be entirely exposed for striking the 
friction igniter button. The igniter button shall be non-water soluble 
or be protected from moisture by a coating of some waterproof substance, 
and shall be raised or exposed in such manner as to provide positive 
ignition by the friction striker. The igniter button shall be firmly 
secured in or on the top of the flare composition; the arrangement shall 
be such that the ignition will be transmitted to the flare composition. 
The assembled flare, consisting of tear strip, cap, casing, and handle, 
shall be sealed and treated to protect the flare from deterioration by 
moisture. The protective waterproof coating shall be applied so none 
adheres to the friction striking surface. Special consideration will be 
given to alternate waterproofing of the signal by means of a water-
resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a sealed plastic 
waterproof bag satisfactory to the Commandant.
    (d) Performance. Signals shall meet all the inspection and test 
requirements contained in Sec. 160.021-4.


<R05>
Sec. 160.021-4  Approval and production tests.

    (a) Approval tests. The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 
100 signals form which samples must be taken for testing for approval 
under Sec. 160.021-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and 
technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval 
tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the 
Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this Chapter.
    (b) Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and 
tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the 
procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot 
must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by 
the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the 
rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by 
the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot 
must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the 
reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and 
the results of the second test.

[[Page 48]]

    (1) Lot size. For the purposes of sampling the production of 
signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must 
be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started 
with: (i) Any change in construction details, (ii) any change in sources 
of raw materials, or (iii) the start of production on a new production 
line or on a previously discountinued production line.
    (2) Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's 
quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering 
into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, 
to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the 
approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with 
the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An 
independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of 
this Chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the 
number of lots produced in year is less than four. The inspections and 
tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no 
lots are produced during that period. If less than four lots are 
produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and 
testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or 
supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least 
once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of 
technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If 
a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the 
laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the 
reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each 
reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the 
purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections 
and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.
    (c) Operational tests. Each lot of signals must be sampled and 
tested as follows:
    (1) Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria. A sample of 
signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample 
must be the individual sample size in Table 160.021-4(c)(1) 
corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as 
prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table 
160.021-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance 
with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having 
the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of 
all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of 
units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the 
lot is accepted. If the cumulative failure percent falls between the 
accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from the 
production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative 
failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous 
samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals 
tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the 
tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the 
cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when 
fired or ignited in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the person 
firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This procedure 
is diagrammed in figure 160.021-4(c)).
    (2) Test procedure. Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as 
follows:
    (i) Conditioning of test specimens--water resistance. Immerse 
specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 
25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours. 
If the signal is protected by alternate waterproofing consisting of a 
water-resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a sealed plastic 
waterproof bag, the 24-hour water immersion conditioning will be 
conducted while the signal is in the sealed plastic waterproof bag and 
will be followed by an additional immersion of the bare signal (i.e., 
after removal from the bag) 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water 
for a period of 10 minutes.

[[Page 49]]

    (ii) Waterproofing of igniter button. Remove the cap from the test 
specimen. Place head of specimen without cap about 25 mm (1 in .) under 
the surface of water for approximately 5 minutes. Remove specimen from 
the water and wipe dry.
    (iii) Ignition and burning characteristics. Test specimens shall 
ignite and burn satisfactorily with uniform intensity when the 
directions on the signal are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite 
explosively in a manner that might be dangerous to the user or persons 
close by. The plug separating the flare composition from the handle 
shall in no case allow flame or hot gases to pass through it or between 
it and the casing in such manner as might burn the hand while holding 
the signal by the handle.
    (iv) Burning time. The burning time of a specimen shall be obtained 
by stop watch measurements from the time a distinct sustained flame is 
emitted until it ceases. Test specimens shall burn in air not less than 
2 minutes.

    (d) Technical tests. Three signals must be subjected to each of the 
following tests. Two of the three signals must pass each test in order 
for the lot of signals to be accepted.
    (1) Underwater burning. Condition each sample in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Ignite specimen and let it burn 
about 5 seconds in air. Submerge the burning signal in water in a 
vertical position with head down. Obtain under water burning time by 
stop watch measurement from time of submersion until distinct, sustained 
flame emission ceases. The test specimen shall burn under water not less 
than 5 seconds when subjected to this test.

[[Page 50]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.003

    (2) Bending strength. Place the specimen on supports 15 cm (6 in.) 
apart. Attach a weight of 35 kg (77 lb.) to a length of wire. Hang the 
weight from the supported signal by looping the wire around the signal 
approximately

[[Page 51]]

equidistant from the two points of support. Let the weight hang 
approximately 5 minutes. The test specimen shall not deflect more than 7 
mm (1/4 in.), nor shall the joint between the casing and the handle 
fail, when subjected to this test.
    (3) Tensile strength. Place the specimen in a chuck firmly holding 
it about 13 mm (1/2 in.) below the cap. Attach a weight of 35 kg (77 
lb.) to a length of wire. Hang the weight from the supported signal by 
looping the wire through a hole bored perpendicular to and through the 
axis of the handle. Let the weight hang approximately 5 minutes. The 
test specimen shall not show noticeable distortion, nor shall the joint 
between the casing and handle fail, when subjected to this test.
    (4) Luminous intensity. The luminous intensity of each specimen 
tested shall be measured by a visual photometer or equivalent 
photometric device, while the specimen is supported in a horizontal 
position and the photometer is at right angles to the axis of the 
specimen. Visual luminous intensity readings shall be observed and 
recorded at approximately 20 second intervals during the burning of the 
specimen. The minimum photometric distance shall be 3 m (10 ft.). 
Recording photometers shall have a chart speed of at least 25 mm (1 in.) 
per minute. The luminous intensity of specimen shall be computed as the 
arithmetical average of the readings recorded. The average luminous 
intensity of a test specimen shall be not less than 500 candela. The 
burning time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop watch measurements 
from the time distinct, sustained flame is emitted until it ceases. Test 
specimens shall burn in air not less than 2 minutes.
    (5) Elevated temperature, humidity and storage. Place specimen in a 
thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. 
with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove 
specimen and store at room temperature (20 deg. to 25  deg.C.) with 
approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any 
reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-
hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity 
for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. 
(Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or 
decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall ignite and operate 
satisfactorily following this conditioning.
    (6) Spontaneous ignition. Place the specimen in a thermostatically 
controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. with not more than 
10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signals shall not 
ignite or undergo marked decomposition.
    (7) Chromaticity. The color of the burning signal must be vivid red 
as defined by sections 13 and 14 of the ``Color Names Dictionary.'' Two 
identical test plates of white cardboard about 30 cm  x  60 cm 
(12" x 24") are used. Except for a negligible amount of stray daylight, 
the first test plate is illuminated by light from the specimen placed at 
a distance of about 1.5 m (5 ft.). The second test plate is illuminated 
only by light from an incandescent lamp operated at a color temperature 
close to 2,848  deg.K at a distance of about 30 cm (1 ft.). The first 
plate is viewed directly, the second through combinations of Lovibond 
red, yellow, and blue glasses selected so as to approximate a 
chromaticity match. By separating the test plates by a wide 
unilluminated area (subtending at the observer about 45 deg.), it is 
possible to make accurate determinations of chromaticity in terms of the 
1931 CIE Standard Observer and Coordinate System, in spite of 
fluctuations in luminous intensity of the specimen by factors as high as 
2 or 3. The CIE coordinates are converted to the Munsell notation which 
is cross-referenced to the color name in Section 13 of the ``Color Names 
Dictionary'' (see the discussion in section 10 of ``The Universal Color 
Language'').
    (8) Heptane ignition. (i) A metal pan must be used to hold a layer 
of water at least 12mm (\1/2\ in.) deep with a layer of technical grade 
heptane on top of the water. The pan must be at least 1 m (39 in.) 
square with sides extending between 175 mm (7 in.) and 200 mm (8 in.) 
above the surface of the water. The amount of heptane used to form the 
layer must be 2.0 liters per square

[[Page 52]]

meter of pan area (6.25 fluid ounces per square foot).
    (ii) The test must be conducted in a draft-free location. The 
ambient temperature, the temperature of the water, and the temperature 
of the heptane must all be between 20  deg.C (68  deg.F) and 25  deg.C 
(77  deg.F) at the time of the test.
    (iii) The signal under test must be held with the flame end pointing 
upward at an angle of approximately 45 deg., 1.2 m (4 ft.) directly 
above the center of the pan. The signal must be ignited as soon as the 
heptane is observed to spread out over the water in continuous layer. 
The signal must be allowed to burn completely, and must remain in 
position until is has cooled.
    (iv) The heptane must not be ignited by the flare or by material 
from the flare.

    Caution: Heptane ignites rapidly and burns vigorously. The flare 
should be remotely ignited and all personnel should stay clear of the 
test pan while the flare is burning and while any part of it remains 
hot.

    (b) Marking of expiration date. The expiration date must be not more 
than 42 months from the date of manufacture.
    (c) Other marking. (1) There shall be die-stamped, in the side of 
the wooden handle in figures not less than 3 mm (C\1/8\ in.) high, 
numbers indicating the month and year of manufacture, thus: ``6-54'' 
indicating June, 1954.
    (2) In addition to any other marking placed on the smallest packing 
carton or box containing hand red flare distress signals, such cartons 
or boxes shall be plainly and permanently marked to show the service 
life expiration date, date of manufacture, and lot number.
    (3) The largest carton or box in which the manufacturer ships 
signals must be marked with the following or equivalent words: ``Keep 
under cover in a dry place.''

    Note: Compliance with the labeling requirements of this section does 
not relieve the manufacturer of the responsibility of complying with the 
label requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1263, the Federal Hazardous Substances 
Act.

Sec. 160.021-6  Container.

    (a) General. Containers for stowage of hand red flare distress 
signals in lifeboats and life rafts on merchant vessels are not required 
to have specific approval or to be of special design, but they shall 
meet the following test for watertightness when closed, and shall be 
capable of being opened and reclosed hand-tight to meet the same 
watertightness test. The materials shall be copper, brass, bronze, or 
equally corrosion-resistant to salt water and spray. The type container 
illustrated by Figure Number 160.021-6(a) is recommended for most 
purposes.
    (b) Watertightness test for containers. Whenever a question arises 
as to the watertightness of a container, the following test may be made 
to determine whether it is satisfactory in this respect. Open the 
container, remove the contents, insert colored blotting paper as a 
lining, re-close container as tightly as possible by hand (no wrenches 
or special tools permitted), submerge container with top about 30 cm (1 
ft.) below the surface of the water for two hours, remove container from 
water, wipe off excess moisture on outside,

[[Page 53]]

then open the container and examine the blotting paper and entire 
interior for evidence of moisture penetration. If any moisture or water 
is evidenced, the container is not satisfactory.

[[Page 54]]


    (c) Marking of container. Containers shall be embossed or bear a 
brass or equivalent corrosion-resistant nameplate, or otherwise be 
suitably and permanently marked, to plainly show in letters not less 
than 13 mm (\1/2\ in.) high the following wording: ``HAND RED FLARE 
DISTRESS SIGNALS''. No additional marking which might cause confusion as 
to the contents shall be permitted. The vessel's name ordinarily is 
painted or branded on equipment such as this container, and nothing in 
this subpart shall be construed as prohibiting same.

<R05>
Sec. 160.022-2  Type.

    (a) Floating orange smoke distress signals, specified by this 
subpart shall be of one type which shall consist essentially of an outer 
container, ballast, an air chamber, an inner container, the smoke 
producing composition, and an igniter mechanism. Alternate arrangements 
which conform to the performance requirements of this specification will 
be given special consideration.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 160.022-3  Materials, workmanship, construction, and performance requirements.

    (a) Materials. The materials shall conform strictly to the 
specifications and drawings submitted by the manufacturer and approved 
by the Commandant. Metal for containers shall be not less than 0.5 mm 
(0.020 in.) in thickness. Other dimensions or materials may be 
considered upon special request when presented with supporting data. 
Igniter systems shall be corrosion-resistant metal. The combustible 
material shall be of such nature that it will not deteriorate during 
long storage, nor when subjected to frigid or tropical climates, or 
both.
    (b) Workmanship. Floating orange smoke distress signals shall be of 
first class workmanship and shall be free from imperfections of 
manufacture affecting their appearance or that may affect their 
serviceability.
    (c) Construction. The outer container shall be of a size suitable 
for its intended use. All sheet metal seams should be hook-jointed and 
soldered. The whole container shall be covered with two coats of 
waterproof paint or equivalent protection system. The igniter mechanism 
shall be simple to operate and provide ignition in most unfavorable 
weather. The mechanism shall be protected with a watertight cover having 
a finish which is corrosion-resistant to salt water and spray. The cover 
shall be easily and quickly

[[Page 55]]

removable by hand without the use of tools. If attachment of the cover 
is by formed screw threads, it shall be of such construction or material 
to prevent rusting or corrosion and will not back off and loosen under 
shipboard vibration.
    (d) Performance. Signals shall meet all the inspection and test 
requirements contained in Sec. 160.022-4.


<R05>
Sec. 160.022-4  Approval and production tests.

    (a) Approval tests. The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 
100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval 
under Sec. 160.022-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and 
technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval 
tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the 
Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this chapter.
    (b) Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and 
tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the 
procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot 
must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by 
the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the 
rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by 
the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot 
must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the 
reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and 
the results of the second test.
    (1) Lot size. For the purposes of sampling the production of 
signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must 
be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started 
with:
    (i) Any change in construction details,
    (ii) Any change in sources of raw materials, or
    (iii) The start of production on a new production line or on a 
previously discontinued production line.
    (2) Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's 
quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering 
into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, 
to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the 
approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with 
the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An 
independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of 
this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the 
number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and 
tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no 
lots are produced during that period. If less than four lots are 
produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and 
testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or 
supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least 
once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of 
technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If 
a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the 
laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the 
reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each 
reworked lot and the next lot of signals must not be counted for the 
purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections 
and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.
    (c) Operational tests. Each lot of signals must be sampled and 
tested as follows:
    (1) Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria. A sample of 
signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample 
must be the individual sample size in Table 160.022-4(c)(1) 
corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as 
prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table 
160.022-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance 
with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having 
the highest numerical value is assigned

[[Page 56]]

to that signal. If the sum of all the failure percents (cumulative 
failure percent) for the number of units in the sample is less than or 
equal to the accept criterion, the lot is accepted. If this sum is equal 
to or more than the reject criterion the lot is rejected. If the 
cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject criteria, 
another sample is selected from the production lot and the operational 
tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each sample tested 
is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the cumulative 
failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample size). 
Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either the 
accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If any 
signal in the sample explodes when fired or ignited in a way that could 
burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected 
without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 
160.022-4(c).)
    (2) Test Procedure. Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as 
follows:
    (i) Conditioning of test specimens--water-resistance. Immerse 
specimens horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal 
approximately 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period 
of 24 hours.
    (ii) Smoke emitting time. Ignite specimen according to the 
directions printed on the signal and place signal in tub or barrel of 
water. The smoke emitting time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop 
watch measurements from the time of distinct, sustained smoke emission 
until it ceases. The watch shall be stopped during periods of flame 
emission. The smoke emitting time for a specimen shall be not less than 
4 minutes.
    (iii) Ignition and smoke emitting characteristics. Test specimens 
shall ignite and emit smoke properly when the directions on the signal 
are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner 
that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. Test specimens 
shall emit smoke at a uniform rate while floating in calm to rough 
water. Signals should be so constructed that water submerging the signal 
in moderately heavy seas will not cause it to become inoperative.

    (d) Technical tests. Three signals must be subjected to each of the 
following tests. Two of the three signals must pass the test in order 
for the lot of signals to be accepted.

[[Page 58]]

    (1) Smoke emission in waves. The signal shall be ignited and thrown 
overboard under conditions where the waves are at least 30 cm (1 ft.) 
high. The smoke emitting time must be at least 4 minutes and the signal 
shall float in such a manner that the signal shall function properly 
during this test. Failure to pass this test shall be cause for the lot 
to be rejected.
    (2) Underwater smoke emission. Condition each sample in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Ignite specimen and let it 
burn about 15 seconds in air. Submerge the burning signal in water in a 
vertical position with head down. Obtain underwater smoke emission time 
by stop watch measurements from time of submersion until distinct, 
sustained smoke emission ceases. The test specimen shall emit smoke 
underwater not less than 15 seconds when subjected to this test.
    (3) Elevated temperature, humidity, and storage. Place specimen in a 
thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. 
with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove 
specimen and store at room temperature (20 deg. to 25  deg.C.) with 
approximately 65 percent relative humidity for ten days. If for any 
reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-
hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity 
for 8 hours out of each 24 during 72-hour conditioning period. (Total of 
24 hours on and 48 hours off). The signal shall not ignite or decompose 
during this conditioning. The signal shall ignite and operate 
satisfactorily following this conditioning.
    (4) Spontaneous ignition. Place the specimen in a thermostatically 
controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. with not more than 
10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal shall not 
ignite or undergo marked decomposition.
    (5) Susceptibility to explosion. Remove smoke composition from 
signal and punch a small hole in the composition. Insert a No. 6 
commercial blasting cap. Ignite the cap. The test specimen shall not 
explode or ignite.
    (6) Corrosion resistance. Expose the complete specimen with cover 
secured hand-tight to a finely divided spray of 20 percent by weight 
sodium chloride solution at a temperature between 32  deg.C and 38 
deg.C (90  deg.F and 100  deg.F) for 100 hours. The container and cap 
must not be corroded in any fashion that would impair their proper 
functioning.
    (7) Color of smoke. Ignite specimen in the open air in daytime 
according to the directions printed on the signal, and determine the 
smoke color by direct visual comparison of the unshadowed portions of 
the smoke with a color chart held so as to receive the same daylight 
illumination as the unshadowed portions of the smoke. The color of the 
smoke must be orange as defined by Sections 13 and 14 of the ``Color 
Names Dictionary'' (colors 34-39 and 48-54).
    (8) Volume and density of smoke. The test specimen shall show less 
than 20 percent transmission for not less than 3 minutes when measured 
with apparatus having a light path of 19 cm (7\1/2\ in.), an optical 
system aperture of +3.7 degrees, and an entrance air flow of 18.4m<SUP>3</SUP> 
per minute (650 cu. ft. per minute), such apparatus to be as described 
in National Bureau of Standards Report No. 4792.

<R05>
Sec. 160.024-4  Approval and production tests.

    (a) Approval tests. The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 
100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval 
under Sec. 160.024-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and 
technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval 
tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the 
Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this chapter.
    (b) Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and 
tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the 
procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot 
must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by 
the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the 
rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by 
the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot 
must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the 
reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and 
the results of the second test.
    (1) Lot size. For the purposes of sampling the production of 
signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must 
be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started 
with: (i) Any change in construction details, (ii) any change in sources 
of raw materials, or (iii) the start of production on a new production 
line or on a previously discontinued production line.
    (2) Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's 
quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering 
into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, 
to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the 
approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with 
the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An 
independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of 
this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and

[[Page 62]]

tests under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, 
unless the number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The 
inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly 
period, unless no lots are produced during this period. If less than 
four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the 
inspection and testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must 
perform or supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this 
section at least once for every ten lots of signals produced, except 
that the number of technical tests must be at least one but not more 
than four per year. If a lot of signals tested by the independent 
laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the 
inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals 
produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot produced must 
not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual 
number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the 
independent laboratory.
    (c) Operational tests. Each lot of signals must be sampled and 
tested as follows:
    (1) Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria. A sample of 
signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample 
must be the individual sample size in Table 160.024-4(c)(1) 
corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as 
prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects. (Table 
160.024-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance 
with the table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having 
the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of 
all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of 
units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the 
lot is accepted. If this sum is equal to or more than the reject 
criterion the lot is rejected. If the cumulative failure percent falls 
between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from 
the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The 
cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the 
previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the 
signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested 
and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for 
the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes 
when fired or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the 
person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This 
procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.024-4(c).)
    (2) Test procedure. Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as 
follows:
    (i) Conditioning of test specimens--water resistance. Immerse 
specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 
25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours.
    (ii) Firing and operating characteristics. Signals shall fire and 
operate satisfactorily when shot from a pistol of the type described in 
subpart 160.028. The parachute and pyrotechnic candle shall be ejected 
at approximately the maximum altitude reached by the projectile case. 
The parachute shall open and properly suspend the pyrotechnic candle 
without fouling. The pyrotechnic candle shall burn with uniform 
intensity and without damaging the parachute, shrouds, or leader line.
    (iii) Altitude. The altitude reached by a signal is considered to be 
the height at which the parachute and pyrotechnic candle are ejected 
from the projectile case, as determined by visual observation against an 
object of known height, such as a tower or ballon, or by triangulation 
from two or more points of observation, or by other method satisfactory 
to the Commandant. The altitude reached shall be not less than 45 m (150 
ft.).
    (iv) Rate of descent. The rate of descent of a signal is considered 
to be the calculated average rate obtained by dividing the altitude by 
the time of descent to the surface. The rate of descent shall not exceed 
1.8 m (6 ft.) per second.
    (v) Burning time. The burning time of the pyrotechnic candle shall 
be obtained by stop watch measurement from the time distinct, sustained 
flame is emitted until it ceases. The burning time shall be not less 
than 30 seconds.

    (d) Technical tests. Three signals must be subjected to each of the 
following tests. Two of the three signals must pass each test in order 
for the lot of signals to be accepted.
    (1) Luminous intensity. The luminous intensity of each pyrotechnic 
candle tested shall be measured by a visual photometer or equivalent 
photometric device while the specimen is supported in a horizontal 
position and the photometer is at right angles to the axis of the 
specimen. Visual luminous intensity readings shall be observed and 
recorded at approximately 5-second intervals during the burning of the 
specimen. The minimum photometric distance shall be 3 m (10 ft.). 
Recording photometers shall have a chart speed of at least 10 cm (4 in.) 
per minute. The luminous intensity of the specimen shall be computed as 
the arithmetical average of the readings recorded. The average luminous 
intensity of a specimen shall be not less than 20,000 candela.
    (2) Elevated temperature, humidity, and storage. Place specimen in a 
thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. 
with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove 
specimen and store at room temperature (20 deg. to 25  deg.C.) with 
approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any 
reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-
hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity 
for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. 
(Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or 
decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall fire and operate 
satisfactorily following this conditioning.
    (3) Spontaneous ignition. Place the specimen in a thermostatically 
controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. with not more than 
10% relative

[[Page 65]]

humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal shall not ignite or 
undergo marked decomposition.
    (4) Chromaticity. The color of the burning signal must be vivid red 
as defined by Sections 13 and 14 of the ``Color Names Dictionary.'' Two 
identical test plates of white cardboard about 30 cm  x  60 cm (12"  x  
24") are used. Except for a negligible amount of stray daylight, the 
first test plate is illuminated by light from the specimen placed at a 
distance of about 1.5 cm (5 ft.). The second test plate is illuminated 
only by light from an incandescent lamp operated at a color temperature 
close to 2,848 deg. K at a distance of about 30 cm (1 ft.). The first 
plate is viewed directly, the second through combinations of lovibond 
red, yellow, and blue glasses selected so as to approximate a 
chromaticity match. By separating the test plates by a wide 
unilluminated area (subtending at the observer about 45 deg.), it is 
possible to make accurate determinations of chromaticity in terms of the 
1931 CIE Standard Observer and Coordinate System, in spite of 
fluctuations in luminous intensity of the specimen by factors as high as 
2 or 3. The CIE coordinates are converted to the Munsell notation which 
is cross-referenced to the color name in Section 13 of the ``Color Names 
Dictionary'' (see the discussion in section 10 of ``the Universal Color 
Language'').


<R05>
Sec. 160.024-5  Marking.

    (a) Cartridge. Each pistol-projected parachute red flare distress 
signal shall be legibly marked as follows:

          Pistol-Projected Parachute Red Flare Distress Signal

20,000 candela--30 seconds burning time

use only when aircraft or vessel is sighted directions-- Fire upward 
from signal pistol Service Life Expiration Date (date to be inserted by 
manufacturer) (Month and year manufactured) Lot No.______

Manufactured by (Name and address of manufacturer)

                  U.S. COAST GUARD APPROVAL NO.______.

    (b) Marking of expiration date. The expiration date must be not more 
than 42 months from the date of manufacture.
    (c) Other marking. (1) On each pistol-projected parachute red flare 
distress signal there shall be die-stamped, in figures not less than 3mm 
(\1/8\ in.) high, on the cartridge, numbers indicating the month and 
year of manufacture, thus: ``6-54'' indicating June 1954.
    (2) The pyrotechnic candle shall be legibly marked with the month 
and year of manufacture.
    (3) In addition to any other marking placed on the smallest packing 
carton or box containing cartridges, each carton or box shall be plainly 
and permanently marked to show the service life expiration date, the 
date of manufacture, and the lot number.
    (4) The largest carton or box in which the manufacturer ships 
signals must be marked with the following or equivalent words: ``Keep 
under cover in a dry place.''

    Note: Compliance with the labeling requirements of this section does 
not relieve the manufacturer of the responsibility of complying with the 
label requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1263, the Federal Hazardous Substances 
Act.

    Source: CGD 79-167, 47 FR 41376, Sept. 20, 1982, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 160.027-2  Type.

    (a) Each life float must meet the requirements in subpart 160.010 of 
this chapter for a peripheral body type buoyant apparatus designed so 
that persons supported are only partially immersed (180 N (40 lb.) of 
buoyancy per person required).
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 160.027-3  Additional requirements for life floats.

    (a) Each life float must have a platform designed to drop through 
the center of the float, whichever way the life float is floating. A 
typical arrangement is shown in Figure 160.027-3(a).
    (b) The platform must meet the requirements of one of the following 
paragraphs:

[[Page 69]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.008

    (1) A lattice type platform must be of western red cedar, port 
orford cedar, sitka spruce, northern white pine, or southern cypress 
slats constructed on an oak frame. The slats must have nominal cross-
section dimensions not less than 90 mm (3\5/8\ in.) by 9.5 mm (\3/8\ 
in.). The frame members must have

[[Page 70]]

nominal cross-section dimensions not less than 100 mm (4 in.) by 12.5 mm 
(\1/2\ in.). The space between adjacent slats must not exceed the width 
of the slats. The space between each frame member and the adjacent slat 
must not exceed twice the width of the slats. The platform must be 
riveted together at each intersection of--
    (i) Frame members,
    (ii) Slats, and
    (iii) Frame members and slats.
    (2) A plywood platform must be made of exterior or marine type 
plywood with surfaces that are either ``A'' or ``B'' grade as commonly 
designated in the plywood industry. Holes 35 mm (1\3/8\ in.) to 50 mm (2 
in.) in diameter must be drilled through the platform. The number of 
holes must be at least the number equal to (L-25) (W-25)/225, where L is 
the length of the platform in cm and W is the width of the platform in 
cm. (The formula is (L-10)(W-10)/36 where L and W are measured in 
inches.) The thickness of the plywood must be at least--
    (i) 12.5 mm (\1/2\ in.) for life floats of 10 persons capacity and 
under,
    (ii) 16 mm (\5/8\ in.) for life floats between 11 and 25 persons 
capacity inclusive, and
    (iii) 19 mm (\3/4\ in.) for life floats of 26 persons capacity and 
over.
    (3) A platform of construction differing from that described in 
either (1) or (2) of this paragraph will be approved if it has holes to 
permit the passage of water and if it passes the tests in Sec. 160.027-
7. The number of holes must be the same as required for a plywood 
platform. If the platform is netting on a frame, the netting must be 
constructed of cordage with a breaking strength of at least 1600 N (355 
lb.). The netting must be constructed on not more than 5 cm (2 in.) 
centers and must be knotted together at each point where the lines 
intersect.
    (c) Each platform must be of a material that is resistant to 
deterioration by exposure to weather or must have a surface that 
protects it from deterioration by exposure to weather. For a wood 
platform, this surface must be at least two coats of water resistant 
spar varnish, or two coats of marine paint.
    (d) Each part of the platform, including surfaces, edges, and rivets 
must be smooth and must not have cutting edges, points, or splinters 
which would be dangerous for bare feet.
    (e) The platform must be arranged so that under normal stowed 
conditions, it can be retained in the center of the float and can be 
readily released from this position for use.
    (f) The platform must be suspended from the body of the float by a 
net or an equivalent arrangement, which when fully extended, holds the 
top of the platform approximately 900 mm (36 in.) below the center of 
the float body.
    (1) The net must be constructed of cordage with a minimum breaking 
strength of 1600 N (355 lb.). The net must be attached to the platform 
through holes on centers that do not exceed 165 mm (6\1/2\ in.).
    (2) If the platform is suspended from the body of the float by an 
arrangement other than a net as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the arrangement must be of equivalent to the net in terms of 
strength, resistance to tangling, and allowing the platform to freely 
pass through the center of the life float body.


<R05>
Sec. 160.027-7  Pre-approval tests for alternate platform designs.

    (a) The tests in this section are for life float platforms that do 
not meet the requirements of either Sec. 160.027-3(b) (1) or (2).
    (b) The float body must be supported so that the platform is 
suspended in the air by the net or equivalent supporting arrangement. 
The platform must be loaded evenly with a weight equal to 60 percent of 
the weight of the total number of persons for which the float is to be 
rated, assuming a weight of 75 kg (165 lb.) per person. The weight must 
be allowed to remain on the platform for ten minutes after which it is 
removed. The supporting arrangement and platform must not show any 
evidence of damage or permanent deformation as a result of this test.
    (c) The float body must be supported so that the platform is 
suspended in the air by the net or equivalent supporting arrangement. A 
bag of sand, shot or similar granular material weighing 90 kg (200 lb.) 
must be dropped onto the center of the platform

[[Page 71]]

from a height of 3 m (10 ft.). The supporting arrangement and platform 
must not show any damage that would affect the serviceability of the 
float or platform.
    (d) As part of the buoyancy test required in Sec. 160.010-7(e) of 
this chapter, the platform must be loaded with weights equal to \1/2\ 
the rated capacity of the float. There must be no damage to the 
supporting arrangement or platform as a result of this test.

    Note: Since the weights on the platform will be submerged during 
this test, allowance must be made for the displacement of the submerged 
weights. The weight required is calculated by the formula W=(18d)/(d-
4895), where W is the required submerged weight per person (in kg) and d 
is the density of the material (in kg/m<SUP>3</SUP>). (In customary U.S. 
units, the formula is W=40d)/(d-63) where W is in lb. and d is in lb./
ft.<SUP>3</SUP>).

    (2) A weight equal to 2.2 times the working load shall be suspended 
from the eye or end of the davit arm. With

[[Page 78]]

this load suspended from the davit it shall be operated from the full 
inboard to the full outboard position using the same operating crank or 
device used in actual practice aboard ship. The load shall then be swung 
in a fore and aft direction through an arc of approximately 10 degrees, 
each side of the vertical. The davit arm and frame shall show no 
permanent set or undue stress from this test. While this test is being 
conducted, the frame and arm, if of cast material, shall be subject to a 
test by being hammered to satisfy the inspector that the castings are 
sound and without flaws.
    (3) A weight equal to 0.5 times the normal working load shall be 
suspended from the eye or end of the davit arm. This load shall be moved 
from the full inboard to the full outboard position using the actual 
handles supplied with the davit. The time required for this operation 
shall not exceed 90 seconds. The above test shall also be conducted with 
the davits set up to simulate a 15-degree inboard list with a 10-degree 
trim to determine that the davits may be satisfactorily operated in that 
condition. The above test shall also be conducted with the davits set up 
to simulate a 15-degree outboard list with a 10-degree trim. This test 
shall determine that the davit arms will not run out under the weight of 
the light boat.
    (4) A load of 1.1 times the normal working load shall be moved from 
the full outboard to the full inboard position to demonstrate the 
strength of operation of the return mechanism.
    (5) Gravity davits shall be tested for strength and operation at the 
place of manufacture in the presence of an inspector. The davit arms, 
tracks, frames, attachments, etc., shall be set up in a manner similar 
to an actual shipboard installation. This installation shall include a 
lifeboat winch suitable for gravity davits and the falls shall be reeved 
in the normal manner. The tests to be conducted are as noted in 
paragraphs (b)(6) to (8) of this paragraph.
    (6) A weight equal to 1.1 times the working load shall be run from 
the full inboard to the full outboard position with the davit assembly 
in the normal upright condition. The davit arm, trackways, etc., shall 
show no permanent set or undue stress from this test.
    (7) A weight equal to 2.2 times the working load shall be attached 
to the falls and suspended from the davit arm when in the full outboard 
position. The load shall be swung in a fore and aft direction through an 
arc of approximately 10 degrees each side of the vertical. The davit arm 
and trackways shall show no permanent set or undue stress from this 
test.
    (8) The entire davit assembly shall then be heeled inboard 15 
degrees and with a 10-degree trim. In this condition a weight equal to 
0.5 times the working load shall be suspended from the falls and shall 
be operated from the full inboard to the full outboard position. This 
test shall demonstrate that the load is sufficient to turn out the davit 
by merely releasing the brake on the winch. Stops shall be made at 
intervals between the inboard and outboard positions to assure that the 
davit will start from any position.
    (c) Factory testing after approval. (1) After the design of a 
mechanical davit has been approved, subsequent davits of the same design 
shall be individually tested as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) After the design of a gravity davit has been approved, 
subsequent davit arms of the same design shall be individually tested as 
described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, except that the swing 
test may be eliminated if not practicable.
    (d) Name plate. (1) A corrosion resistant name plate shall be 
affixed to each davit arm and frame on which shall be stamped the name 
of the manufacturer, approval number, type and serial number of the 
davit, maximum working load in pounds per arm together with the Marine 
Inspection Office identification letters, the date, and the letters

Sec. 160.035-5  Construction of steel motor-propelled lifeboats with and without radio cabin.

    (a) General provisions applicable to all motor-propelled lifeboats. 
(1) A motor-propelled lifeboat, carried as part of the lifesaving 
equipment of a vessel, whether required or not, shall comply with all 
the requirements for an oar-propelled lifeboat, and in addition, shall 
have sufficient additional buoyancy to compensate for the weight of the 
engine and other equipment.
    (2) The engine shall be enclosed in a suitable engine box which 
shall be watertight with the exception of the top which may be 
weathertight. If the engine box is made of material other than steel or 
aluminum, such as fibrous glass reinforced plastic, it shall be made of 
fire retardant material. The top of the engine box shall be fitted with 
a screwdown mushroom vent. The

[[Page 85]]

engine box shall be fitted with a suitable drain. An engine starting 
instruction plate shall be permanently attached to the engine box. There 
shall be ample space between the engine and the engine box to permit 
proper maintenance and removal of engine accessories when necessary. If 
the internal arrangements of the engine in the engine box do not permit 
this, then suitable watertight hand-hole plates shall be installed in 
the vicinity of these accessories. The location of these plates and the 
accessibility to the accessories shall be to the satisfaction of the 
marine inspector. The marine inspector may require the removal of any 
accessory through these hand-hole plates that he may deem necessary to 
establish that it is of proper size and location.
    (3) Fuel tanks must be constructed of steel, fibrous glass 
reinforced plastic or other approved equivalent. Fuel tanks must be 
adequately supported and securely fastened inside the lifeboat to 
prevent any movement. Fuel tanks must have no openings in the bottom, 
sides or ends. Openings for fill, vent and feed pipes must be on the top 
surface of the tanks. The vent size for tanks of 50 gallons or less must 
not be less than \1/4\-inch O.D. tubing. Vents for larger tanks will be 
given special consideration. The access openings in the thwarts for the 
fill tank cap must have a flush cover or the top of the cap must be 
flush with the top of the thwart. Fuel feed pipes must be provided with 
a shutoff valve at the tank, where it is readily accessible and its 
location marked. Tanks must be tested by a static head above the tank 
top of ten feet of water without showing leakage or permanent 
deformation. A graduated measure stick or other means must be provided 
to determine the amount of the fuel in the tank.
    (i) Steel diesel oil fuel tanks shall have a thickness of not less 
than 12 USSG and shall not be galvanized on the inside; however, the 
outside of such tanks shall be so treated as to to obtain a corrosion 
resistance approximately equivalent to hot-dip galvanizing. Swash plates 
shall be fitted in tanks over 30 inches in length.
    (ii) Fibrous glass reinforced plastic diesel oil fuel tanks shall 
have a thickness of not less than 0.187 inch. The resins used shall be

MIL-R-21607. The mechanical properties of the tank shall not be less 
than Grade No. 4 of military specification MIL-P-17549. Mat, woven 
roving and 1000th cloth shall be used. Tank laminates shall not be 
constructed exclusively with fibrous glass fabrics. An increment of 
random oriented, chopped fibrous glass reinforcement is deemed necessary 
to prevent porosity. An ounce and a half per square foot is considered 
minimum. Inclusion of fabrics in low pressure laminates are recommended 
to impart satisfactory containment, strength, and rigidity. For maximum 
strength, tank surfaces should be cambered and curved wherein practical. 
Fittings shall be made of nonferrous metal and securely bonded to the 
tank with epoxy resin. A fibrous glass reinforced plate or boss of the 
same thickness as the tank proper and 1\1/2\ times the outside 
dimensions of the fitting shall be used to strengthen the openings for 
fuel, fill and vent lines. Tanks shall be constructed of a minimum 
possible number of sections. Where two parts are joined there shall be a 
minimum of 2-inch overlap. Tanks exceeding 18 inches in any horizontal 
dimension shall be fitted with vertical baffle plates at intervals not 
exceeding 18 inches. Baffle plate flanges shall be integral and shall be 
of the same strength and stiffness as the tank wall. Flanges shall be 
bonded in place with mat and fabric. A suitable striking plate shall be 
installed at the bottom of the fuel measurement and fill pipe line. The 
laminate may be increased in thickness, in the way of the fill pipe. The 
cover of the fuel tank shall be through bolted as well as bonded. All 
fuel tanks shall bear legible, permanent labels, conveniently located 
for visual inspection, signifying full compliance with these 
specifications and including the following:

    (b) Materials. (1) Plating for shell, air tanks, etc., shall be as 
shown in Table 160.035-6.
    (c) Welding. (1) Welding may be substituted for riveting in the 
following locations: Hoist plate to keel, disengaging gear grace plate 
to stem and sternpost, rudder attachment fitting to the sternpost, and 
the propeller shaft stern tube to the sternpost. When using 6061-T6 
aluminum, the welded area is to be heat-treated and checked by X-ray to 
assure a satisfactory weld. When using 5086-H 112 aluminum, the welded 
area is to be checked by a nondestructive test method such as X-ray, 
ultrasonic waves or fluorescent materials, to assure a satisfactory 
weld. Other methods of checking aluminum welds will be given separate 
consideration. The welding shall be performed by a welder qualified by 
the U.S. Coast Guard, American Bureau of Shipping, or U.S. Navy 
Department, and only suitable electrodes shall be used. Details of the 
joints shall be indicated on the construction drawings submitted for 
approval.
    (d) Dissimilar metals. (1) Where in the construction of aluminum 
lifeboats the use of dissimilar metals are employed such as, the 
installation of the mechanical disengaging gear, hand propelling gear, 
or engine, suitable insulation between the aluminum and these metals 
shall be used. Porous or absorbent materials shall not be used as 
insulating materials. Only non-porous materials such as plastics, rubber 
or neoprene base compounds, or micarta shall be used. Other suitable 
material will be given separate consideration. Fasteners used in joining 
dissimilar metals together shall be of the type that will minimize 
corrosion.

Sec. 160.035-8  Construction of fibrous glass reinforced plastic (F.R.P.), oar-, hand-, and motor-propelled lifeboats.

    (a) General requirements. (1) Plastic lifeboats shall comply with 
the general requirements for the construction and arrangement of steel 
lifeboats, except that unless otherwise specified, materials, 
scantlings, methods of construction, fastenings, methods of attachment 
of component parts, and other specific construction details may be 
varied by the builder in order to produce a structurally sound boat 
meeting in every respect recognized standards of first class 
construction and one which will satisfactorily meet the performance 
requirements set forth in this subpart.
    (2) Fibrous glass reinforced plastic lifeboats may be of the 
following categories of hull construction:

A--Single piece, outer hull construction.
B--Two piece, outer hull construction.
C--Single piece, inner hull construction.
D--Two piece, inner hull construction.
E--Multi-piece, inner hull construction.

    (b) Specific requirements--(1) Resin. The resin used shall be of the 
fire retardant, nonair inhibited-type conforming to Class A of Military 
Specification MIL-R-21607 and Grade A, Class O of Military Specification 
MIL-R-7575, including tests after 1 year's weathering. In addition, the 
test panels shall be tested for continued conformance with Military 
Specification MIL-R-21607. All tests, including weathering of samples, 
shall be accomplished by an independent laboratory. Complete 
certification by the independent laboratory with test data shall be 
submitted to Coast Guard (G-MSE) for acceptance. Class A resin shall be 
fire retardant without additives. Class B resins will be given 
consideration upon request. Class B resin shall be fire retardant with 
additives and shall meet the same test requirements as that for Class A 
resins. When Class B resin is used for the prototype lifeboat, additives 
for fire retardancy shall not be used in order to obtain a translucent 
laminate for inspection purposes. This prototype test lifeboat will not 
be stamped approved, nor will it be acceptable for merchant vessels. 
Whichever class of resin the manufacturer decides to use for his 
prototype lifeboat, shall be used in his production lifeboats. A note to 
this effect shall be included in his specifications and drawings for 
this particular size and type lifeboat.
    (2) Glass reinforcement. The glass reinforcement used shall have 
good laminated wet strength retention and shall

[[Page 90]]

meet the appropriate military specification stated in this paragraph. 
Glass cloth shall meet Military Specification MIL-Y-1140, Class C, form 
4, No. 1000-150. Woven roving shall conform to Military Specification 
MIL-C-19663, Style 605-308 or Style 605-604. Other glass materials 
equivalent in strength, design, wet out, and efficiency will be given 
consideration upon request.
    (3) Laminate. All exposed surfaces of the finished laminate shall 
present a smooth finish, and there shall be no protruding surface 
fibers, open voids, pits, cracks, bubbles or blisters. The laminate 
shall be essentially free from resin-starved or overimpregnated areas, 
and no foreign matter shall remain in the finished laminate. The entire 
laminate shall be fully cured and free of tackiness, and shall show no 
tendency to delaminate, peel, or craze in any overlay. The laminate 
shall not be released from the mold until a Barcol hardness reading of 
not less than 40-55 is obtained from at least 10 places on the nongel 
coated surface, including all interior inner and outer hull surfaces and 
built-in lockers. The mechanical properties of the laminate shall meet 
the requirements for a Grade 3 laminate as specified in Table I of 
Military Specification MIL-P-17549. Other grades will be given 
consideration on specific request. For the prototype boat of each design 
made by each manufacturer, the layup shall be made of unpigmented clear 
resins so that all details of construction will be visible for 
inspection and test panels representative of each prototype layup shall 
be tested in accordance with MIL-P-17549.
    (4) Weights of F.R.P. lifeboats. (i) The variations in weight 
between the fibrous glass reinforced plastic in the prototype F.R.P. 
lifeboat and the fibrous glass reinforced plastic in the production 
F.R.P. lifeboat shall be within 5 percent. This weight shall be for the 
F.R.P. sections only and shall not include the weight of any hardware or 
equipment.
    (ii) When assembling two similar sections as indicated by categories 
B and D of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the weights of the matching 
F.R.P. pieces shall be within 5 percent of each other.
    (iii) The recorded weights of the items indicated in paragraphs 
(b)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section shall be kept by the manufacturer, 
with each boat listed by size, type, and serial number.

Sec. 160.035-9  Cubic capacity of lifeboats.

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply to the measurement 
of a lifeboat to determine its cubic capacity.
    (1) Length (L). The length is the distance in feet from the inside 
of the plating or planking at the stem to the corresponding position at 
the stern. In the case of a boat with a square stern, the after terminus 
is the inside of the transom.
    (2) Breadth (B). The breadth is the distance in feet over the 
plating or planking at the point where the breadth of the boat is 
greatest.
    (3) Depth (D). The depth is the distance in feet amidships inside 
the plating from the top of the keel to the level of the gunwale. The 
depth used for calculating purposes shall not exceed 45 percent of the 
breadth.
    (4) Sheer. Lifeboats shall have a sheer at each end at least equal 
to 4 percent of the length, and a sheer at the quarter points of at 
least 1 percent of the length. If less sheer is provided, the depth used 
to determine the cubic capacity shall be assumed to be reduced so as to 
achieve this minimum sheer.
    (b) Formula. The cubic capacity shall be determined by the following 
formula:


L  x  B  x  D  x  0.64

In the case of lifeboats with unusual proportions, the Commandant may 
require that the cubic capacity be calculated by exact measurements from 
which the exact seating capacity may be determined.
    (c) Motor-propelled lifeboat. The cubic capacity of a motor-
propelled lifeboat shall be determined in the same manner as an oar-
propelled lifeboat and then deducting from the gross volume, a volume 
equal to the engine box

[[Page 91]]

and accessories, and when carried, the radio cabin, searchlight, and 
their accessories. The volume of such equipment extending above the 
sheer line need not be deducted.

Sec. 160.035-10  Number of persons allowed in lifeboats.

    (a) The maximum number of persons for which the lifeboat may be 
rated is determined as noted in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this 
section. The smallest number obtained is the number to be used.
    (1) The number of persons which a lifeboat shall be permitted to 
accommodate shall be equal to the greatest whole number obtained by 
dividing the capacity in cubic feet by the factor shown in Table 
160.035-10(a). The net cubic capacity shall be determined by 
Sec. 160.035-9(b).

    (2) The number of persons permitted in the lifeboat shall not exceed 
the number for which seating space is provided as determined by drawing 
figures to scale of a size as noted in Figure 160.035-10(a)(2) on an 
arrangement plan of the lifeboat.
    (3) The number of persons permitted in the lifeboat shall not exceed 
the number of persons wearing life preservers which can be seated in the 
lifeboat without interfering with the use of the oars or the operation 
of other propulsion equipment.

Sec. 160.035-11  Inspection and testing of lifeboats.

    (a) General. Coast Guard marine inspectors shall be admitted to any 
place in the builder's factory where work is done on these lifeboats or 
component materials or parts. Lifeboats shall be inspected during the 
course of construction to determine that the arrangements and materials 
entering into the construction are in accordance with approved plans, 
and to insure that

[[Page 92]]

the workmanship is of good quality. Samples of materials entering into 
construction may be taken by the marine inspectors for such tests as may 
be deemed necessary at any time there is any question as to suitability 
or adequacy of any material or arrangement.
    (b) Preapproval tests. Before approval is granted to any design of 
lifeboat, the following tests shall be made by a marine inspector:
    (1) Strength test. The light lifeboat shall be suspended by shackles 
at the bow and stern, or by means of the releasing gear, and the length, 
beam, and depth shall be measured. Weights shall then be added to equal 
the weight of the equipment, food, water, etc., and persons for which 
the boat is to be approved, and the length, beam, and depth measured. 
Additional weight shall then be added so that the suspended load is 25 
percent greater than the weight of the fully equipped and loaded 
lifeboat and the measurements repeated. All weights shall then be 
removed and the measurements rechecked. There shall be no appreciable 
set as a result of this test.
    (2) Flooding test. Lifeboats shall be flooded while open to the sea 
to determine the amount of buoyancy necessary to float the complete boat 
including releasing gear but with no equipment, provision lockers, water 
tanks, or fuel tanks aboard. If provision lockers, water tanks, and fuel 
tanks cannot be removed, they should be flooded or filled to the final 
waterline. Lifeboats fitted with watertight stowage compartments to 
accommodate individual drinking water containers shall have these 
individual containers aboard and placed in the stowage compartments 
which shall be sealed watertight during the flooding test. Ballast of 
equivalent weight and density should be substituted for the motor, 
shaft, propeller, radio battery, searchlight, etc., if they are to be 
installed.
    (i) Boats with independent buoyancy tanks or buoyancy units. The 
estimated amount of buoyancy to just float the boat in this condition 
should be fitted symmetrically aboard the lifeboat, and then the boat 
flooded. If the tops of the gunwales at their lowest point do not clear 
the surface of the water, the buoyancy shall be increased as necessary. 
An additional volume of buoyancy, or buoyancy units, equal to at least 
one-tenth the cubic capacity of the lifeboat shall be provided.
    (ii) Boats with built-in buoyancy compartments. When flood testing 
lifeboats with built-in buoyancy compartments weights shall be placed in 
the bottom of the lifeboat to counteract the buoyancy provided for the 
persons to be carried. The amount of weight required per person carried 
shall be as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Weight per
                         Materials                              person
                                                               (pounds)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iron or steel..............................................           72
Lead.......................................................           69
Concrete...................................................          110
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Other impervious material may be used if more convenient. The weight per 
person required is determined from the formula


W = <INF>63</INF>d <divide> d - 63

where d is the density of material in pounds per cubic foot (Sandbags 
should not be used for this purpose inasmuch as their weight under water 
is not readily predictable.) If the lifeboat weighted as above does not 
float with the gunwale at the lowest point just clear of the surface of 
the water, unit air tanks should be slipped beneath the thwarts until 
the gunwales do clear the surface of the water. The additional air 
tankage required shall be incorporated in the design of the lifeboat.
    (3) Seating capacity test. The lifeboat shall be fully loaded with 
equipment, and in this condition the number of persons for which the 
lifeboat is to be approved shall be seated, in accordance with the 
seating plan required in Sec. 160.035-14(a). All persons shall wear an 
approved life preserver and it shall be demonstrated by actual test that 
there is sufficient room to row the boat without interference.
    (4) Freeboard test. Freeboards shall be measured to the low point of 
the sheer with the lifeboat in light condition with neither equipment 
nor persons aboard, and in the loaded condition with full equipment and 
persons aboard.

[[Page 93]]

    (5) Stability test. Upon the conclusion of the seating test, all 
persons on one side of the centerline shall disembark. The remaining 
people should sit upright and not move from their original positions. 
(Not less than one-half in total number of persons should remain in the 
lifeboat.) Freeboard to the low point of sheer shall then be measured. 
This freeboard should, in general, be not less than 10 percent of the 
depth of the lifeboat.
    (c) Motor-propelled lifeboats must pass the tests as required for an 
oar-propelled lifeboat in Sec. 160.035-3. In addition, speed tests over 
a measured course and fuel consumption tests on a time basis shall be 
made to determine that the fully loaded motor-propelled lifeboats can 
maintain a speed of 6 knots for all classes of motor-propelled 
lifeboats, and that for each class of motor-propelled lifeboat its fuel 
tanks carry sufficient fuel for at least 24 hours at 6 knots. A 4-hour 
endurance trial shall be conducted with the fully loaded lifeboat at the 
RPM attained in the speed test in order to insure that there is no 
overheating, undue vibration, or other condition which would warrant the 
belief that the lifeboat could not maintain its proper speed for 24 
hours. The time consumed in conducting the speed and fuel consumption 
tests may be counted toward the 4-hour endurance test. It shall be 
demonstrated that all engines installed in motor lifeboats can be 
started by the acceptable cranking system installed with no previous 
warming up period.
    (d) Hand-propelled lifeboats shall be subjected to the same tests as 
required for an oar-propelled lifeboat. In addition, a test shall be 
made to assure that the lifeboat can be satisfactorily maneuvered with 
the hand-propelling gear. A speed of at least three knots shall be 
achieved in both light and load condition over a measured course of not 
less than 1,000 feet.

    (a) General. These tests are required in addition to the preapproval 
tests required for steel lifeboats in Sec. 160.035-11. The prototype 
boat of each size or design submitted will be required to perform 
satisfactorily in the following tests which will be made in the presence 
of a marine inspector.
    (b) Strength test. The following tests described in this paragraph 
are in lieu of the strength test in Sec. 160.035-11(b)(1):
    (1) Suspension tests. The light lifeboat shall be suspended freely 
from the releasing gear and the length, beam, and depth measured. 
Weights shall then be added to equal the weight of the equipment, food, 
water, and persons to be carried (see Sec. 160.035-11(b)(2)(ii)), and 
the length, beam, and depth measured. Additional weights shall then be 
added so that the suspended load is 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent greater 
than the weight of the fully equipped and loaded lifeboat and the 
measurements taken at each 25 percent increments. (Water may be used for 
all or any portion of the weight if desired.) All weights shall then be 
removed and final measurements taken. There shall be no fractures or 
other signs of excessive stress and no appreciable set as a result of 
this test.
    (2) Chock test. The light lifeboat shall be placed on blocks located 
under the keel at the quarter points and measurements of length, beam, 
and depth taken. The boat shall be flooded with water equal to the 
weight of all equipment, food, water, and persons to be carried and 
measurements of length, beam, and depth taken again. Additional 
measurements of 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the weight of the fully 
equipped and loaded lifeboat shall be added and the measurements taken 
at 25 percent increments. If the boat becomes full of water before 100 
percent overload is reached, no additional weight need be added, and the 
last deflection measurements with the boat under load shall be taken at 
this point. The boat shall be drained and final measurements taken. 
There shall be no fractures or other signs of excessive stress and no 
appreciable set as a result of this test.
    (3) Swing test. The boat shall be loaded with weights equal to the 
weight of all equipment, food, water and persons to be carried. It shall 
then be suspended by the releasing gear with falls 20 feet in length so 
arranged that when

[[Page 94]]

hanging freely the gunwale on one side of the boat is approximately 2 
inches from a stationary concrete or steel wall or other structure of 
similar construction and rigidity. The boat shall then be hauled 
outboard a horizontal distance of 8 feet from its original position. 
From this point, the boat shall be allowed to freely swing inboard and 
strike the wall along one side. There shall be no damage which would 
render the boat unserviceable.
    (4) Drop test. The boat shall be loaded with weights equal to the 
full weight of all equipment, food, water and persons to be carried. The 
boat shall then be suspended freely from the releasing gear and shall be 
dropped in a free fall into the water from a height of 10 feet. There 
shall be no damage which would render the boat unserviceable.
    (5) Thwart test. A 200-pound sand bag shall be dropped from a height 
of 6 feet on the center of each thwart span. The thwarts shall not 
fracture or otherwise be rendered unserviceable.
    (6) Towing test. With a towline rigged around the forward thwart in 
the same manner as the sea painter is normally rigged, the fully loaded 
lifeboat shall be towed at least 1,000 yards at a speed of not less than 
5 knots. The boat shall exhibit satisfactory towing characteristics and 
there shall be no appreciable damage to the thwart.
    (7) Tanks and lockers. Equipment tanks and watertight lockers shall 
be tested with not less than 1.0 p.s.i. of air pressure both before and 
after the tests described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 160.035-13  Testing and inspection after approval.

    (a) General. After the design of a lifeboat has been approved, 
subsequent lifeboats of the same design shall be individually inspected 
and tested as noted in Sec. 160.035-11(a) for metal lifeboats and 
paragraph (b) of this section for FRP. lifeboats. In addition, motors 
and band-propelling gear when installed shall be operated in the 
``ahead'', ``neutral'', and ``astern'' positions. If mechanical 
disengaging apparatus is fitted, it shall be tested by suspending the 
lifeboat loaded with deadweight equivalent to the number of persons 
allowed in the lifeboat (165 pounds per person) together with the weight 
of the equipment, plus 10 percent of the total load, including the 
weight of the lifeboat. The release lever shall then be thrown over with 
this load suspended until the lifeboat is released. The apparatus shall 
be capable of being operated freely by one man, without the use of aids 
or undue force to the satisfaction of the marine inspector. (This test 
may be conducted ashore by suspending the lifeboat just clear of the 
ground.)
    (b) Additional production inspection and tests for FRP. lifeboats--
(1) Inspection requirements. Each production model fibrous glass 
reinforced plastic lifeboat shall as a condition to its being accepted 
as Coast Guard approved equipment, be examined by a marine inspector at 
the following stages in its manufacture:
    (i) When the major, individual components of the shell and inner 
hull or buoyancy casing are completed but before they are assembled 
together. At this stage the marine inspector shall satisfy himself that 
these components comply with the approved plans and specifications by 
visual inspection, thickness measurements and comparison of the weights 
of the components with the weights recorded for the same components in 
the prototype.
    (ii) At the time the internal buoyancy is installed. If block 
plastic foam is used, it shall be inspected after it has been cut to 
size and shaped but before it is inserted and covered. The installation 
shall be completed in the presence of the marine inspector and he shall 
verify that the required amount is used by weighing the material. If 
foamed-in-place plastic foam is used, the marine inspector shall be 
present during the foaming operation. A sample of the foam shall be 
retained outside the boat and when it sets it shall be used to make a 
density determination of the material.
    (iii) When the boat is completed. At this stage the marine inspector 
shall check the scantlings of the minor components and the overall 
compliance with the plans. The manufacturer shall certify that the 
materials used are in accordance with the approved bill of materials.

[[Page 95]]

    (2) Test requirements. After the inspections listed in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section are completed, the following tests are to be 
carried out to the satisfaction of the marine inspector:
    (i) The boat shall be suspended freely from the releasing gear and 
the length, breadth and depth measured. The boat shall then be flooded 
with water equal to 1\1/2\ times the weight of the boat, persons, 
equipment, and provisions and fuel (if motor driven) less the weight of 
the boat. This is represented by the following formula:

  Water added = 1.5  x  (empty boat + equipment + provisions + fuel + 
                          people) - empty boat

The length, breadth and depth shall be measured in this loaded condition 
and, again, after the load has been removed. The loaded deflections and 
the permanent deformations shall not significantly exceed those recorded 
for the prototype in the pre-approval tests. Also, while flooded, the 
exterior of the hull shall be examined for leaks or other defects. After 
the boat is drained, the attachment of the release gear shall be 
carefully examined.
    (ii) All provision tanks shall be tested by a static head above the 
tank top of 2 feet of water without showing leakage or permanent 
deformation.
    (iii) The plastic fuel tanks shall be tested by a static head above 
the tank top of 10 feet of water without showing leakage or permanent 
deformation.
    (c) Marking. (1) A corrosion resistant nameplate shall be affixed at 
the bow of each lifeboat on which is stamped the name of the 
manufacturer, serial number, approval number, dimensions of the 
lifeboat, cubic capacity, buoyancy capacity, net weight of the boat in 
Condition A and Condition B, the number of persons for which the 
lifeboat is approved, together with the Marine Inspection Office 
identification letters, the date, and the letters U.S.C.G. Condition A 
includes buoyancy and water tanks and provision stowage compartments but 
no equipment, provisions, water or persons. Condition B includes full 
required provisions and equipment, persons allowed at 10 cubic feet or 
by seating test whichever is less at 165 pounds and 3 quarts of water 
(6.25 pounds)--per person.

Sec. 160.035-14  Procedure for approval of lifeboats.

    (a) Before action is taken on any design of lifeboat, plans covering 
fully the arrangement and construction of the lifeboat, material 
specifications, together with a lines drawing, stowage arrangement, 
seating arrangement, and other details shall be submitted to the 
Commandant through the Commander of the Coast Guard District in which 
the lifeboat is built. The plans for approval must be detailed to a 
degree that the lifeboat can be constructed from the plans submitted.
    (b) If the drawings required in paragraph (a) of this section are 
satisfactory, the manufacturer shall notify the Commander of the Coast 
Guard District in which the lifeboat is built in writing when 
fabrication is to commence. A marine inspector will be assigned to 
witness the construction procedure in accordance with the plans, verify 
the tests required by Sec. 160.035-11 for metal lifeboats and 
Sec. 160.035-12 for additional tests required for F.R.P. lifeboats. 
Also, the manufacturer shall provide the necessary tools and facilities 
required to conduct the tests. The Coast Guard shall have the right to 
require such other additional tests as reasonably may be deemed 
necessary, either with the completed boat or component parts, depending 
upon the particular construction methods and materials used by the 
builder, or any unusual conditions or circumstances which may arise 
during the construction or testing.
    (c) At the time that the tests are successfully completed, the 
manufacturer shall present to the marine inspector four corrected copies 
of the plans noted in paragraph (a) of this section, including any 
corrections, changes, or additions which may have been found necessary 
during construction or testing. If the manufacturer desires more than 
one set of approved plans, additional copies shall be submitted at that 
time.
    (d) Upon receipt of corrected drawings and satisfactory test 
reports, the

[[Page 96]]

Commandant will issue a certificate of approval. No change shall be made 
in the design or construction without first receiving permission of the 
Commandant via the Commander of the Coast Guard District in which the 
lifeboat is built.

Sec. 160.036-2  Type.

    (a) Handheld rocket-propelled parachute red flare distress signals 
specified by this subpart shall be of one type which shall consist 
essentially of a completely self-contained device which can be fired 
from the hand to provide a rocket-propelled parachute red flare distress 
signal.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 160.036-3  Materials, workmanship, construction and performance requirements.

    (a) Materials. The materials used in handheld rocket-propelled 
parachute red flare distress signals shall conform strictly to the 
specifications and drawings submitted by the manufacturer and approved 
by the Commandant. In general, all exposed parts shall be corrosion-
resistant or properly protected against corrosion.
    (b) Workmanship. Handheld rocket-propelled parachute red flare 
distress signals shall be of first class workmanship and shall be free 
from imperfections of manufacture affecting their appearance or that may 
affect their serviceability.
    (c) Construction. The exterior case of the cartridge shall be made 
of a suitable metal and shall protect against the entrance of moisture. 
The construction shall be such that the parachute and pyrotechnic candle 
will be expelled at approximately the maximum altitude reached.
    (d) Performance. Signals shall meet all of the inspection and test 
requirements contained in Sec. 160.036-4.


<R05>
Sec. 160.036-4  Approval and production tests.

    (a) Approval tests. The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 
100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval 
under Sec. 160.036-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and 
technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval 
tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the 
Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this chapter.
    (b) Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and 
tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the 
procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot 
must not be represented as meeting this Subpart or as being approved by 
the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the 
rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by 
the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot 
must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the 
reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and 
the results of the second test.
    (1) Lot size. For the purposes of sampling the production of 
signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must 
be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started 
with:

[[Page 97]]

    (i) Any change in construction details,
    (ii) Any changes in sources of raw materials, or
    (iii) The start of production on a new production line or on a 
previously discontinued production line.
    (2) Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's 
quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering 
into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, 
to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the 
approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with 
the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Inspections and test by an independent laboratory. An 
independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of 
this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the 
number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and 
tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no 
lots are produced during this period. If less than four lots are 
produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and 
testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or 
supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least 
once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of 
technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If 
a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the 
laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the 
reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each 
reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the 
purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections 
and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.
    (c) Operational tests. Each lot of signals must be sampled and 
tested as follows:
    (1) Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria. A sample of 
signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample 
must be the individual sample size in Table 160.036-4(c)(1) 
corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as 
prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table 
160.036-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance 
with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having 
the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of 
all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of 
units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the 
lot is accepted. If this sum is equal to or more than the reject 
criterion the lot is rejected. If the cumulative failure percent falls 
between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from 
the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The 
cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the 
previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the 
signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested 
and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for 
the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes 
when fired or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the 
person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This 
procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.036-4(c)).
    (2) Test procedure. Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as 
follows:
    (i) Conditioning of test specimens--water resistence. Immerse 
specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 
25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours.
    (ii) Firing and operating characteristics. Signals shall fire and 
operate satisfactorily when the manufacturer's directions are followed. 
The parachute and pyrotechnic candle shall be ejected at approximately 
the maximum altitude reached by the projectile case. The parachute shall 
open and properly suspend the pyrotechnic candle without fouling. The 
pyrotechnic candle shall burn with uniform intensity and without 
damaging the parachute, shrouds, or leader line.
    (iii) Altitude. The altitude reached by a signal is considered to be 
the height

[[Page 98]]

at which the parachute and pyrotechnic candle are ejected from the 
projectile case, as determined by visual observation against an object 
of known height, such as a tower or balloon, or by triangulation from 
two or more points of observation, or by other method satisfactory to 
the Commandant. The altitude reached shall be not less than 150 m (500 
ft.).
    (iv) Rate of descent. The rate of descent of a signal is considered 
to be the calculated average rate obtained by dividing the altitude by 
the time of descent to the surface. The rate of descent shall not exceed 
4.5 m (15 ft.) per second.
    (v) Burning time. The burning time of the pyrotechnic candle shall 
be obtained by stop watch measurement from the time a distinct, 
sustained flame is emitted until it ceases. The burning time shall be 
not less than 30 seconds.

    (d) Technical tests. Three signals must be subjected to each of the 
following tests. Two of the three signals must pass each test in order 
for the lot of signals to be accepted.
    (1) Luminous intensity. The luminous intensity of each pyrotechnic 
candle

[[Page 100]]

tested shall be measured by a visual photometer or equivalent 
photometric device while the specimen is supported in a horizontal 
position and the photometer is at right angles to the axis of the 
specimen. Visual luminous intensity readings shall be observed and 
recorded at approximately 5-second intervals during the burning of the 
specimen. The minimum photometric distance shall be 3 m (10 ft.). 
Recording photometers shall have a chart speed of at least 10 cm (4 in.) 
per minute. The luminous intensity of the specimen shall be computed as 
the arithmetical average of the readings recorded. The average luminous 
intensity of a specimen shall be not less than 20,000 candela.
    (2) Elevated temperature, humidity, and storage. Place specimen in a 
thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. 
with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove 
specimen and store at room temperature (20 deg. to 25  deg.C.) with 
approximately 65 percent relative humidity for ten days. If for any 
reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-
hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity 
for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. 
(Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or 
decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall fire and operate 
satisfactorily following this conditioning.
    (3) Spontaneous ignition. Place the specimen in a thermostatically 
controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. with not more than 
10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal shall not 
ignite or undergo marked decomposition.
    (4) Chromaticity. The color of the burning signal must be vivid red 
as defined by Sections 13 and 14 of the ``Color Names Dictionary.'' Two 
identical test plates of white cardboard about 30 cm  x  60 cm 
(12" x 24") are used. Except for a negligible amount of stray daylight, 
the first test plate is illuminated by light from the specimen placed at 
a distance of about 1.5 m (5 ft.). The second test plate is illuminated 
only by light from an incandescent lamp operated at a color temperature 
close to 2,848 deg. K at a distance of about 30 cm (1 ft.). The first 
plate is viewed directly, the second through combinations of Lovibond 
red, yellow, and blue glasses selected so as to approximate a 
chromaticity match. By separating the test plates by a wide 
unilluminated area (subtending at the observer about 45 deg.), it is 
possible to make accurate determinations of chromaticity in terms of the 
1931 CIE Standard Observer and Coordinate System, in spite of 
fluctuations in luminous intensity of the specimen by factors as high as 
2 or 3. The CIE coordinates are converted to the Munsell notation which 
is cross-referenced to the color name in Section 13 of the ``Color Names 
Dictionary'' (see the discussion in Section 10 of ``The Universal Color 
Language'').

Sec. 160.036-5  Marking.

    (a) General. Each hand-held rocket-propelled parachute red flare 
distress signal shall be legibly marked or labeled as follows:

    (Company brand or style designation) Hand-Held Rocket-Propelled 
Parachute Red Flare Distress Signal--20,000 candela--30 seconds burning 
time. Use Only When Aircraft or Vessel Is Sighted. Directions--(In 
numbered paragraphs, simply worded instructions for firing the device). 
Service Life Expiration Date (date to be inserted by manufacturer) 
(Month and year manufactured) (Lot No. ____) Manufactured by (Name and 
address of manufacturer) U.S. Coast Guard Approval No. ____.

    (b) Marking of expiration date. The expiration date must be not more 
than 42 months from the date of manufacture.
    (c) Other marking. (1) On each hand-held rocket propelled parachute 
red flare distress signal there shall be die-stamped in figures not less 
than 3 mm (\1/8\ in.) high, on the signal, numbers indicating the month 
and year of manufacture, thus: ``6-54'' indicating June, 1954.
    (2) The pyrotechnic candle shall be legibly marked with the month 
and year of manufacture.
    (3) In addition to any other marking place on the smallest packing 
carton or box containing signals, each carton or box shall be plainly 
and permanently

[[Page 101]]

marked to show the service life expiration date, date of manufacture, 
and lot number.
    (4) The largest carton or box in which the manufacturer ships 
signals must be marked with the following or equivalent words: ``Keep 
under cover in a dry place.''

    Note: Compliance with the labeling requirements of this section does 
not relieve the manufacturer of the responsibility of complying with the 
label requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1263, the Federal Hazardous Substances 
Act.

<R05>
Sec. 160.037-2  Type.

    (a) Hand orange smoke distress signals specified by this subpart 
shall be one type which shall consist essentially of a wooden handle to 
which is attached a tubular casing having a sealing plug at the handle 
end, the casing being filled with a smoke producing composition and fuse 
with button of ignition material at the top, and a removable cap having 
a friction striking material on its top which may be exposed for use by 
pulling a tear strip. The signal is ignited by scraping the friction 
striker on top of the cap against the igniter button on top of the body 
of the signal. Alternate arrangements which conform to the performance 
requirements of this specification will be given special consideration.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 160.037-3  Materials, workmanship, construction, and performance requirements.

    (a) Materials. The materials shall conform strictly to the 
specifications and drawings submitted by the manufacturer and approved 
by the Commandant. The color of the tube shall be orange. The 
combustible materials shall be of such nature as will not deteriorate 
during long storage, nor when subjected to frigid or tropical climates, 
or both.
    (b) Workmanship. Hand orange smoke distress signals shall be of 
first class workmanship and shall be free from imperfections of 
manufacture affecting their appearance or that may affect their 
serviceability. Moisture proof

[[Page 102]]

coatings shall be applied uniformly and shall be free from pinholes or 
other visible defects which would impair their usefulness.
    (c) Construction. The casing shall be fitted and secured to the 
handle with not less than a 25 mm (1 in.) overlap and shall be attached 
to the handle in such a manner that failure of the joint will not occur 
during tests, ignition, or operation. The plug shall be securely affixed 
in the casing to separate the smoke composition from the wooden handle. 
The smoke composition shall be thoroughly mixed and be uniformly 
compresssed throughout to preclude variations of density which may 
adversely affect uniformity of its smoke emitting characteristics. The 
cap shall have a lap fit of not less than 25 mm (1 in.) over the end of 
the casing and smoke composition to entirely and securely protect the 
exposed surface of the igniter button and end of smoke composition and 
casing, and shall have an inner shoulder so constructed that it is 
mechanically impossible for the inner surface of the cap to come in 
contact with the igniter button. The cap shall be securely attached to 
the casing in such manner as to preclude its accidental detachment. The 
cap shall be provided on its top with a friction striking material which 
shall, by a pull of the tear strip, be entirely exposed for striking the 
friction igniter button. The igniter button shall be non-water soluble 
or be protected from moisture by a coating of some waterproof substance, 
and shall be raised or exposed in such manner as to provide positive 
ignition by the friction striker. The igniter button shall be firmly 
secured in or on the top of the smoke composition; the arrangement shall 
be such that the ignition will be transmitted to the smoke producing 
composition. The assembled signal, consisting of tear strip, cap, 
casing, and handle, shall be sealed and treated to protect the signal 
from deterioration by moisture. The protective waterproof coating shall 
be applied so none adheres to the friction striking surface. Special 
consideration will be given to alternate waterproofing of the signal by 
means of a water-resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a 
sealed plastic waterproof bag satisfactory to the Commandant.
    (d) Performance. Signals shall meet all the inspection and test 
requirements contained in Sec. 160.037-4.


<R05>
Sec. 160.037-4  Approval and production tests.

    (a) Approval tests. The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 
100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval 
under Sec. 160.037-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and 
technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval 
tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the 
Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this chapter.
    (b) Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and 
tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the 
procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot 
must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by 
the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the 
rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by 
the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot 
must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the 
reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and 
the results of the second test.
    (1) Lot size. For the purposes of sampling the production of 
signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must 
be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started 
with:
    (i) Any change in construction details,
    (ii) Any change in sources of raw materials, or
    (iii) The start of production on a new production line or on a 
previously discontinued production line.
    (2) Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's 
quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering 
into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, 
to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the 
approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested

[[Page 103]]

in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (3) Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An 
independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of 
this Chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the 
number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and 
tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no 
lots are produced during this period. If less than four lots are 
produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and 
testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or 
supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least 
once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of 
technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If 
a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the 
laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the 
reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each 
reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the 
purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections 
and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.
    (c) Operational tests. Each lot of signals must be sampled and 
tested as follows:
    (1) Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria. A sample of 
signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample 
must be the individual sample size in Table 160.037-4(c)(1) 
corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as 
prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defeats (Table 
160.037-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance 
with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having 
the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of 
all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of 
units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the 
lot is accepted. If the sum is equal to or more than the reject 
criterion the lot is rejected. If the cumulative failure percent falls 
between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from 
the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The 
cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the 
previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the 
signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested 
and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for 
the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes 
when fired, or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the 
person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This 
procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.037-4(c)).
    (2) Test procedure. Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as 
follows:
    (i) Conditioning of test specimens--water resistance. Immerse 
specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 
25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours. 
If the signal is protected by alternate waterproofing consisting of a 
water-resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a sealed plastic 
waterproof bag, the 24-hour water immersion conditioning will be 
conducted while the signal is in the sealed plastic waterproof bag and 
will be followed by an additional immersion of the bare signal (i.e., 
after removal from the bag) 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water 
for a period of 10 minutes.
    (ii) Waterproofing of igniter button. Remove the cap from the test 
specimen. Place head of specimen without cap about 25 mm (1 in.) under 
the surface of water for approximately 5 minutes. Remove specimen from 
the water and wipe dry.
    (iii) Smoke emitting time. Ignite specimen according to directions 
printed on the signal. The smoke emitting time of a specimen shall be 
obtained by stop watch measurements from the time of distinct, sustained 
smoke emission until it ceases. The watch shall be stopped during 
periods of flame emission. The smoke emitting time for a specimen shall 
be not less than 50 seconds.

[[Page 104]]

    (iv) Ignition and smoke emitting characteristics. Test specimens 
shall ignite and emit smoke properly when the directions on the signal 
are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner 
that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. The plug 
separating the smoke producing composition from the handle shall in no 
case allow flame or hot gases to pass through it or between it and the 
casing in such manner as might burn the hand while holding the signal by 
the handle.

    (d) Technical tests. Three signals must be subjected to each of the 
following tests. Two of the three signals must pass each test in order 
for the lot of signals to be accepted.
    (1) Underwater smoke emission. Condition each sample in accordance 
with

[[Page 106]]

paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Ignite specimen and let it burn 
about 15 seconds in air. Submerge the burning signal in water in a 
vertical position with head down. Obtain underwater smoke emission time 
by stop watch measurements from time of submersion until smoke emission 
ceases. The test specimen shall burn underwater not less than 10 seconds 
when subjected to this test.
    (2) Bending strength. Place the specimen on supports 15 cm (6 in.) 
apart. Attach a weight of 35 kg (77 lb.) to a length of wire. Hang the 
weight from the supported signal by looping the wire around the signal 
approximately equidistant from the two points of support. Let the weight 
hang approximately 5 minutes. The test specimen shall not deflect more 
than 7 mm (\1/4\ in.), nor shall the joint between the casing and the 
handle fail when subjected to this test.
    (3) Tensile strength. Place the specimen in a chuck firmly holding 
it about 13 mm (\1/2\ in.) below the cap. Attach a weight of 35 kg (77 
lb.) to a length of wire. Hang the weight from the supported signal by 
looping the wire through a hole bored perpendicular to and through the 
axis of the handle. Let the weight hang approximately 5 minutes. The 
test specimen shall not show noticeable distortion, nor shall the joint 
between the casing and handle fail, when subjected to this test.
    (4) Elevated temperature, humidity and storage. Place specimen in a 
thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. 
with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove 
specimen and store at room temperature (20 deg. to 25  deg.C.) with 
approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any 
reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-
hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity 
for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. 
(Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or 
decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall ignite and operate 
satisfactorily following this conditioning.
    (5) Spontaneous ignition. Place the specimen in a thermostatically 
controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. with not more than 
10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal shall not 
ignite or undergo marked decomposition.
    (6) Susceptibility to explosion. Remove smoke composition from 
signal and punch a small hole in the composition. Insert a No. 6 
commercial blasting cap. Ignite the cap. The test specimen shall not 
explode or ignite.
    (7) Color of smoke. Ignite specimen in the open air in daytime 
according to the directions printed on the signal, and determine the 
smoke color by direct visual comparison of the unshadowed portions of 
the smoke with a color chart held so as to receive the same daylight 
illumination as the unshadowed portions of the smoke. The color of the 
smoke must be orange as defined by Sections 13 and 14 of the ``Color 
Names Dictionary'' (colors 34-39 and 48-54).
    (8) Volume and density of smoke. The test specimen shall show less 
than 70 percent transmission for not less than 30 seconds when measured 
with apparatus having a light path of 19 cm (7\1/2\ in.), an optical 
system aperture of +3.7 degrees, and an entrance air flow of 18.4m<SUP>3</SUP> 
per minute (650 cu. ft. per minute), such apparatus to be as described 
in National Bureau of Standards Report No. 4792.

    (2) Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An 
independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of 
this chapter must inspect and test appliances and rockets at least once 
each year. The inspection must determine that the appliances and rockets 
are being produced in accordance with the appropriate plans. The tests 
must be in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Performance tests--(1) Appliances. Each appliance shall be 
tested by firing three rounds. These rounds may be regular rockets or 
buoyant type rockets carrying regular service lines, as provided in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this paragraph or may be dummy projectiles, of the 
same size and weight as the regular rocket projectile, expelled into an 
earthen bank or other resisting medium from a reasonable distance. At 
least one of the rounds shall be fired using a primer-ejector cartridge 
loaded with a charge double the normal charge; the other rounds may be 
fired using regular primer-ejector cartridges. After the firing tests 
have been completed, each appliance shall be fired twice using the 
regular primer-ejector cartridges only, for the purposes of 
demonstrating that the appliance is still in operating condition. The 
entire assembly of the appliance shall then be examined. Results of the 
test firing and the physical examination shall show none of the 
following: Failure to eject cartridge, failure to close breech, trigger 
malfunction, safety lock failure to function, breech catch malfunction, 
broken spring, broken handgrips, cracked barrel or discharge chamber, 
firing pin or plunger broken, distorted or excessively worn or loose 
breech. A single misfire is acceptable if a second cartridge fires on 
repeated test. Misfire of both shall be cause for rejection of the 
appliance. More than one loose screw shall be cause for rejection. If an 
appliance exhibits a single loose screw, it may be retightened.
    (2) Rockets. The rocket shall utilize a solid fuel propellant which 
shall function in accordance with all applicable requirements of MIL-R-
23139. The use of black powder for the rocket motor is not acceptable. 
The ignition of the rocket motor shall occur at such a distance from the 
appliance so as not to spew flame, hot gaseous exhaust, or hot particles 
of propellant in such a manner as to create a hazard to personnel or the 
vessel. The rocket shall have a service line carrier assembly 
permanently attached and made of material, or suitably protected, to 
withstand the heat from the rocket motor's exhaust. From each 200 
rockets manufactured, not less than three must be selected to be tested 
by firing with service line attached. The rockets selected will, over a 
period of time, include representative samples of both the regular and 
buoyant type rockets, except that the approval test must include both 
types. The line shall be carried, under conditions of reasonably still 
atmosphere, a minimum of 230 m (750 ft.), without breaking or fouling 
the line, and the rocket shall alight not more than 15 m (50 ft.) from 
either side of the target line. In no case shall a test rocket be fired 
without a line attached. After a buoyant type rocket is fired, it shall 
demonstrate its ability to float in water for not less than 2 hours. 
Failure to meet any of the test requirements, nose cone cracks, rupture 
in flight, erratic flight, or unusual burning rate, shall be cause for 
rejection of rockets produced until suitable correction has been made. 
If rockets selected from this lot are used for the tests required in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section this may be accepted as meeting the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (3) Primer-ejector cartridges. Inasmuch as primer-ejector cartridges 
are used for the tests required by paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this 
paragraph, additional tests of primer-ejector cartridges will be made 
only when deemed advisable by the independent laboratory. Misfiring or 
failure of any kind shall be cause for rejection of cartridges produced 
until suitable correction has been made.

    (5) The recognized laboratory must assign an inspector to a plant 
when notified that a lot is ready for inspection, to conduct tests and 
inspections on samples selected in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section.
    (6) If a vest fails the buoyancy test, the sample from the next 
succeeding lot must consist of 10 specimen vests or more to be tested 
for buoyancy in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) Additional tests. An inspector from the recognized laboratory or 
the Coast Guard may conduct an examination, test, and inspection of a 
listed and labeled buoyant device that is obtained from the manufacturer 
or through commercial channels to determine its conformance to the 
applicable requirements.
    (d) Test facilities. The manufacturer shall admit the laboratory 
inspector and the Coast Guard inspector to any part of the premises at 
the place of manufacture of a listed and labeled device to--
    (1) Examine, inspect, or test a sample of a part or a material that 
is included in the construction of the device; and
    (2) Conduct any necessary examination, inspection, or test in a 
suitable place and with appropriate apparatus provided by the 
manufacturer.
    (e) Buoyancy--(1) Buoyancy test method. Remove the buoyant pad 
inserts from the vest and cut three slits each not less than 2 inches in 
length and not less than 2 inches apart on both sides of each pad. 
Securely attach the spring scale in a position directly over the test 
tank. Suspend the weighted wire basket from the scale in such a manner 
that the basket is weighed while it is completely under water. In order 
to measure the actual buoyancy provided by the pads, proceed as follows:
    (i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.
    (ii) Place the pads inside the basket and submerge it so that the 
top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water 
for 24 hours. The tank shall be locked or sealed during this 24-hour 
submergence period. It is important that after the pads have once been 
submerged they shall remain submerged for the duration of the test, and 
at no time during the course of the test shall they be removed from the 
tank or otherwise exposed to air.
    (iii) After the 24-hour submergence period unlock or unseal the tank 
and weigh the weighted wire basket with the pads inside while both are 
still under water.
    (iv) The buoyancy is computed as (i) minus (iii).
    (2) Buoyancy required. The pad inserts from adult buoyant vests 
shall provide not less than 16 pounds buoyancy; the pad inserts from 
child medium vests shall provide not less than 11 pounds buoyancy; and 
the pad inserts from child small vests shall provide not less than 7\1/
4\ pounds buoyancy.
    (f) Body strap test. The complete body strap assembly, including 
hardware, shall be tested for strength by attaching the dee ring to a 
suitable support such that the assembly hangs vertically its full 
length. A weight as specified in Sec. 160.047-3(f) shall be attached to 
the other end on the snap hook for 10 minutes. The specified weight 
shall not break or excessively distort the body strap assembly.

    (a) General. This specification covers buoyant cushions of the box 
type filled with kapok or fibrous glass contained in heat-sealed vinyl 
film pad covers which are inserted in an outer cover fitted with grab 
straps. The primary purpose of such cushions is to provide buoyancy to 
aid a person in keeping afloat in the water. No hooks, snaps, or other 
means shall be included which might facilitate fastening the cushion to 
a boat. Buoyant cushions shall be of such size and volume as to provide 
not less than 20 pounds buoyancy when tested in the manner described in 
Sec. 160.048-5(e), but no cushion providing less than 225 square inches 
of top surface area or measuring less than 2 inches or more than 3 
inches in thickness will be acceptable.
    (b) Cover. One piece of material each for the top and bottom shall 
be stitched together to form the cover except that piecing of the cover 
material will be allowed provided it is for decorative purposes only. 
Gusset or boxing materials shall be of not more than two pieces. If more 
than one piece of material is used for the top, bottom, boxing or 
gusset, they shall be attached by a double row of stitching of the type 
shown in Federal Standard No. 751, for seam types SSw-2 or LS(b)-2. The 
top and bottom may be of any of the materials permitted for the cover, 
but the boxing or gusset shall be a cotton fabric as specified by 
Sec. 160.048-3(c)(1) or other equivalent material of a porous nature. 
Nonporous materials will not be permitted for the boxing or gusset, but 
coated upholstery cloth specified by Sec. 160.048-3(d)(2), perforated to 
permit adequate draining and drying will be acceptable.
    (c) Buoyant material. Buoyant cushions shall be filled with the 
minimum amounts of kapok or fibrous glass determined as follows:
    (1) Rectangular buoyant cushions 2 inches thick shall be filled with 
the amounts of kapok or fibrous glass indicated for the various widths 
and lengths of such cushions by Table 160.048-4(c)(1)(i) or 160.048-

\1\ Determine amount of fibrous glass from formula (2) contained in Sec.  160.048-4(c)(2).


[[Page 126]]

    (2) All buoyant cushions more than 2 inches thick, and all buoyant 
cushions 2 inches thick which are of shapes different from those covered 
by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall be filled with kapok or 
fibrous glass as determined in the following formulas:

Amount of kapok (ounces) = A  x  t <divide> 22.5    (1)

Amount of fibrous glass (ounces) = A  x  t <divide> 12.5    (2)

Where:

A = Top surface area of cushion in square inches as determined from 
measurements taken along finished edges.
t = Thickness of boxing or gusset of finished cushion in inches.

    (d) Pad covers for buoyant material. Before being inserted in the 
outer cover the buoyant material shall be placed in waterproof vinyl 
film pad covers which shall be heat-sealed tight. The heat-sealed pad 
seams shall show an adhesion of not less than 8 pounds when one inch 
strips cut across and perpendicular to the seams are pulled apart at a 
rate of separation of the clamping jaws of the test machine of 12 inches 
per minute. Each cushion shall contain not less than four pads and all 
pads in a cushion shall contain approximately equal portions of the 
total amount of buoyant material in the cushion. The buoyant material 
may be inserted directly into the vinyl film pad covers, or may first be 
packed in bags made of print cloth or other suitable material and then 
inserted into the vinyl film pad covers. The pads shall be of such size 
as to adequately fill the outer cover, and prior to sealing, the pads 
shall be evacuated of air sufficiently that when sat on the pads will 
not ``balloon'' excessively because of the pressure in the pad covers. 
For 15" x 15" x 2" cushions the four vinyl film pad covers shall each be 
cut approximately 12" wide  x  12" long or approximately 8" wide  x  18" 
long shall have a sealed area of approximately 125 square inches; shall 
contain not less than 5 ounces of kapok or 9 ounces of fibrous glass 
each; and the volume displacement of the individual heat-sealed pad 
inserts shall be 5\1/2\ pounds each, plus or minus \1/2\ pound, when 
tested in accordance with the method set forth in Sec. 160.048-5(e)(1), 
except that the pad covers shall not be slit open, and the period of 
submergence shall be only long enough to determine the displacement of 
the pads.
    (e) Grab straps. Grab straps shall be attached as shown on Dwg. No. 
160.048-1 and shall finish 20 inches long and 1 inch wide at opposite 
ends. The grab straps, if formed from cover material shall be folded and 
stitched together so as to produce a double thickness with raw edges 
turned under. Other means will be given special consideration.
    (f) Seams and stitching. Seams shall be constructed with not less 
than a \3/8\ inch border between the seam and the edge of the cover 
materials. All stitching shall be a lock stitch, 7 to 9 stitches per 
inch, except as follows: Chain stitching 6 to 8 stitches per inch, with 
20/4 thread on top and 40/3 thread on the bottom, will be acceptable in 
constructing straps.
    (g) Workmanship. All cushions shall be of first class workmanship 
and shall be free from defects materially affecting their appearance or 
serviceability. Cushions classified as ``seconds'' or ``irregular'' will 
not be acceptable under this specification.

Sec. 160.048-5  Inspections and tests.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1</SUP> The manufacturer of a personal flotation device must meet 33 
CFR 181.701 through 33 CFR 181.705 which require an instruction pamphlet 
for each device that is sold or offered for sale for use on recreational 
boats.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) General. Manufacturers of listed and labeled buoyant cushions 
shall maintain quality control of the materials used, manufacturing 
methods and the finished product so as to meet the applicable 
requirements, and shall make sufficient inspections and tests of 
representative samples and components produced to maintain the quality 
of the finished product. Records of tests conducted by the manufacturer 
and records of materials, including affidavits by suppliers that 
applicable requirements are met, entering into construction shall be 
made available to the recognized laboratory inspector or the Coast Guard 
inspector, or both, for review upon request. Any examinations, 
inspections and test which are required by the recognized laboratory

[[Page 127]]

for listed and labeled devices produced will be conducted by the 
laboratory inspector at the place of manufacture or other location at 
the option of the laboratory.
    (b) Lot size and sampling. (1) A lot shall consist of not more than 
1,000 buoyant cushions. A new lot shall be started with any change or 
modification in materials used or manufacturing methods employed. When a 
lot of buoyant cushions is ready for inspection, the manufacturer shall 
notify the recognized laboratory so that they may, at their discretion, 
assign an inspector to the plant for the purpose of making any tests and 
inspections deemed necessary. From each lot of buoyant cushions, the 
manufacturer or the recognized laboratory or U.S. Coast Guard inspector, 
when assigned, shall select samples in accordance with Table 160.048-
5(b)(1) to be tested for buoyancy in accordance with paragraph (e) of 
this section.

    (2) For a lot next succeeding one from which any sample cushion 
failed the buoyancy test, the sample shall consist of not less than 10 
specimen cushions to be tested for buoyancy in accordance with paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (c) Additional tests. Unannounced examinations, tests and 
inspections of samples obtained either directly from the manufacturer or 
through commercial channels may be made to determine the suitability of 
a product for listing and labeling, or to determine conformance of a 
labeled product to the applicable requirements. These may be conducted 
by the recognized laboratory or the Coast Guard.
    (d) Test facilities. The laboratory inspector, or the Coast Guard 
inspector, or both, shall be admitted to any place in the factory where 
work is being done on listed and labeled products, and either or both 
inspectors may take samples of parts or materials entering into 
construction of final assemblies, for further examinations, inspections, 
or tests. The manufacturer shall provide a suitable place and the 
apparatus necessary for the performance of the tests which are done at 
the place of manufacture.
    (e) Buoyancy--(1) Buoyancy test method. Remove the buoyant pad 
inserts from the cushion and cut three slits in the vinyl film, each not 
less than 6 inches in length on both sides of each pad. Securely attach 
the spring scale in a position directly over the test tank. Suspend the 
weighted wire basket from the scale in such a manner that the basket is 
weighed while it is completely under water. In order to measure the 
actual buoyance provided by the pads, the underwater weight of the empty 
basket should exceed the buoyancy of the pads. To obtain the buoyancy of 
the pads, proceed as follows:
    (i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.
    (ii) Place the pads inside the basket and submerge it so that the 
top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water 
for 24 hours. The tank shall be locked or sealed during this 24-hour 
submergence period. It is important that after the pads have once been 
submerged that they shall remain submerged for the duration of the test, 
and at no time during the course of the test shall they be removed from 
the tank or otherwise exposed to air.
    (iii) After the 24-hour submergence period unlock or unseal the tank 
and weigh the weighted wire basket with the pads inside while both are 
still under water.
    (iv) The buoyancy is computed as (i) minus (iii).
    (2) Buoyancy required. The buoyant pads from the cushion shall 
provide not less than 20 pounds total buoyancy.

    (a) General. Manufacturers of listed and labeled buoyant cushions 
shall maintain quality control of the materials used, manufacturing 
methods and the finished product so as to meet the applicable 
requirements, and shall make sufficient inspections and tests of 
representative samples and components produced to maintain the quality 
of the finished product. Records of tests conducted by the manufacturer 
and records of materials, including affidavits by suppliers that 
applicable requirements are met, entering into construction shall be 
made available to the recognized laboratory inspector or the Coast Guard 
inspector, or both, for review upon request. Any examinations, 
inspections and tests which are required by the recognized laboratory 
for listed and labeled devices produced will be conducted by the 
laboratory inspector at the place of manufacture or other location at 
the option of the laboratory.
    (b) Lot size and sampling. (1) A lot shall consist of not more than 
1,000 buoyant cushions. A new lot shall be started with any change or

    (c) Additional tests. Unannounced examinations, tests and 
inspections of samples obtained either directly from the manufacturer or 
through commercial channels may be made to determine the suitability of 
a product for listing and labeling, or to determine conformance of a 
labeled product to the applicable requirements. These may be conducted 
by the recognized laboratory or the U.S. Coast Guard.
    (d) Test facilities. The laboratory inspector, or the Coast Guard 
inspector, or both, shall be admitted to any place in the factory where 
work is being done on listed and labeled products, and either or both 
inspectors may take samples of parts or materials entering into 
construction of final assemblies, for further examinations, inspections, 
or tests. The manufacturer shall provide a suitable place and the 
apparatus necessary for the performance of the tests which are done at 
the place of manufacture.
    (e) Buoyancy--(1) Buoyancy test method. Securely attach the spring 
scale in a position directly over the test tank. Suspend the weighted 
wire basket from the scale in such a manner that the basket is weighed 
while it is completely under water. In order to measure the actual 
buoyancy provided by the cushion, the underwater weight of the empty 
basket should exceed the buoyancy of the cushion. To obtain the buoyancy 
of the cushion, proceed as follows:
    (i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.
    (ii) Place the cushion inside the basket and submerge it so that the 
top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water 
for 24 hours. The tank shall be locked or sealed during this 24-hour 
submergence period. It is important that after the cushion has once been 
submerged that it shall remain submerged for the duration of the test, 
and at no time during the course of the test shall it be removed from 
the tank or otherwise exposed to air.
    (iii) After the 24-hour submergence period unlock or unseal the tank 
and weigh the weighted wire basket with the cushion inside while both 
are still under water.
    (iv) The buoyancy is computed as (i) minus (iii).
    (2) Buoyancy required. Each cushion shall provide not less than 20 
pounds buoyancy.

<R05>
Sec. 160.050-4  Construction and workmanship.

    (a) General. This specification covers ring life buoys which provide 
buoyancy to aid in keeping persons afloat in the water. Each buoy 
consists of a body constructed in the shape of an annular ring, with an 
approximately elliptical body cross section and which is fitted with a 
grab line around the outside periphery. The outside and inside diameters 
of the ring and the length and width of the cross section of the body 
shall be uniform throughout.
    (b) Body. The body shall be made in either one or two pieces. If of 
two pieces, the pieces shall be equal in size and shall be adhesive 
bonded along a center line through an axis passing through the flat area 
dimension of the body. The adhesive shall be a liquid cold setting, 
polymerizable, nonsolvent, containing material of the 
phenolepichlorhydrin type or equivalent having good strength retention 
under outdoor weathering conditions.
    (c) Grab line. The finished length of the grab line shall be four 
times the outside diameter of the buoy. The ends of the grab line shall 
be securely and neatly spliced together, or shall be hand whipped with a 
needle and both ends securely and smoothly seized together. The grab 
line shall encircle the buoy and shall be held in place by the beckets. 
The spliced or seized ends of the grab line shall be placed in the 
center of the width of one of the beckets.
    (d) Beckets. Each ring buoy shall be fitted with four beckets 
located at equidistant points about the body of the buoy. The beckets 
shall be passed around the body of the buoy with the free ends to the 
outside, and shall be securely cemented to the buoy with a suitable 
waterproof adhesive which is compatible with the unicellular plastic 
used in the buoy body. The ends of the beckets shall be turned under at 
least 1 inch, one end to go around the grab line, and the other to be 
laid flat against the first end. The beckets shall then be stitched to 
the grab line with not less than five hand stitches made with two parts 
of thread or machined stitched with not less than three stitches per 
inch. Alternate methods for rigging beckets and grab line will be given 
special consideration.
    (e) Weight. The weight of the completely assembled buoy shall be not 
less than 2.5 pounds and not more than 4.25 pounds for the 20-inch size, 
not less than 3.0 pounds and not more than 5.5 pounds for the 24-inch 
size, and not less than 5.0 and not more than 7.5 pounds for the 30-inch 
size.
    (f) Workmanship. Ring life buoys shall be of first class workmanship 
and free from any defects materially affecting their appearance or 
serviceability.

Sec. 160.050-5  Sampling, tests, and inspection.

    (a) General. Production tests and inspections must be conducted in 
accordance with this section, subpart 159.007

[[Page 134]]

of this chapter, and if conducted by an independent laboratory, the 
independent laboratory's procedures for production inspections and tests 
as accepted by the Commandant. The Commandant may prescribe additional 
production tests and inspections necessary to maintain quality control 
and to monitor compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.
    (b) Oversight. In addition to responsibilities set out in part 159 
of this chapter and the accepted laboratory procedures for production 
inspections and tests, each manufacturer of a ring life buoy and each 
laboratory inspector shall comply with the following, as applicable:
    (1) Manufacturer. Each manufacturer must--
    (i) Perform all tests and examinations necessary to show compliance 
with this subpart and the subpart under which the ring life buoy is 
approved on each lot before any inspector's tests and inspection of the 
lot;
    (ii) Follow established procedures for maintaining quality control 
of the materials used, manufacturing operations, and the finished 
product; and
    (iii) Allow an inspector to take samples of completed units or of 
component materials for tests required by this subpart and for tests 
relating to the safety of the design.
    (iv) Meet 33 CFR 181.701 through 33 CFR 181.705 which requires an 
instruction pamphlet for each device that is sold or offered for sale 
for use on recreational boats, and must make the pamphlet accessible 
prior to purchase.
    (2) Laboratory. An inspector from the accepted laboratory shall 
oversee production in accordance with the laboratory's procedures for 
production inspections and tests accepted by the Commandant. During 
production oversight, the inspector shall not perform or supervise any 
production test or inspection unless--
    (i) The manufacturer has a valid approval certificate; and
    (ii) The inspector has first observed the manufacturer's production 
methods and any revisions to those methods.
    (3) At least quarterly, the inspector shall check the manufacturer's 
compliance with the company's quality control procedures, examine the 
manufacturer's required records, and observe the manufacturer perform 
each of the required production tests.
    (c) Test facilities. The manufacturer shall provide a suitable place 
and apparatus for conducting the tests and inspections necessary to 
determine compliance of ring life buoys with this subpart. The 
manufacturer shall provide means to secure any test that is not 
continuously observed, such as the 48 hour buoyancy test. The 
manufacturer must have the calibration of all test equipment checked in 
accordance with the test equipment manufacturer's recommendation and 
interval but not less than at least once every year.
    (d) Lots. A lot may not consist of more than 1000 life buoys. A lot 
number must be assigned to each group of life buoys produced. Lots must 
be numbered serially. A new lot must be started whenever any change in 
materials or a revision to a production method is made, and whenever any 
substantial discontinuity in the production process occurs. The lot 
number assigned, along with the approval number, must enable the ring 
life buoy manufacturer to determine the supplier's identifying 
information for the component lot.
    (e) Samples. (1) From each lot of ring life buoys, manufacturers 
shall randomly select a number of samples from completed units at least 
equal to the applicable number required by table 160.050-5(e) for 
buoyancy testing. Additional samples must be selected for any tests, 
examinations, and inspections required by the laboratory's production 
inspections and tests procedures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) For a lot next succeeding one from which any sample ring life 
buoy failed the buoyancy or strength test, the sample shall consist of 
not less than ten specimen ring life buoys to be

[[Page 135]]

tested for buoyancy in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Tests--(1) Strength test. The buoy body shall be suspended by a 
2-inch-wide strap. A similar strap shall be passed around the opposite 
side of the buoy and a 200-pound weight suspended by it from the buoy. 
After 30 minutes, the buoy body shall be examined, and there shall be no 
breaks, cracks or permanent deformation.
    (2) Resistance to damage test. The buoy body shall be dropped three 
times from a height of 6 feet onto concrete, and there shall be no 
breaks or cracks in the body.
    (3) Buoyancy test. To obtain the buoyancy of the buoy, proceed as 
follows:
    (i) Weigh iron or other weight under water. The weight shall be more 
than sufficient to submerge the buoy.
    (ii) Attach the iron or other weight to the buoy and submerge with 
the top of the buoy at least 2 inches below the surface for 48 hours.
    (iii) After the 48-hour submergence period, weigh the buoy with the 
weight attached while both are still under water.
    (iv) The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (f)(3)(i) minus paragraph 
(f)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (4) Buoyancy required. The buoys shall provide a buoyancy of not 
less than 16.5 pounds for the 20-and 24-inch sizes, and not less than 32 
pounds for the 30-inch size.
    (g) Lot inspection. On each lot, the laboratory inspector shall 
perform a final lot inspection to be satisfied that the ring life buoys 
meet this subpart. Each lot must demonstrate--
    (1) First quality workmanship;
    (2) That the general arrangement and attachment of all components 
are as specified in the approved plans and specifications; and
    (3) Compliance with the marking requirements in the applicable 
approval subpart.
    (h) Lot acceptance. When the independent laboratory has determined 
that the ring life buoys in the lot are of a type officially approved in 
the name of the company, and that such ring life buoys meet the 
requirements of this subpart, they shall be plainly marked in waterproof 
ink with the independent laboratory's name or identifying mark.
    (i) Lot rejection. Each nonconforming unit must be rejected. If 
three or more nonconforming units are rejected for the same kind of 
defect, lot inspection must be discontinued and the lot rejected. The 
inspector must discontinue lot inspection and reject the lot if 
examination of individual units or the records for the lot shows 
noncompliance with either this subchapter or the laboratory's or the 
manufacturer's quality control procedures. A rejected unit or lot may be 
resubmitted for testing and inspection if the manufacturer first removes 
and destroys each defective unit or, if authorized by the laboratory, 
reworks the unit or lot to correct the defect. A rejected lot or 
rejected unit may not be sold or offered for sale under the 
representation that it meets this subpart or that it is Coast Guard-
approved.

    (5) The manufacturer shall test--
    (i) At least one vest from each lot for buoyancy in accordance with 
procedures contained in paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (ii) At least one vest in each 10 lots for strength of the body 
strap assembly in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph 
(f) of this section.
    (6) If a vest fails the buoyancy test, the sample from the next 
succeeding lot must consist of 10 specimen vests or more to be tested 
for buoyancy in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (7) The manufacturer shall keep on file and make available to the 
laboratory inspector and Coast Guard inspector the records of 
inspections and tests, together with affidavits concerning the material.
    (c) Additional compliance tests. An inspector from the recognized 
laboratory or Coast Guard may conduct an examination, test and 
inspection of a buoyant device that is obtained from the manufacturer or 
through commercial channels to determine the suitability of the device 
for listing and labeling or to determine its conformance to applicable 
requirements.
    (d) Test facilities. The manufacturer shall admit the laboratory 
inspector and the Coast Guard inspector to any part of the premises at 
the place of

[[Page 142]]

manufacture of a listed and labeled device to--
    (1) Examine, inspect, or test a sample of a part or a material that 
is included in the construction of the device; and
    (2) Conduct any necessary examination, inspection, or test in a 
suitable place and with appropriate apparatus provided by the 
manufacturer.
    (e) Buoyancy--(1) Buoyancy test method. Remove the buoyant inserts 
from the vests. Securely attach the spring scale in a position directly 
over the test tank. Suspend the weighted wire basket from the scale in 
such a manner that the basket can be weighed while it is completely 
under water. In order to measure the actual buoyancy provided by the 
inserts, the underwater weight of the empty basket should exceed the 
buoyancy of the inserts. To obtan the buoyancy of the inserts, proceed 
as follows:
    (i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.
    (ii) Place the inserts inside the basket and submerge it so that the 
top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. 
Allow the inserts to remain submerged for 24 hours. The tank shall be 
locked or sealed during this 24-hour submergence period. It is important 
that after the inserts have once been submerged they shall remain 
submerged for the duration of the test, and at no time during the course 
of the test shall they be removed from the tank or otherwise exposed to 
air.
    (iii) After the 24-hour submergence period, unlock or unseal the 
tank and weigh the wire basket with the inserts inside while both are 
still under water.
    (iv) The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section 
minus paragraph (e)(i)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Buoyancy required. The buoyant inserts from adult size buoyant 
vests shall provide not less than 15\1/2\ pounds buoyancy in fresh 
water; the inserts from child medium size vests shall provide not less 
than 11 pounds buoyancy; and the inserts from child small size vests 
shall provide not less than 7 pounds buoyancy.
    (f) Body strap test. The complete body strap assembly including 
hardware, shall be tested for strength by attaching the dee ring to a 
suitable support such that the assembly hangs vertically its full 
length. A weight as specified in Sec. 160.052-3(d) shall be attached to 
the other end of the snap hook for 10 minutes. The specified weight 
shall not break or excessively distort the body strap assembly.
    (g) Additional approval tests for nonstandard vests. Tests in 
addition to those required by this section may be conducted by the 
inspector for nonstandard vests to determine performance equivalence to 
a standard vest. Such additional tests may include determining 
performance in water, suitability of materials, donning time, ease of 
adjustment, and similar equivalency tests. Costs of any additional tests 
must be assumed by the manufacturer.

render the rescue boat unserviceable shall result from this drop.
    (b) Stability and freeboard test. The rescue boat shall have 
sufficient stability and freeboard so that the gunwale on the low side 
shall not be submerged with 350 pounds placed nine inches from the side 
in way of and about the level of the middle thwart.

[[Page 153]]

    (c) Rescue boarding test. With one man in the rowing position, a 
second kneeling on the stern thwart facing aft, and a third man balanced 
on the transom, the minimum freeboard of the transom shall be five 
inches. The men should average 165 pounds each. This test simulates the 
rescue of a person over the transom by a two-man boat crew.
    (d) Rowing test. Three men, averaging 165 pounds each, shall be 
seated on the centerline of the boat, one on each thwart. One man, in 
the rowing position, using ordinary rowing technique, shall demonstrate 
the satisfactory course keeping and maneuvering characteristics of the 
boat in the ahead and astern directions.

Sec. 160.057-2  Type.

    (a) Floating orange. smoke distress signals specified by this 
subpart shall be of one type which shall consist essentially of an outer 
container, ballast, an air chamber, an inner container, the smoke 
producing composition, and an igniter mechanism. Alternate arrangements 
which conform to the performance requirements of this specification will 
be given special consideration.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 160.057-3  Materials, workmanship, construction, and performance requirements.

    (a) Materials. The materials shall conform strictly to the 
specifications and drawings submitted by the manufacturer and approved 
by the Commandant. Metal for containers shall be not less than 0.5 mm 
(0.020 in.) in thickness. Other dimensions or materials may be 
considered upon special request when presented with supporting data. 
Igniter systems shall be of corrosion-resistant metal. The combustible 
material shall be of such nature that it will not deteriorate during 
long storage, nor when subjected to frigid or tropical climates, or 
both.
    (b) Workmanship. Floating orange smoke distress signals shall be of 
first class workmanship and shall be free from imperfections of 
manufacture affecting their appearance or that may affect their 
serviceability.
    (c) Construction. The outer container shall be cylindrical and of a 
size suitable for intended use. All sheet metal seams should be hook 
jointed and soldered. The whole container shall be covered with two 
coats of waterproof paint or other equivalent protection system. The 
igniter mechanism shall operate and provide ignition of the signal 
automatically when the ring life buoy to which it is attached is thrown 
overboard.
    (d) Performance. Signals shall meet all the inspection and test 
requirements contained in Sec. 160.057-4.


<R05>
Sec. 160.057-4  Approval and production tests.

    (a) Approval tests. The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 
20 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval 
under Sec. 160.057-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and 
technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval 
tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the 
Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this chapter.
    (b) Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and 
tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the 
procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot 
must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by 
the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the 
rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by 
the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot 
must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the 
reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and 
the results of the second test.
    (1) Lot size. For the purposes of sampling the production of 
signals, a lot must consist of not more than 1,200 signals. Lots must be 
numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with: 
(i) Any change in construction details, (ii) any change in sources of 
raw materials, or (iii) the start of production on a new production line 
or on a previously discontinued production line.
    (2) Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's 
quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering 
into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, 
to determine that signals are being produced in

[[Page 155]]

accordance with the approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested 
in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (3) Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An 
independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of 
this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the 
number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and 
tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no 
lots are produced during that period. If less than four lots are 
produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and 
testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or 
supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least 
once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of 
technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If 
a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the 
laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the 
reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each 
reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the 
purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections 
and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.
    (c) Operational tests. Each lot of signals must be sampled and 
tested as follows:
    (1) Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria. A sample of 
signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample 
must be the individual sample size in Table 160.057-4(c)(1) 
corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as 
prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table 
160.057-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance 
with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having 
the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal If the sum of all 
the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of 
units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the 
lot is accepted. If this sum is equal to or more than the reject 
criterion the lot is rejected.

If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject 
criteria, another sample is selected from the production lot and the 
operational tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each 
sample tested is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the 
cumulative failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample 
size). Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either 
the accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If 
any signal in the sample explodes when fired, or ignites in a way that 
could burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected 
without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 
160.057-4(c)).
    (2) Test procedure. Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as 
follows:
    (i) Conditioning of test specimens--water resistance. Immerse 
specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 
25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours.
    (ii) Smoke emitting time. Ignite specimen according to the 
directions printed on the signal and place signal in tub or barrel of 
water. The smoke emitting time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop 
watch measurements from the time of distinct, sustained smoke emission 
until it ceases. There shall be no flame emission during the entire 
smoke emitting time of the signal. The smoke emitting time for a 
specimen shall not be less than 15 minutes. When the tests are performed 
or supervised by an independent laboratory, this test shall be conducted 
with approximately 6 mm (\1/4\ in.) of gasoline covering the water in 
the tub or barrel. The gasoline vapors shall not ignite during the 
entire smoke emitting time of the signal.
    (iii) Ignition and smoke emitting characteristics. Test specimens 
shall ignite and emit smoke properly when the directions on the signal 
are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner 
that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. Test specimens 
shall emit smoke at a uniform rate while floating in calm to

[[Page 156]]

rough water. Signals should be so constructed that water submerging the 
signal in moderately heavy seas will not cause it to become inoperable.

    (d) Technical tests. One signal must be subjected to each of the 
following tests. Each signal must pass the test in order for the lot of 
signals to be accepted.
    (1) Drop test. One signal must be attached to a ring life buoy and 
arranged

[[Page 158]]

to be ignited by the dropping buoy in the same manner as it would be 
when used on a vessel. The signal and buoy must be mounted at least 27 m 
(90 ft.) above the surface of a body of water. The buoy is released and 
must cause the signal to ignite and fall to the water with the buoy. The 
signal must remain afloat and emit smoke at least 15 minutes.
    (2) Wave test. A signal shall be tested in a manner simulating its 
use at sea. The signal shall be ignited and thrown overboard under 
conditions where waves are at least 30 cm (1 ft.) high. The smoke 
emitting time must be for the full 15 minutes and the signal shall float 
in such a manner that it shall function properly during this test. The 
signal shall be attached to a ring life buoy in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions.
    (3) Underwater smoke emission. Condition the signal in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Ignite specimen and let it 
burn about 15 seconds in air. Submerge the burning signal in water in a 
vertical position with head down. Obtain underwater smoke emission time 
by stop watch measurements from time of submersion until smoke emission 
ceases. The test specimen shall emit smoke under water not less than 30 
seconds when subjected to this test.
    (4) Elevated Temperature, Humidity and Storage. Place specimen in a 
thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. 
with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove 
specimen and store at room temperature (20 deg. to 25  deg.C.) with 
approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any 
reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-
hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity 
for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. 
(Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or 
decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall ignite and operate 
satisfactorily following this conditioning.
    (5) Spontaneous ignition. Place the specimen in a thermostatically 
controlled even-temperature oven held at 75  deg.C. with not more than 
10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal must not 
ignite or undergo marked decomposition.
    (6) Susceptibility to explosion. Remove smoke composition from 
signal and punch a small hole in the composition. Insert a No. 6 
commercial blasting cap. Ignite the cap. The test specimen shall not 
explode or ignite.
    (7) Corrosion resistance. Expose the complete specimen with cover 
secured hand-tight to a finely divided spray of 20 percent by weight 
sodium chloride solution at a temperature between 32  deg.C and 38 
deg.C (90  deg.F and 100  deg.F) for 100 hours. The container and cap 
must not be corroded in any fashion that would impair their proper 
functioning.
    (8) Color of smoke. Ignite specimen in the open air in daytime 
according to the directions printed on the signal, and determine the 
smoke color by direct visual comparison of the unshadowed portions of 
the smoke with a color chart held so as to receive the same daylight 
illumination as the unshadowed portions of the smoke. The color of the 
smoke must be orange as defined by sections 13 and 14 of the ``Color 
Names Dictionary'' (colors 34-39 and 48-54).
    (9) Volume and density of smoke. The test specimen shall show less 
than 70 percent transmission for not less than 12 minutes when measured 
with apparatus having a light path of 19 cm (7\1/2\ in.), an optical 
system aperture of +3.7 degrees, and an entrance air flow of 18.4m 
<SUP>3</SUP> per minute (650 cu. ft. per minute), such apparatus to be 
as described in National Bureau of Standards Report No. 4792.


<R05>
Sec. 160.057-5  Marking.

    (a) Directions for use. Each floating orange smoke distress signal 
shall be plainly and indelibly marked in black lettering not less than 3 
mm (\1/8\ in.) high ``Approved for daytime use only'', and in black 
lettering not less than 5 mm (\3/16\ in.) high with the word 
``Directions''. Immediately below shall be similarly marked in black 
lettering not less than 3 mm (\1/8\ in.) high in numbered paragraphs, 
and in simple and easily understood wording, instructions to be followed 
to make the device operative. Pasted-on labels are not acceptable.

[[Page 159]]

    (b) Other markings. (1) There shall be embossed or die-stamped, in 
the outer container in figures not less than 5 mm (\3/16\ in.) high, 
numbers, indicating the month and year of manufacture, thus: ``6-54'' 
indicating June 1954. The outer container shall also be plainly and

    (5) If a sample vest fails the buoyancy test, the sample from the 
next succeeding lot must consist of 10 specimen vests or more to be 
tested for buoyancy in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) Additional compliance tests. An inspector from the recognized 
laboratory or Coast Guard may conduct an examination, test and 
inspection of a buoyant device that is obtained from the manufacturer or 
through commercial channels to determine the suitability of the device 
for listing and labeling, or to determine its conformance to applicable 
requirements.
    (d) Test facilities. The manufacturer shall admit the laboratory 
inspector and the Coast Guard inspector to any part of the premises at 
the place of manufacture of a listed and labeled device to--
    (1) Examine, inspect, or test a sample of a part or a material that 
is included in the construction of the device; and
    (2) Conduct any examination, inspection, or test in a suitable place 
and with appropriate apparatus provided by the manufacturer.
    (e) Buoyancy--(1) Buoyancy test method. Remove the buoyant inserts 
from the vests. Securely attach the spring scale in a position directly 
over the test tank. Suspend the weighted wire basket from the scale in 
such a manner that the basket can be weighed while it is completely 
under water. In order to measure the actual buoyancy provided by the 
inserts, the underwater weight of the empty basket should exceed the 
buoyancy of the inserts. To obtain the buoyancy of the inserts, proceed 
as follows:
    (i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.
    (ii) Place the inserts inside the basket and submerge it so that the 
top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. 
Allow the inserts to remain submerged for 24 hours. The tank shall be 
locked or sealed during this 24-hour submergence period. It is important 
that after the inserts have once been submerged they shall remain 
submerged for the duration of the test, and at no time during the course 
of the test shall they be removed from the tank or otherwise exposed to 
air.
    (iii) After the 24-hour submergence period, unlock or unseal the 
tank and weigh the wire basket with the inserts inside while both are 
still under water.
    (iv) The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section 
minus paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Buoyancy required. The buoyant inserts from adult size buoyant 
vests shall provide not less than 15\1/2\ pounds of buoyancy in fresh 
water; the inserts from the child medium size buoyant vests shall 
provide not less than 11 pounds buoyancy; and the inserts from the child 
small size buoyant vests shall provide not less than 7 pounds buoyancy.

[[Page 164]]

    (f) Body strap test. The complete body strap assembly, including 
hardware shall be tested for strength by attaching the dee ring to a 
suitable support such that the assembly hangs vertically its full 
length. A weight as specified in Sec. 160.060-3(d) shall be attached to 
the other end on the snap hook for 10 minutes. The specified weight 
shall not break or excessively distort the body strap assembly.
    (g) Additional approval tests for nonstandard vests. Tests in 
addition to those required by this section may be conducted by the 
inspector for a nonstandard vest to determine performance equivalence to 
a standard vest. Such additional tests may include determining 
performance in water, suitability of materials, donning time, ease of 
adjustment, and similar equivalency tests. Costs for any additional 
tests must be assumed by the manufacturer.

<R05>
Sec. 160.062-3  Materials, construction, workmanship, and performance requirements.

    (a) General. The materials, construction, workmanship, and 
performance requirements shall conform to the requirements of the 
specifications listed in Sec. 160.062-1(a)(1) except as otherwise 
provided by this subpart. In addition, all metals and materials used in 
a hydraulic release must be compatible with each other so that the final 
assembly under conditions of use is not subject to such deleterious 
effects as galvanic corrosion, freezing, or buckling of moving parts, or 
loosening and tightening of joints due to differences in coefficients of 
thermal expansion. Galvanizing or other forms of metallic coating on the 
parts of a hydraulic release are not acceptable. The criteria for 
accepting any combination of materials shall be determined by testing or 
by the data stated in Sec. 160.062-1(b).
    (b) Buoyant load capacity. A hydraulic release working in 
conjunction with its spring-tensioned gripe must demonstrate that it can 
release buoyant loads between the limits of 200 pounds and 3,750 pounds 
and within the range of depths specified by paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Release depth. A hydraulic release shall automatically release 
the buoyant loads described in paragraph (b) of this section at depths 
between 5 feet to 15 feet prior to being tested for either the 
temperature or the corrosion resistance tests of 160.062-4(c)(2). After 
exposure to these temperature and corrosion tests, a hydraulic release 
shall release the buoyant loads of paragraph (b) of this section between 
the depths of 5 feet to 25 feet.


<R05>
Sec. 160.062-4  Inspections and tests.

    (a) General. Marine inspectors shall be assigned to make factory 
inspections of hydraulic releases, as described in paragraph (d) of this 
section for sampling and testing. In addition, the Commander of the 
Coast Guard District may detail a marine inspector at any time to visit 
any place where approved hydraulic releases are manufactured or 
reconditioned to observe production methods and to conduct any 
inspections or tests which may be deemed advisable. The marine inspector 
shall be admitted to any place in the factory or place where work is 
done on hydraulic releases or their components. In addition, the marine 
inspector may take samples of assembled hydraulic releases or parts or 
materials used in their construction for further examination, 
inspection, or tests. The manufacturer shall provide a suitable place 
and the apparatus necessary for the performance of the tests which are 
conducted at the place of manufacture by the marine inspector.
    (b) Classification of tests. The sampling, inspections, and tests 
conducted upon hydraulic releases shall fall within one of the following 
general classifications, as described hereafter:
    (1) Preapproval tests.
    (2) Factory inspections and tests.
    (3) Spot check tests.
    (4) Periodic servicing tests.
    (c) Preapproval testing. The ``Visual and dimensional examination'' 
referred to in Table 160.062-4(c) shall be conducted by a marine 
inspector at the factory. The ``Physical and operational tests'' of that 
table shall be conducted at a laboratory accepted by the Commandant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ These tests are called ``Lot acceptance tests,'' in Military
  Specification MIL-R-15041C.

    (1) Visual and dimensional examination. The marine inspector shall 
examine the 4 hydraulic release samples of the preapproval sample for 
their visual and dimensional characteristics. If all 4 of the devices 
are in agreement with the manufacturer's plans previously reviewed by 
the Commandant, the 4 devices will be accepted and are to be assembled 
for further testing under the

[[Page 170]]

``Physical and operational tests'' of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Physical and operational tests. Each hydraulic release selected 
under Table 160.062-4(c) for the ``Physical and operational tests'' 
shall undergo each of the tests described in this paragraph without 
renewal of parts or repairs between the tests. The tests shall be 
conducted in the following sequence:
    (i) Submergence test. A hydraulic release shall be tested by 
applying buoyant loads of its designed capacity to its spring-tensioned 
gripe as required under Sec. 160.062-3(b) while the device is submerged 
in water or in a water-filled pressure testing tank. A hydraulic release 
shall show by its submergence test that it meets the buoyant capacity 
and release depth requirements of Sec. 160.062-3 (b) and (c) by 
automatically tripping and releasing its load.
    (ii) Temperature test. After its submergence test, a hydraulic 
release sample shall be placed in a cold box at minus 30 degrees F. for 
4 hours. Upon completion of this conditioning, the sample device shall 
be opened for inspection and shall show no significant change in the 
position of the hydraulic or manual control as a result of the low 
temperature exposure.

    (3) Lot acceptance at a factory. The submergence test of paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) shall be performed on each of the remaining hydraulic releases 
in a production lot after the selection of the lot samples required by 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Such individual submergence tests may 
be performed at the factory in a pressure tank apparatus which simulates 
the hydrostatic pressure and the various tension loads on the hydraulic 
release. Those hydraulic releases which do not pass this submergence 
test shall be removed from the production lot as unacceptable, but may 
be reworked and included in a subsequent lot. After the completion of 
these individual submergence tests and after receipt of the laboratory's 
test report showing that the tests on the lot samples were 
satisfactorily met, the Commander of the Coast Guard District in which 
the factory is located shall have the manufacturer notified that this 
production lot of hydraulic releases meets the requirements of this 
specification subpart. After being marked as required by Sec. 160.062-5, 
the manufacturer may sell such hydraulic releases as approved equipment.
    (i) Hydraulic releases which have been rejected may not, unless 
subsequently accepted, be sold or offered for sale under representation 
as being in compliance with this specification or as being approved for 
use on vessels subject to inspection under this chapter.

Sec. 160.066-12  Operational tests.

    (a) The procedure for conducting operational tests is described in 
figure (1).
    (1) An ``accept lot'' decision must be reached in order to pass the 
operational tests.
    (2) If a ``reject lot'' decision is reached, the entire lot is 
rejected.
    (3) Signals from ``reject lots'' may be reworked by the manufacturer 
to correct the deficiency for which they were rejected and be 
resubmitted for inspection. Records shall be kept of the reasons for 
rejection, the reworking performed on the ``reject lot'', and the result 
of the second test. Signals from ``reject lots'' may not, unless 
subsequently accepted, be sold or offered for sale as being in 
compliance with this specification.
    (b) Each signal selected for the operational tests must be 
conditioned by:
    (1) Being submerged under at least 25 mm (1 in.) of water for 24 
hours without any protection other than its waterproofing; or
    (2) If waterproofing is provided by a sealed plastic bag or other 
waterproof packaging, submersion under 25 mm (1 in.) of water for 24 
hours in the packaging, followed immediately by submersion under 25 mm 
(1 in.) of water for 10 minutes with the signal removed from the 
packaging.
    (c) After each signal selected has undergone the conditioning 
required by paragraph (b) of this section it must be fired as described 
by the manufacturer's operating instructions. The following data as 
observed must be recorded for each signal:
    (1) Burning time of the pyrotechnic candle;
    (2) Color;
    (3) Whether the pyrotechnic candle burns out above, at, or below the 
level of launch.
    (d) A signal fails the operational tests if:
    (1) It fails to fire,
    (2) The pyrotechnic candle fails to ignite,
    (3) The pyrotechnic candle continues to burn after it falls back to 
the level of launch,
    (4) The observed color is other than vivid red, or
    (5) The burning time is less than 5.5 seconds.
    (e) A lot is rejected if a ``reject lot'' decision is reached using 
Figure (1) and Table 1 after completion of the operational tests.

conditioning for the technical tests must be conducted with the signal 
in the sealed packaging;
    (3) If signals in the test sample fail to pass one of the technical 
tests, the entire lot is rejected;
    (4) Signals from ``reject lots'' may be reworked by the manufacturer 
to correct the deficiency for which they were rejected and be 
resubmitted for inspection. Records shall be kept of the reasons for 
rejection, the reworking performed on the ``reject lot'', and the result 
of the second test. Signals from ``reject lots'' may not, unless 
subsequently accepted, be sold or offered for sale as being in 
compliance with this specification.
    (b) The Elevated Temperature, Humidity, and Storage Test must be 
conducted in the following manner:
    (1) Select three signals from the nine;
    (2) Place each signal in a thermostatically controlled even-
temperature oven held at 55 Degrees C (131 Degrees F), and at not less 
than 90% relative humidity, for at least 72 hours (If for any reason it 
is not possbie to operate the oven continuously for the 72 hour period, 
it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity for 8 hours 
of each 24 during the 72 hour conditioning period.);
    (3) After removal from the oven immediately place each signal in a 
chamber:
    (i) At a temperature of at least 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) but not 
more than 25 degrees C (77 degrees F);
    (ii) At not less than 65% relative humidity;
    (iii) For ten days;
    (4) Then remove each signal from any sealed packaging and fire it.
    (5) The test sample fails the test if:
    (i) Any signal ignites or decomposes before firing;
    (ii) Any signal when fired malfunctions in a manner that would cause 
burns or injury to an unprotected person firing the signal, or;
    (iii) Two or more of the signals fail to project and ignite the 
pyrotechnic candle.
    (c) The Spontaneous Combustion Test must be performed in the 
following manner:
    (1) Select three signals from the remaining six signals and place 
them in a thermostatically controlled even temperature over for 48 hours 
at a temperature of 75 degrees C (167 degrees F).
    (2) The test sample fails the test if any signal ignites or 
decomposes during the test.
    (d) The Luminous Intensity and Chromaticity Test must be performed 
in the following manner:
    (1) Remove the pyrotechnic candle from the remaining three signals.

[[Page 181]]

    (2) Ignite, measure, and record the intensity of the burning candle 
with a visual photometer or equivalent photometric device or automatic 
recorder:
    (i) While the specimen is supported in a horizontal position and the 
photometer is at right angles to the axis of the specimen,
    (ii) At a distance of at least 3 m (10 ft.).
    (3) Calculate the intensity of the candle as in Sec. 160.066-7(c).
    (4) Measure and record the chromaticity of the burning candle as 
specified in Sec. 160.021-4(d)(4).
    (5) The test sample fails the test if more than one signal has a 
luminous intensity of less than 10,000 candela, or more than one signal 
is not ``vivid red''.

    (b) The operational tests in Sec. 160.066-12 must be performed for 
every lot of signals produced.
    (c) The technical tests in Sec. 160.066-13 must be performed at 
least once every twelve months,or at least once every 10 lots, whichever 
occurs first.
    (d) If a lot is rejected on the basis of the technical tests, then 
each subsequent lot produced must be tested according to the technical 
tests until samples from a lot pass these tests.
    (e) An independent laboratory acceptable to the Commandant must 
perform or directly supervise:
    (1) Each technical test, and
    (2) All operational tests for at least four lots in a 12 month 
period, unless fewer than four lots are produced in a 12 month period. 
If less than four lots are produced in a 12 month period, each 
operational test must be performed or directly supervised by the 
independent laboratory.
    (f) If a lot selected by the independent laboratory for an 
operational test is rejected, then the operational tests for the next 
lot produced, and the rejected lot, if reworked, must be performed or 
directly supervised by the independent laboratory. The tests required by 
this paragraph must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (e).
    (g) The independent laboratory selects the lots upon which technical 
tests are performed.
    (h) If the manufacturer produces more than four lots within a 12 
month period, the independent laboratory selects the lots for which it 
performs or directly supervises the operational tests.
    (i) The operational test performed or directly supervised by the 
independent laboratory must occur at least once during each quarterly 
period, unless no lots are produced during that period.
    (j) The independent laboratory, when it performs or directly 
supervises the technical tests required by paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section, must inspect the signals selected for testing and compare them 
with the approved plans. Each signal inspected must conform to the 
plans.

Sec. 160.076-29  Production oversight.

    (a) Production tests and inspections must be conducted in accordance 
with this section and subpart 159.007 of this chapter unless the 
Commandant authorizes alternative tests and inspections. The Commandant 
may prescribe additional production tests and inspections necessary to 
maintain quality control and to monitor compliance with the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (b) Production oversight must be performed by the same laboratory 
that performs the approval tests unless the Commandant determines that 
the employees of an alternative laboratory have received training and 
have access to the same information as the inspectors of the laboratory 
that conducted the approval testing.
    (c) In addition to responsibilities set out in part 159 of this 
chapter and the accepted Laboratory Follow-up Procedures, each 
manufacturer of an inflatable PFD and each recognized laboratory 
inspector shall comply with the following, as applicable:
    (1) Manufacturer. Each manufacturer must--
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, perform 
all required tests and examinations on each PFD lot before any required 
inspector's tests and inspection of the lot;
    (ii) Follow established procedures for maintaining quality control 
of the materials used, manufacturing operations, and the finished 
product;
    (iii) Implement a continuing program of employee training and a 
program for maintaining production and test equipment;
    (iv) Admit the inspector to any place in the factory where work is 
done on PFDs or component materials, and where parts or completed PFDs 
are stored;
    (v) Have an inspector observe the production methods used in 
producing the first PFD lot and observe any revisions in production 
methods made thereafter; and
    (vi) Allow the inspector to take samples of completed PFDs or of 
component materials for tests required by this subpart and for tests 
relating to the safety of the design.
    (2) Recognized laboratory oversight. An inspector from a recognized 
laboratory shall oversee production in accordance with the MOU. During 
production oversight, the inspector shall not perform or supervise any 
production test or inspection unless--
    (i) The manufacturer has a valid approval certificate; and
    (ii) The inspector has first observed the manufacturer's production 
methods and any revisions to those methods.
    (3) The inspector must perform or supervise testing and inspection 
of at least one in each five lots of PFDs produced.
    (4) During each inspection, the inspector must check for compliance 
with the manufacturer's quality control procedures.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, at least 
once each calendar quarter, the inspector must examine the 
manufacturer's records required by Sec. 160.076-33 and observe the 
manufacturer perform each of the tests required by Sec. 160.076-31(c).
    (6) If less than six lots are produced during a calendar year, only 
one lot inspection and one records' examination and test performance 
observation are required during that year. Each lot tested and inspected 
under paragraph (c)(3) of this section must be within seven lots of the 
previous lot inspected.
    (d) PFD lots. A lot number must be assigned in accordance with UL 
1180 to each group of PFDs produced. Lots must be numbered serially. A 
new lot must be started whenever any change

[[Page 189]]

in materials or a revision to a production method is made, and whenever 
any substantial discontinuity in the production process occurs. Changes 
in lots of component materials must be treated as changes in materials. 
The lot number assigned, along with the approval number, must enable the 
PFD manufacturer, by referring to the records required by this subpart, 
to determine the supplier of the components used in the PFD and the 
component supplier's identifying information for the component lot.
    (e) Samples. For the tests, examinations, and inspections required 
by Sec. 160.076-31, inspectors and manufacturers shall select samples as 
provided in this paragraph.
    (1) Samples shall be selected at random from a lot in which all PFDs 
or materials in the lot are available for selection. Except as provided 
in Sec. 160.076-31(c), samples must be selected from completed PFDs.
    (2) Different samples must be selected for the manufacturer's and 
inspector's tests, except, if the total production for any five 
consecutive lots does not exceed 250 PFDs, the manufacturer's and 
inspector's tests may be run on the same sample(s) at the same time.
    (3) The number of samples selected per lot must be at least equal to 
the applicable number required by Table 160.076-29A for manufacturers or 
Table 160.076-29B for inspectors.
    (4) The following additional requirements apply as indicated in 
Table 160.076-29A to individual sample selections by manufacturers:

tests required under paragraphs 160.076-25(d)(2)(i) through 160.076-
25(d)(2)(iv) prescribe the number of samples to select.
    (ii) Samples selected for the indicated tests may not be used for 
more than one test.
    (iii) If a sample fails the over-pressure test, the number of 
samples to be tested in the next lot produced must be at least two 
percent of the total number of PFDs in the lot or 10 PFDs, whichever is 
greater.
    (iv) The indicated test must be conducted at least once each 
calendar quarter or whenever a new lot of material is used or a 
production process is revised.
    (5) The following additional requirements apply as indicated in 
Table 160.076-29B to individual sample selections by inspectors:
    (i) Samples selected for the indicated tests may not be used for 
more than one test.
    (ii) The indicated test may be omitted if it was conducted by the 
manufacturer on the materials used and by the inspector on a previous 
lot within the past 12 months.
    (iii) One sample of each means of marking on each type of fabric or 
finish used in PFD construction must be tested at least every six months 
or whenever a new lot of materials is used.

    (1) The manufacturer must conduct the tests in paragraphs (c)(2) 
through (c)(8) of this section;

    (2) The recognized laboratory inspector must conduct or supervise 
the tests in paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(8) of this section; and

    (3) In addition to meeting the requirements of this section, each 
test result must meet the requirements, if any, contained in the 
approved plans and specifications.

    (c) When conducting the tests specified by this paragraph, the 
following conditions must be met:
    (1) Inflation chamber materials. The average and individual results 
of testing

[[Page 191]]

the minimum number of samples prescribed by Sec. 160.076-25(d)(2) must 
comply with the requirements in Sec. 160.076-21 (b) and (c) for 
permeability, grab strength, and tear strength. Lots not meeting this 
requirement must be rejected and, unless authorized by the Commandant, 
may not be subdivided and retested.
    (2) Seam strength. The seams in each inflation chamber of each 
sample must be tested in accordance with Sec. 160.076-25(d)(2)(iv). The 
results for each inflation chamber must be at least 90% of the results 
obtained in approval testing.
    (3) Over-pressure. Each sample must be tested in accordance with and 
meet UL 1180 section 7.15. Prior to initiating the test at the specified 
values, samples may be prestressed by inflating them to a greater 
pressure than the required test pressure.
    (4) Air retention. Each sample must be tested in accordance with and 
meet UL 1180 section 7.16. Prior to initiating the test at the specified 
values, test samples may be prestressed by inflating to a pressure 
greater than the design pressure, but not exceeding 50 percent of the 
required pressure for the tests in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. No 
alternate test method may be used that decreases the length of the test 
unless authorized by the Commandant. Such alternative test must require 
a proportionately lower allowable pressure loss and the same percentage 
sensitivity and accuracy as the standard allowable loss measured with 
the standard instrumentation.
    (5) Buoyancy and inflation medium retention. Each sample must be 
tested in accordance with and meet UL 1180 section 7.2.2-7.2.10, except 
7.2.5. Each buoyancy value must fall within the tolerances specified in 
the approved plans and specifications.

tested in accordance with and meet UL 1180 section 7.4.1 and .2.
    (7) Detailed product examination. Each sample PFD must be 
disassembled to the extent necessary to determine compliance with the 
following:
    (i) All dimensions and seam allowances must be within tolerances 
prescribed in the approved plans and specifications.
    (ii) The torque of each screw type mechanical fastener must be 
within its tolerance as prescribed in the approved plans and 
specifications.
    (iii) The arrangement, markings, and workmanship must be as 
specified in the approved plans and specifications and this subpart.
    (iv) The PFD must not contain any apparent defects.
    (8) Waterproof Marking Test. Each sample must be completely 
submerged in fresh water for at least 30 minutes. The sample must then 
be removed, immediately placed on a hard surface, and the markings 
vigorously rubbed with the fingers for 15 seconds. If the printing 
becomes illegible, the sample must be rejected.
    (d) Final lot examination and inspection--(1) General. On each PFD 
lot that passes production testing, the manufacturer shall perform a 
final lot examination and, on every fifth lot, a laboratory inspector 
shall perform a final lot inspection. Samples must be selected in 
accordance with paragraph Sec. 160.076-29(e). Each final lot must 
demonstrate--
    (i) First quality workmanship;
    (ii) That the general arrangement and attachment of all components, 
such as body straps, closures, inflation mechanisms, tie tapes, and 
drawstrings, are as specified in the approved plans and specifications;
    (iii) Compliance with the marking requirements in Sec. 160.076-39; 
and
    (iv) That the information pamphlet and owner's manual required by 
Sec. 160.076-35 and 160.076-37, respectively, are securely attached to 
the device, with the pamphlet selection information visible and 
accessible prior to purchase.
    (2) Accept/reject criteria. Each nonconforming PFD must be rejected. 
If three or more nonconforming PFDs are rejected for the same kind of 
defect, lot examination or inspection must be discontinued and the lot 
rejected.
    (3) Manufacturer examination. This examination must be conducted by 
a manufacturer's representative who is familiar with the approved plans 
and specifications, the functioning of the

[[Page 192]]

PFD and its components, and the production testing procedures. This 
person must not be responsible for meeting production schedules or be 
supervised by someone who is. This person must prepare and sign the 
record required by 159.007-13(a) of this chapter and 160.076-33(b).
    (4) Independent laboratory inspection. (i) The inspector must 
discontinue lot inspection and reject the lot if examination of 
individual PFDs or the records for the lot shows noncompliance with 
either this section or the laboratory's or the manufacturer's quality 
control procedures.
    (ii) If the inspector rejects a lot, the inspector must advise the 
Commandant or the recognized laboratory within 15 days.
    (iii) The inspector must prepare and sign the inspection record 
required by 159.007-13(a) of this chapter and 160.076-33(b). If the lot 
passes, the record must include the inspector's certification that the 
lot passed inspection and that no evidence of noncompliance with this 
section was observed.
    (e) Disposition of rejected PFD lot or PFD. (1) A rejected PFD lot 
may be resubmitted for testing, examination or inspection if the 
manufacturer first removes and destroys each defective PFD or, if 
authorized by the Commandant, reworks the lot to correct the defect.
    (2) Any PFD rejected in a final lot examination or inspection may be 
resubmitted for examination or inspection if all defects have been 
corrected and reexamination or reinspection is authorized by the 
Commandant.
    (3) A rejected lot or rejected PFD may not be sold or offered for 
sale under the representation that it meets this subpart or that it is 
Coast Guard-approved.

    (c) PFD Lots. A lot number must be assigned to each group of PFD's 
produced. No lot may exceed 1000 PFD's. A new lot must be started 
whenever any change in materials or a production method is made, or 
whenever any substantial discontinuity in the production process occurs. 
Changes in lots of component materials must be treated as changes in 
materials. Lots must be numbered serially. The lot number assigned, 
along with the approval number, must enable the PFD manufacturer, by 
referring to the records required by this subpart, to determine who 
produced the components used in the PFD.
    (d) Samples. (1) Samples used in testing and inspections must be 
selected at random. Sampling must be done only when all PFD's or 
materials in the lot are available for selection.
    (2) Each sample PFD selected must be complete, unless otherwise 
specified in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (3) Each adult test subject must have a freeboard of at least:
    (i) 100 mm (4 inches) if the PFD being tested is to be approved as a 
Type I hybrid PFD; or
    (ii) 120 mm (4.75 inches) if the PFD being tested is to be approved 
as a SOLAS lifejacket.
    (4) The number of samples selected per lot must be at least the 
number listed in Table 160.077-23A or Table 160.077-23B, as applicable, 
except as allowed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
    (5) If the total production for any five consecutive lots does not 
exceed 250 devices, the manufacturer's and inspector's tests can be run 
on the same sample(s) at the same time.

    (4) Independent Laboratory Inspection. (i) The inspector must 
discontinue lot inspection and reject the lot if observation of the 
records for the lot or of individual PFD's shows noncompliance with this 
section or the manufacturer's quality control procedures.
    (ii) An inspector may not perform a final lot inspection unless the 
manufacturer has a current approval certificate.
    (iii) If the inspector rejects a lot, the inspector shall notify the 
Commandant immediately.
    (iv) The inspector must prepare and sign the record required by 
Sec. 159.077-13 of this chapter and Sec. 160.077-25(b). If the lot 
passes, the record must also include the inspector's certification to 
that effect and a certification that no evidence of noncompliance with 
this section was observed.
    (k) Disposition of PFD's Rejected in Testing or Inspections. (1) A 
rejected PFD lot may be resubmitted for testing, examination, or 
inspection if the manufacturer first removes and destroys each PFD 
having the same type of defect or, if authorized by the Commandant or an 
authorized representative of the Commandant, reworks the lot to correct 
the defect.
    (2) Any PFD rejected in a final lot examination or inspection may be 
resubmitted for examination or inspection if

[[Page 208]]

all defects have been corrected and reexamination or reinspection is 
authorized by the Commandant or an authorized representative of the 
Commandant.
    (3) A rejected lot or rejected PFD may not be sold or offered for 
sale with the representation that it meets this subpart or that it is 
Coast Guard approved.

follows:
    (1) The text in UL 1517, Section 39, item A;
    (2) The following text and illustrations:

           There Are Five Types of Personal Flotation Devices

    This is a Type [insert approved Type] Hybrid Inflatable PFD.

    Note: The following types of PFDs are designed to perform as 
described in calm water

[[Page 209]]

and when the wearer is not wearing any other flotation material (such as 
a wetsuit).

    Type I--A Type I PFD has the greatest required inherent buoyancy and 
turns most unconscious persons in the water from a face down position to 
a vertical and slightly backward position, therefore greatly increasing 
one's chances of survival. The Type I PFD is suitable for all waters, 
especially for cruising on waters where rescue may be slow coming, such 
as large bodies of water where it is not likely that boats will be 
nearby. This type PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water. 
It is reversible and available in only two sizes--Adult (over 40 kg (90 
lb)) and child (less than 40 kg (90 lb)) which are universal sizes 
(designed for all persons in the appropriate category).

[Insert illustration of Type I PFD]

    Type II--A Type II PFD turns most wearers to a vertical and slightly 
backward position in the water. The turning action of a Type II PFD is 
less noticeable than the turning action of a Type I PFD and the Type II 
PFD will not turn as many persons under the same conditions as the Type 
I. The Type II PFD is usually more comfortable to wear than the Type I. 
This type of PFD is designed to fit a wide range of people for easy 
emergency use, and is available in the following sizes: Adult (over 40 
kg (90 lb)), Medium Child (23-40 kg (50-90 lb)), and two categories of 
Small Child (less than 23 kg (50 lb) or less than 14 kg (30 lb). 
Additionally, some models are sized by chest sizes. You may prefer to 
use the Type II where there is a good chance of fast rescue, such as 
areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, 
fishing and other water activities.

[Insert illustration of Type II PFD]

    Type III--The Type III PFD allows the wearer to tilt backwards in 
the water, and the device will maintain the wearer in that position and 
will not turn the wearer face down. It is not designed to turn the 
wearer face up. A Type III is generally more comfortable than a Type II, 
comes in a variety of styles which should be matched to the individual 
use, and is often the best choice for water sports, such as skiing, 
hunting, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. This type PFD normally comes 
in many chest sizes and weight ranges; however, some universal sizes are 
available. You may also prefer to use the Type III where there is a 
probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other 
persons to be engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities.

[Insert illustration of Type III PFD]

    Hybrid Inflatable Type I, II, or III--A Type I, II, or III Hybrid 
PFD is an inflatable device which is the most comfortable PFD to wear 
and has a minimal amount of buoyancy when deflated and significantly 
increased buoyancy when inflated (See accompanying table for actual 
buoyancy for your Type of hybrid). When inflated it turns the wearer 
with the action of a Type I, II, or III PFD as indicated on its label. 
Boaters taking advantage of the extra comfort of hybrid inflatable PFDs 
must take additional care in the use of these devices. Boaters should 
test their hybrid PFDs in the water, under safe, controlled conditions 
to know how well the devices float them with limited buoyancy. 
Approximately 90 percent of boaters will float while wearing a Type II 
or III hybrid inflatable PFD when it is not inflated. However, hybrid 
inflatable PFDs are not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with 
enough additional inflation to float the wearer. Almost all boaters will 
float while wearing a Type I hybrid inflatable PFD that is not inflated. 
The PFD's `performance type' indicates whether it should be used only 
where help is nearby, or if it also may be used where help may be slow 
coming. Type I hybrids are suitable where rescue may be slow coming, 
while Types II and III are good only when there is a chance of fast 
rescue. Type I hybrids are approved in three weight ranges, adult, for 
persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); youth, for persons weighing 23-40 
kg (50-90 lb); and small child, for persons weighing 14-23 kg (30-50 
lb). Type II hybrid PFDs are approved in the same size ranges as Type I 
hybrids but may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal 
adult sizes. Type III hybrids are only approved in adult and youth sizes 
but may also be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal 
adult sizes.

[For a pamphlet provided with a Type I, II or III hybrid PFD, insert 
illustration of the Type Hybrid PFD being sold]

    Type IV--A Type IV PFD is normally thrown or tossed to a person who 
has fallen overboard so that the person can grasp and hold the device 
until rescued. Until May 15, 1995 (or May 1, 1996 at commercial 
liveries), the Type IV is acceptable in place of a wearable device in 
certain instances. However, this type is suitable only where there is a 
good chance of quick rescue, such as areas where it is common for other 
persons to be nearby engaged in boating, fishing, and other water 
activities. It is not recommended for use by non-swimmers and children.

[Insert illustration of Type IV PFD]

    Type V (General)--A Type V PFD is a PFD approved for restricted uses 
or activities such as boardsailing, or commercial white water rafting. 
These PFDs are not suitable for other boating activities. The label on 
the PFD indicates the kinds of activities for which the PFD may be used 
and whether there are limitations on how it may be used.
    Type V Hybrid--A Type V Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can 
be the most comfortable and has very little buoyancy when it

[[Page 210]]

is not inflated, and considerably more buoyancy when it is inflated. In 
order for the device to count toward carriage requirements on 
recreational boats, it must be worn except when the boat is not underway 
or when the user is below deck. When inflated it turns the wearer 
similar to the action provided by a Type I, II, or III PFD (the type of 
performance is indicated on the label). This type of PFD is more 
comfortable because it is less bulky when it is not inflated. Boaters 
taking advantage of the extra comfort of hybrid inflatable PFDs must 
take additional care in the use of these devices. Boaters should test 
their hybrid PFDs in the water, under safe, controlled conditions to 
know how well the devices float them with limited buoyancy. 
Approximately 70 percent of boaters will float while wearing a Type V 
hybrid PFD when the device is not inflated. Therefore, it is not 
recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough additional 
inflation to float the wearer. The PFD's ``performance type'' indicates 
whether it should be used only where help is nearby, or if it may also 
be used where help may be slow coming. This type of PFD is approved in 
two sizes, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); and youth, 
for persons weighing 23-40 kg (50-90 lb), and may be available in a 
number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.

Sec. 160.077-29  PFD Manuals.

    (a) Approval. The text of each manual required by this section is 
reviewed with the application for approval. Changes may be required if 
needed to comply with this section.
    (b) Required Manuals. An owner's manual must be provided with each 
recreational and commercial hybrid PFD sold or offered for sale as 
follows:
    (1) The manual text for a recreational hybrid PFD must be printed 
verbatim and in the sequence set out in paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section, as applicable.
    (2) The manual for a commercial hybrid PFD must meet the 
requirements of paragraph (f) of this section except that the manual for 
a commercial Type I PFD which is also labeled for recreational use must 
meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Additional information, instructions, or illustrations may be 
included within the specified text of the manuals required by this 
section if there is no contradiction to the required information.
    (c) Type I, II or III Hybrid PFD. For a Type I, II and III hybrid 
PFD the manual contents must be as follows:
    (1) The following text:

                           Hybrid Limitations

    This PFD has limited inherent buoyancy which means YOU MAY HAVE TO 
INFLATE THIS PFD TO FLOAT, and its inflatable portion requires 
maintenance. While these PFDs are not required to be worn, if you have 
an accident or fall overboard, you are much more likely to survive if 
you are already wearing a PFD.
    There is only one way to find out if you will float while wearing 
the PFD when it is not inflated. That is to try this PFD in the water as 
explained in [insert reference to the section of the manual that 
discusses how to test the PFD]. If you have not tested this device in 
accordance with these guidelines, the Coast Guard does not recommend its 
use.

    (2) Instructions on use including instructions on donning, 
inflation, replenishing inflation mechanisms, and recommended practice 
operation;
    (3) Instructions on how to properly inspect and maintain the PFD, 
and recommendations concerning frequency of inspection;
    (4) Instructions on how to get the PFD repaired;
    (5) The text in UL 1517, Section 40, items B and D;
    (6) The following text:

                         Why Do You Need a PFD?

    A PFD provides buoyancy to help keep your head above water and to 
help you stay face up. The average in-water-weight of an adult is only 
about 5 to 10 pounds. The buoyancy provided by most PFDs will support 
that weight in water. However, the hybrid Type I, II, or III PFD may be 
an exception. The uninflated buoyancy provided by this PFD may only 
float 90 percent of the boating public. This is because the inherent 
buoyancy has been reduced to make it more comfortable to wear. So, you 
may not float adequately without inflating the device. Once

[[Page 211]]

the device is inflated you will have a minimum of 22 lb of buoyancy for 
adult sizes, which should be more than enough to float everyone. (See 
table above [below] for the actual minimum buoyancy for different Types 
of hybrids.) Your body weight alone does not determine your in-water-
weight. Since there is no simple method of determining your weight in 
water, you should try the device in the water in both its deflated and 
inflated condition.

    (7) The text in UL 1517, Section 40, item G;
    (8) The following text:

                              Wear Your PFD

    Your PFD won't help you if you don't have it on. It is well-known 
that most boating accidents occur on calm water during a clear sunny 
day. It is also true that in approximately 80 percent of all boating 
accident fatalities, the victim did not use a PFD. Don't wait until it's 
too late. Non-swimmers and children especially should wear their PFD at 
all times when on or near the water. Hybrid Type I, II, III or V PFDs 
are not recommended for non-swimmers unless inflated enough to float the 
wearer.

    (9) The text in UL 1517, Section 40, items I, J, K, and L; and
    (10) A table with the applicable PFD Type, size, and buoyancy values 
from Table 160.077-15(b)(13) or 160.077-17(b)(11), as applicable, or 
provide a reference to appropriate pamphlet table, if the pamphlet is 
combined with the manual.
    (d) Type V Recreational Hybrid PFD. For a Type V recreational hybrid 
PFD the manual contents must be as follows:
    (1) The text in UL 1517, Section 40, item A;
    (2) Instructions on use including instructions on donning, 
inflation, replenishing inflation mechanisms, and recommended practice 
operation;
    (3) Instructions on how to properly inspect and maintain the PFD, 
and recommendations concerning frequency of inspection;
    (4) Instructions on how to get the PFD repaired; and
    (5) The text in UL 1517, section 40, that is not included under

paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) For a commercial hybrid PFD approved as a ``Work Vest Only'' or 
Type I PFD the manual must meet the requirements of either paragraphs 
(e) (3) and (4) or of paragraph (c) of this section. The manual for a 
commercial Type I hybrid PFD which is also labeled for use on 
recreational boats must meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (3) Each commercial hybrid PFD approved with special purpose 
limitation must have a user's manual that--
    (i) Explains in detail the proper care, maintenance, stowage, and

Sec. 160.151-15   Design and performance of inflatable liferafts.

    To satisfy the requirements of the regulations of SOLAS indicated in 
Sec. 160.151-7, each inflatable liferaft must meet the following 
requirements of this section:
    (a) Workmanship and materials (Regulation III/30.2.1). Each liferaft 
must be constructed of the following types of materials meeting MIL-C-
17415E, or materials accepted by the Commandant as equivalent or 
superior--
    (1) Type 2, Class B, for the canopy;
    (2) Type 8 for seam tape;
    (3) Type 11 for the inflatable floor; and
    (4) Type 16, Class AA, for all other inflatable compartments and 
structural components.
    (b) Seams (Regulation III/30.2.1). Each seam must be at least as 
strong as the weakest of the materials joined by the seam. Each seam 
must be covered with tape where necessary to prevent lifting of and 
damage to fabric edges.
    (c) Protection from cold inflation-gas (Regulation III/30.2.1). Each 
inflatable compartment must be provided with a protective liner or 
baffling arrangement at the inflation-gas inlet, or other equally 
effective means to prevent damage from exposure to cold inflation-gas.
    (d) Compatibility of dissimilar materials (Regulation III/30.2.4). 
Where dissimilar materials are combined in the construction of a 
liferaft, provisions must be made to prevent loosening or tightening due 
to differences in thermal expansion, freezing, buckling, galvanic 
corrosion, or other incompatibilities.
    (e) Color (Regulation III/30.2.6). The primary color of the exterior 
of the canopy must be vivid reddish orange (color number 34 of NBS 
Special Publication 440), or a fluorescent color of a similar hue.
    (f) Retroreflective material (Regulation III/30.2.7). Each 
inflatable liferaft must be marked with Type I retroreflective material 
approved under part 164, subpart 164.018, of this chapter as complying 
with SOLAS. The arrangement of the retroreflective material must comply 
with IMO Resolution A.658(16).
    (g) Towing attachments (Regulation III/38.1.4.) Each towing 
attachment must be reinforced strongly enough to withstand the towing 
strain, and marked to indicate its function.
    (h) Weight (Regulation III/38.2.2). The weight of the liferaft 
including its container and equipment may not exceed 185 kg (407.8 lb), 
unless the liferaft is intended for launching into the water directly 
from its stowed position using an inclined or hand-tilted rack, or is 
served by a launching appliance approved by the Commandant under 
approval series 160.163.
    (i) Lifelines (Regulation III/38.3.1). Each lifeline must be made of 
nylon tubular webbing with a minimum diameter of 14 mm (9/16-inch), rope 
with a minimum diameter of 10 mm (\3/8\-inch),

[[Page 217]]

or equivalent. Each lifeline-attachment patch must have a minimum 
breaking strength of 1.5 kN (350 lb) pull exerted perpendicular to the 
base of the patch. Each bight of an exterior lifeline must be long 
enough to allow the lifeline to reach to the waterline of the liferaft 
when it is afloat.
    (j) Painter length (Regulation III/38.3.2). The length of the 
liferaft painter shall be not less than 10 meters (33 feet) plus the 
liferaft's maximum stowage height, or 15 meters (49 feet), whichever is 
greater.
    (k) Painter system (Regulation III/38.6.1). The painter protruding 
from the liferaft container must be inherently resistant, or treated to 
be resistant, to deterioration from sunlight and salt spray, and 
resistant to absorption and wicking of water.
    (l) Inflation cylinders (Regulation III/39.2.3). Each compressed-gas 
inflation cylinder within the liferaft must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 147.60 of this chapter, and be installed so that--
    (1) Slings and reinforcements of sufficient strength retain the 
inflation cylinders in place when the liferaft is dropped into the water 
from its stowage height and during inflation; and
    (2) The painter and the inflation cylinders of the liferaft are 
linked to start inflation when the painter is pulled by one person 
exerting a force not exceeding 150 N (34 lb).
    (m) Boarding ladders (Regulation III/39.4.2). The steps of each 
boarding ladder must provide a suitable foothold.
    (n) Canopy lamps (Regulation III/39.6.2). The exterior liferaft 
canopy lamp must be approved by the Commandant under approval series 
161.101.
    (o) Containers (Regulation III/39.7.1). Each container for packing 
liferafts--
    (1) Must include a telltale made with a seal-and-wire, or 
equivalent, method for indicating whether the liferaft has been tampered 
with or used since packing;
    (2) Must be designed so that the liferaft breaks free of the 
container when inflation is initiated, without the need to manually open 
or remove any closing arrangement;
    (3) Must have an interior surface smooth and free from splinters, 
barbs, or rough projections;
    (4) Must be of rigid construction where the liferaft is intended for 
float-free launching or for exposed stowage on deck;
    (5) If rigid, must be designed to facilitate securing the inflatable 
liferaft to a vessel to permit quick release for manual launching;
    (6) If constructed of fibrous-glass-reinforced plastic, must be 
provided with a means to prevent abrasion of the liferaft fabric, such 
as by using a gel-coated interior finish of the container, enclosing the 
liferaft in an envelope of plastic film, or equivalent means; and
    (7) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(4) of this section, may be 
of fabric construction. Each container of fabric construction must be 
made of coated cloth, include carrying handles and drain holes, and be 
adaptable to stowage and expeditious removal from lockers and deck-
mounted enclosures adjacent to liferaft-launching stations. The weight 
of a liferaft in a fabric container including its container and 
equipment may not exceed 100 kg (220 lb).

liters

[[Page 218]]

(7.77 ft\3\) for liferafts approved to accommodate up to 10 persons. The 
volume of an appendage is calculated using the bottom of the lowest 
opening in an appendage as the height of the appendage, and by deducting 
the volume of any objects inside the appendage. No opening designed to 
close as water is forced out of an appendage is an opening for the 
purpose of this calculation.
    (ii) The total volume of the appendages for liferafts approved to 
accommodate more than 10 persons must be not less than 20  x  N liters 
(0.706  x  N ft\3\), where N = the number of persons for which the 
liferaft is approved.
    (iii) The appendages must be securely attached and evenly 
distributed around the periphery of the exterior bottom of the liferaft. 
They may be omitted at the locations of inflation cylinders.
    (iv) The appendages must consist of at least two separate parts so 
that damage to one part will permit at least half of the required total 
volume to remain intact.
    (v) Openings in or between the appendages must be provided to limit 
the formation of air pockets under the inflatable liferaft.
    (vi) The appendages must be designed to deploy underwater when the 
liferaft inflates, and to fill to at least 60 percent of their capacity 
within 25 seconds of deployment. If weights are used for this purpose, 
they must be of corrosion-resistant material.
    (vii) The primary color of the appendages must be vivid reddish 
orange (color number 34 of NBS Special Publication 440), or a 
fluorescent color of a similar hue.
    (b) Boarding ramp (Regulation III/39.4.1). The boarding ramp must 
have sufficient size and buoyancy to support one person weighing 100 kg 
(220 lb), sitting or kneeling and not holding onto any other part of the 
liferaft.
    (c) Marking (Regulation III/39.8). Means must be provided for 
identifying the liferaft with the name and port of registry of the ship 
to which it is to be fitted, so that the identification can be changed 
without opening the liferaft container.

laboratory's inspection of the prototype liferaft under Sec. 160.151-
13(a) satisfies the requirements of paragraph 1/5.14.
    (7) Davit-launched liferafts--strength test (Paragraph 1/5.16.1). 
The calculation of combined strength of the lifting

[[Page 221]]

components must be based on the lesser of--
    (i) The lowest breaking strength obtained for each item; or
    (ii) The component manufacturer's ultimate strength rating.
    (d) The boarding ramp on each liferaft equipped with one must be 
demonstrated capable of supporting one person weighing 100 kg (220 lb), 
sitting or kneeling and not holding onto any other part of the liferaft.

Sec. 160.151-29  Additional approval tests for SOLAS A and SOLAS B inflatable liferafts.

    To verify compliance with the requirements of Regulation III/39.5.1, 
the following test must be conducted for SOLAS A and SOLAS B inflatable 
liferafts in addition to those required by Sec. 160.151-27 and IMO 
Resolution A.689(17):
    (a) Test of filling time for stability appendages. A representative 
sample of each type and size of stability appendage to be fitted to a 
liferaft must be tested as follows:
    (1) The appendage must be attached to a testing jig similar in 
material and construction to the appendage's intended location on a 
liferaft. The method of attachment must be the same as used on a 
liferaft. The appendage and jig must be attached to a scale capable of 
recording peak readings, and suspended over a pool of calm water. The 
dry weight must be recorded.
    (2) The appendage and jig must then be quickly lowered into the 
water until the appendage is completely submerged. When the appendage 
has been in the water for 25 seconds, it must be smoothly lifted 
completely out of the water, and the peak weight after the appendage is 
removed from the water recorded.
    (3) The difference in weights measured according to paragraphs (a) 
(1) and (2) of this section must be at least 60 percent of the 
appendage's volume, calculated in accordance with Sec. 160.151-
17(a)(2)(i).

constructed with those materials.
    (d) Each approved liferaft must pass each of the inspections and 
tests described in IMO Resolution A.689(17), part 2, paragraphs 5.1.3 
through 5.1.6 inclusive, and prescribed by paragraphs (e) through (g) of 
this section. For a davit-launched liferaft, these tests must be 
preceded by the test described in IMO Resolution A.689(17), part 2, 
paragraph 5.2.
    (e) The test described in IMO Resolution A.689(17), Paragraph 2/
5.1.5, must be conducted under the following conditions:
    (1) The test must last 1 hour, with a maximum allowable pressure 
drop of 5

[[Page 222]]

percent after compensation for changes in ambient temperature and 
barometric pressure.
    (2) For each degree Celsius of rise in temperature, 0.385 kPa must 
be subtracted from the final pressure reading (0.031 psig per degree 
Fahrenheit). For each degree Celsius of drop in temperature, 0.385 kPa 
must be added to the final pressure reading (again, 0.031 psig per 
degree Fahrenheit).
    (3) For each mm of mercury of rise in barometric pressure, 0.133 kPa 
must be added to the final temperature-corrected pressure reading (0.049 
psig per 0.1 inch of mercury). For each mm of mercury of drop in 
barometric pressure, 0.133 kPa must be subtracted from the final 
temperature-corrected pressure reading (again, 0.049 psig per 0.1 inch 
of mercury). Corrections for changes in ambient barometric pressure are 
necessary only if a measuring instrument open to the atmosphere, such as 
a manometer, is used.
    (f) One liferaft from each lot of fewer than 30 liferafts, and two 
from each lot of 30 to 50 liferafts, must pass the test described in IMO 
Resolution A.689(17), part 2, paragraphs 5.1.1 and 5.1.2. If any 
liferaft fails this test--
    (1) The reason for the failure must be determined;
    (2) Each liferaft in the lot must be examined for the defect and 
repaired if reparable, or scrapped if irreparable; and
    (3) The lot test must be repeated, including random selection of the 
liferaft or liferafts to be tested. If any liferafts from the lot have 
left the place of manufacture, they must be recalled for examination, 
repair, and testing as necessary; or else the required actions must take 
place at an approved servicing facility.
    (g) The manufacturer shall arrange for inspections by an accepted 
independent laboratory at least once in each calendar quarter in which 
production of liferafts approved by the Coast Guard takes place. The 
time and date of each inspection must be selected by the independent 
laboratory, to occur when completed liferafts are in the manufacturing 
facility and others are under construction. The manufacturer shall 
ensure that the inspector from the independent laboratory--
    (1) Conducts the inspection and witnesses the tests required by 
paragraph (f) of this section, and further conducts a visual inspection 
to verify that the liferafts are being made in accordance with the 
approved plans and the requirements of this subpart;
    (2) Examines the records of production inspections and tests for 
liferafts produced since the last inspection by an independent 
laboratory to verify that each required inspection and test has been 
carried out satisfactorily;
    (3) Conducts a design audit on at least one liferaft approved by the 
Coast Guard each year. If possible, different models of liferafts must 
be examined in the design audit from year to year. To retain Coast Guard 
approval, the manufacturer shall demonstrate to the inspector during 
each design audit that--
    (i) Each part used in the liferaft matches the part called for by 
the approved plans;
    (ii) Each part and subassembly are of the materials and components 
indicated on the approved plans or their bills of materials; and
    (iii) Each critical dimension is correct as shown either by 
measurement or by proper fit and function in the next-higher assembly.

paragraph (g) of this section, the liferaft may be evacuated and 
refilled with air for the tests in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (k) At each annual servicing of a liferaft ten or more years past 
its date of manufacture during which the gas-inflation test in paragraph 
(g) of this section is not conducted, a ``Necessary Additional 
Pressure'' (NAP) test must be conducted. Before the tests and 
inspections required in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section are 
conducted, the NAP test must be completed, using the following 
procedure:
    (1) Plug or otherwise disable the pressure-relief valves.
    (2) Gradually raise the pressure to the lesser of 2 times the design 
working pressure, or that specified in the manufacturer's servicing 
manual as sufficient to impose a tensile load on the tube fabric of 20 
percent of its minimum required tensile strength.
    (3) After 5 minutes, there should be no seam slippage, cracking, 
other defects, or pressure drop greater than 5 percent. If cracking in 
the buoyancy tubes is audible, accompanied by pressure loss, condemn the 
liferaft. If it is not, reduce the pressure in all buoyancy chambers 
simultaneously by enabling the pressure-relief valves.
    (l) At each annual servicing of a liferaft 10 or more years past its 
date of manufacture, the integrity of the seams connecting the floor to 
the buoyancy tube must be checked by the following procedure, or an 
equivalent procedure specified in the manufacturer's approved servicing 
manual:
    (1) With the buoyancy tube supported a sufficient distance above the 
floor of the servicing facility to maintain clearance during the test, a 
person weighing not less than 75 kg (165 lb) shall walk or crawl around 
the entire perimeter of the floor of the liferaft.
    (2) The seams connecting the floor to the buoyancy tube must then be 
inspected for slippage, rupture, and lifting of edges.
    (m) The servicing facility must complete the following for each 
liferaft that passes these inspections and tests:
    (1) Permanently mark the liferaft on its outside canopy, or on a 
servicing-record panel on an interior portion of one of its buoyancy 
tubes near an entrance, with--
    (i) The date of the servicing;
    (ii) The identification and location of the servicing facility; and
    (iii) If applicable, an indication that the special fifth-year 
servicing was performed.

[[Page 229]]

    (2) Permanently and legibly mark on the identification device 
provided in accordance with Sec. 160.151-17(c), or on the outside canopy 
of the liferaft, the name, if known, of the vessel on which the raft 
will be installed or the name, if known, of the vessel owner.
    (3) Affix an inspection sticker to the liferaft container or valise. 
The sticker must be of a type that will remain legible for at least 2 
years when exposed to a marine environment, and that cannot be removed 
without being destroyed. The sticker must be about 100 mm x 150 mm (4 by 
6 inches), with the last digit of the year of expiration superimposed 
over a background color that corresponds to the colors specified for the 
validation stickers for recreational-boat numbers in 33 CFR 174.15(c),

<R05>
Sec. 160.171-9  Construction.

    (a) General. Each immersion suit must be constructed primarily of a 
closed-cell flexible foam that meets the buoyancy and thermal insulation 
requirements in Sec. 160.171-11 (a) and (c). Each suit must be designed 
to cover the wearer's entire body, except for the area of the nose and 
eyes. It must be capable of being worn inside-out or be clearly capable 
of being worn in only one way and, as far as possible, incapable of 
being donned incorrectly.
    (b) Impact resistance and body strength. The body of each suit must 
be designed to allow the wearer to jump from a height of at least 4.5 m 
into the water without injury and without dislodging or damaging the 
suit.
    (c) Seams. Stitching in each sewn structural seam of an immersion 
suit must be lock type stitching that meets the requirements in Federal 
Standard No. 751 for one of the following:
    (1) Class 300 Lockstitch.
    (2) Class 700 Single Thread Lockstitch.

Other stitches which are not true lock stitches may be used to reinforce 
a glued seam provided the adhesive alone has the required seam strength 
after the non-standard stitch has been removed.
    (d) Seam strength. Each seam must have a strength of at least 225 
Newtons (50 lb.).

[[Page 232]]

    (e) Closures and seals. Each closure and seal must be designed so 
that, following a jump from a height of not less than 4.5 m into the 
water, there is no undue ingress of water into the suit.
    (f) Hardware. All hardware of an immersion suit must be of a size 
and design that allows ease of operation by the wearer. The hardware 
must be attached to the suit in a manner that allows the wearer to 
operate it easily and that prevents it from attaining a position in 
which it can be operated improperly.
    (g) Metal parts. Each metal part of an immersion suit must be--
    (1) 410 stainless steel or have salt water and salt air corrosion 
characteristics equal or superior to 410 stainless steel; and
    (2) Galvanically compatable with each other metal part in contact 
with it.
    (h) Suit exterior. The primary color of the exterior of each suit 
must be vivid reddish orange (color number 34 of National Bureau of 
Standards Publication 440). The exterior surface of the suit must resist 
tearing and abrasion when tested as prescribed in Sec. 160.171-17 (n) 
and (o).
    (i) Buoyant materials and compartments. Buoyant materials used in a 
suit must not be loose or granular. The suit must not have an inflated 
or inflatable chamber, except as prescribed in Sec. 160.171-11(a)(2).
    (j) Hand and arm construction. The hand of each suit must be a glove 
that allows sufficient dexterity for the wearer to pick up a 9.5 mm (3/8 
in.) diameter wooden pencil from a table and write with it, after being 
immersed in water at 5  deg.C for a period of one hour. The glove may 
not be removable unless it is attached to the arm and unless it can be 
secured to the arm or stowed in a pocket on the arm when not in use. A 
removable glove must be designed so that there is no undue ingress of 
water into the glove during use. Each arm with a removable glove must 
have a wristlet seal that meets paragraph (e) of this section.
    (k) Leg construction. Each suit must be designed to minimize or 
reduce free air in its legs when the wearer enters the water headfirst.
    (l) Foot construction. Each leg of a suit must have a foot that has 
a hard sole or enough room for a work shoe to be worn inside. The sole 
of each foot must be--
    (1) Natural or synthetic rubber that is ribbed or bossed for skid 
resistance; and
    (2) Designed to prevent the wearer from slipping when the suit is 
tested as prescribed in Sec. 160.171-17(c)(5).
    (m) Size. Each adult suit must fit persons ranging in weight from 50 
kg (110 lb.) to 150 kg (330 lb.) and in height from 1.5 m (59 in.) to 
1.9 m (75 in.). Each child size suit must fit children or small adults 
ranging in weight from 20 kg (44 lb.) to 50 kg (110 lb.) and in height 
from 1.0 m (39 in.) to 1.5 m (59 in.). An oversize adult suit is 
intended for persons too large for the standard adult suit. Each suit 
must be capable of being worn comfortably over clothing and must not 
restrict the wearer's motion. The suit size and design must allow 
successful completion of the mobility tests prescribed in Sec. 160.171-
17(c)(2) through (7).
    (n) Retroreflective material. Each immersion suit must be fitted 
with Type I retroreflective material that meets subpart 164.018 of this 
chapter. When the wearer of an immersion suit is in any stable floating 
position, at least 200 cm \2\ (31 sq. in.) of the material must be 
visible above water.
    (o) PFD Light. Each immersion suit must be designed so that a light 
meeting the requirements of subpart 161.012 of this chapter can be 
attached to its front shoulder area and so that the light when attached 
does not damage the suit and cannot adversely affect its performance. If 
the manufacturer of the suit designates a specific location for the 
light, or designates a specific model light, this information must be 
clearly printed on the suit or in the instructions prescribed by 
Sec. 160.171-15(c).
    (p) Inflation tube. If the suit has an inflatable auxiliary means of 
buoyancy, each joint in the oral inflation tube must be joined with a 
clamping device. A flange connection between the tube and the inflatable 
chamber must be reinforced so that the flange on the inflation tube is 
secured between the material of the inflatable section and the 
reinforcement.

<R05>
Sec. 160.171-11  Performance.

    (a) Buoyancy. Each suit must meet the following buoyancy 
requirements as measured in the test conducted under Sec. 160.171-17(h):
    (1) The adjusted buoyancy of each adult and each oversize adult size 
suit must be at least 100 N (22 lb.). The adjusted buoyancy of each 
child size suit must be at least 50 N (11 lb.) The measured buoyancy 
must not be reduced by more than 5% after 24 hours submersion in fresh 
water.
    (2) Each suit must have a stable floating position in which the 
wearer's head must be tilted to a position between 30 deg. and 80 deg. 
above the horizontal, with the mouth and nose at least 120 mm (4\3/4\ 
in.) above the surface of the water. If necessary, this position may be 
obtained through the use of an auxiliary means of buoyancy such as an 
inflatable bladder behind the wearer's head.
    (3) If an auxiliary means of buoyancy is necessary to meet paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the suit must have a stable floating position 
without the auxiliary means of buoyancy in which the mouth and nose of 
the wearer are at least 50 mm (2 in.) above the surface of the water.
    (4) The buoyancy of any auxiliary means of buoyancy must not be 
counted when determining the buoyancy of the suit.
    (b) Righting. The suit must be designed to turn the body of an 
unconscious person in the water from any position to one where the mouth 
is clear of the water in not more than five seconds, without assistance 
or the use of any means of auxiliary buoyancy which must be inflated by 
the wearer; or to allow the wearer to turn from a face down to a face up 
position in not more than 5 seconds, without assistance or the use of 
any means of auxiliary buoyancy. If an automatically inflated means of 
auxiliary buoyancy is used to meet this paragraph, the inflation 
mechanism must meet the requirements for commercial hybrid PFDs in 
Sec. 160.077-15(c) of this chapter, and the tests required under 
Sec. 160.077-21(c)(3) of this chapter. Auxiliary buoyancy, if fitted 
and/or inflated, must not interfere with righting.
    (c) Thermal protection. The suit must be designed to protect against 
loss of body heat as follows:
    (1) The thermal conductivity of the suit material when submerged 1 m 
(39 in.) in water must be less than or equal to that of a control sample 
of 4.75 mm (\3/16\ in.) thick, closed-cell neoprene foam. The control 
sample of foam must have a thermal conductivity of not more than 0.055 
watt/meter- deg. K (0.38 Btu-in./hr.-sq.ft.-  deg.F).
    (2) The suit must provide the wearer with sufficient thermal 
insulation, following one jump into the water from a height of 4.5 m, to 
ensure that the wearer's body core temperature does not fall more than 2 
 deg.C (3.6  deg.F) after a period of 6 hours immersion in calm 
circulating water at a temperature of between 0  deg.C (32  deg.F) and 2 
 deg.C (35.6  deg.F).
    (d) Donning time. Each suit must be designed so that a person can 
don the suit correctly within two minutes after reading the donning and 
use instructions described in Sec. 160.171-15(a).
    (e) Vision. Each suit must be designed to allow unrestricted vision 
throughout an arc of 60 deg. to either side of the wearer's straight-
ahead line of sight when the wearer's head is turned to any angle 
between 30 deg. to the right and 30 deg. to the left. Each suit must be 
designed to allow a standing wearer to move head and eyes up and down 
far enough to see both feet and a spot directly overhead.
    (f) Water penetration. An immersion suit must be designed to prevent 
undue ingress of water into the suit following a period of flotation in 
calm water of one hour.
    (g) Splash protection. Each suit must have a means to prevent water 
spray from directly entering the wearer's mouth.
    (h) Storage temperature. Each suit must be designed so that it will 
not be damaged by storage in its storage case at any temperature between 
-30  deg.C (-22  deg.F) and +65  deg.C (149  deg.F).
    (i) Flame exposure. Each suit must be designed to prevent sustained 
burning or continued melting after it is totally enveloped in a fire for 
a period of 2 seconds.
    (j) Oil resistance. Each immersion suit must be designed to be 
useable after a 24 hour exposure to diesel oil.

[[Page 234]]


<R05>
Sec. 160.171-13  Storage case.

    (a) Each suit must have a storage case made of vinyl coated cloth or 
material that provides an equivalent measure of protection to the suit.
    (b) Each storage case must be designed so that it is still useable 
after two seconds contact with a gasoline fire.


<R05>
Sec. 160.171-15  Instructions.

    (a) Each suit must have instructions for its donning and use in an 
emergency. The instructions must be in English and must not exceed 50 
words. Illustrations must be used in addition to the words. These 
instructions must be on the exterior of the storage case or printed on a 
waterproof card attached to the storage case or to the suit.
    (b) If the suit has an inflatable auxiliary means of buoyancy, 
separate instructions covering the use of the inflation valve must be 
provided on the suit near the valve or on a waterproof card attached 
near the valve.
    (c) Instructions for donning and use of the suit in an emergency 
must also be available in a format suitable for mounting on a bulkhead 
of a vessel. This placard must be in English, must include 
illustrations, and must include a warning as to the risk of entrapment 
in a submerged compartment due to the buoyancy of the suit.
    (d) Instructions for donning and use of the suit in an emergency, 
instructions for care and repair of the suit, and any additional 
necessary information concerning stowage and use of the suit on a vessel 
must be available in 8\1/2\ x 11 loose-leaf format suitable for 
inclusion in the vessel's training manual.

Sec. 160.171-17  Approval testing for adult size immersion suit.

    Caution: During each of the in-water tests prescribed in this 
section, a person ready to render assistance when needed should be near 
each subject in the water.
    (a) General. An adult size immersion suit must be tested as 
prescribed in this section. If the suit is also made in a child size, a 
child size suit must be tested as prescribed in Sec. 160.171-19. If the 
suit is also made in an oversize adult size, an oversize adult suit must 
be tested as prescribed in Sec. 160.171-17(g) to determine the measured 
buoyancy for the suit. No additional testing will be required if the 
oversize adult suit is of the same design as the adult suit except for 
extra material to provide for larger persons.
    (b) Test samples. Each test prescribed in this section may be 
performed by using as many immersion suits as needed to make efficient 
use of the test subjects and test equipment, except that each subject in 
the impact test described in Sec. 160.171-17(c)(11) must not use more 
than one suit during the test, and the suits used in the impact test 
must also be used in the thermal protection test described in 
Sec. 160.171-17(d).
    (c) Mobility and flotation tests. The mobility and flotation 
capabilities of each immersion suit must be tested under the following 
conditions and procedures:
    (1) Test subjects. Seven males and three females must be used in the 
tests described in this paragraph. The subjects must represent each of 
the three physical types (ectomorphic, endomorphic, and mesomorphic). 
Each subject must be in good health. The heaviest subject, of either 
sex, must weigh at least 135 kg (298 lb.). The heaviest male subject 
must weigh at least 115 kg (254 lb.) and the lightest male subject must 
weigh not more than 55 kg (121 lb). The heaviest female subject must 
weigh at least 115 kg (254 lb.) and the lightest female subject must 
weigh not more than 55 kg (121 lb). Each subject must be unfamiliar with 
the specific suit under test. Each subject must wear a standard range of 
clothing consisting of:

(ii)  Shirt (long sleeved);
(iii)  Trousers (not woolen);
(iv)  Woolen or equivalent synthetic socks;
(v)  Rubber soled work shoes.

    (2) Donning time. Each subject is removed from the view of the other 
subjects and allowed one minute to examine a suit and the manufacturer's 
instructions for donning and use of the suit in an emergency. At the end 
of this period, the subject attempts to don the suit as rapidly as 
possible

[[Page 235]]

without the aid of a chair or any support to lean on. If the subject 
does not don the suit completely, including gloves and any other 
accessories, within two minutes, the subject removes the suit and is 
given a demonstration of correct donning, and again attempts to don the 
suit. At least nine of the ten subjects must be able to don the suit 
completely, including time to remove shoes if necessary, in two minutes 
in at least one of the two attempts.
    (3) Field of vision. The immersion suit's field of vision must be 
tested as follows:
    (i) While wearing a suit, each subject sits upright and faces 
straight ahead. An observer is positioned to one side of the subject at 
an angle of 60 deg. away from the subject's straight-ahead line of 
sight. The observer must be able to see the subject's closest eye at 
this position. The observer then walks past the front of the subject to 
a position on the subject's other side that is at an angle of 60 deg. 
away from the subject's straight-ahead line of sight. The suit must not 
obstruct the observer's view of the subject's eyes at any point between 
the two positions.
    (ii) While wearing the suit, each subject stands upright and faces 
straight ahead. An observer is positioned to one side of the subject at 
an angle of 90 deg. away from the subject's straight-ahead line of 
sight. The subject then turns his or her head through an arc of 30 deg. 
toward the position of the observer. This procedure is repeated with the 
observer positioned on the other side of the subject at an angle of 
90 deg. away from the subject's straight ahead line of sight. The suit 
must not obstruct the observer's view of the subject's eyes when the 
subject's head is turned 30 deg. toward the observer.
    (iii) While wearing the suit, each subject stands upright and faces 
straight ahead. Through a combination of head and eye movement, the 
subject looks first at a spot directly overhead, then looks at a spot on 
or between the feet. An observer must verify that the subject can make 
the necessary head and eye movements while wearing the suit.
    (4) Hand dexterity. A physician must always be present during this 
test. While wearing a suit, including a removable glove if any, and 
after being immersed in water at 5  deg.C (41  deg.F) for a period of 
one hour, each subject must be able to pick up a 9.5 mm (\3/8\ in.) 
diameter wooden pencil from a flat hard surfaced table using only one 
hand. Still using only one hand, the subject must be able to position 
the pencil and write with it. At least eight of the ten test subjects 
must be able to complete this test. This test may be performed in 
conjunction with the thermal protection test described in Sec. 160.171-
17(d), in which case five of the six test subjects specified in 
Sec. 160.171-17(d)(1) must be able to complete the test.
    (5) Walking. A 30 m (100 ft.) long walking course must be laid out 
on a smooth linoleum floor. The finish on the floor must allow water to 
lie on it in a sheet rather than in beads. The course may have gradual 
turns, but must not have any abrupt change in direction. Each subject is 
timed walking the course two times at a normal pace with the floor dry. 
Each subject then dons a suit and is timed again walking the course two 
times with the floor wet. The subject is given adequate rest between 
trials to avoid fatigue. The subject must not slip on the wet floor when 
wearing the suit. The average time for each subject to walk the course 
while wearing the suit must be not more than 1.25 times the subject's 
average time to walk the course without the suit.
    (6) Climbing. A vertical ladder extending at least 5 meters (17 
feet) above a level floor must be used for this test. Each subject is 
timed climbing the ladder twice to a rung at least 3 meters (10 feet) 
above the floor. The subject then dons a suit and is again timed 
climbing to the same rung twice. The subject is given adequate rest 
between trials to avoid fatigue. The average time for each subject to 
climb the ladder while wearing the suit must not be more than 1.25 times 
the subject's average time to climb the ladder without the suit.
    (7) Swimming and water emergence test. A pool with an inflatable 
liferaft at one side must be used for this test. The liferaft must be of 
a type approved under Subpart 160.051 of this Chapter and must not have 
a boarding ramp. Each subject, wearing a life preserver but not the 
immersion suit, enters the

[[Page 236]]

water and swims 25 m. The subject must then be able to emerge from the 
pool onto the liferaft using only the hands placed on top of the 
liferaft as an aid and without pushing off of the bottom of the pool. 
Any subject unable to emerge onto the liferaft within 30 seconds is 
disqualified for this test. At least five subjects must qualify and be 
used for this test. If less than five subjects of the original ten 
qualify, substitute subjects must be used. Each qualified subject, after 
sufficient rest to avoid fatigue, repeats this test wearing an immersion 
suit instead of the life preserver. At least two-thirds of the qualified 
subjects must be able to swim this distance, and emerge onto the 
liferaft within 30 seconds, wearing the immersion suit.
    (8) Stability and retroreflective material. While wearing the suit 
in water witiout any auxiliary means of buoyancy, each subject assumes a 
face-up position and then allows his or her body to become limp. The 
distance from the water surface to the lowest part of the subject's 
mouth or nose is measured. This procedure is repeated using the 
auxiliary means of buoyancy, if one is provided. For each test subject, 
the stable position and the distance of the mouth and nose above the 
water must be prescribed in Sec. 160.171-11(a)(2) and Sec. 160.171-
11(a)(3). During this test, each subject must be viewed by observers to 
determine whether the retroreflective material of the suit meets 
Sec. 160.171-9(n).
    (9) Righting. Each subject while wearing a suit in water, without 
the use of any auxiliary means of buoyancy, takes a deep breath, assumes 
a face-down position, allows his or her body to become limp, and slowly 
expels air. The suit must cause the subject to turn to a position where 
the face is clear of the water within 5 seconds; or if the suit does not 
turn the subject within 5 seconds, the subject must be able to turn face 
up under his or her own power within 5 seconds. If the suit is provided 
with any means of auxiliary buoyancy, the procedure is repeated under 
each of the following applicable conditions:
    (i) With any means of auxiliary buoyancy attached but not inflated;
    (ii) With any means of auxiliary buoyancy which must be inflated by 
the wearer inflated according to the instructions; or
    (iii) With any means of auxiliary buoyancy which inflates 
automatically inflated by its automatic mechanism.
    (10) Water and air penetration. Each subject is weighed while 
wearing a pre-wetted suit without any auxiliary means of buoyancy. The 
subject jumps into water from a height that will cause the subject to be 
completely immersed. The subject swims or treads water for approximately 
one minute, emerges from the water, and is weighed within 10 seconds 
after emerging. The procedure is repeated with the subject entering the 
water headfirst. If air accumulates in the legs as the subject enters 
the water head-first, it must be expelled automatically. At the end of 
this test, the weight of the subject in the suit must not exceed the 
weight of the subject in the suit at the beginning of the test by more 
than 500 grams. Each test subject then re-enters the water and floats 
for a period of one hour. The subject then emerges from the water and is 
weighed within 10 seconds. The weight of the subject in the suit at the 
end of this test must not exceed the weight of the subject in the suit 
at the beginning of the period of flotation by more than 200 grams.
    (11) Impact. While wearing a suit without any auxiliary means of 
buoyancy, each subject jumps into water feet first six times from a 
height of 4.5 m (15 ft.) above the water surface. Each subject must be 
able to assume a face up stable position without assistance after each 
jump. The suit must not tear, separate at any seam, or exhibit any 
characteristic that could render it unsafe or unsuitable for use in 
water.
    (d) Thermal protection. The thermal protection capability of a suit 
must be tested under the following conditions and procedures;
    (1) Test subjects. Male subjects must be used for this test. Each 
subject must be familiarized with the test procedure before starting the 
test. Each subject must have somatotype parameters within the following 
ranges according to the Heath-Carter anthropometric method: endomorphy 
3.5<plus-minus>1.0; mesomorphy 4.0<plus-minus>1.5; ectomorphy 
3.5<plus-minus>1.0.

    Note: The following publication, among others, contains guidance for 
use of the

[[Page 237]]

Heath-Carter anthropometric method: ``Body Type and Performance,'' 
Hebbelinck and Ross; FITNESS, HEALTH AND WORK CAPACITY, INTERNATIONAL 
STANDARDS FOR ASSESSMENT; Larson, L. A. (Ed.); International Committee 
for the Standardization of Physical Fitness Tests; Macmillan; New York; 
1974 (pp. 266-283).


Each subject must have had a normal night's sleep before the test, a 
well-balanced meal 1 to 5 hours before the test, and no alcoholic 
beverages for 24 hours before the test. In addition to the suit, each 
subject must wear:
    (i) Underwear (short sleeved, short legged);
    (ii) Shirt (long sleeved);
    (ii) Trousers (not woolen);
    (iv) Woolen or equivalent synthetic socks;
    (v) Work shoes, if the suit is designed for shoes to be worn inside.
    (2) Test equipment. The test must be conducted in calm water with a 
temperature between 0  deg.C (32  deg.F) and 2  deg.C (35.6  deg.F). The 
air temperature 300 mm (1 ft.) above the water surface must be between 
minus 10  deg.C (14  deg.F) and 20  deg.C (68  deg.F). Each subject must 
be instrumented with an electrocardiograph, a thermistor or thermocouple 
in the rectum placed 150 mm (6 in) beyond the anus, thermistor or 
thermocouple in the lumbar region, a thermistor or thermocouple on the 
tip of the index finger, and a thermistor or thermocouple on the tip of 
the great toe. Each thermistor or thermocouple must have an accuracy of 
0.1  deg.C (0.18  deg.F). The suits used in this test must be the same 
ones previously subjected to the impact test described in Sec. 160.171-
17(c)(11).
    (3) Test procedure. A physician must always be present during this 
test. Before donning the suit, each subject rests quietly in a room with 
a temperature between 10  deg.C (50  deg.F) and 25  deg.C (77  deg.F) 
for 15 minutes. The rectal temperature is then recorded as the initial 
rectal temperature. The subject dons a suit as rapidly as possible 
without damaging the instrumentation and immediately enters the water. 
The subject assumes a face-up, stable floating position. No auxiliary 
means of buoyancy may be used during this test. The subject remains in 
the water engaging in activity that maintains the heart rate between 50 
and 140 per minute for the first hour, and between 50 and 120 per minute 
during the remainder of the test, except that no attempt is made to 
control heart rate if the subject is shivering. Each thermistor or 
thermocouple reading is recorded at least every 10 minutes.
    (4) Completion of testing. Testing of a subject ends six hours after 
he first enters the water, unless terminated sooner.
    (5) Termination of test. Testing of a subject must be terminated 
before completion if any of the following occurs:
    (i) The physician determines that the subject should not continue.
    (ii) The subject requests termination due to discomfort or illness.
    (iii) The subject's rectal temperature drops more than 2  deg.C (3.6 
 deg.F) below the initial rectal temperature, unless the physician 
determines that the subject may continue.
    (iv) The subject's lumbar, finger, or toe temperature drops below 10 
 deg.C (50  deg.F), unless the physician determines that the subject may 
continue.
    (6) Test results. The test results must be prepared as follows:
    (i) The total rectal temperature drop during the test period and the 
average lumbar, finger and toe temperature at the end of the test must 
be determined for each subject in the test, except subjects who did not 
complete testing for a reason stated in paragraph (d)(5)(i) or 
(d)(5)(ii) of this section. These temperatures and temperature drops 
must then be averaged. The average drop in rectal temperature must not 
be more than 2  deg.C (3.6  deg.F), and the average lumbar, toe and 
finger temperature must not be less than 5  deg.C (41  deg.F). Data from 
at least four subjects must be used in making these temperature 
calculations.
    (ii) Rates of toe, finger, lumbar, and rectal temperature drop for 
each subject who did not complete testing for a reason stated in 
paragraph (d)(5)(iii) or (d)(5)(iv) of this section must be determined 
using the highest temperature measured and the temperature measured 
immediately before testing was terminated. These rates must be used to 
extrapolate to 6 hours the estimated rectal, finger, lumbar, and toe 
temperature at the end of that time. These

[[Page 238]]

estimated temperatures must be the temperatures used in computing the 
average temperatures described in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section.
    (e) Insulation. Suit material must be tested under the following 
conditions and procedures, except that if the suit material meets the 
requirements for the control sample in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this 
section, the test procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is not 
required.
    (1) Test equipment. The following equipment is required for this 
test:
    (i) A sealed copper or aluminum can that has at least two parallel 
flat surfaces and that contains at least two liters (two quarts) or 
water and no air. One possible configuration of the can shown in figure 
160.171-17(e)(1)(i).
    (ii) A thermistor or thermocouple that has an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>0.1  deg.C (<plus-minus>0.18  deg.F) and that is arranged to 
measure the temperature of the water in the can.
    (iii) A control sample of two flat pieces of 4.75 mm (3/16 in.) 
thick, closed cell neoprene foam of sufficient size to enclose the can 
between them. The control sample must have a thermal conductivity of not 
more than 0.055 watt/meter- deg. K (0.38 Btu-in./hr.-sq.ft.-  deg.F). 
The thermal conductivity of the control sample must be determined in 
accordance with the procedures in ASTM C 177 or ASTM C 518 (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 160.171-3).
    (iv) Two flat pieces of suit material of sufficient size to enclose 
the can between them. The surface covering, surface treatment, and 
number of layers of the material tested must be the same as those of 
material used in the suit. If the material used in the suit varies in 
thickness or number of layers, the material tested must be 
representative of the portion of the suit having the least thickness or 
number of layers.
    (v) A clamping arrangement to form a watertight seal around the 
edges of the material when the can is enclosed inside. A sealing 
compound may be used. Figure 160.171-17(e)(1)(v) shows one possible 
arrangement of the clamping arrangement.
    (vi) A container of water deep enough to hold the entire assembly of 
the can, material, and clamp at least 1 meter (39 in.) below the surface 
of the water.
    (vii) A means to control the temperature of the water in the 
container between 0  deg.C (32  deg.F) and 1  deg.C (33.8  deg.F).
    (viii) A thermistor or thermocouple that has an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>0.1  deg.C (0.18  deg.F) and that is arranged to measure the 
temperature of the water in the container at the depth at which the can, 
material, and clamp are held.
    (2) Test procedure. The can is held under water (which can be at 
room temperature) and clamped between the two pieces of the neoprene 
control sample so that the assembly formed conforms as closely as 
possible to the shape of the can, and so that water fills all void 
spaces between the can and the sample. When the water temperature in the 
can is at or above 45  deg.C (113  deg.F), the assembly is then placed 
in the container and submerged to a depth of 1 m (39 in.) at the highest 
point of the assembly. The water temperature in the container must be 
between 0  deg.C (32  deg.F) and 1  deg.C (33.8  deg.F) and must be 
maintained within this range for the remainder of the test. No part of 
the assembly may touch the bottom or sides of the container. Every two 
minutes the assembly is shaken and then inverted from its previous 
position. The time for the water inside the can to drop from 45  deg.C 
(113  deg.F) to 33  deg.C (91  deg.F) is recorded. This procedure is 
performed three times using the control sample and then repeated three 
times using the suit material instead of the control sample. The 
shortest time for the drop in water temperature when the suit material 
is used must be greater than or equal to the shortest time when the 
neoprene control sample is used.
    (f) Storage temperature. Two samples of the immersion suits, in 
their storage cases, must be alternately subjected to surrounding 
temperatures of -30  deg.C to +65  deg.C. These alternating cycles need 
not follow immediately after each other and the following procedure, 
repeated for a total of ten cycles, is acceptable:
    (1) 8 hours conditioning at 65  deg.C to be completed in one day;
    (2) The specimens removed from the warm chamber that same day and 
left

[[Page 239]]

exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day;
    (3) 8 hours conditioning at -30  deg.C to be completed the next day; 
and
    (4) The specimens removed from the cold chamber that same day and 
left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day. At the 
conclusion of the final cycle of cold storage, two test subjects who 
successfully completed the donning test in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section enter the cold chamber, unpack and don the immersion suits. 
Alternatively, the suits may be upacked in the chamber, then removed and 
immediately donned. Neither of the suits must show damage such as 
shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical 
qualities.
    (g) Measured buoyancy. The buoyancy of a suit must be measured under 
the following conditions and procedures:
    (1) Test equipment. The following equipment is required for this 
test:
    (i) A mesh basket that is large enough to hold a folded suit, and 
that is weighted sufficiently to overcome the buoyancy of the suit when 
placed in the basket.
    (ii) A tank of water that is large enough to contain the basket 
submerged with its top edge 50 mm (2 in.) below the surface of the 
water.
    (iii) A scale or load cell that has an accuracy of 0.15 Newtons (1/2 
oz.) and that is arranged to support and weigh the basket in the tank.
    (2) Test procedure. The basket is submerged so that its top edge is 
50 mm (2 in.) below the surface of the water. The basket is then 
weighed. Thereafter, a suit is submerged in water and then filled with 
water, folded, and placed in the submerged basket. The basket is titled 
45 deg. from the vertical for five minutes in each of four different 
directions to allow all entrapped air to escape. The basket is then 
suspended with its top edge 50 mm (2 in.) below the surface of the water 
for 24 hours. At the beginning and end of this period, the basket and 
suit are weighed underwater. The measured buoyancy of the suit is the 
difference between this weight and the weight of the basket as 
determined at the beginning of the test. The measured buoyancy after 24 
hours must not be more than 5% lower than the initial measured buoyancy. 
The measured buoyancy after 24 hours is used to determine adjusted 
buoyancy as described in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (h) Adjusted buoyancy. The adjusted buoyancy of a suit is its 
measured buoyancy reduced by the percentage buoyancy loss factor of the 
buoyant suit material. The percentage buoyancy loss factor is part of 
the buoyancy rating code determined in accordance with UL 1191, except 
that the minimum number of samples required to determine each property 
is 10 instead of 75.
    (i) Suit flame exposure. The suit's resistance to flame must be 
tested under the following conditions and procedures:
    (1) Test equipment. The following equipment is required for this 
test:
    (i) A metal pan that is at least 300 mm (12 in.) wide, 450 mm (18 
in.) long, and 60 mm (2\1/2\ in.) deep. The pan must have at least 12 mm 
(\1/2\ in.) of water on the bottom with approximately 40 mm (1\1/2\ in.) 
of gasoline floating on top of the water.
    (ii) An arrangement to hold the suit over the gasoline.
    (2) Test procedure. A suit is held from its top by the holding 
arrangement. The gasoline is ignited and allowed to burn for 
approximately 30 seconds in a draft-free location. The suit is then held 
with the lowest part of each foot 240 mm (9.5 in.) above the surface of 
the burning gasoline. After two seconds, measured from the moment the 
flame first contacts the suit, the suit is removed from the fire. The 
suit must not sustain burning or continue melting after removal from the 
flames. If the suit sustains any visible damage other than scorching, it 
must then be subjected to the stability test described in paragraph 
(c)(8) of this section, except that only one subject need be used; the 
impact test described in paragraph (c)(11) of this section, except that 
only one subject need be used; the thermal protection test described in 
paragraph (d) of this section, except that only one subject need be 
used; and the buoyancy test described in paragraph (g) of this section, 
except that the buoyancy test need be conducted for only 2 hours.
    (j) Storage case flame exposure. The storage case must be tested 
using the same equipment required for the suit

[[Page 240]]

flame exposure test. The immersion suit must be inside the storage case 
for this test. The storage case is held from its top by the holding 
arrangement. The gasoline is ignited and allowed to burn for 
approximately 30 seconds in a draft-free location. The storage case is 
then held with its lowest part 240 mm (9.5 in.) above the surface of the 
burning gasoline. After two seconds, measured from the moment the flames 
first contact the case, the case is removed from the fire. If the case 
is burning, it is allowed to continue to burn for six seconds before the 
flames are extinguished. The storage case material must not burn through 
at any point in this test and the immersion suit must not sustain any 
visible damage.
    (k) Corrosion resistance. Each metal part of a suit that is not 410 
stainless steel, or for which published evidence of salt-spray corrosion 
resistance equal to or greater than 410 stainless steel is not 
available, must be tested as described in ASTM B 117 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 160.171-3). A sample of each metal under test and a 
sample of 410 stainless steel must be tested for 720 hours. At the 
conclusion of the test, each sample of test metal must show corrosion 
resistance equal to or better than the sample of 410 stainless steel.
    (l) Body strength. The body strength of a suit must be tested under 
the following conditions and procedures:
    (1) Test equipment. The test apparatus shown in figure 160.171-
17(1)(1) must be used for this test. This apparatus consists of--
    (i) Two rigid cylinders each 125 mm (5 in.) in diameter, with an eye 
or ring at each end;
    (ii) A weight of 135 kg (300 lb.); and
    (iii) Ropes or cables of sufficient length to allow the suit to be 
suspended as shown in Figure 160.171-17(1)(1).
    (2) Test procedure. The suit is cut at the waist and wrists, or 
holes are cut into it as necessary to accommodate the test apparatus. 
The suit is immersed in water for at least two minutes. The suit is then 
removed from the water and immediately arranged on the test apparatus, 
using each closure as it would be used by a person wearing the suit. The 
135 kg (300 lb.) load is applied for 5 minutes. No part of the suit may 
tear or break during this test. The suit must not be damaged in any way 
that would allow water to enter or that would affect the performance of 
the suit.
    (m) Seam strength. The strength of each different type of seam used 
in a suit must be tested under the following conditions and procedures:
    (1) Test equipment. The following equipment must be used for this 
test.
    (i) A chamber in which air temperature can be kept at 23  deg.C 
(73.4  deg.F) <plus-minus>2  deg.C (1.8  deg.F) and in which relative 
humidity can be kept at 50% <plus-minus>5%.
    (ii) A device to apply tension to the seam by the means of a pair of 
top jaws and a pair of bottom jaws. Each set of jaws must grip the 
material on both sides so that it does not slip when the load is 
applied.
    (2) Test samples. Each test sample must consist of two pieces of 
suit material, each of which is a 100 mm (4 in.) square. The two pieces 
are joined by a seam as shown in figure 160.171-17(m)(3). For each type 
of seam, 5 samples are required. Each sample may be cut from the suit or 
may be prepared specifically for this test. One type of seam is 
distinguished from another by the type and size of stitch or other 
joining method used and by the type and thickness of the materials 
joined at the seam.
    (3) Test procedure. Each sample is conditioned for at least 40 hours 
at 23  deg.C (73.4  deg.F) <plus-minus>2 deg.(1.8  deg.F) C and 50% 
<plus-minus>5% relative humidity. Immediately after conditioning, each 
sample is mounted individually in the tension device as shown in figure 
160.171-17(m)(3). The jaws are separated at a rate of 5 mm/second (12 
in./minute). The force at rupture is recorded. The average force at 
rupture must be at least 225 Newtons (50 lb.).
    (n) Tear resistance. The tear resistance of suit material must be 
determined by the method described in ASTM D 1004. If more than one 
material is used, each material must be tested. If varying thickness of 
a material are used in the suit, samples representing the thinnest 
portion of the material must be tested. If multiple layers of a material 
are used in the suit, samples representing the layer on the exterior of 
the suit must be tested. Any material which is a composite

[[Page 241]]

formed of two or more materials bonded together is considered to be a 
single material. The average tearing strength of each material must be 
at least 45 Newtons (10 lb.).
    (o) Abrasion resistance. The abrasion resistance of each type of 
suit material on the exterior of the suit must be determined by the 
method described in Federal Test Method Standard 191, Method 5304.1. If 
varying thicknesses of exterior suit material are used, samples 
representing the thinnest portion of the material must be tested. If 
exterior material has multiple layers, samples of the layer on the 
outside surface of the suit must be tested. Any exterior material which 
is a composite formed of two or more layers bonded together is 
considered to be a single material and the abradant must be applied to 
the surface that is on the exterior of the suit. The residual breaking 
strength of each material must be at least 225 Newtons (50 lb.).
    (p) Test for oil resistance. After all its apertures have been 
sealed, an immersion suit is immersed under a 100 mm head of diesel oil, 
grade No. 2-D as defined in ASTM D 975 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 160.171-3) for 24 hours. The surface oil is then wiped off and the 
immersion suit subjected to the leak test prescribed in Sec. 160.171-
17(c)(10). The ingress of water must not be greater than 200 grams.

Sec. 160.171-19  Approval testing for child size immersion suit.

    A child size suit must pass the following tests:
    (a) The stability test prescribed in Sec. 160.171-17(c)(8), except 
that only six children need be used as test subjects and they can be of 
either sex. The subjects must be within the ranges of weight and height

    (c) Storage Temperature. A thermal protective aid must not be 
damaged by storage in its storage case at any temperature between -30 
deg.C (-22  deg.F) and +65 C (149  deg.F).
    (d) In water performance. The thermal protective aid must be 
designed to permit the wearer to remove it in the water within two 
minutes, if it impairs ability to swim.
    (e) Water penetration. The fabric from which the thermal protective 
aid is constructed must maintain its watertight integrity when 
supporting a column of water 2 meters high.
    (f) Oil resistance. Each thermal protective aid must be designed to 
be useable after 24 hours exposure to diesel oil.


<R05>
Sec. 160.174-13  Storage case.

    Each thermal protective aid must be provided with a ziplock bag or 
equivalent storage case.


<R05>
Sec. 160.174-15  Instructions.

    (a) Each thermal protective aid must have instructions for its 
donning and use in an emergency. The instructions must be in English and 
must not exceed 50 words. Illustrations must be used in addition to the 
words. The instructions must include advice as to whether to swim in the 
aid or discard it if the wearer is thrown into the water.
    (b) The instructions required by paragraph (a) of this section must 
be on the exterior of the storage case, printed on a waterproof card 
attached to the storage case, or printed on the thermal protective aid 
and visible through a transparent storage case. The instructions must 
also be available in 8\1/2\ x 11 inch loose-leaf format for inclusion in 
the vessel's training manual.


<R05>
Sec. 160.174-17  Approval testing.

    (a) General. A thermal protective aid must be tested as prescribed 
in this section.
    (b) Mobility and swimming tests. The mobility and swimming 
capabilities of each thermal protective aid must be tested under the 
following conditions and procedures:
    (1) Test subjects. Seven males and three females must be used in the 
tests described in this paragraph. The subjects must represent each of 
the three physical types (ectomorphic, endomorphic, and mesomorphic). 
Each subject must be in good health. The heaviest male subject must 
weigh at least 25 kg (55 lb) more than the lightest male subject. The 
heaviest female subject must weigh at least 25 kg (55 lb) more than the 
lightest female subject. The heaviest subject must weigh 
150<plus-minus>5 Kg (330<plus-minus>11 lbs.) and the lightest subject 
must weigh 50<plus-minus>5 Kg (110<plus-minus>11 lbs.). Each subject 
must be unfamiliar with the specific thermal protective aid under test. 
Each subject must wear a standard range of clothing consisting of:

[[Page 247]]

    (i) Underwear (short sleeved, short legged);
    (ii) Shirt (long sleeved);
    (iii) Trousers (not woolen);
    (iv) Woolen socks;
    (v) Rubber soled shoes; and
    (vi) A life preserver.
    (2) Donning test. Each subject is removed from the view of the other 
subjects and allowed one minute to examine the thermal protective aid 
and the manufacturer's instructions for donning and use of the aid in an 
emergency. At the end of this period, the subject attempts to don the 
thermal protective aid as rapidly as possible. If the subject does not 
don the thermal protective aid completely, including gloves and any 
other accessories, within 60 seconds, the subject removes the aid and is 
given a demonstration of correct donning, and again attempts to don the 
aid. At least nine out of ten subjects must be able to don the thermal 
protective aid completely in 60 seconds on at least one of the two 
attempts.
    (3) Discarding test. If the thermal protective aid impairs the 
ability of the wearer to swim, it must be demonstrated that it can be 
discarded by the test subjects, when immersed in water, in not more than 
two minutes. Caution: During each of the in water tests prescribed in 
this section, a person ready to render assistance when needed should be 
near each subject in the water.
    (i) Unless the manufacturer specifies in the instructions that the 
thermal protective aid does impair ability to swim and should always be 
discarded in the water, each subject, wearing a life preserver, enters 
the water and swims 25 meters. The subject, after sufficient rest to 
avoid fatigue, repeats this test wearing a thermal protective aid in 
addition to the life preserver. At least nine out of ten subjects must 
be able to swim this distance wearing the thermal protective aid in not 
more than 125% of the time taken to swim the distance wearing only a 
life preserver, or the aid will be determined to impair the ability to 
swim.
    (ii) If the thermal protective aid is determined by the above test 
or specified by the manufacturer to impair the ability to swim, each 
subject, after entering the water from a height of one meter (three 
feet), attempts to remove the aid and discard it. At least nine out of 
ten subjects must be able to discard the device within two minutes.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Storage temperature. Two samples of the thermal protective aids, 
in their storage cases, are alternately subjected to surrounding 
temperatures of -30  deg.C to +65  deg.C. These alternating cycles need 
not follow immediately after each other and the following procedure, 
repeated for a total of ten cycles, is acceptable:
    (1) 8 hours conditioning at 65  deg.C to be completed in one day;
    (2) The specimens removed from the warm chamber that same day and 
left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day;
    (3) 8 hours conditioning at -30  deg.C to be completed the next day; 
and
    (4) The specimens removed from the cold chamber that same day and 
left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day. At the 
conclusion of step (3) of the final cycle of cold storage, two test 
subjects who successfully completed the donning test previously enter 
the cold chamber, unpack and don the thermal protective aids. The aids 
must not show any damage, such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, 
dissolution or change of mechanical qualities.
    (e) Water penetration. A sample of the fabric from which the thermal 
protective aid is constructed is installed as a membrane at one end of a 
tube of at least 2.5 cm (one inch) diameter and 2 meters long. The tube 
is fixed in a vertical position with the membrane at the bottom, and 
filled with water. After one hour the membrane must continue to support 
the column of water with no leakage.
    (f) Insulation. The material from which the thermal protective aid 
is constructed is tested in accordance with the procedures in ASTM C 
177, ASTM C 518, or ASTM D 1518. The material must have a thermal 
conductivity of not more than 0.25 W/(m- deg.K) (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 160.174-3).
    (g) Test for oil resistance. After all its apertures have been 
sealed, a thermal protective aid is immersed under a 100

[[Page 248]]

mm head of diesel oil, grade no. 2-D as defined in ASTM D 975 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.174-3), for 24 hours. The 
surface oil is then wiped off and a sample of the material from the aid 
is again tested in accordance with the procedures in ASTM C 177 or ASTM 
C 518 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.174-3). The material must 
still have a thermal conductivity of not more than 0.25 W/(m- deg. K).
    (h) Seam strength. The strength of each different type of seam used 
in a thermal protective aid must be tested under the following 
conditions and procedures.
    (1) Test equipment. The following equipment must be used in this 
test:
    (i) A chamber in which air temperature can be kept at 25  deg.C 
(73.4  deg.F) <plus-minus>2  deg.C (1.8  deg.F) and in which relative 
humidity can be kept at 50% <plus-minus>5%.
    (ii) A device to apply tension to the seam by means of a pair of top 
jaws and a pair of bottom jaws. Each set of jaws must grip the material 
on both sides so that it does not slip when the load is applied. Each 
front jaw must be 25 mm (1 inch) wide by 25 mm (1 inch) long. The 
distance between the jaws before the load is applied must be 75mm (3 
inches).
    (2) Test samples. Each test sample consists of two pieces of the 
material from which the thermal protective aid is constructed, each of 
which is 100 mm (4 inches) square. The two pieces are joined by a seam 
as shown in figure 160.171-17(m)(3). For each type of seam, 5 samples 
are required. Each sample may be cut from a thermal protective aid or 
may be prepared specifically for this test. One type of seam is 
distinguished from another by the type and size of stitch or other 
joining method used (including orientation of warp and fill, if any) and 
by the type and thickness of the materials joined at the seam.
    (3) Test procedure. Each sample is conditioned for at least 40 hours 
at 23  deg.C<plus-minus>2  deg.C and 50% <plus-minus>5% relative 
humidity. Immediately after conditioning, each sample is mounted 
individually in the tension device as shown in figure 160.171-17(m)(3). 
The jaws are separated at a rate of 5 mm/second (12 in/minute). The 
maximum force to achieve rupture is recorded. The average force at 
rupture must be at least 225 Newtons (50 lb).
    (i) Tear resistance. The tear resistance of the material from which 
a thermal protective aid is constructed must be determined by the method 
described in ASTM D 1004 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.174-
3). If more than one material is used, each material must be tested. If 
varying thicknesses of a material are used in the aid, samples 
representing the thinnest portion of the material must be tested. If 
multiple layers of a material are used in the aid, samples representing 
the layer on the exterior of the aid must be tested. Any material that 
is a composite formed of two or more materials bonded together is 
considered to be a single material. The average tearing strength of each 
material must be at least 45 Newtons (10 lb).

given a complete visual examination. The sample must be selected at 
random from a production lot of 100 thermal protective aids and examined 
by or under the supervision of the independent laboratory. The sample 
fails if the visual examination shows that the aid does not conform to 
the approved design.

[[Page 249]]

    (c) If a defect in the thermal protective aid is detected upon 
visual examination, 10 additional samples from the same lot must be 
selected at random and examined for the defect.
    (d) If one or more of the 10 samples fails the examination, each 
thermal protective aid in the lot must be examined for the defect for 
which the lot was rejected. Only thermal protective aids that are free 
of defects may be sold as Coast Guard approved.

<R05>
Sec. 160.176-13  Approval Tests.

    (a) General. (1) This section contains requirements for approval 
tests and examinations of inflatable lifejackets. Each test or 
examination must be conducted or supervised by an independent 
laboratory. The tests must be done using lifejackets that have been 
constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications in the 
application for approval. Unless otherwise specified, only one 
lifejacket, which may or may not have been subjected to other tests, is 
required to be tested in each test. One or more lifejackets that have 
been tested as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section must be used 
for the tests prescribed in paragraphs (j), (n), (q), and (r) of this 
section. The tests prescribed in paragraph (y) of this section require 
one or more lifejackets as specified in that paragraph.
    (2) All data relating to buoyancy and pressure must be taken at, or 
corrected to, an atmospheric pressure of 760 mm (29.92 inches) of 
mercury and a temperature of 20  deg.C (68  deg.F).
    (3) The tests in this section are not required to be run in the 
order listed, except where a particular order is specified.
    (4) Some tests in this section require a lifejacket to be tested 
while being worn. In each of these tests the test subjects must 
represent a range of small, medium, and large heights and weights. 
Unless otherwise specified, a minimum of 18 test subjects, including 
both males and females, must be used. The test subjects must not be 
practiced in the use of the lifejacket being tested. However, they must 
be familiar with the use of other Coast Guard approved lifejackets. 
Unless specified otherwise, test subjects must wear only swim suits. 
Each test subject must be able to swim and relax in the water.

    Note: Some tests have inherent hazards for which adequate safeguards 
must be taken to protect personnel and property in conducting the tests.

    (b) Donning. (1) No second stage donning is allowed in the tests in 
this paragraph. Test subjects may read the donning instructions to be 
provided with the device, if any. An uninflated lifejacket with size 
adjustment at its mid-range is given to each test subject with the 
instruction: ``Please don as quickly as possible, adjust to fit snugly, 
and inflate.'' Each subject must, within one minute, don the uninflated 
lifejacket, adjust it to fit snugly, and then activate the manual 
inflation mechanism.

    Note: For this test the manual inflation mechanism may be disabled.


[[Page 256]]


    (2) The average time of all subjects to complete the test in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section must not exceed 30 seconds. The 
criteria in this paragraph do not apply to the tests in paragraphs 
(b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.
    (3) The test in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is repeated with 
each subject wearing an insulated, hooded parka and gloves made from 
heavy, cotton-jersey (knit) fabric.
    (4) The test in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is then repeated 
twice more with a fully inflated lifejacket. In the first test the 
subjects must wear swim suits and in the second test, parka and gloves.
    (c) Inflation Testing. No second stage donning is allowed in the 
tests in this paragraph. A lifejacket with each automatic inflation 
mechanism disabled must be used for the tests prescribed in paragraphs 
(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. For the tests prescribed in paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section, remove any non-reusable cover or packaging from 
the lifejacket, but do not open any cover or closure which is intended 
to be closed when the lifejacket is worn in the uninflated condition.
    (1) Each test subject dons an uninflated lifejacket and is 
instructed to enter the water and swim for approximately 30 seconds and 
then, on command, inflate the lifejacket using only oral inflation 
mechanisms. Within 30 seconds after the command is given, the lifejacket 
must be sufficiently inflated to float each subject with respiration 
unimpeded.
    (2) Each test subject dons an uninflated lifejacket and is 
instructed to enter the water and swim for approximately 30 seconds, 
bring both hands to the surface, and then, on command, inflate the 
lifejacket using each manual inflation mechanism. Each test subject must 
find and operate all the manual inflation mechanisms within 5 seconds 
after the command is given. The manual inflation mechanisms must inflate 
the lifejacket sufficiently to float the wearers within 5 seconds after 
the mechanisms are operated. Within 20 seconds after activation each 
subject must be floating in the position described in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section.
    (3) One small and one large test subject don uninflated lifejackets 
and jump feet first from a height of 1 meter into the water. The 
automatic inflation mechanisms must inflate the lifejackets sufficiently 
to float the wearers within 10 seconds after the subjects enter the 
water. Within 20 seconds after entering the water each subject must be 
floating in the position described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (4) Air at a pressure of 4.2 kPa (0.6 psig) is applied separately to 
each oral inflation mechanism of the lifejacket. In each application the 
chamber must fully inflate within 1 minute.
    (5) Each oral inflation mechanism of an unpacked lifejacket is 
connected to a regulated air source constantly supplying air at a 
pressure of 7 kPa (1 psig). Each mechanism must pass at least 100,000 cc 
of air per minute.
    (d) Flotation stability--(1) Uninflated flotation stability. 
Lifejackets with their automatic inflation mechanisms disabled must be 
used for this test. Each subject dons an uninflated lifejacket, enters 
the water, and assumes an upright, slightly back of vertical, position. 
Each subject then relaxes. For each subject that floats, the uninflated 
lifejacket must not tend to turn the wearer face-down when the head is 
allowed to fall back.
    (2) Righting action. (i) Each test subject dons an uninflated 
lifejacket, enters the water, allows the automatic inflation mechanism 
to inflate the lifejacket, and swims for 30 seconds. While swimming, 
freedom of movement and comfort are observed and noted by the person 
conducting the test. Freedom of movement and comfort must comply with 
Sec. 160.176-11(d). Also, each subject must demonstrate that the 
lifejacket can be adjusted while the subject is in the water.
    (ii) Each subject then takes three gentle breast strokes and while 
still face-down in the water, relaxes completely while slowly exhaling 
to FRC. Each subject remains in this limp position long enough to 
determine if the lifejacket will turn the subject from the face-down 
position to a position in which the subject's breathing is not impaired. 
The time from the last

[[Page 257]]

breast stroke until breathing is not impaired is recorded. Each subject 
repeats these steps two additional times, and the average time for the 
three righting actions is calculated. This average time must not exceed 
5 seconds.
    (iii) If the lifejacket does not have automatic inflation mechanisms 
for all chambers, the tests in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of 
this section are repeated with each lifejacket fully inflated.
    (iv) Each subject then performs the test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of 
this section with one chamber of the lifejacket deflated. This test is 
then repeated as many times as necessary to test the lifejacket with a 
different chamber deflated until each chamber has been tested in this 
manner.
    (v) Each subject then performs the test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of 
this section but exhales to FRC at the end of the third breast stroke 
and holds the breath prior to relaxing.
    (3) Static measurements. At the end of each test with each subject 
in Sec. 160.176-13(d)(2)(ii), through Sec. 160.176-13(d)(2)(v)--
    (i) The freeboard (the distance from the water surface to the bottom 
of the mouth) must be at least 100 mm (4.0 in.) without repositioning of 
any part of the body and at least 120 mm (4.75 in.) after the head is 
positioned on the lifejacket for maximum freeboard and then relaxed;
    (ii) The distance from water surface to the lower portion of the ear 
canal must be at least 50 mm (2 in.);
    (iii) The torso angle (the angle between a vertical line and a line 
passing through the shoulder and hip) must be between 20 deg. and 
65 deg. (back of vertical);
    (iv) The face-plane angle (the angle between a vertical line and a 
line passing through the most forward part of the forehead and chin) 
must be between 15 deg. and 60 deg. (back of vertical);
    (v) The lowest mark on a vertical scale 6 m (20 ft.) from and in 
front of the subject which the subject can see without moving the head 
must be no higher than 0.3 m (12 in.) from the water level.
    (vi) The subject when looking to the side, must be able to see the 
water within 3 m (10 ft.) away; and
    (vii) At least 75% of the retroreflective material on the outside of 
the lifejacket, and the PFD light, must be above the water.
    (4) Average requirements. The test results for all subjects must be 
averaged for the following static measurements and must comply with the 
following:
    (i) The average freeboard prior to positioning the head for maximum 
freeboard must be at least 120 mm (4.75 in.);
    (ii) The average torso angle must be between 30 deg. and 50 deg. 
(back of vertical); and
    (iii) The average face-plane angle must be between 20 deg. and 
50 deg. (back of vertical).
    (5) ``HELP'' Position. Starting in a relaxed, face-up position of 
static balance, each subject brings the legs and arms in towards the 
body so as to attain the ``HELP'' position (a fetal position, but 
holding the head back). The lifejacket must not turn the subject face 
down in the water.
    (e) Jump test. (1) Each test subject dons an uninflated lifejacket 
and with hands above head, jumps feet first, into the water from a 
height of 4.5 m (15 ft.). No second stage donning is allowed during this 
test and the lifejacket must--
    (i) Inflate automatically, float the subject to the surface, and 
stabilize the body with the mouth out of the water;
    (ii) Maintain its intended position on the wearer;
    (iii) Not be damaged; and
    (iv) Not cause injury to the wearer.
    (2) The jump test in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is repeated 
using a lifejacket which has been fully inflated manually.
    (3) The jump test in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is then 
conducted with one chamber deflated.This test is then repeated as many 
times as necessary to test the lifejacket with a different chamber 
deflated until each chamber has been tested in this manner.

    Note: Before conducting these tests at the 4.5 m height, subjects 
should first do the test from heights of 1 m and 3 m to lessen the 
possibility of injury. It is suggested that subjects wear a long-sleeve 
cotton shirt to prevent abrasions when testing the device in the 
inflated condition and that the teeth should be tightly clenched 
together when jumping.


[[Page 258]]


    (f) Water emergence--(1) Equipment. A pool with a wooden platform at 
one side must be used for this test.The platform must be 300 mm (12 in.) 
above the water surface and must not float on the water. The platform 
must have a smooth painted surface. Alternatively, a Coast Guard 
approved inflatable liferaft may be used in lieu of a platform.
    (2) Qualifying. Each test subject enters the water wearing only a 
bathing suit and swims 25 m. The subject must then be able to emerge 
from the pool onto the platform using only his or her hands on the top 
of the platform as an aid and without pushing off of the bottom of the 
pool. Any subject unable to emerge onto the platform within 30 seconds 
is disqualified for this test. If less than 2/3 of the test subjects 
qualify, substitute subjects must be used.
    (3) Test. Each qualified subject dons an inflated lifejacket, enters 
the water and swims 25 m. Afterward, at least 2/3 of the qualified 
subjects must then be able to climb out of the pool in the manner 
prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section within 45 seconds while 
wearing the lifejacket. If marking on the lifejacket so indicates, and 
if the wearer can read the marking while the lifejacket is being worn, 
the subjects may deflate the device during the 45 second attempt.
    (g) Lanyard pull test and strength. (1) An uninflated lifejacket is 
placed on a rigid metal test form built according to Figure 160.176-
13(n)(2) and suspended vertically.
    (2) The inflation handle of each manual inflation mechanism is 
attached to a force indicator. The force indicator is then used to 
activate each manual inflation mechanism separately. The force required 
to activate each mechanism is recorded. In each test the force must be 
between 25 and 70 N (5 and 15 lb.).
    (3) A weight of 225 N (50 lb.) is in turn attached to the inflation 
handle of each manual inflation mechanism. The weight is then allowed to 
hang freely for 5 minutes from each manual inflation mechanism. The 
handle must not separate from the mechanism.
    (h) Temperature cycling tests. (1) Three uninflated lifejackets, 2 
packed and 1 unpacked, are maintained at room temperature (20 
<plus-minus> 3  deg.C (68 + 6  deg.F)) for 4 hours and then at a 
temperature of 65 <plus-minus> 2  deg.C (150 <plus-minus> 5  deg.F) for 
20 hours. The lifejackets are then maintained at room temperature for at 
least 4 hours, after which they are maintained at a temperature of minus 
30 <plus-minus> 2  deg.C (-22 <plus-minus> 5  deg.F) for 20 hours. This 
cycle is then repeated once.
    (2) Upon the completion of the conditioning in paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section all sealed or non-reusable packaging is removed from the 
two packed units. The lifejackets must show no functional deterioration 
after being inflated immediately after removal from the conditioning. 
The lifejackets must be inflated as follows:
    (i) One unit which was packed during conditioning must fully inflate 
within 2 minutes using only oral inflation.
    (ii) The other unit which was packed during conditioning must fully 
inflate within 45 seconds of submersion in water at 2 <plus-minus> 2 
deg.C (37 <plus-minus> 5  deg.F) as a result of automatic inflation.
    (iii) The unit which was unpacked during conditioning must fully 
inflate within 30 seconds of activation of the manual inflation 
mechanisms.
    (3) The same 3 lifejackets used for the test in paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section are deflated and, with 2 repacked and 1 unpacked, are 
maintained at room temperature for 4 hours and then at a temperature of 
minus 30 <plus-minus> 2  deg.C (-22 <plus-minus> 5  deg.F) for 20 hours. 
The lifejackets are then stored at room temperature for at least 4 
hours, after which they are maintained at a temperature of 65 
<plus-minus> 2  deg.C (150 <plus-minus> 5  deg.F) for 20 hours. This 
cycle is then repeated once. The steps in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section are then repeated, and the lifejackets must meet the criteria in 
that paragraph.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Buoyancy and inflation medium retention test. A lifejacket which 
has been used in the tests in paragraph (h) of this section must be used 
for this test.
    (1) Equipment. The following equipment is required for this test:
    (i) A wire mesh basket that is large enough to hold the inflated 
lifejacket without compressing it, is designed not to allow the 
lifejacket to float free, and is heavy enough to overcome the buoyancy 
of the lifejacket.

[[Page 259]]

    (ii) A scale that is sensitive to 14 g (0.5 oz.) and that has an 
error of less than <plus-minus>14 g (0.5 oz.).
    (iii) A test tank, filled with fresh water, that is large enough to 
hold the basket with its top 50 mm (2 in.) below the surface without the 
basket touching the tank.
    (2) Method. One inflation chamber is inflated using its automatic 
inflation mechanism. The lifejacket is placed in the basket. The basket 
is then suspended from the scale and submerged in the test tank with the 
lifejacket and basket completely below the water surface. An initial 
reading of the scale is taken after 30 minutes and again after 24 hours. 
The buoyancy of the lifejacket is the submerged weight of the basket 
minus the submerged weight of the basket with the lifejacket inside. 
This test is repeated as many times as necessary until each chamber has 
been tested. On each chamber that does not have an automatic inflation 
mechanism the manual or oral inflation mechanism may be used.
    (3) Requirement. The buoyancy of each inflation chamber must be 
within the tolerances specified in the plans and specifications for the 
lifejacket required by Sec. 160.176-5(a)(2) of this part. Each inflation 
chamber must retain at least 95% of its initial buoyancy after being 
submerged for 24 hours.
    (k) Uninflated floatation test. A packed lifejacket, with all 
automatic inflation mechanisms disabled, is dropped from a height of 1 m 
(3 ft.) into fresh water. The lifejacket must remain floating on the 
surface of the water for at least 30 minutes. This test is repeated with 
an unpacked, uninflated lifejacket, with all automatic inflation 
mechanisms disabled.
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) Environmental tests--(1) Salt spray exposure. An uninflated 
lifejacket is subjected to 720 hours of salt spray as specified by ASTM 
B 117 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.176-4). The automatic 
inflation mechanism(s) must not be activated by the salt spray. The 
lifejacket is then inflated first using the automatic inflation 
mechanism(s) and then twice more using first the manual mechanisms and 
then the oral mechanisms. The lifejacket must show no functional 
deterioration.
    (2) Rain exposure. An uninflated lifejacket is mounted on a rigid 
metal test form built according to Figure 160.176-13(n)(2). The test 
form must be vertical. Spray nozzles that deliver 0.05 mm of water per 
second (0.7 inch/hour) over the area of the lifejacket at a temperature 
between 2 and 16  deg.C (35 and 60  deg.F) and at a 45 deg. angle below 
horizontal toward the lifejacket are mounted 1.5 m (4.5 ft.) above the 
base of the test form. There must be at least 4 nozzles evenly spaced 
around the lifejacket at a horizontal distance of 1 m from the center of 
the lifejacket and each nozzle must deliver water at the same rate. 
Water is then sprayed on the lifejacket for 1 hour. The lifejacket must 
not inflate during the test.
    (n) Tensile tests. Two lifejackets that have been subjected to the 
tests in paragraph (h) of this section must be used for these tests.
    (1) Body tensile test. (i) In this test one lifejacket must be fully 
inflated and the other deflated.
    (ii) Two unconnected rigid cylinders are passed through the body 
portion of each lifejacket, or through the encircling body strap for 
yoke style devices, with one closure fastened and adjusted to its mid 
range, as shown in Figure 160.176-13(n)(1). Each cylinder must be 125 mm 
(5 inches) in diameter. The top cylinder is connected to a winch or 
pulley system. The bottom cylinder is connected to a test load which 
when combined with the weight of the lower cylinder and the linkage 
equals 325 kg (720 lb.). The winch or pulley system lifts the top 
cylinder so the test load is raised off of its support. The test load is 
left suspended for 30 minutes.
    (iii) There must be no functional deterioration of any component of 
either lifejacket during the test. Each friction type closure must not 
permit slippage of more than 25 mm (1 in.).
    (iv) If a lifejacket has friction type closures, the test must be 
repeated immediately after the lifejacket has been immersed in water for 
a least 2 minutes.
    (v) The test is repeated until each different type of closure is 
tested separately.

[[Page 260]]

    (2) Shoulder tensile test. Each shoulder section of a lifejacket is 
subjected to this test separately. A fully inflated lifejacket, with all 
closures fastened, must be secured to a rigid metal test form built 
according to Figure 160.176-13(n)(2). A 2 <plus-minus>\1/4\ in. wide web 
is passed through the shoulder section of the lifejacket and is 
connected to a winch or pulley system. The bottom portion of the form is 
connected to a dead weight load which when combined with the weight of 
the form and the linkage equals 90 kg. (200 lb.). The winch or pulley 
system is operated to raise the weight off of its support. The weight is 
left suspended for 30 minutes. There must be no functional deterioration 
of any component of the lifejacket during the test.

[[Page 261]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.025

    (3) Strength of attachment of inflation mechanism. (i) A fully 
inflated lifejacket is secured to a rigid metal test form as in Figure 
160.176-13(n)(2), and the pressure of each inflated chamber is measured. 
The top portion of the form is then connnected to a winch or pulley 
system. A 35 kg (75 lb.) weight is attached by a line to one of the 
inflation mechanisms as close as possible to the point of attachment on 
the lifejacket. The winch or pulley system is operated to raise the 
weight off of its support. The weight is left suspended for 5 minutes 
and then released. The inflation chamber to which the inflation 
mechanism is attached must not lose more than 3 kPa (0.4 psig) or 20% of 
its original pressure.
    (ii) The test is paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this section is repeated 
until each type of inflation mechanism has been tested separately.
    (iii) The test is then repeated as many additional times as 
necessary to test each joint in each type of inflation mechanism beyond 
its point of attachment to an inflation chamber. In each test the point 
of attachment must be as close as possible to the joint being tested.
    (o) [Reserved]
    (p) Impact test. (1) an uninflated lifejacket is secured to the test 
form shown in Figure 160.176-13(n)(2). The lifejacket, with the 
automatic inflation mechanism disabled, is secured to the form as it is 
intended to be worn. The lifejacket is accelerated to 25 m/s (50 mph) 
horizontally and is then dropped from a height of not more than 0.5 m 
(1.5 ft.) into the water in the following positions:
    (i) Face down, shoulder forward.
    (ii) Face down, shoulder back.
    (iii) Back down, shoulder forward.
    (iv) Back down, shoulder back.
    (v) Left side down, shoulder forward.
    (vi) Right side down, shoulder back.
    (2) Following each impact, there must be no sign of functional 
deterioration, and the lifejacket must not come off of the test form. 
After each

[[Page 262]]

impact the closures may be readjusted as necessary.
    (3) Following the six impacts, the lifejacket must fully inflate 
using only its oral inflation mechanisms.
    (4) The test in this paragraph is repeated on the same lifejacket 
after inflating, with manual inflation mechanisms, all chambers that 
have those mechanism.
    (q) Flame exposure test. A lifejacket that has been subjected to the 
tests in paragraph (h) of this section must be used for this test.
    (1) Equipment. The following equipment is required for this test:
    (i) A test pan 300 mm by 450 mm by 60 mm (12 in. by 18 in. by 2\1/2\ 
in.) containing 12 mm (\1/2\ in.) of water under 25 mm (1 in.) of N-
heptane.
    (ii) an arrangement to hold the lifejacket over the N-heptane.
    (2) Method. The test is only conducted when there is no significant 
air movement other than that caused by the fire. The N-heptane is 
ignited and allowed to burn for 30 seconds. A lifejacket which has been 
fully inflated with air is then passed through the flames in an upright, 
forward, vertical, free-hanging position with the bottom of the 
lifejacket 240 mm C 9\1/2\ in.) above the top edge of the test pan. The 
lifejacket is exposed to the flames for 2 seconds.
    (3) Requirement. The lifejacket must not burn or melt for more than 
6 seconds after being removed from the flames. The lifejacket must 
remain inflated throughout the test. If the lifejacket sustains any 
visible damage other than discoloration after being exposed to the 
flames, the lifejacket must--
    (i) pass the test in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that 
only one subject is used and the test is done six times; and
    (ii) pass the tensile test in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, 
except that a weight of 245 kg (540 lb.) is used in lieu of the 325 kg 
(720 lb.) weight.
    (r) Solvent exposure test. Lifejackets with their automatic 
inflation mechanisms disabled must be used for this test. Two uninflated 
lifejackets that have been subjected to the tests in paragraph (h) of 
this section are totally submerged in diesel fuel, grade No. 2-D as 
defined in ASTM D 975 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.176-4), 
for 24 hours. The lifejackets are then removed and the excess fuel 
removed. One lifejacket must fully inflate using only its manual 
inflation mechanisms and the other using only its oral inflation 
mechanisms. The lifejackets must show no functional deterioration as a 
result of the test.
    (s) Puncture test. A fully inflated lifejacket is placed on a flat, 
level surface. A test point 4 mm (\5/32\ in.) in diameter tapering to a 
rounded point, 1 mm (\3/64\ in.) in diameter, is pressed against an 
inflation chamber of the lifejacket perpendicular to the surface of the 
chamber at a rate of 300 mm/minute (12 in./minute). The test point is 
applied until the inflation chamber is punctured or the chamber walls 
are touching each other. The force required to puncture the inflation 
chamber or make the chamber walls touch each other is recorded. The 
force required must exceed 30 N (7 lb.).
    (t) Inflation chamber tests--(1) Over-pressure test. One lifejacket 
is used in this test. Before pressurizing the lifejacket, each over-
pressure valve, if any, must be blocked. One inflation chamber is then 
pressurized with air to 70 kPa (10 psig) and held for 5 minutes. After 
the 5 minute period, there must be no sign of permanent deformation, 
damage, or pressure loss of more than 3.5 kPa (0.5 psig). This test is 
then repeated as many times as necessary to test a different chamber 
until each chamber has been tested in this manner.
    (2) Air retention test. One inflation chamber of a lifejacket is 
filled with air until air escapes from the over-pressure valve or, if 
the lifejacket does not have an over-pressure valve, until its design 
pressure, as stated in the plans and specifications, is reached. After 
12 hours the lifejacket must still be firm with an internal pressure of 
at least 14 kPa (2.0 psig). This test is then repeated as many times as 
necessary to test a different chamber until each chamber has been tested 
in this manner.
    (u) Seam strength test. Samples of each type of structural sewn seam 
must be subjected to and pass the ``Seam Strength (Sewability) Test''

[[Page 263]]

specified in Underwriters Laboratories Standard UL 1191 except that the 
breaking strength of each seam in the directions of both greater and 
lesser thread count must be at least 400 N (90 lb.).
    (v) [Reserved]
    (w) Visual examination. One complete lifejacket must be visually 
examined for compliance with the requirements of Secs. 160.176-9 and 
160.176-11 of this part
    (x) [Reserved]
    (y) Inflation chamber properties. The tests in this paragraph must 
be run after successful completion of all other approval tests. The 
results of these tests will be used to check the quality of incoming 
lifejacket components and the production process. Test samples must come 
from one or more lifejackets that were each used in all of the tests in 
paragraphs (e), (j), (p), (s), and (t) of this section.
    (1) Grab breaking strength. The grab breaking strength of chamber 
materials must be determined according to Method No. 5100 of Federal 
Test Method Standard 191A or ASTM D 751 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 160.176-4).
    (2) Tear strength. The tear strength of chamber materials must be 
determined according to Method No. 5132 or 5134 of Federal Test Method 
Standard 191A or ASTM D 751 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 160.176-4).
    (3) Permeability. The permeability of chamber materials must be 
determined according to ASTM D 1434 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 160.176-4) using CO<INF>2</INF> as the test gas.
    (4) Seam strength. The seam strength of the seams in each inflation 
chamber of at least one lifejacket must be determined according to ASTM 
D 751 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.176-4) except that 25 by 
200 mm (1 by 8 in.) samples may be used where insufficient length of 
straight seam is available.
    (z) Additional tests. The Commandant may prescribe additional tests, 
if necessary, to approve novel or unique designs.

lifejackets produced. No lot may exceed 1000 lifejackets. A new lot must 
be started whenever any change in materials or a revision to a 
production method is made, and whenever any substantial discontinuity in 
the production process occurs. Changes in lots of component materials 
must be treated as changes in materials. Lots must be numbered serially. 
The lot number assigned, along with the approval number, must enable the 
lifejacket manufacturer, by referring to the records required by this 
subpart, to determine who produced the components used in the 
lifejacket.
    (d) Samples. (1) Samples used in testing and inspections must be 
selected at random. Sampling must be done only when all lifejackets or 
materials in the lot are available for selection.
    (2) Each sample lifejacket selected must be complete, unless 
otherwise specified in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (3) The inspector may not select the same samples tested by the 
manufacturer.
    (4) The number of samples selected per lot must be at least the 
applicable number listed in Table 160.176-15A or Table 160.176-15B.

water. The light, or lights, must begin to shine within 2 minutes after 
activation and, within 5 minutes after activation, must be seen from a 
distance of at least one nautical mile against a dark background.
    (c) At least ten sample lights must be selected at random from a 
group of at least 25. Each sample light must be kept at a constant 
temperature of 65 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2  deg.C 
(149 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4  deg.F) for 24 hours. Each sample light 
must then be kept at a constant temperature of minus 
30 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2  deg.C (minus 
22 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4  deg.F) for 24 hours. Five samples must 
then be submerged in salt water having the approximate salinity of sea 
water and the five other samples must be submerged in fresh water. The 
temperature of the water must be 15 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5  deg.C 
(59 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9  deg.F). The lights must then be 
activated and left submerged for eight hours. However, if their power 
sources need a supply of air to operate, the lights may be brought to 
their normal operating positions at the surface of the water for up to 
10 seconds per minute during the eight hour period. At least nine of the 
ten lights must operate continuously over the eight hour period. If the 
lights are flashing lights, at least nine of ten must have a flash rate 
of between 50 and 70 flashes per minute when first activated or within 
five minutes thereafter.
    (d) Individual tests must be conducted on a sample light to 
determine whether the light meets the requirements of Sec. 161.012-7, 
except that technical data showing compliance with Sec. 160.012-7(c) may 
be submitted with the application for approval in lieu of performing an 
individual test.


<R05>
Sec. 161.012-13  Production tests and inspections.

    (a) The manufacturer of approved lights must randomly select a 
sample of ten lights from each lot of lights produced. Each lot must not 
exceed 1,000 lights. At least nine of the ten lights, when tested in 
accordance with the test described in Sec. 161.012-11(c), must meet the 
test criteria prescribed by that section. If less than nine lights meet 
the test criteria, another random sample of ten lights must be taken and 
tested. If less than nine of these lights meet the test criteria, none 
of the lights in the lot may be sold as Coast Guard approved equipment.
    (b) The Coast Guard does not inspect lights approved under this 
subpart on a regular schedule. However, the Commandant may select 
samples and conduct tests and examinations whenever necessary to 
determine whether the lights are being manufactured in compliance with 
the requirements in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 161.012-15  Markings.

    (a) Each light manufactured under Coast Guard approval must be 
permanently and legibly marked with:
    (1) The manufacturer's name or trade mark that clearly identifies 
the model designation;
    (2) The Coast Guard approval number asssigned to light; and
    (3) Instructions on how to activate the light.
    (b) The power source of each light must be permanently and legibly 
marked with its date of manufacture and expiration date. Each date must 
include the month and year.

[[Page 283]]


<R05>
Sec. 161.012-17  Instructions.

    (a) Each light must have instructions on how to attach it to a PFD 
in a manner that complies with Sec. 161.012-7(a). However, in the case 
of lights that are to be attached by a PFD manufacturer, only one set of 
instructions need be provided for each shipment of lights.
    (b) If a light is designed to be attached to a finished PFD, any 
attachment materials that are not supplied with the light must be 
clearly identified in the instructions. If a light is to be attached to 
a finished PFD by a PFD purchaser, any attachment materials not supplied 
with the light must be generally available for purchase.
    (c) Each set of instructions must--(1) Clearly identify the kind of 
PFD construction (for example fabric covered or vinyl dipped) to which 
the light can be attached; and
    (2) Not require penetration of the bouyant material of the PFD.

<R05>
Sec. 162.017-3  Materials, construction, and workmanship.

    (a) The valves shall be of substantial construction and first class 
workmanship and shall be free from imperfections which may affect its 
serviceability.
    (b) Bodies of pressure-vacuum relief valves must be made of bronze 
or such corrosion-resistant material as may be approved by the 
Commandant (G-MSE).
    (c) Valve discs, spindles, and seats shall be made of bronze or such 
corrosion--resistant material as may be approved by the Commandant.
    (d) Where springs are employed to actuate the valve discs, the 
springs shall be made of corrosion-resistant material. Springs plated 
with corrosion-resistant material are not acceptable.
    (e) Flame screens shall be made of corrosion-resistant wire.
    (f) Nonmetallic materials will not be permitted in the construction 
of the valves, except bushings used in way of moving parts and gaskets 
may be made of nonmetallic material resistant to

[[Page 286]]

attack by the product carried. Nonmetallic diaphragms will be allowed 
where diaphragm failure will not result in unrestricted flow of cargo 
vapors to the atmosphere nor in an increase in the pressure or vacuum at 
which the valve normally releases.
    (g) The design and construction of the valves shall permit 
overhauling and repairs without removal from the line.
    (h) Valve discs shall be guided by a ribbed cage or other suitable 
means to prevent binding, and to insure proper seating. Where valve 
stems are guided by bushings suitably designed to prevent binding and to 
insure proper seating, the valves need not be fitted with ribbed cages.
    (i) The disc shall close tight against the valve seat by metal to 
metal contact, however, resilient seating seals may be provided if the 
design is such that the disc closes tight against the seat in case the 
seals are destroyed or in case they carry away.
    (j) Pressure-vacuum relief valves for venting cargo tanks shall be 
of not less than 2\1/2\ inches nominal pipe size.
    (k) Bodies of valves shall be designed to withstand a hydrostatic 
pressure of at least 125 pounds per square inch without rupturing or 
showing permanent distortion.
    (l) The valve discs may be solid or made hollow so that weight 
material may be added to vary the lifting pressure. If hollow discs are 
employed, a watertight bolted cover shall be fitted to encase the weight 
material. The pressure at which the discs open shall not exceed 120 
percent of the set pressure.
    (m) The free area through the valve seats at maximum lift shall not 
be less than the cross-sectional area of the valve inlet connection.
    (n) Double flame screens of 20 x 20 corrosion-resistant wire mesh 
with a \1/2\-inch corrosion-resistant separator on a single screen of 
30 x 30 corrosion-resistant wire mesh shall be fitted on all openings to 
atmosphere. The net free area through the flame screens shall not be 
less than 1\1/2\ times the cross-sectional area of the vent inlet from 
the cargo tanks.
    (o) Valve bodies may have screwed or flanged pipe connections, or 
such types of connections as may be approved by the Commandant. If 
flanged, the thickness and drilling shall comply with USA standards for 
150-pound bronze flanged fittings.
    (p) Where design of valve does not permit complete drainage of 
condensate to attached cargo tank or vent line, the valve body shall be 
fitted with a plugged drain opening on the side of the atmospheric 
outlet of not less than \1/2\ inch pipe size.
    (q) Relief pressure adjusting mechanisms shall be permanently 
secured by means of lockwires, locknuts, or other acceptable means.

<R05>
Sec. 162.028-3  Requirements.

    (a) General. Every portable fire extinguisher shall conform to the 
requirements for listing and labeling by a recognized laboratory, and 
shall be of such design, materials, and construction as to meet the 
requirements specified in this section.
    (b) Design and weight. Every portable fire extinguisher shall be 
self-contained, i.e., when charged it shall not require any additional 
source of extinguishing agent or expellant energy for its operation 
during the time it is being discharged, and it shall weigh not more than 
55 pounds, maximum, when fully charged.
    (c) Materials. Materials used for exposed working parts shall be 
corrosion-resistant to salt water and spray. Materials used for other 
exposed parts shall be either corrosion-resistant or shall be protected 
by a suitable corrosion-resistant coating.
    (1) Corrosion-resistant materials. The materials which are 
considered to be corrosion-resistant are copper, brass, bronze, certain 
copper-nickel alloys, certain alloys of aluminum, certain plastics, and 
certain stainless steels.
    (2) Corrosion-resistant coatings. (i) The following systems of 
organic or metallic coatings for exposed non-working ferrous parts, when 
applied on properly prepared surfaces after all cutting, forming, and 
bending operations are completed, are considered to provide suitable 
corrosion resistance:
    (a) Bonderizing, followed by the application of zinc chromate 
primer, followed by one or more applications of enamel; or,
    (b) Hot-dipped or electrodeposited zinc in thicknesses not less than 
0.002 inch; or,
    (c) Electrodeposited cadmium in thicknesses not less than 0.001 
inch; or,
    (d) Hot-dipped or sprayed aluminum in thicknesses not less than 
0.002 inch; or,
    (e) Copper plus nickel in total thicknesses not less than 0.003 
inch, of which the nickel is not less than 0.002 inch, plus any 
thickness of chrome.

[[Page 291]]

    (ii) The metallic platings of less than the thicknesses specified in 
this paragraph are not acceptable for the protection against corrosion 
of ferrous parts.
    (3) Decorative platings. Decorative platings in any thicknesses 
applied over corrosion-resistant materials and corrosion-resistant 
coatings are acceptable for either working or non-working parts.
    (4) Dissimilar metals. The use of dissimilar metals in combination 
shall be avoided wherever possible, but when such contacts are 
necessary, provisions (such as bushings, gaskets, or o-rings) shall be 
employed to prevent such deleterious effects as galvanic corrosion, 
freezing or buckling of parts, and loosening or tightening of joints due 
to differences in thermal expansion.
    (5) Suitability of materials. All extinguishers submitted for 
approval shall undergo the salt spray test in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(6) of this section.
    (6) Salt spray tests. Expose the complete fully charged specimen 
extinguisher to a 20 percent sodium chloride solution spray at a 
temperature of 95  deg.F. (35  deg.C.) for a period of 240 hours. The 
procedures and apparatus described in Method 811 of Federal Test Method 
Standard No. 151 are suitable. Alternate methods may be found 
satisfactory if the results are comparable. Following the test, allow 
the specimen extinguisher to air dry for a period of 48 hours. Following 
the air drying--
    (i) The extinguisher must be capable of being operated and recharged 
in a normal fashion;
    (ii) Any coating required in this section to be corrosion resistant 
must remain intact and must not be removable (when such removal exposes 
a material subject to corrosion) by such action as washing or rubbing 
with a thumb or fingernail;
    (iii) No galvanic corrosion may appear at the points of contact or 
close proximity of dissimilar metals;
    (iv) The extinguisher and its bracket, if any, must not show any 
corrosion, except corrosion that can be easily wiped off after rinsing 
with tap water, on surfaces having no protective coating or paint; and,
    (v) The gauge on a stored pressure extinguisher must remain 
watertight throughout the test.
    (d) Bursting pressure. For all extinguishers except the carbon 
dioxide type, the hydrostatic bursting pressure of the extinguisher and 
component parts which are subjected to pressure, exclusive of the hose, 
shall be at least five times the maximum working pressure during 
discharge of the extinguisher at approximately 70  deg.F. During this 
test, a pressure gauge if fitted will usually be removed to avoid 
breaking the indicating mechanism, but the gauge shall be capable of 
withstanding the same test without leaking.
    (e) Vibration resistance. The complete, fully charged specimen 
extinguisher, secured in its bracket which is mounted to the test 
machine, shall be tested in accordance with sections 3.1 through 3.1.4.4 
of Military Standard MIL-STD-167. Following this test, there shall be no 
obvious failures of parts or assemblies, and the specimen shall be 
capable of being operated satisfactorily without undue effort or special 
procedures on the part of the operator, and the specimen shall be 
capable of being recharged satisfactorily in accordance with the 
directions on the name plate without the use of extraordinary tools or 
procedures.
    (f) Additional marking. (1) As part of the usual name plate marking, 
there shall be included the rated capacity of the extinguisher in 
gallons, quarts, or pounds, and complete instructions for recharging, 
including the identification of the recharge materials and of the 
pressure cartridge or separate container if one is used.
    (2) For extinguishers which are not ordinarily discharged or opened 
during the regular maintenance inspections and tests, the weight of the 
fully charged extinguisher shall be die-stamped, embossed, or cast in a 
conspicuous location on the name plate, valve body, or shell of the 
extinguisher.
    (3) Pasted-on type paper or decalcomania labels are not acceptable 
for any of the required extinguisher markings.
    (4) For stored pressure type or cartridge operated type water or 
antifreeze portable fire extinguishers, each extinguisher name plate 
shall be

[[Page 292]]

marked to indicate whether the extinguisher is to be filled with plain 
water or with anti-freeze solution. Combination type name plates showing 
the charge may be either plain water or antifreeze solution will not be 
permitted.
    (5) Recharge packages shall be legibly marked with the name of the 
recharge and the capacity of contents in gallons, quarts, or pounds, in 
addition to the usual recharge package marking. Recharge pressure 
cartridges shall, in addition to the usual marking, also be plainly 
marked to show the distinctive identifying designation of the cartridge.
    (g) Mounting bracket. Every portable fire extinguisher shall be 
supplied with a suitable bracket which will hold the extinguisher 
securely in its stowage location on vessels or boats, and which is 
arranged to provide quick and positive release of the extinguisher for 
immediate use.
    (h) Carbon dioxide type. Every carbon dioxide type extinguisher 
shall be fitted with a valve which will withstand a minimum bursting 
pressure of 6,000 p.s.i., and a discharge hose or tube which will 
withstand a minimum bursting pressure of 5,000 p.s.i. The hose shall be 
constructed with either a wire braid or other conducting material for 
conducting static charges occurring at the discharge nozzle back to the 
body of the extinguisher.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Dry chemical type. (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Every dry chemical stored pressure type portable fire 
extinguisher, i.e., one which employs a single chamber for both the dry 
chemical and expellant gas, shall be fitted with a pressure gauge or 
device to show visual indication of whether or not the pressure in the 
chamber is in the operating range.
    (k) Toxic extinguishing agents. Every portable fire extinguisher 
shall contain only agents which qualify for the Underwriters' 
Laboratories, Inc., toxicity rating of Group 5 or Group 6, and which in 
normal fire extinguishing use do not generate decomposition products in 
concentrations hazardous to life.
    (l) Gauge. Every pressure gauge used on a portable fire extinguisher 
shall have an accuracy of at least 2 percent of the scale range for the 
middle half of the scale conforming to ASME Grade B commercial accuracy. 
The gauge when new shall be watertight, i.e., with the connection capped 
or plugged, no water shall penetrate to the interior of the case during 
submergence one foot below the surface of water for a period of two 
hours. The gauge shall be constructed of corrosion-resistant materials, 
so that the pointer or face lettering will not be obliterated by the 
action of salt water if some leakage should occur after rough handling 
or extended periods of service. The gauge, when attached to the fire 
extinguisher, shall pass the salt spray and vibration tests prescribed 
by Sec. 162.028-3 (c)(1) and (e).
    (m) Fire tests. In addition to the usual fire tests conducted to 
determine the suitability and adequacy of portable fire extinguishers, 
additional fire tests, such as those described in National Bureau of 
Standards Building Materials and Structures Report 150, issued June 14, 
1957, may be employed in determining the suitability for ``marine type'' 
listing and labeling.
    (n) Additional tests. Every portable extinguisher may be 
additionally examined and tested to establish its reliability and 
effectiveness in accordance with the intent of this specification for a 
``marine type'' portable fire extinguisher when considered necessary by 
the Coast Guard or by the recognized laboratory.

    (b) Design. Every semiportable extinguisher shall be fitted with 
hose of sufficient length to a nozzle or nozzles to provide for suitable 
application of the extinguishing agent to any part of the space 
protected (a length of pipe may connect the outlet of the supply to the 
hose connection); shall weigh more than 55 pounds when fully charged; 
shall be self-contained, i.e., when charged, it shall not require any 
additional source of extinguishing agent or expellent energy for its 
operation; and shall provide simple means for immediate operation by a 
single operator. The design, materials and construction shall provide 
reliability of operation and performance after non-use for long periods 
under conditions encountered in marine service.
    (c) Materials. Materials used for exposed working parts, except 
those used for inversion mechanism or similar purposes, shall be 
corrosion-resistant to salt water and spray. Materials used

[[Page 295]]

for other exposed parts shall be either corrsion-resistant or shall be 
protected by a suitable corrosion-resistant coating.
    (1) Corrosion-resistant materials. The materials which are 
considered to be corrosion-resistant are copper, brass, bronze, certain 
copper-nickel alloys, certain alloys of aluminum, certain plastics, and 
certain stainless steels.
    (2) Corrosion-resistant coatings. (i) The following systems of 
organic or metallic coatings for exposed nonworking ferrous parts except 
for ICC cylinders, when applied on properly prepared surfaces after all 
cutting, forming, and bending operations are completed, are considered 
to provide suitable corrosion resistance:
    (a) Bonderizing, followed by the application of zinc chromate 
primer, followed by one or more applications of enamel; or,
    (b) Inorganic zinc coatings; or,
    (c) Hot-dipped or electrodeposited zinc in thicknesses not less than 
0.002 inch; or,
    (d) Electrodeposited Cadmium in thicknesses not less than 0.001 
inch; or,
    (e) Hot-dipped or sprayed aluminum in thicknesses not less than 
0.002 inch; or,
    (f) Copper plus nickel in total thicknesses not less than 0.003 
inch, or which the nickel is not less than 0.002 inch, plus any 
thickness of chrome.
    (ii) The metallic platings of less than the thicknesses specified in 
this paragraph are not acceptable for the protection against corrosion 
of ferrous parts.
    (3) Decorative platings. Decorative platings in any thicknesses 
applied over corrosion-resistant materials and corrosion-resistant 
coatings are acceptable for either working or nonworking parts.
    (4) Dissimilar metals. The use of dissimilar metals in combination 
shall be avoided wherever possible, but when such contacts are 
necessary, provisions (such as bushings, gaskets, or o-rings) shall be 
employed to prevent such deleterious effects as galvanic corrosion, 
freezing or buckling of parts, and loosening or tightening of joints due 
to differences in thermal expansion.
    (5) Suitability of materials. In event of question as to the 
suitability of the materials (including coatings) used, the salt spray 
test described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section shall be conducted.
    (6) Salt spray test. Expose either component parts, subassemblies, 
or the complete fully charged specimen extinguisher to a 20 percent 
sodium-chloride solution spray at a temperature of 95  deg.F. (35 
deg.C.) for a period of 240 hours. The procedures and apparatus 
described in Method 811 of Federal Test Method Standard No. 151 are 
suitable. Alternate methods may be found satisfactory if the results are 
comparable. Following the test, allow the specimen extinguisher to air 
dry for a period of 48 hours. Following the air drying, the specimen 
extinguisher shall be capable of being operated satisfactorily without 
undue effort or special procedures on the part of the operator, and it 
shall be capable of being recharged satisfactorily in accordance with 
the directions on the nameplate without the use of extraordinary tools 
or procedures.
    (d) Gauges. Every pressure gauge used on a semiportable fire 
extinguisher shall have an accuracy of at least 2 percent of the scale 
range for the middle half of the scale conforming to ASME Grade B 
commercial accuracy. The gauge when new shall be watertight, i.e., with 
the connection capped or plugged, no water shall penetrate to the 
interior of the case during submergence 1 foot below the surface of 
water for a period of 2 hours. The gauge shall be constructed of 
corrosion-resistant materials, so that the pointer or face lettering 
will not be obliterated by the action of salt water if some leakage 
should occur after rough handling or extended periods of service. The 
gage, when attached to the extinguisher, shall pass the salt spray and 
vibration tests prescribed by paragraphs (c)(6) and (e) of this section.
    (e) Vibration resistance. Either component parts, subassemblies, or 
the complete, fully charged specimen extinguisher, shall be tested in 
accordance with sections 3.1 through 3.1.4.4 of Military Standard MIL-
STD-167. Following this test, there shall be no obvious failures of 
parts or assemblies, and they

[[Page 296]]

shall be capable of being operated satisfactorily without undue effort 
or special procedures on the part of the operator, and the extinguisher 
shall be capable of being recharged satisfactorily in accordance with 
the directions on the name plate without the use of extraordinary tools 
or procedures.
    (f) Carbon dioxide type. Every carbon dioxide type extinguisher 
shall be fitted with a valve which will withstand a minimum bursting 
pressure of 6,000 p.s.i., and a discharge hose or tube which will 
withstand a minimum bursting pressure of 5,000 p.s.i. The hose shall be 
constructed with either a wire braid or other conducting material for 
conducting static charges occurring at the discharge nozzle back to the 
body of the extinguisher.
    (g) Chemical-foam type. Every chemical foam type semiportable fire 
extinguisher shall have a nozzle which will provide operating 
characteristics such that when it is held about 3 feet above the ground 
at an elevation of approximately 30 deg., and with the extinguisher and 
contents both at approximately 70  deg.F. and 120  deg.F., the range of 
the stream shall not exceed 40 feet, and the major portion of the 
discharge shall fall between 20 and 40 feet, measured horizontally, from 
the nozzle. The duration of the effective discharge shall be between 2.5 
and 4.0 minutes, effective discharge being considered as occurring while 
the major portion of the discharge falls beyond 10 feet, measured 
horizontally, from the nozzle.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) Toxic extinguishing agents. Every semiportable fire extinguisher 
shall contain only agents which qualify for the Underwriters' 
Laboratories, Inc., toxicity rating of Group 5 or Group 6, and which in 
normal fire extinguishing use do not generate decomposition products in 
concentrations hazardous to life. Acceptance of extinguishing agents 
under these requirements will be determined by the Coast Guard.
    (j) Fire tests. Fire tests may be employed in determining the 
suitability for ``marine type'' listing and labeling.
    (k) Additional tests. Every semiportable extinguisher may be 
additionally examined and tested to establish its reliability and 
effectiveness in accordance with the intent of this specification for a 
``marine type'' semiportable fire extinguisher when considered necessary 
by the Coast Guard or by the recognized laboratory.

there shall be included the rated capacity of the extinguisher in 
gallons, quarts, or pounds, and complete instructions for recharging, 
including the identification of the recharge materials and of the 
pressure containing cylinder or separate container if one is used.
    (2) Pasted-on type paper or decalcomania labels are not acceptable 
for any of the required extinguisher marking.
    (3) Recharge packages shall be legibly marked with the name of the 
recharge and the capacity of contents in gallons, quarts, or pounds in 
addition to the usual recharge package marking. Recharge pressure 
containing cylinders shall, in addition to the usual marking, also be 
plainly marked to show the distinctive identifying designation of the 
cylinder.
    (m) Securing means. Every semi-portable fire extinguisher shall be 
supplied with a suitable means for holding the extinguisher securely in 
its stowage location on vessels or boats. The materials shall be 
sufficiently corrosion-resistant or protected against corrosion to 
withstand the test prescribed by paragraph (c)(6) of this section 
without showing more than traces of slight corrosion, which may be 
easily wiped off after rinsing with tapwater.

<R05>
Sec. 162.050-23  Separator: Approval tests.

    (a) Test Conditions. (1) Each test described in this section must be 
performed at a throughput and influent pressure equal to the maximum 
throughput and pressure at which the separator being tested is designed 
to operate. The tests and each of the steps in the tests must be carried 
out in the order described in this section. Each test must be performed 
without time delay between steps in the test.
    (2) Except as provided in Test No. 6S, the influent oil used in each 
test must be a heavy fuel oil that has a relative density of 
approximately 0.94 at 15  deg.C and a viscosity of at least 220 
centistokes (approximately 900 seconds Redwood No. 1) at 37.8  deg.C.
    (3) A test rig of the type described in Sec. 162.050-17 must be used 
in performing each test.
    (4) If a separator has a supply pump, it must be tested using that 
pump. If a separator does not have a supply pump, it must be tested 
using the mixture pump on the test rig.
    (5) The influent water used in each test must be clean fresh water 
or clean fresh water in solution with sodium chloride. The water or 
solution must have a relative density at 15  deg.C that is equal to or 
less than 0.085 plus the relative density of the heavy fuel oil used in 
the tests.
    (6) Each test must be conducted at an ambient temperature of between 
10  deg.C and 30  deg.C.
    (7) The oil content of each sample must be measured using the method 
described in Sec. 162.050-39.
    (8) Influent oil content must be determined during testing by 
measuring the flow rates of the oil and water that are mixed to form the 
influent or by use of an oil content meter on the inlet piping of the 
test rig. If an oil content meter is used, a sample of influent and a 
meter reading must be taken at the beginning of each test. If the meter 
reading is not within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 percent of the oil content 
of the sample, the meter readings subsequently taken during the test are 
unacceptable test results.
    (9) When collecting a sample at a sample point that has a stop cock, 
the first minute of fluid flow through the stop cock must not be 
included in the sample collected.
    (10) In each test, the separator must be operated in accordance with 
the procedures described in its instruction manual.
    (11) No maintenance, including replacement of parts, may be 
performed on a separator during or between the tests described in this 
section.
    (12) A one (1) liter sample of each oil to be used in testing must 
be taken and provided for use in the sample analysis required by 
Sec. 162.050-39 .
    (13) The separator may not be operated manually in Test No. 5S.
    (b) Test No. 1S. The separator is filled with water and started. It 
is fed with oil for at least five (5) minutes and then with an oil-water 
influent containing an oil content of between 5,000 and 10,000 p.p.m. 
until a steady flow rate occurs. After the flow rate is steady, the 
influent is fed to the separator for thirty (30) minutes. Samples of 
separated water effluent are taken after the first ten (10) and twenty 
(20) minutes. At the end of the thirty (30) minute period, the air cock 
on the test rig is opened and, if necessary, the oil and water supply 
valves are closed to stop the flow of influent. A sample is then taken 
of the separated water effluent as the effluent flow ceases.

[[Page 308]]

    (c) Test No. 2S. Test No. 1S is repeated using an influent 
containing approximately 25 percent oil and 75 percent water.
    (d) Test No. 3S. The separator is fed with oil until oil is 
discharged at the oil discharge outlet of the separator at essentially 
the same rate that oil is being fed to the separator. The separator is 
then fed with oil for five (5) additional minutes. If any oily mixture 
is discharged from the separated water outlet on the separator during 
the test, that observation is recorded.
    (e) Test No. 4S. The separator is fed with water for fifteen (15) 
minutes. Samples of the separated water effluent are taken at the 
beginning of the test and after the first ten (10) minutes.
    (f) Test No. 5S. The separator is operated automatically for three 
(3) hours. During the test, the separator is continuously fed with an 
influent varying from water to a mixture of 25 percent oil in water and 
back to water every fifteen (15) minutes. The oil concentration in the 
influent is varied in at least five (5) equal increments during each 
fifteen (15) minute period and the time intervals between the 
incremental changes are equal. During the last hour, the separator must 
be inclined at an angle of 22.5 deg. with the plane of its normal 
operating position. During the last time increment in which the unit is 
fed a 25 percent oil mixture, a sample of the separated water effluent 
is taken. If the separator stops at any time during this test, that 
observation is recorded.
    (g) Test No. 6S. Tests No. 1S and No. 2S are repeated using, in lieu 
of a heavy fuel oil in the influent, a light distillate fuel oil having 
a relative density of approximately 0.83 at 15  deg.C.

    (b) Each monitor must be designed so that it is calibrated by a 
means that does not involve manually mixing a known quantity of oil and 
a known quantity of water to form a mixture and manually feeding the 
mixture into the monitor.
    (c) The electrical components of a monitor that are to be installed 
in an explosive atmosphere must be approved by an independent laboratory 
as components that Underwriters Laboratories Standard 913 (dated April 
8, 1976) defines as intrinsically safe for use in a Class I, Group D 
hazardous location.
    (d) Each monitor component that is a moving part must be designed so 
that its movement during operation of the monitor does not cause 
formation of static electricity.
    (e) A monitor must be designed to operate in each plane that forms 
an angle of 22.5 deg. with the plane of its normal operating position.
    (f) Each monitor must be designed in accordance with the applicable 
requirements contained in subchapters F and J of this chapter.
    (g) Each monitor must be designed so that it records each change in 
oil content of the mixture it is measuring within twenty (20) seconds 
after the change occurs.
    (h) Each monitor must have a device that produces a warning signal 
and a signal that can be used to actuate valves in a vessel's fixed 
piping system, when--
    (1) The oil content of the mixture being measured exceeds the 
concentration limit set by the operator of the monitor; and
    (2) Malfunction, breakdown, or other failure of the monitor occurs.
    (i) Each monitor must have a means to determine whether it is 
accurately calibrated.

    (8) Unless otherwise provided in a specific test, each test must be 
performed at the maximum mixture pressure, the maximum flow rate, and 
the power supply ratings at which the monitor is designed to operate.
    (9) The particulate contaminant described in Table 162.050-27(g) 
must be of a type that does not lose more than three (3) percent of its 
weight after ignition and must be insoluble in a 500 p.p.m. mixture.
    (10) In each test the monitor must be operated in accordance with 
the procedures described in its instructions manual.
    (11) Unless otherwise provided in a specific test, the centrifugal 
pump shown in Figure 162.050-19 must be operated at one thousand (1,000) 
revolutions per minute or more in each test.
    (12) Whenever the oil content of a mixture is recorded, a sample of 
the mixture must also be taken. The oil content of the sample must be 
measured using the method described in Sec. 162.050-39.
    (13) A one (1) liter sample of each oil to be used in testing must 
be taken and provided for use in the sample analysis required by 
Sec. 162.050-39.
    (c) Test No. 1CM. The cargo monitor is calibrated and zeroed. It is 
then fed with water for 15 minutes and then with mixtures in the 
following concentrations: 15 p.p.m., 50 p.p.m., 100 p.p.m., and each 
additional concentration, in increments of 50 p.p.m. up to the highest 
oil concentration that can be read on the monitor. Each mixture is fed 
to the monitor in the order listed for fifteen (15) minutes. Water is 
fed to the monitor for a (15) minute period between each mixture. At the 
end of each (15) minute period, an oil content reading is obtained and 
recorded.
    (d) Test No. 2CM. (1) If the cargo monitor is designed for use with 
crude oils, it is fed with a mixture of water and the first oil listed

p.p.m., and a concentration that is ninety (90) percent of the highest 
oil concentration in water that can be read on the monitor. Each 
concentration is fed to the monitor in the order listed until a steady 
reading occurs and is recorded. After each steady reading is recorded, 
the monitor is fed with water for fifteen (15) minutes. At the end of 
each fifteen (15) minute period of feeding the monitor with water, an 
oil content reading is again obtained and recorded.
    (2) The steps described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are 
repeating using each of the other oils listed in Table 162.050-27(d).

    (a) Scope. This section describes the method and apparatus to be 
used in measuring the oil content of a sample taken in approval testing 
of each separator, monitor, or alarm. Light oil fractions in the sample, 
with the exception of volatile components lost during extractions, are 
included in each measurement.
    (b) Summary of method. Each sample is acidified to a low pH and 
extracted with two volumes of solvent. The oil content of the sample is 
determined by comparison of the infrared absorbance of the sample 
extract against the absorbance of known concentrations of a reference 
oil in solvent.
    (c) Apparatus. The following apparatus is used in each measurement:
    (1) Separatory funnel that is 1000 ml. or more in volume and that 
has a Teflon stopcock.
    (2) Infrared spectrophotometer.
    (3) A cell of 5 mm. pathlength that has sodium chloride or infrared 
grade quartz with a minimum of 80 percent transmittance at 2930 
cm<SUP>-1.</SUP> (This cell should be used if the oil content of the 
sample to be measured is expected to have a concentration of between 2 
p.p.m. and 80 p.p.m.)
    (4) A cell of pathlength longer than 5 mm. that has sodium chloride 
or infrared grade quartz with a minimum of 80 percent transmittance at 
2930 cm<SUP>-1.</SUP> (This cell should be used if the oil content of 
the sample to be measured is expected to have a concentration of between 
0.1 p.p.m. and 2 p.p.m.)
    (5) Medium grade filter paper.
    (6) 100 ml. glass stoppered volumetric flasks.
    (d) Reagents. The following regaents are used in each measurement:
    (1) Hydrochloric acid prepared by mixing equal amounts of 
concentrated, reagent grade hydrochloric acid and distilled water.
    (2) Reagent grade sodium chloride.
    (3) One of the following solvents:
    (i) Spectrographic grade carbon tetrachloride.
    (ii) Reagent grade Freon 113, except that this solvent may not be 
used to analyze samples in approval testing of cargo monitors. (Ucon 
113, Genatron 113, or an equivalent fluorocarbon solvent are also 
acceptable.)
    (4) Reference oil, which is the oil used in the portion of the test 
during which the sample is collected.
    (5) Stock reference standard prepared by weighing 0.30 g. of 
reference oil in a tared 100 ml. volumetric flask and diluting to 100 
ml. volume with solvent.
    (e) Preparation of calibration standards. A series of dilutions is 
prepared by pipetting volumes of stock reference standard into 100 ml. 
volumetric flasks and diluting to volume with solvent. A convenient 
series of volumes of the stock reference standard is 5, 10, 15, 20, and 
25 ml. The exact concentrations of the dilutions in milligrams of oil 
per 100 milliliters of diluted stock reference standard are calculated. 
The calibration standards are the dilutions.
    (f) Extraction. (1) A reagent blank is carried through each step 
described in this paragraph and paragraph (g) of this section.
    (2) The pH of each sample is checked by dipping a glass rod into the 
sample and touching the rod with pH-sensitive paper to ensure that the 
pH is 2 or lower. More acid is added if necessary until the pH is 2 or 
lower. The glass rod is then rinsed in the sample bottle with solvent.
    (3) The sample is poured into a separatory funnel and 5 g. of sodium 
chloride are added.
    (4) Fifty (50) ml. of solvent are added to the sample bottle. The 
bottle is capped tightly and shaken thoroughly to rinse its inside. The 
contents of the bottle are then transferred to the separatory funnel 
containing the sample and extracted by shaking vigorously for 2 minutes. 
The layers are allowed to separate.
    (5) The solvent layer is drained through a funnel containing solvent 
moistened filter paper into a 100 ml. volumetric flask.
    (6) Fifty (50) ml. of solvent are added to the sample bottle. The 
bottle is capped tightly and shaken thoroughly to rinse its inside 
surface. The contents of the bottle are then transferred to the 
separatory funnel containing the water layer of the sample. The contents 
of the separatory funnel are then extracted by shaking vigorously for 2

[[Page 317]]

minutes. The layers are allowed to separate. The solvent layer is then 
drained through a funnel containing solvent moistened filter paper into 
the volumetric flask containing the solvent layer of the sample.
    (7) The tips of the separatory funnel, filter paper, and funnel are 
rinsed with small portions of solvent and the rinsings are collected in 
the volumetric flask containing the solvent layer of the sample. The 
volume is adjusted with solvent up to 100 ml. The flask is then 
stoppered and its contents are thoroughly mixed.
    (8) The water layer remaining in the separatory funnel is drained 
into a 1000 ml. graduated cylinder and the water volume estimated to the 
nearest 5 ml.
    (g) Infrared spectroscopy. (1) The infrared spectrophotometer is 
prepared according to manufacturer instructions.
    (2) A cell is rinsed with two volumes of the solvent layer contained 
in the volumetric flask. The cell is then completely filled with the 
solvent layer. A matched cell containing solvent is placed in the 
reference beam.
    (3) If a scanning spectrophotometer is used, the solvent layer in 
the cell and the calibration standards are scanned from 3200 
cm<SUP>-1</SUP>to 2700 cm-1. If a single beam or non-scanning 
spectrophotometer is used, the manufacturer's instructions are followed 
and the absorbance is measured at or near 2930 cm-1.
    (4) If the scan is recorded on absorbance paper, a straight baseline 
of the type described in Figure 162.050-39(g) is constructed. To obtain 
the net absorbance, the absorbance of the baseline at 2930 
cm<SUP>-1</SUP>is subtracted from the absorbance of the maximum peak on 
the curve at 2930 cm-1.
    (5) If the scan is recorded on transmittance paper, a straight 
baseline is constructed on the hydrocarbon band plotted on the paper. 
The net absorbance is:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.030

    (6) A plot is prepared for net absorbance vs. oil content of the 
calibration standards or of the percentages of stock reference standard 
contained in the calibration standards.

[[Page 318]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.031

    (7) If the net absorbance of a sample determined by the calibration 
plot exceeds 0.8 or the linear range of the spectrophotometer, a 
dilution of the solvent layer contained in the volumetric flask after 
completing the step

[[Page 319]]

described in paragraph (f)(7) of this section is prepared by the 
pipetting an appropriate volume of the solvent layer into a second 
volumetric flask and diluting to volume with solvent. If the net 
absorbance is less than 0.1 when determined in accordance with the 
procedures in this paragraph, it is recalculated using a longer 
pathlength cell.
    (h) Calculations. (1) The plot described in paragraph (g)(6) of this 
section is used to determine the milligrams of oil in each 100 ml. of 
solvent layer contained in the volumetric flask after completing the 
steps described in paragraph (f) or paragraph (g)(7) of this section.
    (2) The oil content of the sample is calculated using the following 
formula:

oil content of sample=R x D x 1000/V

R = mg. of oil in 100 ml. of solvent layer determined from plot.
D = 1 or, if the step described in paragraph (g)(7) of this section is 
performed, the ratio of the volume of the second volumetric flask 
described in that paragraph to the volume of solvent layer pipetted into 
the second volumetric flask.
V = The volume of water in milliliters drained into the graduated 
cylinder at the step described in paragraph (f)(8) of this section.

    (3) The results are reported to two significant figures for oil 
contents below 100 mg/l and to three significant figures for oil 
contents above 100 mg/l. The results are converted to p.p.m.

Sec. 163.002-21  Approval tests.

    (a) General. If a pilot hoist fails one of the tests in this section 
the cause of the failure must be identified and any needed design 
changes made. After a test failure and any design change, the failed 
test, and any other previously completed tests affected by the change, 
must be rerun.
    (b) Visual examination. Before starting the tests described in this 
section an assembled pilot hoist is examined for evidence of 
noncompliance with the requirements in Secs. 163.002-11 and 163.002-13.
    (c) The following approval tests must be conducted:
    (1) Rung strength. If the pilot hoist has a rigid ladder a static 
load of 900 kilograms (2000 pounds) is applied to the center of a ladder 
rung for one minute. The load must be uniformly distributed over a 100 
millimeter (4 inch) wide contact surface. The test must be repeated 
using a second ladder rung. The rungs must not break or crack during 
these tests.
    (2) Platform strength. If the pilot hoist has a lift platform, the 
platform is lifted to a level where it is supported only by its 
suspension components. A static load of 900 kilograms (2000 pounds) is 
then applied to the center of the platform for one minute. The load must 
be uniformly distributed over a 100 millimeter (4 inch) square contact 
surface. The test must be repeated enough additional times so that the 
load is placed in the center of each hatch cover when in its closed 
position, and in the center of each area of the platform located between 
floor supports. The platform must not break or crack during these tests.
    (3) Deck interlock. If the pilot hoist is portable, it is placed in 
an uninstalled position. Its hoist control lever is then activated. The 
deck interlock must prevent movement of the ladder or lift platform when 
the lever is activated.
    (4) Lifting and lowering speed and level wind. The hoist is 
installed in a level operating position and a weight equal to the weight 
of the pilot ladder plus 150 kg (330 lb.) times the maximum persons 
capacity of the hoist is placed on its ladder or lift platform. The 
ladder or lift platform is repeatedly raised and lowered under power 
operation until a total distance of at least 150 meters (500 feet) has 
been traversed. The ladder or lift platform is raised and lowered each 
time through a distance of at least 5 meters (16 feet). The average 
speed of raising the ladder or lift platform and the average lowering 
speed during this test must both be between 15 and 21 meters per minute 
(50 and 70 feet per minute). During the test, each suspension cable must 
have one level wind of wrap each time it is rewound onto its drum.
    (5) Upper position stop. The hoist is installed in a level operating 
position and a weight equal to the weight of the pilot ladder plus 150 
kg (330 lb.) times the maximum persons capacity is attached to the 
hoist. The hoist must be able to raise the weight to the upper limit of 
travel of the ladder or lift platform and must be able to stop at the 
upper limit without jarring, jerking, or damage. The test is repeated 
with no weight on the ladder or lift platform.
    (6) Cable securing device. If the hoist has suspension cables, it is 
installed in a level operating position and the cables are run all the 
way out. A weight equal to 2.2 times the working load is then attached 
to the cables. The cables must remain securely attached to the drums for 
at least one minute after the weight has been attached.
    (7) Controls and power indicator. The hoist is installed in a level 
operating

[[Page 324]]

position and a weight equal to the working load is attached to the 
hoist. The hoist control lever is then operated with the power both on 
and off. The lever, when operated, must meet the requirements in 
Sec. 163.002-13(l). The power indicator must meet the requirements in 
Sec. 163.002-13(n) during the test. When the power is turned off, the 
ladder or lift platform must stop immediately and remain stationary 
until power is turned on. The emergency stop switch on the ladder or 
lift platform is activated at some point when the ladder or lift 
platform is being raised or lowered. Upon activation, the ladder or lift 
platform must stop and remain stationary.
    (8) Hand operation and interlock. The hoist is installed in a level 
operating position and a weight equal to the working load is attached to 
the hoist. The hand operated device is then engaged. One person, when 
using the hand operated device, must be able to raise and lower the 
weight through a distance of at least 5 meters (16 ft.) in each 
direction and must be able to raise and lower it at a speed of at least 
1.5 meters per minute (5 ft. per minute). When raising or lowering the 
hoist with the hand operated device, the power source for the hoist is 
turned on, or an attempt is made to turn it on. Then, with power source 
turned off, the hand operated device is disengaged. The power source is 
then turned on and an attempt made to engage the hand operated device. 
The interlock must prevent simultaneous operation of the power source 
and the hand operated device.
    (9) 2.2x overload. The hoist is installed in a level operating 
position. Each roller on the ladder or lift platform is placed in 
contact with a vertical surface. A weight equal to the difference 
between 2.2 times the working load and the weight of the ladder or lift 
platform is placed on the ladder or lift platform. The ladder or lift 
platform is raised through a distance of at least 5 meters (16 feet) and 
the hoist control lever is then released. The ladder or lift platform 
must stop without jarring or damage and must hold the weight for at 
least one minute. The weight is then lowered through a distance of not 
less than 5 meters (16 feet) and the control lever is then released. The 
ladder or lift platform must stop within 600 millimeters (2 ft.) of 
where the hoist was when the lever was released and the ladder or lift 
platform must remain stationary for at least one minute thereafter. Each 
roller must move smoothly over the vertical surface without jamming or 
sliding during the test.
    (10) 6x overload. The hoist is installed in a level operating 
position. A load of six times the working load is attached to the hoist. 
(If the hoist has suspension cables, the cables must be run out at least 
one meter (3 ft.) before adding the load to the hoist). The weight must 
remain stationary for at least one minute without damage to any part of 
the hoist. The test is repeated simulating a vessel list of 15 degrees 
toward the side on which the hoist is installed.
    (11) Level wind suspension cable. If the hoist has suspension 
cables, it is installed in a level operating position with the cables 
wound onto the drums. A weight equal to the working load is attached to 
the hoist. The cables are run all the way out and then rewound back onto 
the drums at least ten times. Each drum and cable is observed for level 
winding as the cable is wound onto the drum. The test must be repeated 
with a weight equal to the weight of the rigid ladder or lift platform. 
In each test, each cable must always rewind onto the drum in one level 
wind of wrap.
    (12) Rung friction test. One rung of each type used on a rigid 
ladder must be subjected to this test. This test compares the dry and 
wet surface friction characteristics of ladder rungs with those of a 
standard oak step.
    (i) The standard step must have a surface of clean oak that meets 
Sec. 163.003-11(b) of this chapter and that is 115 mm (4\1/2\ in.) wide 
by 400 mm (16 in.) long. The stepping surface must have grooves that are 
3 mm (\1/8\ in.) deep and 3 mm wide. The grooves must run in two 
different directions at right angles to each other, and at 45 degree 
angles with each edge of the stepping surface, so that the grooves form 
a diamond pattern covering the stepping surface. The centers of all 
parallel grooves must be 13 mm (\1/2\ in.) apart.
    (ii) The standard step must be set in a level position. A metal 
block must be

[[Page 325]]

placed on one end of the step so that the block is in contact with the 
stepping surface. The metal block must weigh between 1.5 kg (3.3 lb.) 
and 3.0 kg (6.6 lb.) and must not be more than 100 mm (4 in.) wide by 
135 mm (5\3/8\ in.) long. The surface of the block in contact with the 
step must have leather or composition shoe sole material attached to it.
    (iii) The end of the step that has the metal block on it must be 
slowly raised until the block starts to slide. The angle of the step in 
this position must be measured and recorded. The step and block must 
then be placed under water and the procedure repeated.
    (iv) The procedure in paragraph (c)(12)(iii) of this section must be 
repeated using a rigid ladder rung in place of the standard step.
    (v) The ladder rung must then be secured in a horizontal position 
with a block resting on its stepping surface. The block must be of a 
size similar to the one used in the previous tests and have the same 
shoe sole surface used in the previous tests. The block must be arranged 
to apply a vertical load of 40 kg (88 lb.) to the rung. The block must 
be then moved back and forth in the same line from one end of the 
stepping surface to the other. This must be done for a total of 1,500 
cycles.
    (vi) The rung must again be tested as described in paragraph 
(c)(12)(iii) of this section, except that the initial position of the 
block must be on a part of the stepping surface that was subjected to 
the 1,500 cycles of rubbing.
    (vii) The angles at which the block starts to slide on a wet and dry 
ladder rung when tested under paragraphs (c)(12)(iv) and (c)(12)(vi) of 
this section must be equal to or greater than the corresponding angles 
measured for the standard step when tested under paragraph (c)(12)(iii) 
of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 163.003-13  Construction.

    (a) General. Each pilot ladder must have two suspension members on 
each side. Each step in the ladder must be supported by each suspension 
member.
    (b) Suspension member. The suspension members of a pilot ladder must 
meet the following requirements:
    (1) Each suspension member must be continuous from the top of the 
ladder to the bottom and must not be painted or otherwise coated or 
covered.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section--
    (i) The top end of one suspension member on each side of the ladder 
must extend at least 3 m (10 ft.) beyond the top ladder step; and
    (ii) The top ends of the other suspension members must be just above 
the top step and must have an eye splice or thimble large enough to fit 
two passes of a suspension member.
    (3) The top end of each suspension member that does not have an eye 
splice or thimble must be served or treated to prevent fraying.
    (4) Each pair of suspension members must be clamped together both 
above and below each step. Marline seizing may not be used.
    (5) The clear space between the suspension members on one side of a 
ladder and those on the other side must be at least 400 mm (16 in.), but 
not more than 480 mm (19 in.).
    (6) The suspension members must not have fittings at the bottom of 
the ladder that can be used for attaching additional ladder sections.
    (c) Steps. Pilot ladder steps must meet the following requirements:
    (1) The four lowest steps must be molded steps and the rest of the 
steps must be either wooden or molded steps.
    (2) The top face of each step must have a rectangular surface that 
is at least 115 mm (4\1/2\ in.) wide with a non-skid surface that does 
not retain water. Adhesive non-skid sheets may not be used. (For 
example, a suitable surface

[[Page 327]]

for a step is one that has grooves at least 3 mm (\1/8\ in.) deep cut in 
a diamond pattern so that water runs off the edge of the step. Non-skid 
grit is applied directly to the step surface extending to almost the 
full width of the step.)
    (3) Each step at its thinnest point must be at least 25 mm (1 in.) 
thick and in determining this thickness, the depth of the grooves in the 
non-skid surface and the diameter of any hole extending from one side of 
the step to the other must not be counted.
    (4) Each step must be at least 480 mm (19 in.) long.
    (5) Each step must be designed so that it can be removed and 
replaced without unstringing the ladder. If special replacement steps 
are made to meet this requirement, the replacement steps must meet the 
requirements of this section.
    (6) If a step has grooves for its suspension members, the grooves 
must be in the sides of the steps.
    (7) The spacing from the top of one step to the top of the next step 
must be uniform and this spacing must be between 300 mm (12 in.) and 350 
mm (13\3/4\ in.).
    (8) Each step must be a bright orange color, except that this color 
is not required for the non-skid surface. If a step is painted, it must 
be painted with a two-part epoxy paint intended for marine use, or a 
paint of equivalent durability.
    (9) The height of each device attached to the step for securing the 
suspension members must not be more than one-half the width of the step 
so that the step is not prevented from rolling if the ladder is caught 
between a pilot boat and the hull of the vessel.
    (10) Each replacement step must be either white or yellow instead of 
the orange color required under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, and 
must have the special marking required in Sec. 163.003-25(b).
    (d) Spreaders. Each pilot ladder with 5 or more steps must have one 
or more spreaders that meet the following requirements:
    (1) Each spreader must be at least 1.8 m (70 in.) long.
    (2) The spreaders must be positioned at intervals of not more than 9 
steps.
    (3) The lowest spreader on a ladder must be on the fifth step from 
the bottom.
    (e) Fasteners. Each fastening device securing a part of a pilot 
ladder must have a means to prevent the device from loosening.
    (f) Workmanship. A pilot ladder must not have splinters, burrs, 
sharp edges, corners, projections, or other defects that could injure a 
person using the ladder.
    (g) Special arrangements for pilot hoists. Each pilot ladder 
produced for use with an approved pilot hoist must have at least 8 
steps. The top ends of its suspension members need not have an eye 
splice or thimble or be arranged as required in paragraph (b) of this 
section if necessary to permit attaching the ladder to fittings of a 
particular pilot hoist. The spreader required in paragraph (d) of this 
section may be omitted from an 8 step ladder for a pilot hoist.

<R05>
Sec. 163.003-15  Performance.

    (a) Each pilot ladder must be capable of being rolled up for 
storage.
    (b) Each ladder when rolled up must be able to unroll freely and 
hang vertically.
    (c) Each suspension member must be arranged so that, when the ladder 
is in use on a vessel, the suspension member cannot come in contact with 
the vessel's side.
    (d) Each step must be arranged so that it can bear on the side of 
the vessel when the ladder is in use.


<R05>
Sec. 163.003-17  Strength.

    (a) Each pilot ladder must be designed to pass the approval tests in 
Sec. 163.003-21.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 163.003-21  Approval tests.

    (a) General. Each approval test must be conducted on a ladder of the 
longest length for which approval has been requested. If the ladder 
fails one of the tests, the cause of the failure must be identified and 
any needed design changes made. After a test failure and any design 
change, the failed test, and

[[Page 328]]

any other previously completed tests affected by the change, must be 
rerun. Any ladder step that has a residual deflection after testing 
under this section may not be used thereafter in any ladder represented 
as Coast Guard approved.
    (b) Visual examination. Before starting the approval tests, an 
assembled pilot ladder is examined for evidence of noncompliance with 
the requirements in Secs. 163.003-11, 163.003-13, and 163.003-15.
    (c) The following approval tests must be conducted:
    (1) Step flexibility test. This test is performed on six different 
steps, one of which must be a molded step and one of which must be a 
replacement step if special replacement steps are made by the 
manufacturer. Each step is placed on a pair of supports located at the 
points where the step would ordinarily be attached to the suspension 
members. A static load must be applied uniformly for a period of at 
least one minute over a contact surface that is at the center of the 
step and is approximately 100 mm (4 in.) wide. The load must be 150 kg 
(330 lb.) for each molded step that is used only as one of the four 
bottom steps in the ladder. The load must be 320 kg (700 lb.) for each 
other step. The deflection of the step is measured while the step is 
under load and after the load is removed. The step must not deflect more 
than 20 mm (\3/4\ in.) under the load, and there must be no residual 
deflection after the load is removed.
    (2) Strength test 1. An assembled ladder is supported so that a 
static load, if placed on any of its steps, would exert a force on both 
the step and each suspension member. A static load of 900 kg (2,000 lb.) 
is then placed on one step for at least one minute. The load must be 
uniformly distributed over a contact surface that is approximately 100 
mm (4 in.) wide. The center of the contact surface must be at the center 
of the step. This test is performed on six different steps, one of which 
must be a molded step. None of the steps may break or crack. No 
attachment between any step and a suspension member may loosen or break 
during this test.
    (3) Strength test 2. An assembled ladder is suspended vertically to 
its full length. A static load of 900 kg (2,000 lb.) is then applied to 
the bottom step of the ladder so that it is distributed equally between 
the suspension members. The suspension members, and inserts must not 
break, incur any elongation or deformation that remains after the test 
load is removed, or be damaged in any other way during this test.
    (4) Strength test 3. A rolled up ladder is attached to anchoring 
fixtures in a location away from any wall or structure that would 
prevent it from falling freely, and where it can hang to its full length 
vertically. The ladder when dropped must unroll freely. When unrolling 
the ladder, its steps and attachments must not become cracked, broken, 
or loosened. Other similar damage making the ladder unsafe to use must 
likewise not occur.
    (5) Step friction test. One step of each type used on a pilot ladder 
must be subjected to this test. This test compares the dry and wet 
surface friction characteristics of ladder steps with those of a 
standard oak step.
    (i) The standard step must have a surface of clean oak that meets S/
163.003-11(b) and that is 115 mm (4\1/2\ in.) wide by 400 mm (16 in.) 
long. The stepping surface must have grooves that are 3 mm (\1/8\ in.) 
deep and 3 mm wide. The grooves must run in two different directions at 
right angles to each other, and at 45 degree angles with each edge of 
the stepping surface, so that the grooves form a diamond pattern 
covering the stepping surface. The centers of all parallel grooves must 
be 13 mm (\1/2\ in.) apart.
    (ii) The standard step must be set in a level position. A metal 
block must be placed on one end of the step so that the block is in 
contact with the stepping surface. The metal block must weigh between 
1.5 kg (3.3 lb.) and 3.0 kg (6.6 lb.) and must not be more than 100 mm 
(4 in.) wide by 135 mm (5\3/8\ in.) long. The surface of the block in 
contact with the step must have leather or composition shoe sole 
material attached to it.
    (iii) The end of the step that has the metal block on it must be 
slowly raised until the block starts to slide. The angle of the step in 
this position must be measured and recorded. The step

[[Page 329]]

and block must then be placed under water and the procedure repeated.
    (iv) The procedure in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section must be 
repeated using a pilot ladder step in place of the standard step.
    (v) The ladder step must then be secured in a horizontal position 
with a block resting on its stepping surface. The block must be of a 
size similar to the one used in the previous tests and have the same 
shoe sole surface used in the previous tests. The block must be arranged 
to apply a vertical load of 40 kg (88 lb.) to the step. The block must 
be then moved back and forth in the same line from one end of the 
stepping surface to the other. This must be done for a total of 1,500 
cycles.
    (vi) The step must again be tested as described in paragraph 
(c)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the initial position of the 
block must be on a part of the stepping surface that was subjected to 
the 1,500 cycles of rubbing.
    (vii) The angles at which the block starts to slide on a wet and dry 
ladder step when tested under paragraphs (c)(6)(iv) and (c)(6)(vi) of 
this section must be equal to or greater than the corresponding angles 
measured for the standard step when tested under paragraph (c)(6)(iii) 
of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 163.003-25  Marking.

    (a) Each pilot ladder step manufactured under Coast Guard approval 
must be branded or otherwise permanently and legibly marked on the 
bottom with--
    (1) The name of the manufacturer;
    (2) The manufacturer's brand or model designation;
    (3) The lot number or date of manufacture; and
    (4) The Coast Guard approval number.
    (b) In addition to the markings required under paragraph (a) of this 
section each step sold as a replacement step must be branded or 
otherwise permanently and legibly marked with the words ``REPLACEMENT 
STEP ONLY.''

25456, June 21, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 163.003-27  Production tests and examination.

    (a) General. Each ladder produced under Coast Guard approval must be 
tested in accordance with this section and subpart 159.007 of this 
chapter. Steps that fail testing may not be marked with the Coast Guard 
approval number and each assembled ladder that fails testing may not be 
sold as Coast Guard approved.
    (b) Test No. 1: Steps. Steps must be separated into lots of 100 
steps or less. Steps of different types must be placed in separate lots. 
One step from each lot must be selected at random and tested as 
described in Sec. 163.003-21(c)(2) except that supports are placed under 
the step at the points where it would be attached to suspension members 
in an assembled ladder. If the step fails the test, ten more steps must 
be selected at random from the lot and tested. If one or more of the ten 
steps fails the test, each step in the lot must be tested. No step that 
has any residual deflection after the test may be used in a ladder 
represented by the manufacturer as Coast Guard approved.
    (c) Test No. 2: Ladders. Assembled ladders must be separated into 
lots of 20 ladders or less. One ladder must be selected at random from 
the ladders in each lot. The ladder selected must be at least 3 m (10 
ft.) long or, if each ladder in the lot is less then 3 m long, a ladder 
of the longest length in the lot must be selected. The ladder must be 
tested as prescribed in Sec. 163.003-21(c)(3) except that only a 3 m 
section of the ladder need be subjected to the static load. If the 
ladder fails the test, each other ladder in the lot must be tested.
    (d) Independent laboratory. Each production test must be conducted 
or supervised by an independent laboratory. However, if a test is 
performed more than 4 different times per year, laboratory participation 
is required only 4 times per year. If the laboratory does not 
participate in all tests, the times of laboratory participation must be 
as selected by the laboratory. The times selected must provide for 
effective monitoring throughout the production schedule.
    (e) Visual examination. The visual examination described in 
Sec. 163.003-21(b)

[[Page 330]]

must be conducted as a part of each production test.

Sec. 164.003-3  Material and workmanship.

    (a) The raw kapok fiber shall be long, clean, creamy white in color, 
lustrous, free from discoloration and adulteration with other fiber, and 
of a quality equal to that grown in Java.
    (b) Kapok shall be processed by teasing in a machine using the air-
blow method. Mechanical separation of fiber masses is permitted, but 
machines using violent beating which breaks down the fibers or causes 
undue powdering or pulverizing are not permitted. Provision shall be 
made for trapping seeds and heavy objects in gravity traps and the dust 
or powder in an efficient dust collector.
    (c) Processed kapok shall have a buoyancy in fresh water of at least 
48 pounds per cubic foot when tested in accordance with Sec. 164.003-
4(d). Rejected kapok shall not be used in lifesaying products inspected 
by the Coast Guard.
    (d) The processed kapok shall contain not more than 5 percent by 
weight of sticks, seeds, dirt or other foreign material and shall be 
free from objectionable odor and adulteration with other fibers.


<R05>
Sec. 164.003-4  Inspections and tests.

    (a) Kapok fibers to be used in a finished product subject to 
inspection by the Coast Guard shall be subject to inspection and tests 
at the plant of the manufacturer of such product, who shall furnish the 
necessary testing tank, test cages, and scales.
    (b) Acceptance of kapok prior to being incorporated into finished 
products, or during the course of manufacture, shall in no case be 
construed as a guarantee of the acceptance of the finished product.
    (c) Not less than a one-pound sample from each 1,000 pounds of kapok 
shall be tested for buoyancy by the inspector. At his discretion, the 
inspector may select additional samples for tests if deemed advisable.
    (d) The buoyancy test shall be made with 16 ounces of processed 
kapok uniformly packed in a rigid wire box or cage with metal reinforced 
edges, and submerged by weights in a tank of fresh water to a depth of 
12 inches below the surface of the water, measurement made to the top of 
box, for 48 hours. The test box shall be cylindrical in shape, and as

made largely of incombustible materials with low heat transmission 
qualities which will produce a minimum of smoke when exposed to high 
temperatures.
    (b) Deck coverings shall be of such a quality as to successfully 
pass all of the tests set forth in Sec. 164.006-4.


<R05>
Sec. 164.006-4  Inspection and testing.

    (a) All tests shall be conducted at the National Bureau of Standards 
or other laboratories designated by the Coast Guard.
    (b) Smoke tests. (1) A sample of each thickness submitted shall be 
tested for smoke emission. Each sample shall be laid on a \1/
4\" x 12" x 27" steel plate. Normal protective coatings and deck 
attachments shall be incorporated in the samples. Each sample shall be 
heated in a furnace whose temperature is limited to the standard decking 
curve reaching 1,325 degrees F. at the end of one hour. Smoke 
observations shall be made at intervals not greater than five minutes 
during the one-hour period of test.
    (2) Instantaneous values of the percent of light transmission shall 
be calculated from the observations noted in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. A plot of light transmission values shall be made using 
straight lines between instantaneous values.
    (3) Any instantaneous value of 10 percent light transmission or less 
shall be considered sufficient cause for rejection of a deck covering.
    (4) Average values of light transmission shall be calculated for 15, 
30, and 60 minutes. Averages shall be an arithmetic mean with values 
taken at one minute intervals from the plotted curve noted in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. If any of the three average values of light 
transmission is less than the values set forth below, it will be 
considered sufficient cause for rejection of a deck covering:

15 minutes--90 percent light transmission.
30 minutes--60 percent light transmission.
60 minutes--50 percent light transmission.

    (c) Fire resistance and integrity tests. (1) A sample of each 
thickness submitted shall be tested for fire resistance and integrity. 
Each sample shall be laid on a \1/4\" x 12" x 27" steel plate. Normal 
protective coatings and deck attachments shall be incorporated in the 
samples. Each sample shall be heated in a furnace whose temperature is 
controlled according to the standard fire exposure curve reaching 1,700 
degrees F. at the end of one hour. Temperature of the unexposed side as 
indicated by a thermocouple under a 0.40 inch asbestos pad shall be 
observed at intervals not greater than 5 minutes during the one-hour 
period of test.
    (2) Data from these tests shall be analyzed to determine the 
thicknesses necessary to limit the average temperature rise on the 
unexposed surface to 250 degrees F. above the original temperature at 
the end of 15, 30, and 60 minutes.
    (3) Excessive cracking, buckling, or disintegration may be 
considered cause for rejection.
    (d) Organic carbon content test. (1) The organic carbon content 
shall be determined and shall not exceed 0.12 gram

[[Page 333]]

per cubic centimeter of the molded deck covering.
    (e) Spot check tests. (1) Deck coverings are not inspected at 
regularly scheduled factory inspections; however, the cognizant Officer 
in Charge, Marine Inspection, may detail a marine inspector at any time 
to visit any place where deck coverings are manufactured to conduct any 
inspections or examinations deemed advisable and to select 
representative samples for further examination, inspection or tests. The 
marine inspector shall be admitted to any place where work is done on 
deck coverings or component materials.
    (2) Manufacturers of approved deck coverings shall maintain quality 
control of materials used, manufacturing methods, and the finished 
product so as to meet the requirements of this specification, and any 
other conditions outlined on the certificate of approval, but the Coast 
Guard also reserves the right to make spot-check tests of approved deck 
coverings at any time on samples selected by a marine inspector at the 
place of manufacture or samples obtained from other sources in the 
field. The manufacturer will incur no expense for such tests, but the 
results shall be binding upon the approval of his product. The 
manufacturer will be advised in advance of the time of testing of the 
samples selected and may witness the tests if he so desires.

<R05>
Sec. 164.007-2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this specification is to set forth tests necessary to 
measure the insulation value of structural insulation specimens under 
fire exposure conditions. The tests are not intended to measure the 
integrity of structural components of an assembly Insulation meeting 
this specification is adequate to limit the average temperature rise of 
a steel bulkhead to 139  deg.C. (250  deg.F.) at the end of a 60-minute 
standard fire test.


<R05>
Sec. 164.007-3  Conditions of approval.

    (a) Structural insulation shall be of such quality as to 
successfully meet the requirements for an incombustible material as set 
forth in subpart 164.009 of this part.
    (b) Structural insulation shall be of such quality and thickness as 
to successfully pass all of the tests set forth in Sec. 164.007-4, and 
the retests required by Sec. 164.007-8.
    (c) The product shall be so marked as to be readily identifiable to 
an inspector in the field. The marking shall include the Coast Guard 
approval number.


<R05>
Sec. 164.007-4  Testing procedure.

    (a) Tests. All tests, including the retests, shall be conducted at 
the National Bureau of Standards or other laboratories designated by the 
Coast Guard.
    (b) Test of physical properties. (1) Density measurement: The 
smallest sample for density measurements of solid materials shall be 30 
cm  x  30 cm (12" x 12") by the submitted thickness. Length and width 
measurements shall be made to the nearest 1 mm. (\1/32\"), thickness to 
the nearest 0.25 mm. (0.01"), allowance being made of any nonflatness of 
the major surfaces of the specimen. Measurements of dimensions of 
fibrous insulations shall be made to the nearest 1.5 mm. (\1/16\") on a 
nominal 30 cm. (12") cube assembled from sheets of thickness as 
received. The average of at least four measurements of each dimension 
shall be reported. The weight shall be determined with a scale or 
balance sensitive and accurate to 0.5 percent or less of the total 
weight. The dimensional and weight measurements shall not be made until 
the sample has been conditioned 1 week, or longer if required to reach 
constant weight, in an atmosphere at 23 deg. <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 
deg.C. (73  deg.F.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg.) and 50 percent relative 
humidity.
    (2) Transfer to a previously dried and weighed wide-mouth weighing 
bottle provided with a glass stopper. Remove the stopper and heat the 
bottle and sample at 105 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5  deg.C. 
(221 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9  deg.F.) for 4 hours, insert the 
stopper, cool and weigh. Calculate the content of moisture and other 
volatiles as percent of the final dry weight of the sample.

[[Page 335]]

    (c) Preparation of fire test specimens. (1) The fire test specimens 
shall be conditioned to approximately constant weight with air being 
maintained at a relative humidity of 40 to 70 percent and a temperature 
of 15 deg. to 25  deg.C. (50 deg. to 77  deg.F.). After conditioning, 
but before testing, the temperature of the specimens shall not exceed 40 
 deg.C. (104  deg.F.).
    (2) Representative samples of the structural insulation, of a 
thickness or thicknesses and density as specified in Sec. 164.007-
9(a)(5), shall be tested as part of an assembly which forms a portion of 
a vertical wall of a furnace. The assembly shall be at least 100 cm.  x  
150 cm. (40" x 60") in size. More than one sample may be tested, see 
Sec. 164.007-7.
    (3) The specimens shall be attached to a 5<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.3 
mm. (\3/16\") thick steel plate and mounted in the furnace with the 
steel plate forming the exterior wall of the furnace. Any stiffening 
members on the steel plate shall be installed on the face not adjacent 
to the insulation. Spacer strips of asbestos cement board or similar 
material, up to 5 cm. (2") in width, shall be installed around the 
periphery of the panel. For fibrous insulations, the attachment to the 
steel plate shall be made by means of 5 mm. (0.19") diameter steel pins 
on 30 cm. (12") centers covered by 18-gage, 4 cm. (1\1/2\") mesh 
expanded metal. Alternate methods will be given consideration. For other 
materials, typical installation practice shall be used.
    (d) Furnace control. (1) The furnace temperature shall be determined 
by at least four mineral insulated thermocouples having rapid response, 
and distributed so as to represent fairly the furnace temperature and to 
insure as uniform heating as possible. The thermocouples shall be 
arranged so that the hot junction is approximately 10 cm. from the 
nearest point of the specimen.
    (2) The furnace temperature shall be continuously controlled so as 
to follow the standard time-temperature curve within the accuracy 
specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (3) The standard time-temperature curve is defined by a smooth curve 
drawn through the following points:

At the beginning of the test, 20  deg.C. (68  deg.F.)
At the end of the first 5 minutes, 538  deg.C. (1,000  deg.F.).
At the end of the first 10 minutes, 704  deg.C. (1,300  deg.F.).
At the end of the first 30 minutes, 843  deg.C. (1,550  deg.F.).
At the end of the first 60 minutes, 927  deg.C. (1,700  deg.F.).


For a further definition of the time-temperature curve, see Appendix I 
of the ASTM Standard E-119, ``Fire Tests of Building Construction and 
Materials''.
    (4) The accuracy of the furnace control shall be such that the area 
under the mean time-temperature curve is within 15 percent of the area 
under the standard time-temperature curve during the first 10 minutes of 
the test, within 10 percent during the first one-half hour, and within 5 
percent for any period after the first one-half hour. At any time after 
the first 10 minutes of the test the mean furnace temperature shall not 
differ from the standard curve by more than 100  deg.C. (180  deg.F.). 
Consideration will be given to adjusting the results for variation of 
the furnace exposure from that prescribed. If corrections are made, they 
shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in the ASTM E-119.
    (e) Temperature of unexposed surface. For the unexposed surface 
temperature measurement a thermocouple of 0.5 mm. (0.020") diameter 
wires shall be soldered centrally with high temperature solder to one 
surface of a disc of copper 12 mm. in diameter and 0.2 mm. thick. The 
discs shall be covered with an oven-dry asbestos pad 50 mm.  x  50 mm, 
and 4 mm. thick. The disc and the pad may be fixed to the surface of the 
steel plate by pins, tape, or a suitable adhesive. The asbestos pad 
shall have a density of approximately 1,000 kg./m. <SUP>3</SUP> and 
thermal conductivity of 0.11 kcal/m/hr.  x   deg.C. at 100  deg.C. (212 
deg.F.).
    (f) Temperature observations. (1) All observations shall be taken at 
intervals not exceeding 5 minutes. The surface temperature on the 
exterior side of the steel plate shall be measured by thermocouples 
located as follows:
    (i) One thermocouple located approximately in the center of each 
quadrant of the steel plate (four thermocouples total).
    (ii) One thermocouple close to the center of the steel plate.

[[Page 336]]

    (iii) One thermocouple in way of or as close as possible to one of 
the pins or other through metallic connections (if any) used for holding 
the insulation in place.
    (iv) Further thermocouples at the discretion of the testing 
laboratory or Coast Guard for the purpose of determining the temperature 
at points deemed likely to give a greater temperature rise than any of 
the above-mentioned thermocouples.
    (2) The average temperature rise on the unexposed surface shall be 
obtained by averaging the readings of the thermocouples mentioned in 
paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (g) Other observations. Throughout the test observations shall be 
made of all changes and occurrences, which are not criteria of 
performance, but which may create hazard in case of a fire; for example 
the emission of appreciable volumes of smoke or noxious vapors from the 
unexposed side of the test specimen. The specimen shall be examined 
after the test for changes that have taken place and the information 
shall be noted in the test report.
    (h) Duration of testing. The test shall be continued for at least 
one hour or until the maximum surface temperature rise values noted in 
Sec. 164.007-5(a) have been reached, whichever occurs later.


<R05>
Sec. 164.007-5  Test requirements.

    The insulation value of the specimens for the full scale test shall 
be such that the average temperature of the thermocouples on the 
unexposed surface described in Sec. 164.007-4(f)(2) will not rise more 
than 139  deg.C. (250  deg.F.) above the initial temperature, nor will 
the temperature at any one point on the surface, including any through 
metallic connection, rise more than 181  deg.C. (325  deg.F.) above the 
original temperature at the end of 60 minutes. The results obtained on 
the small scale test 2' x 2' (60 cm.  x  60 cm.) shall be recorded.


<R05>
Sec. 164.007-6  Test report.

    (a) The test report required shall contain at least the following:
    (1) Name of manufacturer.
    (2) Purpose of test.
    (3) Test conditions and date of test.

<R05>
Sec. 164.008-3  Testing procedure.

    (a) Tests. All tests, including the retests, shall be conducted at 
the National Bureau of Standards or other laboratories designated by the 
Coast Guard.
    (b) Preparation of test specimen. (1) The test specimens shall be 
conditioned to approximately constant weight with the air being 
maintained at a relative humidity of 40 to 70 percent and a temperature 
of 15 deg. to 25  deg.C. (59 deg. to 77  deg.F.). After conditioning, 
but before testing, the temperature of the specimen should not exceed 40 
 deg.C. (104  deg.F.).
    (2) The specimens shall be mounted in the furnace in a vertical 
position in such a way as to give an exposed surface of at least 4.65 
square meters (50 square feet) and a height of at least 2.44 meters (8 
feet).
    (3) The specimen shall be supported at the top and secured on the 
vertical sides and at the bottom in a manner representative of 
conditions in service. If provision for movement at the edges of a 
bulkhead panel is made for a particular construction in service, the 
specimen should stimulate these conditions.
    (4) The method of securing shall be such that there is no 
possibility of misinterpretation of test results due to the passage of 
flame at the edges of the specimen when the method of fixing is not the 
subject of the test.
    (c) Furnace control. (1) The furnace temperature shall be determined 
by at least four mineral insulated thermocouples having rapid response 
and distributed so as to represent fairly the furnace temperature and to 
insure as uniform heating as possible. The thermocouples shall be 
arranged so that the hot junction is approximately 10 cm. (4") from the 
nearest point of the specimen.
    (2) The furnace temperature shall be continuously controlled so as 
to follow the standard time-temperature curve within the accuracy 
specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (3) The standard time-temperature curve is defined by a smooth curve 
drawn through the following points:

At the beginning of the test, 20  deg.C. (68  deg.F.).
At the end of the first 5 minutes, 538  deg.C. (1,000  deg.F.).

[[Page 340]]

At the end of the first 10 minutes, 704  deg.C. (1,300  deg.F.).
At the end of the first 30 minutes, 843  deg.C. (1,550  deg.F.).
At the end of the first 60 minutes, 927  deg.C. (1,700  deg.F.).

For a further definition of the time-temperature curve, see Appendix I 
of the ASTM Standard E119, ``Fire Tests of Building Construction and 
Materials''.
    (4) The accuracy of the furnace control shall be such that the area 
under the mean time-temperature curve is within 15 percent of the area 
under the standard curve during the first 10 minutes of the test, within 
10 percent during the first one-half hour, and within 5 percent for any 
period after the first one-half hour. At any time after the first 10 
minutes of the test the mean furnace temperature shall not differ from 
the standard curve by more than 100  deg.C. (180  deg.F.). Consideration 
will be given to adjusting the results for variation of the furnace 
exposure from that prescribed. If corrections are made, they shall be in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in ASTM E-119.
    (5) The pressure in the furnace shall be equal to that in the 
laboratory at about one-third of the height of the specimen.
    (d) Temperature of unexposed surface. For the unexposed surface 
temperature measurement, a thermocouple of 0.5 mm. (0.020") diameter 
wires shall be soldered centrally with high temperature solder to one 
surface of a disc of copper 12 mm. diameter and 0.2 mm. thick. The discs 
shall be covered with an oven-dry asbestos pad 50 mm.  x  50 mm. and 4 
mm. thick. The disc and the pad may be fixed to the surface of the 
specimen by pins, tape or a suitable adhesive, depending on the nature 
of the specimen material. The asbestos pad shall have a density of 
approximately 1,000 kg./m. <SUP>3</SUP> and thermal conductivity of 0.11 
kcal./m./hr.  x  C. at 100  deg.C. (212  deg.F.).
    (e) Flame penetration. (1) Where cracks or openings are formed 
during the test, an ignition test as prescribed in Sec. 164.008-4(b) 
shall take place immediately after the appearance of cracks or damage, 
followed by similar tests at frequent intervals. The purpose of the test 
is to indicate whether cracks and openings formed during the test are 
such that they would lead to passage of flame.
    (2) The cotton wool used for the tests prescribed in Sec. 164.008-
4(b) shall consist of new undyed soft fibers without any admixture of 
artificial fibers, and shall be free from thread, leaf, and shell fiber 
dust. A suitable material for this purpose is sold in the form of rolls 
for surgical use. A pad shall be cut measuring 10 cm.  x  10 cm. 
approximately 2 cm. thick and weighing between 3 and 4 grams. It shall 
be oven-dried prior to the test. The pad shall be attached by means of 
wire clips to a 10 cm.  x  10 cm. frame of 1 mm. diameter. A wire handle 
approximately 75 cm. long attached to the frame would facilitate its use 
on the specimen.
    (3) When testing for cracks or openings during the test, the pad 
shall be held in a vertical position facing the crack or opening with 
the aperture located in a central part of the cotton wool. The pad may 
be reused if it has not absorbed any moisture or become charred during 
the previous application.
    (f) Temperature observations. (1) All observations shall be taken at 
intervals not exceeding 5 minutes. The surface temperatures on the 
unexposed side of the test specimen shall be measured by thermocouples 
located as follows:
    (i) One thermocouple located approximately in the center of each 
quadrant of the steel plate (four thermocouples total).
    (ii) One thermocouple close to the center of the test specimen, but 
away from the joint, if any.
    (iii) At least one thermocouple at the vertical joint of the test 
specimen.
    (iv) Further thermocouples at the discretion of the testing 
laboratory or Coast Guard for the purpose of determining the temperature 
at points deemed likely to give a greater temperature rise than any of 
the above mentioned thermocouples.
    (2) The average temperature rise on the unexposed surface shall be 
obtained by averaging the readings of the thermocouples mentioned in 
paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (g) Other observations. Throughout the test, observations shall be 
made of all changes and occurrences, which are

[[Page 341]]

not criteria of performance but which may create hazard in case of a 
fire; for example the emission of appreciable volumes of smoke or 
noxious vapors from the unexposed side of the test specimen. The 
specimen shall be examined after the test for changes that have taken 
place and the information shall be noted in the test report.
    (h) Duration of testing. The test shall be continued for at least 30 
minutes to meet the requirements of Sec. 164.008-2(b) or at least 60 
minutes to meet the requirements of Sec. 164.008-2(c). In either case, 
the test shall be continued until the maximum surface temperature rise 
values noted in Sec. 164.008-4(a) have been reached, or until cracks 
which lead to flaming as specified in Sec. 164.008-4(b) are formed.


<R05>
Sec. 164.008-4  Test requirements.

    (a) Thermal insulation: The insulation value of the specimens for 
the full scale test shall be such that the average temperature of 
thermocouples on the unexposed surface described in Sec. 164.008-3(f)(2) 
will not rise more than 139  deg.C. (250  deg.F.) above the initial 
temperature, nor will the temperature at any point on the surface, 
including any joint, rise more than 225  deg.C. (405  deg.F.) above the 
initial temperature at the end of 15 minutes. When failure is due to 
excessive temperature rise on the joint, consideration will be given to 
alternate joint construction. The results obtained on the small scale 
test (2' x 2') (60 cm.  x  60 cm.) shall be recorded.
    (b) The test shall determine the length of time, up to one hour, 
that the bulkhead panel, including the joint can withstand the passage 
of flame. Cracks and openings shall not be such as to lead to flaming of 
a cotton wool test pad as prescribed in Sec. 164.008-3(e)(3) held facing 
the aperture at about 25 mm. for a period of 30 seconds. If no flaming 
occurs, the pad shall be removed and reapplied after a suitable 
interval.


<R05>
Sec. 164.008-5  Test report.

Sec. 164.009-13  Furnace calibration.

    A calibration is performed on each new furnace and on each existing 
furnace as often as necessary to ensure that the furnace is in good 
working order. In each calibration the energy input to the furnace is 
adjusted so that the furnace thermocouple gives a steady reading of 
750<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10  deg.C. The wall temperature of the furnace 
tube is then measured by an optical micro-pyrometer at intervals of 10mm 
on 3 equally spaced vertical axes. The furnace is correctly calibrated 
if the temperature of the furnace tube wall is between 825 and 875 
deg.C. 50 mm above and below the midline of the wall and if the average 
wall temperature is approximately 850  deg.C.


<R05>
Sec. 164.009-15  Test procedure.

    (a) General. Paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section contain the 
test procedures for each material submitted for approval, except 
fiberglass and other materials that melt at 
750 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10  deg.C. Paragraph (l) of this section 
contains test procedures for fiberglass and other materials that melt at 
750 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10  deg.C.
    (b) Preparation of specimens. (1) The designated laboratory prepares 
5 cylindrical specimens representative of the properties of the sample 
submitted for testing. The dimensions of each specimen are as follows:

diameter:  45(+2/-0) mm
height:  50<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3 mm
volume:  80<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 cm <SUP>3

    </SUP>(2) If the height of the sample, except a composite material, 
is less than 47 mm, the specimens prepared consist of layers of the 
sample.
    (3) If the sample is a composite material and has a height that is 
not 50<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3mm, the layers of the specimen prepared are 
proportional in thickness to the layers of the sample.
    (4) The top and bottom faces of each specimen prepared are the faces 
of the material as manufactured.
    (5) If it is not practicable to prepare a specimen by the procedures 
described in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section, the test 
is performed on five specimens of each component of the sample made to 
the dimensions prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Conditioning of specimen. Each specimen is conditioned for at 
least 20 hours in a ventilated oven maintained at 
60<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5  deg.C. and is then cooled to room temperature 
in a desiccator.
    (d) Weight of specimen. The weight of each conditioned specimen 
after cooling is determined before it is tested.
    (e) Placement of specimen in holder. After a specimen is conditioned 
and weighed, it is placed in the specimen holder. A specimen that is 
made of layers of a composite material is held firmly together in the 
specimen holder.
    (f) Attachment of thermocouples. After the specimen is placed in the 
specimen holder, the thermocouples are attached to the specimen as 
follows: A vertical hole with a diameter of 2 mm and a depth that is 
half the height of the specimen is made in the center of the top of the 
specimen. The specimen thermocouple is then inserted into the hole so 
that its hot junction is at the center of the specimen. The surface 
thermocouple is put in contact with the surface of the specimen at its 
mid-height.
    (g) Preparation of the apparatus. The apparatus is examined to 
determine whether it is in good working order and to ensure that the 
equipment is protected against drafts and is not exposed to direct 
sunlight or artificial illumination. The furnace temperature is 
stabilized at 750  deg.C.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10  deg.C. and kept at 
that temperature for the duration of the test. The furnace temperature 
is stabilized when no adjustments are needed in the energy input to the 
furnace to keep the temperature constant.
    (h) Insertion of specimen. After the furnace temperature is 
stabilized for at least 10 minutes, the specimen is inserted into the 
furnace. The insertion is completed within 5 seconds. The specimen is 
positioned so that the hot junction of the surface thermocouple is 
diametrically opposite the hot junction of the furnace thermocouple.
    (i) Heating period. The heating period begins upon insertion of the 
specimen into the furnace and continues for 20 minutes, or until peak 
temperatures have passed.
    (j) Test observations. Temperature measurements at each thermocouple 
are made at intervals of not more than 10 seconds during the heating 
period,

[[Page 346]]

and note is taken of the occurrence and duration of any flaming. At the 
end of the heating period, the specimen is removed from the furnace and 
weighed while still hot.
    (k) Test results. Material is approved under this subpart if the 
test results of the sample submitted are within the following limits:
    (1) The highest temperature recorded for each specimen during the 
test by the furnace thermocouple, when averaged with the highest 
temperatures recorded for the other specimens, is not more than 50 
deg.C. above the stabilized furnace temperature.
    (2) The highest temperature recorded for each specimen during the 
test by the surface thermocouple, when averaged with the highest 
temperatures recorded for the other specimens, is not more than 50 
deg.C. above the stabilized furnace temperature.
    (3) The duration of flaming of each specimen during the test, when 
averaged with duration of flaming recorded for the other specimens, is 
not more than 10 seconds.
    (4) The average weight loss of the specimens after heating is not 
more than 50 percent of their average weight after conditioning.
    (l) Fiberglass and other materials that melt at 750 
deg.C.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10  deg.C. If the material submitted for 
approval is fiberglass or other material that melts at 
750 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10  deg.C., it is tested as described in 
paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section, except the average weight 
loss of the sample is determined as follows:
    (1) Five cylindrical specimens in addition to the five cylindrical 
specimens required in paragraph (b) of this section are prepared as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Each of the additional specimens is placed on a weighing dish 
and both the specimen and the weighing dish are conditioned as described 
in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) The weight of each specimen and its weighing dish is determined 
as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (4) After a specimen and weighing dish are conditioned and weighed, 
they are placed in the specimen holder with the specimen supported by 
weighing dish. No specimen thermocouple or surface thermocouple is 
attached to the specimen.
    (5) The apparatus is prepared as described in paragraph (g) of this 
section, and after the furnace temperature has stabilized for at least 
10 minutes, the specimen and weighing dish are inserted into the 
furnace. The specimen and weighing dish are then heated for 20 minutes 
or until peak temperatures have passed. At the end of the heating 
period, the specimen and weighing dish are removed from the furnace and 
weighed while still hot.
    (6) The average weight loss of the specimens after heating may not 
be more than 50 percent of their average weight before heating.

Sec. 164.009-17  Density measurement.

    (a) The measurements described in this section are made to determine 
the density of a sample.
    (b) If the sample is a solid material, a specimen that has a length 
of 305 mm, a width of 305 mm, and thickness equal to that of the sample 
is prepared. The length and width are measured to the nearest 0.80 mm 
and the thickness to the nearest 0.25 mm. Allowance is made for any 
irregularity in the surfaces of the specimen. The average of at least 
four measurements of each dimension is determined.
    (c) If the sample is fibrous insulation, a specimen is prepared from 
sheets of the sample submitted. The sample is a cube and each dimension 
is 305 mm<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1.60 mm. The average of at least four 
measurements of each dimension is determined.
    (d) The weight of a specimen is determined with a sensitive balance 
scale accurate to at least 0.5 percent of the weight of the specimen.
    (e) The dimension and weight measurements of a specimen are made 
after it has been conditioned for at least one week, and for any 
additional time needed for the specimen to reach a constant weight, in 
an atmosphere that is 22.8  deg.C.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2  deg.C. and 50 
percent <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 percent relative humidity.

  \1\ No softening or swelling.
  \2\ Not objectionable.

    (b) Density. The density of the material shall be determined by 
dividing the weight of the material by its volume and shall be expressed 
in pounds per cubic foot. The volume shall be determined by measuring 
the volume of water displaced by the material or by direct measurement 
of the specimen using vernier calipers reading to 0.001 inch A sheet 
specimen 4" x 4" x thickness furnished shall be used unless the foam is 
molded shape, then the largest single piece so molded shall be used.
    (c) Buoyancy in fresh water--(1) Specimens. The buoyancy test shall 
be made with a sample of the sheet material measuring 
12" x 12" x thickness of material furnished or with the largest molded 
shape furnished.
    (2) Procedure. Securely attach a spring scale in a position directly 
over a test tank. Suspend a weighted wire basket from the scale in such 
a manner that the basket can be weighed while completely submerged in 
water. Proceed as follows:
    (i) Weigh the empty basket under water.
    (ii) Place the sample inside the basket and submerge it so that the 
top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. 
Allow the samples to remain submerged for 24 hours.
    (iii) After 24 hours submergence period, weigh the wire basket with 
the sample inside while both are still under water.

[[Page 353]]

    (iv) The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section 
minus (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The resulting value is divided by the 
volume of the polyvinyl chloride foam expressed in cubic feet. The final 
result is in lbs./cu. ft.
    (d) Volume loss on heat aging--(1) Specimen. Test specimens shall 
consist of pieces 4" x 4" x the thickness of the material furnished. 
Where the foam is an object of molded shape, the largest single piece so 
molded shall be used for this test.
    (2) Procedure. Volume before and after the heat aging test shall be 
determined by measuring the volume of water displaced by the material. 
The specimens shall be placed in an oven maintained at 
140 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2  deg.F., for a period of one week. At the 
end of that period the specimens shall be removed from the oven and 
allowed to recover in the open for 5 hours at 
70 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2  deg.F. before the measurement of final 
volume is made. The test shall be run in triplicate, the results 
averaged and the percentage of volume loss calculated.
    (e) Compression deflection. Compression deflection shall be 
determined in accordance with method 12151 of Federal Standard 601, 
except that the deflection shall be maintained at 25 percent with 
automatic or manual control, and the load observed and recorded 60 
seconds after the 25 percent deflection is reached.
    (f) Compression set--(1) Specimens. The specimens shall have 
parallel top and bottom surfaces which shall be at right angles to the 
side surfaces. The specimen may be cylindrical or rectangular. The 
minimum dimension across the top shall be at least 1.0 times the 
thickness and the top a minimum of 1 square inch in area, and a maximum 
of 16 square inches in area.
    (2) Apparatus. The apparatus shall consist of a compression device 
with two parallel plates, between which the test specimen shall be 
compressed by means of four studs and nuts. The plates may be steel, 
aluminum or any rigid smooth metal of sufficient thickness to withstand 
the required compression stresses without bending. The surfaces against 
which the test specimens are held shall be smooth and shall be 
thoroughly cleaned and wiped dry before each test. Metal shims inserted 
between the plates shall be used to limit the compression of the 
specimen.
    (3) Procedure. Thickness, before and after the compression set test 
shall be measured as specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. The 
test specimens shall be compressed 25% of the original thickness for 22 
hours. At the end of that period, the test specimens shall be removed 
from the set apparatus and allowed to rest for 24 hours before 
measurement of final thickness is made. The compression set shall be 
calculated by means of the following formula:

Compression set (percent) = [(h<INF>o</INF> - h<INF>i</INF>) <divide> 
(h<INF>o</INF> - h<INF>s</INF>)] x 100                (1)

where:

h<INF>o</INF>=the original thickness.
h<INF>i</INF>=the thickness 24 hours after removal from apparatus.
h<INF>s</INF>=the test compression thickness.

    (g) Fire retardance--(1) Types A and C foams. The test specimens 
shall be \1/4\ inch in thickness, 1 inch in width and approximately 6 
inches in length. The specimens shall be clamped at one end in a 
position such that the long dimension forms a 45 deg. angle with the 
horizontal and with the widths in a vertical position. A bunsen burner 
with a 1 inch yellow flame shall be applied to the lower or free end of 
the specimen for 15 seconds. The burner shall then be removed and the 
time that the specimen continues to burn after removal of the burner 
shall be recorded as burning time. The length of char shall also be 
recorded. The test shall be performed in a location free from drafts. 
The average results of three determinations shall be reported. A plain 
wax candle equivalent to those meeting Federal Specification C-C 91 may 
be substituted for the bunsen burner.
    (2) Type B foam. The test specimens shall be \1/2\ inch in 
thickness, 2 inches in width and approximately 6 inches in length. The 
specimens shall be tested in accordance with American Society for 
Testing Materials Designation D-1692T specification standard.
    (h) Tensile strength and the ultimate elongation--(1) Specimens. The 
test specimens shall be dumbbell shaped, conforming in shape to die I of 
method 4111 of Standard FED-STD-601. The

[[Page 354]]

thickness of the specimen shall be \1/4\ inch. Two specimens shall be 
taken from the center of the sample piece and two from one side, keeping 
the skin surface intact. The thickness shall be measured to the nearest 
0.001 inch by a suitable measurement device such as a vernier caliper 
with a sliding vernier to read 0.001 inch. Care shall be taken not to 
compress or distort the specimen when measuring. The specimens taken 
from the center will be skinless; the others will have skin on one side. 
One-inch bench marks shall be placed midway on the constricted portion 
of the tensile specimen.
    (2) Procedure. (i) The tensile strength of the specimens shall be 
determined in a standard tensile testing machine with a rate of 
separation of jaws set at 2 inches per minute. The bench marks shall be 
followed with a suitable pair of dividers until the specimen ruptures. A 
minimum of 4 specimens shall be tested and if any specimen breaks at the 
clamp or any specimen exhibits any obvious defects, the results obtained 
therewith shall be discarded. A new similar specimen shall then be 
prepared and tested. The tensile strength shall be calculated by 
dividing the breaking load (to the nearest 0.1 pound) by the original 
area of the cross section of the specimen in square inches and the 
result shall be expressed in pounds per square inch. The percent 
ultimate elongation shall be calculated as follows:
D<INF>1</INF> - D <divide> D  x  100              (2)

where:

D = distance between knife edges of bench marker.
D<INF>1</INF> = distance between bench marks at moment of rupture to the 
nearest \1/32\ inch.

    (3) Averaging determinations. The tensile strength in pounds per 
square inch and percent ultimate elongation of four determinations shall 
be averaged for each sample.
    (i) Water absorption--(1) Specimens. Test specimens shall be 4" x 4" 
square and approximately 1" in thickness. The specimen may have the 
natural skin on the top and bottom surfaces.
    (2) Procedure. The specimens shall be weighed and submerged in water 
under a 10-foot head of water (equal to 4.35 psi) at room temperature 
(65 deg.-95  deg.F.) for 48 hours. The specimens shall then be placed in 
a stream of air for the minimum time required to remove visible water 
from the surface, and reweighed. The results shall be calculated in 
terms of pounds of water gain per square foot of total exposed surface.
    (j) Flexibility--(1) The size of the specimen shall be approximately 
1' x 8' with a thickness of \1/4\'<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>\1/16\". The test 
specimens and equipment shall be conditioned for at least 4 hours at 0 
deg.F. <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2  deg.F., and bent 180 deg. around a \1/2\" 
diameter steel mandril within 5 seconds at the test temperature. Care 
shall be taken to avoid warming the test specimens, particularly at or 
near the bend point, in performing the test.
    (k) Oil resistance--(1) Specimens. The test specimens shall be a 
disk approximately 1" in diameter and 1" (approximately) in thickness.
    (2) Procedure. The specimen shall be immersed in fuel oil conforming 
to Navy special grade of Specification MIL-F-859 for 70 hours. The 
specimen shall then be removed, dipped in alcohol and blotted with 
filter paper. The specimen shall then be compared to an untreated 
specimen of similar size for apparent softness and visible swelling.
    (l) Odor. The odor of unicellular polyvinyl chloride foam shall be 
determined by sniffing.

<R05>
Sec. 164.018-11  Approval tests.

    (a) Retroreflective material submitted for Coast Guard approval must 
be tested in accordance with the following test methods described in 
Federal Specification L-S-300:

[[Page 357]]

    (1) Test conditions.
    (2) Test panels.
    (3) Adhesion test method using a 0.79 kg (1.75 lb.) test weight, 
except that one test panel must be immersed in distilled water in a 
covered container for 16 hours before the weight is applied and the 
other test panel must be immersed in salt water (4% NaCl by weight) in a 
covered container for 16 hours before the weight is applied. (This test 
method is required only for retroreflective material that is designed 
for use with an adhesive. If a particular test panel used in testing 
results in a test failure, the retroreflective material will not be 
approved for attachment to material of the type used as the test panel. 
The retroreflective material may nevertheless be approved for use with 
other types of material depending on the results of testing with the 
other panels. See paragraph (d) of this section for a listing of tests 
panels used.)
    (4) Flexibility at standard conditions test method, except that when 
testing Type I material--
    (i) The material must be unmounted;
    (ii) A 1.5 mm (\1/16\-inch) mandrel must be used in place of the 
mandrel described in the test method; and
    (iii) After testing at standard conditions, the material must be 
placed in a chamber at a temperature of -18  deg.C. (0  deg.F.) for at 
least 1 hour and then retested in the chamber at that temperature.
    (5) Reflective intensity.
    (6) Resistance to accelerated weathering test method and subtest 
methods ``reflective intensity after accelerated weathering,'' 
``reflective intensity during rainfall,'' and ``adhesion after 
accelerated weathering.'' (The ``adhesion after accelerated weathering'' 
test method is required only for materials designed for use with an 
adhesive. The ``resistance to accelerated weathering'' test method must 
be performed for 250 hours, if testing Type I material, and for 1,000 
hours if testing Type II material.)
    (7) Resistance to heat, cold, and humidity.
    (8) Fungus resistance.
    (b) Retroreflective material submitted for approval must also be 
tested as follows:
    (1) Resistance to water immersion. Two test panels are used. The 
test panels and test conditions must meet paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) 
of this section. The retroreflective material on each test panel is cut 
with a sharp knife from each corner to the corner diagonally opposite so 
that an ``X'' is formed. The cuts must be made completely through the 
material to the metal panel. One panel is immersed in distilled water in 
a covered container. The other panel is immersed in salt water (4% NaCl 
by weight) in a covered container. After 16 hours in water, the panels 
are removed from the containers, rinsed of deposits, and dried. 
Reflective intensity values at the angles listed in Table 164.018-9 must 
be measured within 2 hours after removal of the panels from the water. 
When measuring the reflective intensity values, the area within 5 mm 
(0.2 in.) of either side of the ``X'' cuts, and within 5 mm of the cut 
edges of the material, must not be counted.
    (2) Abrasion resistance. One test panel is used. The panel and test 
conditions must meet paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. The 
test apparatus must meet Federal Test Method Standard 141, Method 6142, 
except that the brush must be dry. One thousand brush strokes are 
applied to the material. The test panel is then wiped with a clean soft 
cloth. Thereafter, the reflective intensity of the area of the material 
in contact with the brush is measured at the angles listed in Table 
164.018-9.
    (3) Soil resistance and cleanability. One panel is used. The test 
panel and test conditions must meet paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section. A soiling medium is applied to the material as described in 
Federal Test Method Standard 141, Method 6141. The soiled area is then 
covered with a laboratory watch glass or similar device. After 24 hours, 
the material is uncovered and the soil medium wiped off with a clean, 
dry, soft cloth. The material is then wetted with mineral spirits and 
wiped with a cloth soaked in mineral spirits. Thereafter, it is washed 
with a 1 percent (by weight) solution of detergent in warm water and 
rinsed and dried with a clean, dry, soft cloth.

[[Page 358]]

    (c) Each measurement of reflective intensity required in paragraphs 
(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2) of this section must be made using either--
    (1) The L-S-300 procedure for measuring reflective intensity; or
    (2) The procedure for measuring specific intensity per unit area in 
Federal Test Method Standard 370, except that the test apparatus 
arrangement required in L-S-300 must be used.
    (d) If material is designed for use with an adhesive, the 
``adhesion'' test method required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
must be repeated using a 0.79 kg. (1.75 lb.) test weight and using each 
of the following materials as test panels in place of the aluminum test 
panels required by this test method:
    (1) Smooth panel of cured polyester laminating resin meeting MIL-R-
21607 (Types I and II material).
    (2) Cotton drill (Type I material only) meeting CCC-C-426, or cotton 
duck meeting CCC-C-443 (Type I material only).
    (3) Vinyl-nylon laminated cloth meeting MIL-C-43006 (Type I material 
only).
    (4) Vinyl film meeting L-P-375 (Type I material only).
    (5) Rubber coated cloth meeting MIL-C-17415 (Type I material only).
    (e) Each flexible material listed in paragraph (d) of this section 
when used as a test panel must be bonded to a rigid backing.
    (f) Test panel material listed in paragraph (d) of this section 
must--
    (1) Be taken from an item of Coast Guard approved lifesaving 
equipment; or
    (2) Be certified by the manufacturer of the material that it meets 
the applicable specification in paragraph (d) of this section.

the manufacturer or the inspector shall examine each sample component to 
determine that--
    (i) The construction, markings, and workmanship conform to the 
information submitted in the request for acceptance; and
    (ii) The component is not otherwise defective.
    (2) Inspection responsibility. The manufacturer shall ensure that 
the inspection required by paragraph (h)(1) of this section is performed 
by a manufacturer's representative familiar with the performance 
requirements for the component, and all of the production quality 
control requirements. The manufacturer's representative must not be 
responsible for meeting production schedules, or be subject to 
supervision by someone responsible for meeting production schedules.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Accept/reject criteria. (1) A component lot passes production 
testing and is therefore accepted if each sample tested passes each 
test.
    (2) A lot having a production test failure may be accepted if it 
meets the following additional test requirements.
    (i) When the basis of acceptability is an average result, a second 
sampling with an identical number of samples is taken. The results of 
this second sampling must be averaged with the initial results. If the 
average result passes the test, then the lot may be accepted.
    (ii) When the basis of acceptability is individual sample results, a
