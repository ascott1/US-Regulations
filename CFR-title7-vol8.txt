                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2011), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 900.3  Proposals.

    (a) A marketing agreement or a marketing order may be proposed by 
the Secretary or by any other person. If any person other than the 
Secretary proposes a marketing agreement or marketing order, he shall 
file with the Administrator a written application, together with at 
least four copies of the proposal, requesting the Secretary to hold a 
hearing upon the proposal. Upon receipt of such proposal, the

notice shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the grounds for the 
denial.

subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 900.4  Institution of proceeding.

    (a) Filing and contents of the notice of hearing. The proceeding 
shall be instituted by filing the notice of hearing with the hearing 
clerk. The notice of hearing shall contain a reference to the authority 
under which the marketing agreement or marketing order is proposed; 
shall define the scope of the hearing as specifically as may be 
practicable; shall contain either the terms or substance of the proposed 
marketing agreement or marketing order or a description of the subjects 
and issues involved and shall state the industry, area, and class of 
persons to be regulated, the time and place of such hearing, and the 
place where copies of such proposed marketing agreement or marketing 
order may be obtained or examined. The time of the hearing shall not be 
less than 15 days after the date of publication of the notice in the 
Federal Register, as provided in this subpart, unless the Administrator 
shall determine that an emergency exists which requires a shorter period 
of notice, in which case the period of notice shall be that which the 
Administrator may determine to be reasonable in the circumstances: 
Provided, That, in the case of hearings on amendments to marketing 
agreements or marketing orders, the time of the hearing may be less than 
15 days but shall not be less

[[Page 10]]

than 3 days after the date of publication of the notice in the Federal 
Register.
    (b) Giving notice of hearing and supplemental publicity. (1) The 
Administrator shall give or cause to be given notice of hearing in the 
following manner:
    (i) By publication of the notice of hearing in the Federal Register;
    (ii) By mailing a true copy of the notice of hearing to each of the 
persons known to the Administrator, to be interested therein;
    (iii) By issuing a press release containing the complete text or a 
summary of the contents of the notice of hearing and making the same 
available to such newspapers in the area proposed to be subjected to 
regulation as reasonably will tend to bring the ntoice to the attention 
of the persons interested therein;
    (iv) By forwarding copies of the notice of hearing addressed to the 
governors of such of the several States of the United States and to 
executive heads of such of the Territories and possessions of the United 
States as the Administrator, having due regard for the subject matter of 
the proposal and the public interest, shall determine, should be 
notified.
    (2) Legal notice of the hearing shall be deemed to be given if 
notice is given in the manner provided by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section; and failure to give notice in the manner provided in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not affect the 
legality of the notice.
    (c) Record of notice and supplemental publicity. There shall be 
filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing an 
affidavit or certificate of the person giving the notice provided in 
paragraph (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section. In regard to the 
provisions relating to mailing in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, 
a determination by the Administrator that such provisions have been 
complied with shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the 
judge at the hearing. In the alternative, if notice is not given in the 
manner provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section 
there shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at 
the hearing a determination by the Administrator that such notice is 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest with a 
brief statement of the reasons for such determination. Determinations by 
the Administrator as herein provided shall be final.


<R05>
Sec. 900.5  Docket number.

    Each proceeding, immediately following its institution, shall be 
assigned a docket number by the hearing clerk and thereafter the 
proceeding may be referred to by such number.


<R05>
Sec. 900.6  Judges.

    (a) Assignment. No judge who has any pecuniary interest in the 
outcome of a proceeding shall serve as judge in such proceeding.
    (b) Powers of judges. Subject to review by the Secretary, as 
provided elsewhere in this subpart, the judge, in any proceeding, shall 
have power to:
    (1) Rule upon motions and requests;
    (2) Change the time and place of hearing, and adjourn the hearing 
from time to time or from place to place;
    (3) Administer oaths and affirmations and take affidavits;
    (4) Examine and cross-examine witnesses and receive evidence;
    (5) Admit or exclude evidence;
    (6) Hear oral argument on facts or law;
    (7) Do all acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance 
of order at the hearing and the efficient conduct of the proceeding.
    (c) Who may act in absence of judge. In case of the absence of the 
judge or his inability to act, the powers and duties to be performed by 
him under this part in connection with a proceeding may, without 
abatement of the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the Secretary, 
be assigned to any other judge.
    (d) Disqualification of judge. The judge may at any time withdraw as 
judge in a proceeding if he deems himself to be disqualified. Upon the 
filing by an interested person in good faith of a timely and sufficient 
affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of a judge, the Secretary 
shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the 
proceeding, after making such investigation or holding such hearings,

[[Page 11]]

or both, as he may deem appropriate in the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 900.7  Motions and requests.

    (a) General. All motions and requests shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk, except that those made during the course of the hearing 
may be filed with the judge or may be stated orally and made a part of 
the transcript. Except as provided in Sec. 900.15(b) such motions and 
requests shall be addressed to, and ruled on by, the presiding officer 
if made prior to his certification of the transcript pursuant to Sec. 
900.10 or by the Secretary if made thereafter.
    (b) Certification to Secretary. The judge may in his discretion 
submit or certify to the Secretary for decision any motion, request, 
objection, or other question addressed to the judge.


<R05>
Sec. 900.8  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) Time and place. The hearing shall be held at the time and place 
fixed in the notice of hearing, unless the judge shall have changed the 
time or place, in which event the judge shall file with the hearing 
clerk a notice of such change, which notice shall be given in the same 
manner as provided in Sec. 900.4 (relating to the giving of notice of 
the hearing): Provided, That, if the change in time or place of hearing 
is made less than 5 days prior to the date previously fixed for the 
hearing, the judge, either in addition to or in lieu of causing the 
notice of the change to be given, shall announce, or cause to be 
announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed for the 
hearing.
    (b) Appearances--(1) Right to appear. At the hearing, any interested 
person shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in person or 
through his authorized counsel or representative, and to be heard with 
respect to matters relevant and material to the proceeding. Any 
interested person who desires to be heard in person at any hearing under 
these rules shall, before proceeding to testify, state his name, 
address, and occupation. If any such person is appearing through a 
counsel or representative, such person or such counsel or representative 
shall, before proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the 
hearing, state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or 
representative, and the names and addresses and occupations of such 
person and such counsel or representative. Any such person or such 
counsel or representative shall give such other information respecting 
his appearance as the judge may request.
    (2) Debarment of counsel or representative. Wherever, while a 
proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds that a person, acting 
as counsel or representative for any person participating in the 
proceeding, is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge 
may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel 
or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be 
taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or 
suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Provided, That the judge 
may suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of 
enabling the client to obtain other counsel or other representative. In 
case the judge has ordered that a person be precluded from further 
acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the presiding 
officer, within a reasonable time thereafter shall submit to the 
Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding such order 
and shall recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other 
proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after 
notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order, respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings 
before the Secretary, as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
    (3) Failure to appear. If any interested person fails to appear at 
the hearing, he shall be deemed to have waived the right to be heard in 
the proceeding.
    (c) Order of procedure. (1) The judge shall, at the opening of the 
hearing prior to the taking of testimony, have noted as part of the 
record the notice of hearing as filed with the Office of the Federal 
Register and the affidavit or certificate of the giving of notice or the 
determination provided for in Sec. 900.4(c).
    (2) Evidence shall then be received with respect to the matters 
specified in

[[Page 12]]

the notice of the hearing in such order as the judge shall announce.
    (d) Evidence--(1) In general. The hearing shall be publicly 
conducted, and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported 
verbatim.
    (i) Every witness shall, before proceeding to testify, be sworn or 
make affirmation. Cross-examination shall be permitted to the extent 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (ii) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the 
hearing, the judge may limit the number of times any witness may testify 
to the same matter or the amount of corroborative or cumulative 
evidence.
    (iii) The judge shall, insofar as practicable, exclude evidence 
which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not 
of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
    (2) Objections. If a party objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or to any other ruling of the judge during the hearing, he 
shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an 
automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the 
judge. The transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon 
except as ordered by the judge. The ruling of the judge on any objection 
shall be a part of the transcript. Only objections made before the judge 
may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An 
official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be 
admissible as evidence without the production of the person who made or 
prepared the same. Such record or document shall, in the discretion of 
the judge, be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy 
attested by the person having legal custody thereof and accompanied by a 
certificate that such person has the custody.
    (4) Exhibits. All written statements, charts, tabulations, or 
similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after 
identification by the proponent and upon satisfactory showing of the 
authenticity, relevancy, and materiality of the contents thereof, be 
numbered as exhibits and received in evidence and made a part of the 
record. Such exhibits shall be submitted in quadruplicate and in 
documentary form. In case the required number of copies is not made 
available, the judge shall exercise his discretion as to whether said 
exhibits shall, when practicable, be read in evidence or whether 
additional copies shall be required to be submitted within a time to be 
specified by the judge. If the testimony of a witness refers to a 
statute, or to a report or document (including the record of any 
previous hearing) the judge, after inquiry relating to the 
identification of such statute, report, or document, shall determine 
whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and physically be made 
a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it shall be 
incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and material 
matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report or document 
(including the record of any previous hearing) containing immaterial or 
irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be 
excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the 
direction of the presiding officer.
    (5) Official notice. Official notice may be taken of such matters as 
are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any 
other matter of technical, scientific or commercial fact of established 
character: Provided, That interested persons shall be given adequate 
notice, at the hearing or subsequent thereto, of matters so noticed and 
shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are 
inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.
    (6) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a 
brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence 
consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be 
inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be 
considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the 
judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall 
not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of

[[Page 13]]

such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. 
In the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the judge erred in 
excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing 
shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.

[25 FR 5907, June 28, 1960, as amended at 37 FR 1103, Jan. 25, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 900.9  Oral and written arguments.

    (a) Oral argument before judge. Oral argument before the judge shall 
be in the discretion of the judge. Such argument, when permitted, may be 
limited by the judge to any extent that he finds necessary for the 
expeditious disposition of the proceeding and shall be reduced to 
writing and made part of the transcript.
    (b) Briefs, proposed findings and conclusions. The judge shall 
announce at the hearing a reasonable period of time within which 
interested persons may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings and 
conclusions, and written arguments or briefs, based upon the evidence 
received at the hearing, citing, where practicable, the page or pages of 
the transcript of the testimony where such evidence appears. Factual 
material other than that adduced at the hearing or subject to official 
notice shall not be alluded to therein, and, in any case, shall not be 
considered in the formulation of the marketing agreement or marketing 
order. If the person filing a brief desires the Secretary to consider 
any objection made by such person to a ruling of the judge, as provided 
in Sec. 900.8(d), he shall include in the brief a concise statement 
concerning each such objection, referring where practicable, to the 
pertinent pages of the transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 900.10  Certification of the transcript.

    The judge shall notify the hearing clerk of the close of a hearing 
as soon as possible thereafter and of the time for filing written 
arguments, briefs, proposed findings and proposed conclusions, and shall 
furnish the hearing clerk with such other information as may be 
necessary. As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall 
transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the 
transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the 
exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. He 
shall attach to the original transcript of testimony his certificate 
stating that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the transcript is 
a true transcript of the testimony given at the hearing except in such 
particulars as he shall specify; and that the exhibits transmitted are 
all the exhibits as introduced at the hearing with such exceptions as he 
shall specify. A copy of such certificate shall be attached to each of 
the copies of the transcript of testimony. In accordance with such 
certificate the hearing clerk shall note upon the official record copy, 
and cause to be noted on other copies, of the transcript each correction 
detailed therein by adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the 
text as originally transcribed) at the appropriate place any words 
necessary to make the same conform to the correct meaning, as certified 
by the judge. The hearing clerk shall obtain and file certifications to 
the effect that such corrections have been effected in copies other than 
the official record copy.


<R05>
Sec. 900.11  Copies of the transcript.

    (a) During the period in which the proceeding has an active status 
in the Department, a copy of the transcript and exhibits shall be kept 
on file in the office of the hearing clerk, where it shall be available 
for examination during official hours of business. Thereafter said 
transcript and exhibits shall be made available by the hearing clerk for 
examination during official hours of business after prior request and 
reasonable notice to the hearing clerk.
    (b) Transcripts of hearings shall be made available to any person at 
actual cost of duplication.

<R05>
Sec. 900.12  Administrator's recommended decision.

    (a) Preparation. As soon as practicable following the termination of 
the period allowed for the filing of written arguments or briefs and 
proposed findings and conclusions the Administrator shall file with the 
hearing clerk a recommended decision.

[[Page 14]]

    (b) Contents. The Administrator's recommended decision shall 
include: (1) A preliminary statement containing a description of the 
history of the proceedings, a brief explanation of the material issues 
of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, and proposed 
findings and conclusions with respect to such issues as well as the 
reasons or basis therefor; (2) a ruling upon each proposed finding or 
conclusion submitted by interested persons, and (3) an appropriate 
proposed marketing agreement or marketing order effectuating his 
recommendations.
    (c) Exceptions to recommended decision. Immediately following the 
filing of his recommended decision, the Administrator shall give notice 
thereof, and opportunity to file exceptions thereto by publication in 
the Federal Register. Within a period of time specified in such notice 
any interested person may file with the hearing clerk exceptions to the 
Administrator's proposed marketing agreement or marketing order, or 
both, as the case may be, and a brief in support of such exceptions. 
Such exceptions shall be in writing, shall refer, where practicable, to 
the related pages of the transcript and may suggest appropriate changes 
in the proposed marketing agreement or marketing order.
    (d) Omission of recommended decision. The procedure provided in this 
section may be omitted only if the Secretary finds on the basis of the 
record that due and timely execution of his functions imperatively and 
unavoidably requires such omission.


<R05>
Sec. 900.13  Submission to Secretary.

    Upon the expiration of the period allowed for filing exceptions or 
upon request of the Secretary, the hearing clerk shall transmit to the 
Secretary the record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: All 
motions and requests filed with the hearing clerk and rulings thereon; 
the certified transcript; any proposed findings or conclusions or 
written arguments or briefs that may have been filed; the 
Administrator's recommended decision, if any, and such exceptions as may 
have been filed.


<R05>

decision. Such decision shall become a part of the record and shall 
include: (a) A statement of his findings and conclusions, as well as the 
reasons or basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law or 
discretion presented on the record, (b) a ruling upon each proposed

marketing order or (2) a marketing agreement and, if the findings upon 
the record so warrant, a marketing order, the provisions of which shall

commodity or product in the same manner and to the same extent as such 
marketing agreement, which order shall be complete except for its 
effective date and any determinations to be made under Sec. 900.14(b)

Sec. 900.14  Execution and issuance of marketing agreements and 
marketing orders.

    (a) Execution and issuance of marketing agreement. If the Secretary 
has approved a marketing agreement, as provided in Sec. 900.13a, the 
Administrator shall cause copies thereof to be distributed for execution 
by the handlers eligible to become parties thereto. If and when such 
number of the handlers as the Secretary shall deem sufficient shall have 
executed the agreement, the Secretary shall execute the agreement. After 
execution of a marketing agreement, such agreement shall be filed with 
the hearing clerk, and notice thereof, together with notice of the 
effective date, shall be given by publication in the Federal Register. 
The marketing agreement shall not become effective less than 30 days 
after its publication in the Federal Register, unless the Secretary, 
upon good cause

[[Page 15]]

found and published with the agreement, fixes an earlier effective date 
therefor: Provided, That no marketing agreement shall become effective 
as to any person signatory thereto before either (1) it has been filed 
with the Office of the Federal Register, or (2) such person has received 
actual notice that the Secretary has executed the agreement and the 
effective date of the marketing agreement.
    (b) Issuance of marketing order with marketing agreement. Whenever, 
as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary executes a 
marketing agreement, and handlers also have executed the same as 
provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, he shall, if he finds that it will 
tend to effectuate the purposes of the Act, issue and make effective the 
marketing order, if any, which was filed as a part of his decision 
pursuant to Sec. 900.13a: Provided, That the issuance of such order 
shall have been approved or favored by producers as required by section 
8c(8) of the act.
    (c) Issuance of marketing order without marketing agreement. If, 
despite the failure or refusal of handlers to sign the marketing 
agreement, as provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, the Secretary makes 
the determinations required under section 8c(9) of the Act, the 
Secretary shall issue and make effective the marketing order, if any, 
which was filed as a part of his decision pursuant to Sec. 900.13a.
    (d) Effective date of marketing order. No marketing order shall 
become effective less than 30 days after its publication in the Federal 
Register, unless the Secretary, upon good cause found and published with 
the order, fixes an earlier effective date therefor: Provided, That no 
marketing order shall become effective as to any person sought to be 
charged thereunder before either (1) it has been filed with the Office 
of the Federal Register, or (2) such person has received actual notice 
of the issuance and terms of the marketing order.
    (e) Notice of issuance. After issuance of a marketing order, such 
order shall be filed with the hearing clerk, and notice therof, together 
with notice of the effective date, shall be given by publication in the 
Federal Register. (7 U.S.C. 610(c).)

    (3) Oral argument. Unless a written application for oral argument is 
filed by a party with the hearing clerk not later than the time fixed 
for filing papers in opposition to the motion, it shall be considered 
that the party does

not desire oral argument. The granting of a request to make oral 
argument shall rest in the discretion of the Judge.

<R05>
Sec. 900.52b  Amended pleadings.

    At any time before the close of the hearing the petition or answer 
may be amended, but the hearing shall, at the request of the adverse 
party, be adjourned or recessed for such reasonable time as the judge

Amendments subsequent to the first amendment or subsequent to the filing 
of an answer may be made only with leave of the judge or with the 
written consent of the adverse party.


<R05>
Sec. 900.53  Withdrawal of petition.

    If, at any time after the petition is filed, the petitioner desires 
to withdraw the same, he shall file with the hearing clerk (or, if filed 
during the course of a hearing, with the judge) a written request for 
permission to withdraw. The judge may, in his discretion, thereupon 
dismiss the petition without further procedure: Provided, That, if the 
request to withdraw is filed after a hearing has been opened, permission 
to withdraw shall be granted only in exceptional circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 900.54  Docket number.

    Each proceeding, immediately following its institution, shall be 
assigned a docket number by the hearing clerk and thereafter the

<R05>
Sec. 900.55  Judges.

    (a) Assignment. No judge who has any pecuniary interest in the 
outcome of the proceeding, or who has participated in any investigation 
preceding the institution of the proceeding, shall serve as judge in 
such proceeding.
    (b) Conduct. The judge shall conduct the proceeding in a fair and 
impartial manner and shall not discuss ex parte the merits of the 
proceeding with any person who is or who has been connected in any 
manner with the proceeding in an advocative or investigative capacity.
    (c) Powers of judges. Subject to review by the Secretary, as 
provided elsewhere in this subpart, the judge shall have power to:
    (1) Rule upon motions and requests;
    (2) Adjourn the hearing from time to time, and change the time and 
place of hearing;
    (3) Administer oaths and affirmations and take affidavits;

at the hearing and the efficient conduct of the proceeding.
    (d) Who may act in absence of judge. In case of the absence of the 
judge or his inability to act, the powers and duties to be performed by 
him under these rules of practice in connection with a proceeding may, 
without abatement of the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the 
Secretary, be assigned to any other judge.
    (e) Disqualification of judge. The judge may at any time withdraw as 
judge in a proceeding if he deems himself to be disqualified. Upon the 
filing by an interested person in good faith of a timely and sufficient 
affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of a judge, the Secretary 
shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the 
proceeding, after making such investigation or holding such hearings, or 
both, as he may deem appropriate in the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 900.56  Consolidated hearings.

    At the discretion of the judge, hearings upon two or more petitions 
pertaining to the same order may be consolidated, and the evidence taken 
at such consolidated hearing may be embodied in a single record.


<R05>
Sec. 900.57  Intervention.

    Intervention in proceedings subject to this subpart shall not be 
allowed, except that, in the discretion of the Secretary or the judge, 
any person (other than the petitioner) showing a substantial interest in 
the outcome of a proceeding shall be permitted to participate in the 
oral argument and to file a brief.


<R05>
Sec. 900.58  Prehearing conferences.

    In any proceeding in which it appears that such procedure will 
expedite the proceeding, the judge, at any time prior to the 
commencement of or during the course of the hearing, may request the 
parties or their counsel to appear at a conference before him to 
consider (a) the simplification of issues; (b) the possibility of 
obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents which will avoid 
unnecessary proof; (c) the limitation of the number of expert or other 
witnesses; and (d) such other matters as may expedite and aid in the 
disposition of the proceeding. No transcript of such conference shall be 
made, but the judge shall prepare and file for the record a written 
summary of the action taken at the conference, which shall incorporate 
any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties at the 
conference or as a result of the conference. If the circumstances are 
such that a conference is impracticable, the judge may request the 
parties to correspond with him for the purpose of accomplishing any of 
the objects set forth in this section. The judge shall forward copies of 
letters and documents to the parties as the circumstances require. 
Correspondence in such negotiations shall not be a part of the record, 
but the judge shall submit a written summary for the record if any 
action is taken.


<R05>
Sec. 900.59  Motions and requests.

    (a) General. (1) All motions and requests shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk, except that those made during the course of an oral 
hearing may be filed with the judge or may be stated orally and made a 
part of the transcript.
    (2) The judge is authorized to rule upon all motions and requests 
filed or made prior to the transmittal by the hearing clerk to the 
Secretary of the record as provided in this subpart. The Secretary shall 
rule upon all motions and requests filed after that time.
    (b) Certification of motions. The submission or certification of any 
motion, request, objection, or other question to the Secretary, as 
provided in this subpart, shall be in the discretion of the judge.

[25 FR 5907, June 28, 1960, as amended at 38 FR 29798, Oct. 29, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 900.60  Oral hearings before judge.

    (a) Time and place. The judge shall set a time and place for hearing 
and shall file with the hearing clerk a notice stating the time and 
place of hearing. If any change in the time or place of hearing becomes 
necessary, it shall be made by the judge, who, in such event, shall file 
with the hearing clerk a notice of the change. Such notice shall be 
served upon the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral 
hearing and made a part of the transcript.

[[Page 24]]

    (b) Appearances--(1) Representation. In any proceeding under the 
act, the parties may appear in person or by counsel or other 
representative. The Department, if represented by counsel, shall be 
represented by an attorney assigned by the General Counsel of the 
Department, and such attorney shall present or supervise the 
presentation of the position of the Department.
    (2) Debarment of counsel or representative. Whenever, while a 
proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds that a person acting 
as counsel or representative for any party to the proceeding is guilty 
of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge may order that such 
person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in 
such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such 
order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending 
disposition of the appeal: Provided, That the judge may suspend the 
proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the client 
to obtain other counsel or representative. In case the judge has issued 
an order precluding a person from further acting as counsel or 
representative in the proceeding, the judge, within a reasonable time 
thereafter, shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the issuance of the order and shall recommend 
what action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such 
person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the 
Secretary. Thereafter, the Secretary may, after notice and an 
opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the appearance of 
such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the 
Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
    (3) Failure to appear. If the petitioner, after being duly notified, 
fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have authorized 
the dismissal of the proceeding, without further procedure, and with or 
without prejudice as the judge may determine. In the event that the 
petitioner appears at the hearing and no representative of the 
Department appears, the judge shall proceed ex parte to hear the 
evidence of the petitioner. Provided, That failure on the part of such 
representative of the Department to appear at a hearing shall not be 
deemed to be waiver of the Department's right to file suggested findings 
of fact, conclusions and order; to be served with a copy of the judge's 
initial decision and to appeal to the Secretary with respect thereto.
    (c) Order of proceeding. Except as may be determined otherwise by 
the judge, the petitioner shall proceed first at the hearing.
    (d) Evidence--(1) In general. The hearing shall be publicly 
conducted, and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported 
verbatim.
    (i) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be upon oath or 
affirmation and subject to cross-examination.
    (ii) Any witness may, in the discretion of the judge, be examined 
separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be 
parties to the proceeding.
    (iii) The judge shall exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence 
which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not 
of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
    (2) Objections. If a party objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or 
cross-examination, or any other ruling of the judge, he shall state 
briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception 
will follow which may be pursued in an appeal pursuant to Sec. 900.65 
by the party adversely affected by the judge's ruling.
    (3) Depositions. The deposition of any witness shall be admitted, in 
the manner hereinafter provided in and subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 900.61.
    (4) Affidavits. Except as is otherwise provided in this subpart, 
affidavits may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible 
and the parties agree (which may be determined by their failure to make 
timely objections) that affidavits may be used.
    (5) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An 
official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be 
admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or 
prepared the same. Such record or document shall, in the

[[Page 25]]

discretion of the judge, be evidenced by an official publication thereof 
or by a copy attested by the person having legal custody thereof and 
accompanied by a certificate that such person has the custody.
    (6) Exhibits. All written statements, charts, tabulations, or 
similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after 
identification by the proponent and upon a satisfactory showing of the 
admissibility of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits and 
received in evidence and made a part of the record. Except where the 
judge finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of 
each exhibit, in addition to the original, shall be filed with the judge 
for the use of each other party to the proceeding. The judge shall 
advise the parties as to the exact number of copies which will be 
required to be filed and shall make and have noted on the record the 
proper distribution of the copies. If the testimony of a witness refers 
to a statute, or to a report, document, or transcript, the judge, after 
inquiry relating to the identification of such statute, report, 
document, or transcript, shall determine whether the same shall be 
produced at the hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as 
an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by 
reference. If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is 
embraced in a report, document, or transcript containing immaterial or 
irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be 
excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the 
direction of the judge.
    (7) Official notice. Official notice will be taken of such matters 
as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any 
other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established 
character: Provided, That the parties shall be given adequate notice, at 
the hearing or by reference in the judge's report or the tentative order 
or otherwise, of matters so noticed, and (except where official notice 
is taken, for the first time in the proceeding, in the final order) 
shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are 
erroneously noticed.
    (8) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a 
brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence 
consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be 
inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be 
considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the 
judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall 
not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such 
evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In 
the latter event, if on appeal the Secretary decides that the judge 
erred in excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, 
the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.
    (e) Transcript. Transcripts of hearings shall be made available to 
any person at actual cost of duplication.

FR 10829, Mar. 11, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 900.61  Depositions.

    (a) Procedure in lieu of deposition. Before any party may have 
testimony taken by deposition, said party shall, if practicable, submit 
to the other party an affidavit which shall set forth the facts to which 
the witness would testify, if the deposition should be taken. If, after 
examination of such affidavit, the other party agrees, or (within 10 
days after submission of the affidavit) fails to object, that the 
affidavit may be used in lieu of the deposition, the judge shall admit 
the affidavit in evidence and shall not order the deposition to be 
taken.
    (b) Application for taking deposition. Upon the application of a 
party to the proceeding, the judge may, at any time after the filing of 
the moving paper, order, under the facsimile signature of the Secretary, 
the taking of testimony by deposition. The application shall be in 
writing and shall be filed with the hearing clerk and shall set forth: 
(1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name and 
address of the person (referred to hereinafter in

[[Page 26]]

this section as the judge), qualified under the rules in this part to 
take depositions, before whom the proposed examination is to be made; 
(3) the proposed time and place of the examination, which shall be at 
least 15 days after the date of the mailing of the application; and (4) 
the reasons why such deposition should be taken.
    (c) Judge's order for taking deposition. If, after the examination 
of the application, the judge is of the opinion that the deposition 
should be taken, he shall order its taking. The order shall be filed 
with the hearing clerk and shall be served upon the parties and shall 
state: (1) The time and place of the examination (which shall not be 
less than 10 days after the filing of the order); (2) the name of the 
judge before whom the examination is to be made; (3) the name of the 
deponent. The judge and the time and place need not be the same as those 
suggested in the application.
    (d) Qualifications of judge. The deposition shall be taken before 
the judge, or before a judge authorized by the law of the United States 
or by the law of the place of the examination to administer oaths, or 
before a judge authorized by the Secretary to administer oaths.
    (e) Procedure on examination. (1) The deponent shall be examined 
under oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination. The 
testimony of the deponent shall be recorded by the judge or by some 
person under his direction and in his presence. In lieu of oral 
examination, parties may transmit written interrogatories to the judge 
prior to the examination and the judge shall propound such 
interrogatories to the deponent.
    (2) The applicant must arrange for the examination of the witness 
either by oral examination or by written interrogatories. If it is found 
by the judge, upon the protest of a party to the proceeding, that such 
party has his residence and his place of business more than 100 miles 
from the place of the examination and that it would constitute an undue 
hardship upon such party to be represented at the examination, the 
applicant will be required to conduct the examination by means of 
interrogatories. When the examination is conducted by means of 
interrogatories, copies of the interrogatories shall be served upon the 
other parties to the proceeding at least five days prior to the date set 
for the examination, and the other parties shall be afforded an 
opportunity to file with the judge cross-interrogatories at any time 
prior to the time of the examination.
    (f) Certification by judge. The judge shall certify on the 
deposition that the deponent was duly sworn by him and that the 
deposition is a true record of the deponent's testimony. He shall then 
securely seal the deposition, together with two copies thereof, in an 
envelope and mail the same by registered mail to the hearing clerk.
    (g) Use of depositions. A deposition ordered and taken in accord 
with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under 
the act if the judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and 
(1) that the witness is dead; or (2) that the witness is at a distance 
greater than 100 miles from the place of hearing, unless it appears that 
the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the 
deposition; or (3) that the witness is unable to attend or testify 
because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or (4) that the 
party offering the deposition has endeavored to procure the attendance 
of the witness by subpena but has been unable to do so; or (5) that such 
exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the 
interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. If a 
deposition has been taken, and the party upon whose application it was 
taken refuses to offer it in evidence, the other party may offer the 
deposition, or any part thereof, in evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 900.62  Subpenas.

    (a) Issuance of subpenas. The attendance of witnesses and the 
production of documentary evidence from any place in the United States 
on behalf of any party to the proceeding may, by subpena, be required at 
any designated place of hearing. Subpenas may be issued by the Secretary 
or by the judge, under the facsimile signature of the Secretary, upon a 
reasonable showing by the applicant of the grounds, necessity, and 
reasonable scope thereof.

[[Page 27]]

    (b) Application for subpena duces tecum. Subpenas for the production 
of documentary evidence, unless issued by the judge upon his own motion, 
shall be issued only upon a certified written application. Such 
application shall specify, as exactly as possible, the documents desired 
and shall show their competency, relevancy, and materiality and the 
necessity for their production.
    (c) Service of subpenas. Subpenas may be served (1) by a United 
States Marshal or his deputy, or (2) by any other person who is not less 
than 18 years of age, or (3) by registering and mailing a copy of the 
subpena addressed to the person to be served at his or its last known 
residence or principal place of business or residence. Proof of service 
may be made by the return of service on the subpena by the United States 
Marshal or his deputy; or, if served by an individual other than a 
United States Marshal or his deputy, by an affidavit of such person 
stating that he personally served a copy of the subpena upon the person 
named therein; or, if service was by registered mail, by an affidavit 
made by the person mailing the subpena that it was mailed as provided in 
this paragraph and by the signed return post office receipt: Provided, 
That, if the subpena is issued on behalf of the Department, the return 
receipt without an affidavit of mailing shall be sufficient proof of 
service. In making personal service, the person making service shall 
leave a copy of the subpena with the person subpenaed; the original, 
bearing or accompanied by the required proof of service, shall be 
returned to the official who issued the same.

<R05>
Sec. 900.63  Fees and mileage.

    Witnesses who are subpenaed and who appear in such proceeding, 
including witnesses whose depositions are taken, shall be paid the same 
fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United 
States, and persons taking depositions shall be entitled to the same 
fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States, 
to be paid by the party at whose request the deposition is taken. 
Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance 
the witnesses appear, and claims therefor, as to witnesses subpenaed on 
behalf of the Department, shall be proved before the person issuing the 
subpena, and, as to witnesses subpenaed on behalf of any other party, 
shall be presented to such party.


<R05>
Sec. 900.64  The Judge's decision.

    (a) Corrections to and certification of transcript. (1) At such time 
as the judge may specify, but not later than the time fixed for filing 
proposed findings of fact, conclusions and order, or briefs, as the case 
may be, the parties may file with the judge proposed corrections to the 
transcript.
    (2) As soon as practicable after the filing of proposed findings of 
fact, conclusions and order, or briefs, as the case may be, the judge 
shall file with the hearing clerk his certificate indicating any 
corrections to be made in the transcript, and stating that, to the best 
of his knowledge and belief, the transcript, as corrected, is a true, 
correct, and complete transcript of the testimony given at the hearing, 
and that the exhibits are all the exhibits properly a part of the 
hearing record. The original of such certificate shall be attached to 
the original transcript and a copy of such certificate shall be served 
upon each of the parties by the hearing clerk who shall also enter onto 
the transcript (without obscuring the text) any correction noted in the 
certification.
    (b) Proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and orders. Within 10 
days (unless the judge shall have announced at the hearing a shorter or 
longer period of time) after the transcript has been filed with the 
hearing clerk, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, each party 
may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings of fact, conclusions, 
and order, based solely upon the evidence of record, and briefs in 
support thereof.
    (c) Judge's Decision. The judge, within a reasonable time after the 
termination of the period allowed for the filing of proposed findings of 
fact, conclusions,and orders, and briefs in support thereof, shall 
prepare upon the basis of

[[Page 28]]

the record, and shall file with the hearing clerk, his initial decision, 
a copy of which shall be served by the hearing clerk, upon each of the 
parties. Such decision shall become final without further proceedings 35 
days after the date of service thereof, unless there is an appeal to the 
Secretary by a party to the proceeding: Provided, however, That no 
decision shall be final for the purpose of judicial review except a 
final decision issued by the Secretary pursuant to an appeal by a party 
to the proceeding.

[25 FR 5907, June 28, 1960, as amended at 38 FR 29799, Oct. 29, 1973; 67 
FR 10830, Mar. 11, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 900.65  Appeals to Secretary: Transmittal of record.

    (a) Filing of appeal. Any party who disagrees with a judge's 
decision or any part thereof, may appeal the decision to the Secretary 
by filing an appeal petition with the Hearing Clerk within 30 days after 
service of said decision upon said party. Each issue set forth in the 
appeal, and the arguments thereon, shall be separately numbered; shall 
be plainly and concisely stated; and shall contain detailed citations of 
the record, statutes, regulations and authorities being relied upon in 
support thereof. The appeal petition shall be served upon the other 
party to the proceeding by the hearing clerk.
    (b) Argument before Secretary--(1) Oral argument. A party bringing 
an appeal may request within the prescribed time period for filing such 
appeal, an opportunity for oral argument before the Secretary. Failure 
to make such request in writing, within the prescribed time period, 
shall be deemed a waiver of oral argument. The Secretary, in his 
discretion, may grant, refuse or limit any request for oral argument on 
appeal.
    (2) Scope of argument. Argument to be heard on appeal, whether oral 
or in a written brief, shall be limited to the issues raised by the 
appeal, except that if the Secretary determines that additional issues 
should be argued, the parties shall be given reasonable notice of such 
determination, so as to permit preparation of adequate arguments on all 
the issues to be argued.
    (c) Response. Within 20 days after service of an appeal brought by a 
party to the proceeding, any other party may file a response in support 
of or in opposition to such appeal.
    (d) Transmittal of record. Whenever an appeal is filed by a party to 
the proceeding, the hearing clerk shall transmit to the Secretary the 
record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: The pleadings; any 
motions and requests filed, and the rulings thereon; the transcript of 
the testimony taken at the hearing, as well as the exhibits filed in 
connection therewith; any statements filed under the shortened 
procedure; any documents or papers filed in connection with prehearing 
conferences; such proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and orders, 
and briefs in support thereof, as may have been filed in connection with 
the hearing; the judge's initial decision; and the appeal petition; 
briefs in support thereof, and responses thereto as may have been filed 
in the proceeding.

[38 FR 29799, Oct. 29, 1973, as amended at 67 FR 10830, Mar. 11, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 900.66  Consideration of appeal by the Secretary and issuance 
of final order.

    (a) Consideration of appeal. As soon as practicable after the 
receipt of the record from the hearing clerk, or, in case oral argument 
was had, as soon as practicable thereafter, the Secretary, upon the 
basis of and after due consideration of the record, shall rule on the 
appeal. If the Secretary decides that no change or modification of the 
judge's decision is warranted, he may adopt the Judge's decision as the 
final order of the Secretary, preserving any right of the party bringing 
the appeal to seek judicial review of such decision in the proper forum. 
At no stage of the proceeding between its institution and the issuance 
of the order shall the Secretary discuss ex parte the merits of the 
proceeding with any person who is connected with the proceeding in an 
advocative or an investigative capacity, or with any representative of 
such person: Provided, however, That the Secretary may discuss the 
merits of the proceeding with such a person if all

[[Page 29]]

parties to the proceeding, or their representatives, have been given an 
opportunity to be present. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions 
of this section, a memorandum or other communication from any party, or 
from any person acting on behalf of any party, which relates to the 
merits of the proceeding, receives the personal attention of the 
Secretary (or, if an official other than the Secretary is to issue the 
order, then of such other official) during the pendency of the 
proceeding, such memorandum or communication shall be regarded as 
argument made in the proceeding and shall be filed with the hearing 
clerk, who shall serve a copy thereof upon the opposite party to file a 
reply thereto.

Sec. 900.302  Associations eligible to vote.

    (a) Any association of producers, not previously determined to be a 
cooperative association may file an application for a determination as 
to whether it is a cooperative association and thus eligible to vote in 
a referendum. Such application shall be filed with the Administrator at 
least 60 days prior to the holding of the referendum: Provided, however, 
That the Administrator may permit the filing of an application in less 
than 60 days when, in the opinion of the Administrator, such filing 
would not delay the conduct of the referendum.
    (b) Within a time fixed by the referendum agent, but not later than 
5 days prior to the final date for balloting, each cooperative 
association electing to vote shall, upon the request of the referendum 
agent, furnish to him a certified list showing the name and address of 
each producer for whom it claims the right to vote and the plant at 
which such person's milk was received during the representative period.


<R05>
Sec. 900.303  Conduct of referendum.

    The referendum shall be conducted by mail in the manner prescribed 
in this subpart. The referendum agent may utilize such personnel or 
agencies of the Department as are deemed necessary by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 900.304  Who may vote.

    (a) Each producer shall be entitled to only one vote and to cast one 
ballot in each referendum; and no person who may claim to be a producer 
shall be refused a ballot. Each producer casting more than one ballot 
with conflicting votes shall thereby invalidate all ballots cast by such 
producer in such referendum. Each ballot cast shall contain a 
certification by the person casting the ballot that he is a producer.
    (b) Except as provided in section 8c(5)(B) of the act, as amended,

association. A cooperative association shall submit, with its ballot, a 
certified copy of the resolution authorizing the casting of the ballot. 
Each such cooperative association entitled to vote in a referendum

invalidate all ballots cast by such voter in such referendum.
    (c) Voting by proxy or agent, or in any manner, except by the 
producer or cooperative association will not be permitted; however, a 
producer which is other than an individual may cast its ballot by a 
person who is duly authorized and such ballot shall contain a 
certification by such person that the person on whose behalf the ballot 
is cast is a producer.


<R05>
Sec. 900.305  Duties of referendum agent.

    The referendum agent shall also:
    (a) For purposes of mailing, prepare a record of producers which 
will disclose the name of each such person, his address, the name of the 
handler who received the producer's milk during the representative 
period, and the name of the cooperative association, if any, which 
claims the right to vote for the producer. Such record may be compiled 
from readily available sources, including the following:
    (1) Records of the Department;
    (2) Producer records supplied by handlers;
    (3) Health authority records;
    (4) Certifications signed by dairy farmers who claim to be 
producers;
    (5) Any other reliable sources of information which may be available 
to the referendum agent.
    (b) Apply, as a guide, the following criteria in preparing a record 
of producers:
    (1) When the order requires approval by an appropriate health 
authority before a person meets the definition of producer, only those 
persons having such approval and who otherwise meet

[[Page 39]]

the definition may be regarded as producers. When the definition of 
producer requires the shipment of milk to a handler or a plant as well 
as health authority approval, only those persons having such approval 
and whose milk was received by a handler or at a plant may be regarded 
as producers.
    (2) When the order requries shipment to a handler or to a plant, 
without regard to health authority approval, a person may not be 
regarded as a producer, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section, unless his name appears on the handler's producer records.
    (3) In the case of a producer that is other than an individual, the 
business unit shall be regarded as the producer.
    (4) No person may be included in the record more than once although 
he may operate more than one farm, hold more than one health authority 
approval, or appear on more than one handler's producer records.
    (5) In the event the health authority records are not available, are 
inaccurate, or are incomplete, the appearance of the producer's name on 
a handler's records as an approved producer shall be prima facie 
evidence of health authority approval.
    (6) In the event any handler refuses or fails to make his records 
available to the referendum agent, a certification signed by the 
producer shall be regarded by the referendum agent as prima facie 
evidence that such person is eligible to vote.
    (c) Verify the information supplied by each cooperative association 
which wishes to vote on behalf of producers, as follows:
    (1) Examine the records of the cooperative association for the 
purpose of ascertaining whether each producer claimed by the cooperative 
association is a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with the 
cooperative association.
    (2) Identify the persons ascertained to be members of, stockholders 
in, or under contract with a cooperative association which wishes to 
vote on behalf of its producers with the names of producers which appear 
on the record compiled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) In determining whether a cooperative association may vote on 
behalf of a producer the following criteria shall be used:
    (i) The cooperative association may vote for each producer who is a 
member of, stockholder in, or under contract with such cooperative 
association on the date of the order directing that the referendum be 
conducted.
    (ii) The cooperative association may cast only one ballot for all 
such producers.
    (iii) Whenever more than one cooperative association claims the 
right to vote for a producer only the cooperative association which 
furnished evidence satisfactory to the referendum agent that such 
association was in fact marketing the milk of the producer on the date 
of the referendum order may vote for such producer.


<R05>
Sec. 900.306  Notice of the referendum.

    (a) The referendum agent shall at least 5 days prior to the final 
date for balloting:
    (1) Mail to each cooperative association which has elected to cast a 
ballot on behalf of its producers and to each of all other known 
producers, a notice of the referendum which will include instructions 
for completing the ballot, a statement as to the time within which the 
ballot must be mailed to, and received by, the referendum agent, a copy 
of the final decision, and a ballot containing a description of the 
terms and conditions of the order.
    (2) Give public notice of the referendum:
    (i) By furnishing press releases and other information to available 
media of public information (including but not limited to press, radio, 
and television facilities) serving the area, announcing the time within 
which ballots must be completed and mailed to and received by the 
referendum agent, eligibility requirements, where additional information 
may be procured, and other pertinent information; and

Sec. 900.308  Tabulation of ballots.

    (a) General. The referendum agent shall verify the information 
supplied with each ballot. If he ascertains that the person who cast the 
ballot was eligible to do so, that the ballot is complete and was mailed 
and received within the prescribed time, the ballot shall be eligible to 
be counted. If the referendum agent ascertains that the person who cast 
the ballot was not eligible to do so, or if the producer who cast the 
ballot was a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with a 
cooperative association which cast a valid ballot, or if the ballot is 
not completed or cast in accordance with instructions, or if the ballot 
was not mailed to or received by the referendum agent within the 
prescribed time, the ballot shall be marked ``disqualified'' with a 
notation on the ballot as to the reason for the disqualification. The 
total number of ballots cast, including the disqualified ballots, shall 
be ascertained. The number of eligible ballots cast approving and the 
number of eligible ballots cast disapproving the issuance of the order 
shall also be ascertained. The ballots marked ``disqualified'' shall not 
be considered as approving or disapproving the issuance of the order, 
and the persons who cast such ballots shall not be regarded as 
participating in the referendum.
    (b) Individual-handler pool provisions. Whenever separate approval 
of the pooling provisions of the order is required by section 
608c(5)(B)(i) of the act, any ballot which approves the issuance of the 
order and disapproves the pooling provisions, or approves the pooling 
provisions and disapproves the issuance of the order, shall be 
disqualified; and the referendum agent shall mark the ballot 
accordingly.
    (c) Record of results of the referendum. The referendum agent shall 
notify the Administrator of the number of eligible ballots cast, the 
count of the votes, the number of disqualified ballots and the number of 
producers who were eligible to cast ballots. The referendum agent shall 
seal the ballots, including those marked ``disqualified'', the list of 
eligible voters and tabulation of ballots, and shall transmit to the 
Administrator a complete detailed report of all action taken in 
connection with the referendum together with all the ballots cast and 
all other information furnished to or compiled by the referendum agent.
    (d) Announcement of the results of the referendum. Announcement of 
the results of the referendum will be made only at the direction of the 
Secretary. The referendum agent, or others who assist in the referendum, 
shall not disclose the results of the referendum or the total number of 
ballots cast.

                    Subpart_Assessment of Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 900.700  Exemption from assessments.

    (a) This section specifies criteria for identifying persons eligible 
to obtain an assessment exemption for marketing promotion, and 
procedures for applying for an exemption under 7 CFR parts 906, 915, 
916, 917, 922, 923, 924, 925, 927, 929, 930, 931, 932, 947, 948, 955, 
956, 958, 959, 966, 979, 981, 982, 984, 985, 987, 989, 993, and such 
other parts (included in 7 CFR parts 905 through 998) covering marketing 
orders for fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops as may be established 
or amended to include market promotion. For the purposes of this 
section, the term ``assessment period'' means fiscal period, fiscal 
year, crop year, or marketing year as defined under these parts; the 
term ``marketing promotion'' means marketing research and development 
projects, and marketing promotion, including paid advertising, designed 
to assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, and 
consumption of the applicable commodity.
    (b) Any handler who operates under an approved National Organic 
Program (7 CFR part 205)(NOP) process system plan, only handles or 
markets organic products that are eligible to be labeled 100 percent 
organic under the NOP, and are produced on a certified organic farm as 
defined in Sec. 2103 of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 
U.S.C.

[[Page 47]]

6502) and the NOP regulations issued under that Act, is not a split 
operation, and is subject to assessments under a part or parts specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be exempt from the portion of 
the assessment applicable to marketing promotion, including paid 
advertising. Any handler so exempted shall be obligated to pay the 
portion of the assessment for other authorized activities under such 
part or parts.
    (c) To be exempt from paying assessments for these purposes under a 
part or parts, the handler shall submit an application to the committee 
or board established under the applicable part or parts prior to or 
during the assessment period. This application, FV-649, ``Certified 
Organic Handler Application for Exemption from Market Promotion 
Assessments Paid Under Federal Marketing Orders,'' shall include: The 
applicable committee or board and Federal marketing order number; the 
date; handler's name; company name and address; telephone and fax 
numbers; an optional e-mail address; certification that the applicant is 
not a split operation, as defined by the Organic Foods Production Act of 
1990 (OFPA) (7 U.S.C. 6502) and the NOP; certification that the 
applicant only handles and markets organic products eligible to be 
labeled 100 percent organic under the NOP, and that the applicant is 
subject to assessments under the Federal marketing order program for 
which the exemption is requested. The applicant shall list all 
commodities handled or marketed. The applicant shall list the number of 
producers for whom they handle or market. The applicant shall attach a 
copy of their organic handler operation certificate and all applicable 
producer certificates provided by a USDA-accredited certifying agent 
under the OFPA and the NOP. The applicant shall certify that the handler 
meets all of the applicable requirements for an assessment exemption as 
provided in this section. The handler shall file the application with 
the committee or board, prior to or during the applicable assessment 
period, and annually thereafter, as long as the handler continues to be 
eligible for the exemption. If the person complies with the requirements 
of this section and is eligible for an assessment exemption, the 
committee or board will approve the exemption and notify the applicant, 
in writing, within the applicable timeframe as follows: For exemption 
requests received on or before August 15, 2005, the committee or board 
will have 60 days to approve the exemption request; after August 15, 
2005, the committee or board will have 30 days to approve the exemption 
request. If the application is disapproved, the committee or board will 
notify the applicant, in writing, of the reason(s) for disapproval 
within the same timeframes.
    (d) The applicable assessment rate for any handler approved for an 
exemption shall be computed by dividing the committee's or board's 
estimated non-marketing promotion expenditures by the committee's or 
board's estimated total expenditures approved by the Secretary and 
applying that percentage to the assessment rate applicable to all 
persons for the assessment period. The committee's or board's estimated 
non-marketing promotion expenditures shall exclude the direct costs of 
marketing promotion and the portion of committee's or board's 
administrative and overhead costs (e.g., salaries, supplies, printing, 
equipment, rent, contractual expenses, and other applicable costs) to 
support and administer the marketing promotion activities. If a 
committee or board does not plan to conduct any market promotion 
activities in a fiscal year, the committee or board may submit a 
certification to that effect to the Secretary, and as long as no 
assessments for such fiscal year are used for marketing promotion 
projects, or the administration of projects funded by a previous fiscal 
period's assessments, the committee or board may assess all handlers, 
regardless of their organic status, the full assessment rate applicable 
to the assessment period. For each assessment period, the Secretary 
shall review the portion of the assessment rate applicable to marketing 
promotion for persons eligible for an exemption and, if appropriate, 
approve the assessment rate.
    (e) When the requirements of this section for exemption no longer 
apply to a handler, the handler shall inform the committee or board 
within 30 days

[[Page 48]]

and pay the full assessment on all remaining assessable product for all 
committee or board assessments from the date the handler no longer is 
eligible to the end of the assessment period.
    (f) Within 30 days following the applicable assessment period, the 
committee or board shall re-compute the applicable assessment rate for 
handlers exempt under this section based on the actual expenditures 
incurred during the applicable assessment period. The Secretary shall 
review, and if appropriate, approve any change in the portion of the 
assessment rate for market promotion applicable to exempt handlers, and 
authorize adjustments for any overpayments.
    (g) The exemption will apply at the beginning of the next assessable 
period following notification of approval of the assessment exemption, 
in writing, by the committee or board.

    (a) Each handler who first handles fruit shall pay to committee, 
upon demand, such handler's pro rata share of the expenses which the 
Secretary finds will be incurred by the committee for the maintenance 
and functioning, during each fiscal period, of the committee established 
under this subpart. Each such handler's share of such expenses shall be 
that proportion thereof which the total quantity of fruit shipped by 
such handler as the first handler thereof during the applicable fiscal 
period is of the total quantity of fruit so shipped by all handlers 
during the same fiscal period. The Secretary shall fix the rate of 
assessment per standard packed carton of fruit to be paid by each such 
handler. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning 
of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period 
it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof 
are suspended or become inoperative.
    (b) At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may 
increase the rate of assessment so that the sum of money collected 
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be adequate to cover 
the said expenses. Such increase shall be applicable to all fruit 
shipped during the given fiscal period. In order to provide funds to 
carry out the functions of the committee established under Sec. 905.19, 
handlers may make advance payment of assessments.
    (c) In the case of an extreme emergency, the committee may borrow 
money on a short term basis to provide funds for the administration of 
this part. Any such borrowed money shall only be used to meet the 
committee's current financial obligations, and the committee shall repay 
all such borrowed money by the end of the next fiscal period from 
assessment income.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, the committee, with the approval of the 
Secretary, may carry over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as 
a reserve: Provided, That funds already in the reserve do not exceed 
approximately one-half of one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve 
funds may be used (1) to cover any expenses authorized by this part and 
(2) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of 
termination of this part. If any such excess is not retained in a 
reserve, each handler entitled to a proportionate refund shall be 
credited with such refund against the operations of the following fiscal 
period unless he demands payment of the sum due him, in which case such 
sum shall be paid to him. Upon termination of this part, any funds not 
required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be 
disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be 
appropriate: Provided, That to the extent practical, such funds shall be 
returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, maintain 
in its own name or in the name of its members a suit against any handler 
for the collection of such handler's pro rata share of the said expense.

section.
    (b) The committee shall give notice of any meeting to consider the 
recommendation of regulations pursuant to Sec. 905.52 by mailing a

Sec. 905.52  Issuance of regulations.

    (a) Whenever the Secretary shall find from the recommendations and 
reports of the committee, or from other available information, that to 
limit the shipment of any variety would tend to effectuate the declared 
policy of the act, he shall so limit the shipment of such variety during 
a specified period or periods. Such regulations may:
    (1) Limit the shipments of any grade or size, or both, of any 
variety, in any manner as may be prescribed, and any

[[Page 57]]

such limitation may provide that shipments of any variety grown in 
Regulation Area II shall be limited to grades and sizes different from 
the grade and size limitations applicable to shipments of the same 
varieties grown in Regulation Area I: Provided, That whenever any such 
grade or size limitation restricts the shipment of a portion of a 
specified grade or size of a variety the quantity of such grade or size 
that may be shipped by a handler during a particular week shall be 
established as a percentage of the total shipments of such variety by 
such handler in such prior period established by the committee with the 
approval of the Secretary, in which he shipped such variety.
    (2) Limit the shipment of any variety by establishing and 
maintaining, only in terms of grades or sizes, or both, minimum 
standards of quality and maturity;
    (3) Limit the shipment of the total quantity of any variety by 
prohibiting the shipment thereof: Provided, that no such prohibition 
shall apply to exports or be effective during any fiscal period with 
respect to any variety other than for one period not exceeding five days 
during the week in which Thanksgiving Day occurs, and for not more than 
two periods not exceeding a total of 14 days during the period December 
20 to January 20, both dates inclusive.
    (4) Provide that exports of any variety shall be limited to grades 
and sizes different from the grade and size limitations applicable to 
shipments of such variety in the 48 contiguous States and the District 
of Columbia of the United States, and specify condition requirements for 
such variety; and
    (5) Fix the size, capacity, weight, dimensions, marking, or pack of 
the container or containers which may be used in the shipment of fruit 
for export: Provided, that such regulation shall not authorize the use 
of any container which is prohibited for use for fruit under the 
provisions of Chapter 601 of the Florida Statutes and regulations 
effective thereunder.
    (b) Prior to the beginning of any such regulations, the Secretary 
shall notify the committee of the regulation issued by him, and the 
committee shall notify all handlers by mailing a copy thereof to each 
handler who has filed his address with said committee for this purpose.
    (c) Whenever the Secretary finds from the recommendations and 
reports of the committee, or from other available information, that a 
regulation should be modified, suspended, or terminated with respect to 
any or all shipments of fruit in order to effectuate the declared policy 
of the act, he shall so modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation. 
If the Secretary finds that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall suspend or terminate 
such regulation. On the same basis, and in like manner, the Secretary 
may terminate any such modification or suspension.
    (d) Whenever any variety is regulated pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section, no such regulation shall be deemed to limit the right 
of any person to sell, contract to sell, or export such variety but no 
handler shall otherwise ship any fruit of such variety which was 
prepared for market during the effective period of such regulation.

may investigate the handling of special purpose shipments under 
Certificates of Privilege to determine whether Special Purpose Shippers 
are complying with the requirements and regulations applicable to such 
certificates. Whenever the committee finds that a Special Purpose 
Shipper or consignee is failing to comply with the requirements and 
regulations applicable to such certificates, the Certificate of 
Privilege issued to such Special Purpose Shipper may be suspended or, in 
the case of an application for the issuance of an initial Certificate of 
Privilege, may be denied. Such suspension of a certificate shall be for 
a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee, but in no 
event shall it extend beyond the end of the current fiscal period. In 
the case of the denial of an application for the issuance of an initial 
certificate, such certificate shall be denied until the applicant comes 
into compliance with the requirements and regulations applicable to such 
certificates. Prior to suspending or denying an application for a 
Certificate of Privilege, the committee shall give the shipper or 
applicant reasonable advance notice in writing of its intention and the 
facts and reasons therefor, and afford the shipper or applicant an 
opportunity, either orally or in writing, to present opposing facts and 
reasons. The shipper or applicant shall be informed of the committee's 
determination in writing and in a timely manner.

Sec. 905.149  Procedure for permitting growers to ship tree run 
citrus fruit.

    (a) Tree run citrus fruit. Tree run citrus fruit as referenced in 
this section is defined in the Florida Department of Citrus (FDOC) 
regulation 20-35.006, which specifies that ``Tree run grade is that 
grade of naturally occurring sound and wholesome citrus fruit which has 
not been separated either as to grade or size after severance from the 
tree.'' Wholesomeness is as defined in FDOC regulation 20-62.002. The 
tree run citrus fruit shipped under this provision also must be from the 
applying grower's own grove.
    (b) Application. A grower shall apply to ship tree run fruit using a 
Grower

[[Page 64]]

Tree Run Certificate Application, furnished by the committee. Such 
application shall contain, but not be limited to: the name, address, and 
phone number of the grower; legal description of the grove(s) from which 
citrus will be shipped; variety of citrus produced on the identified 
grove(s); approximate number of boxes produced on the identified 
grove(s); and a certification to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and 
to the committee as to the truthfulness of the information shown 
thereon; and any other appropriate information or documents deemed 
necessary by the committee or its duly authorized agents.
    (c) Approval. The committee or its duly authorized agents shall give 
prompt consideration to each application for a Grower Tree Run 
Certificate. Approval of an application will be based upon a 
determination as to whether the information contained therein and on 
whether other information available to the committee supports an 
application's approval. Approval of an application shall be evidenced by 
the issuance of a Grower Tree Run Certificate to the applicant. Each 
certificate shall expire at the end of the fiscal period.
    (d) Suspension or denial of a Grower Tree Run Certificate. The 
committee may investigate the handling of tree run shipments under a 
Grower Tree Run Certificate to determine whether growers are complying 
with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. 
Whenever the committee finds that a grower is failing to comply with the 
requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates, the Grower 
Tree Run Certificate issued to such grower may be suspended or, in the 
case of an application for the issuance of an initial Grower Tree Run 
Certificate, may be denied. Such suspension of a certificate shall be 
for a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee, but in 
no event shall it extend beyond the end of the fiscal period. In the 
case of the denial of an application for the issuance of an initial 
certificate, such certificate shall be denied until the applicant comes 
into compliance with the requirements and regulations applicable to such 
certificates. Prior to suspending or denying an application for a Grower 
Tree Run Certificate, the committee shall give the grower reasonable 
advance notice in writing of its intention and the facts and reasons 
therefor, and afford the grower an opportunity, either orally or in 
writing, to present opposing facts and reasons. The grower shall be 
informed of the committee's determination in writing and in a timely 
manner.
    (e) To qualify for a Grower Tree Run Certificate, each such grower 
must notify the committee prior to the first shipment of tree run 
Florida citrus fruit of the grower's intent to ship such citrus, submit 
an application on forms supplied by the committee, and agree to other 
requirements as set forth in this section with respect to such 
shipments.
    (f) The handling of tree run citrus under a Grower Tree Run 
Certificate shall be exempt from the provisions of Sec. Sec. 905.52 and 
905.53 and the regulations issued thereunder, under the following 
conditions:
    (1) A grower may only ship up to 150 1\3/5\ bushel boxes per 
variety, per shipment.
    (2) A grower may only ship up to 3,000 boxes per variety per season.
    (3) Each grower shall apply to the Citrus Administrative Committee 
and receive a Grower Tree Run Certificate prior to shipping their own 
tree run Florida citrus fruit.
    (4) Each grower of citrus shipping under a Grower Tree Run 
Certificate shall supply the committee with reports on each shipment as 
requested by the committee, on forms supplied by the committee, 
providing the following information: The name and address of the grower, 
along with the grower's Grower Tree Run Certificate number; the legal 
description of the grove; the variety and amount of citrus shipped; the 
date the fruit was shipped; and the truck/trailer license number. A copy 
of the form will be completed for each shipment. One copy of the report 
will be forwarded by the grower to the committee office within 10 days 
after such shipment, and one copy of the report will accompany each 
shipment and be given to the Road Guard Station.

[[Page 65]]

    (5) Each container of tree run fruit shipped under a Grower Tree Run 
Certificate shall be labeled with or contain the name and address of the 
grower shipping under the Grower Tree Run Certificate.

<R05>
Sec. 905.153  Procedure for determining handlers' permitted quantities 
of red seedless grapefruit when a portion of sizes 48 and 56 of such 

variety is restricted.

    (a) For the purposes of this section, the prior period specified in 
Sec. 905.52 is hereby established as an average week within the 
immediately preceding three seasons. Each handler's average week shall 
be computed by adding the total volume of red seedless grapefruit 
handled in the immediately preceding three seasons and dividing the 
total by 99. The average week for handlers with less than three previous 
seasons of shipments shall be calculated by adding the total volume of 
shipments for the seasons they did ship red seedless grapefruit, divide 
by the number of seasons, divide further by 33. If crop conditions limit 
shipments from any or all of the immediately preceding three season(s), 
the committee may use a prior season or seasons for the purposes of 
calculating an average week. New handlers with no record of shipments 
could ship size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit as a percentage of 
total shipments equal to the percentage applied to other handlers' 
average week; once such handlers have recorded shipments, their average 
week shall be calculated as an average of total shipments for the weeks 
they have shipped red seedless grapefruit during the current season. 
When used in the regulation of red seedless grapefruit, the term season 
means the weeks beginning the third Monday in September and ending the 
first Sunday in the following May. The term regulation period means the 
22-week period beginning the third Monday in September of the current 
season.
    (b) When a size limitation restricts the shipment of a portion of 
sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit during a particular week as 
provided in Sec. 905.52, the committee shall compute the quantity of 
sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit that may be shipped by each 
handler by multiplying the handler's calculated average week shipments 
of such grapefruit by the percentage established by regulation for red 
seedless grapefruit for that week. Such set percentage may vary from 
week to week but shall not be less than 25 percent in any week.
    (c) The committee shall notify each handler of the quantity of size 
48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit such handler may handle during a 
particular week.
    (d) During any regulation week for which the Secretary has fixed the 
percentage of sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit, any person who 
has received an allotment may handle, in addition to their total 
allotment available, an amount of size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit 
up to 10 percent greater than their allotment. The quantity of the 
overshipment shall be deducted from the handler's allotment for the 
following week. Overshipments will not be allowed during the last week 
of regulation. If the handler fails to use his or her entire allotment, 
the undershipment is not carried forward to the following week. Each 
handler shipping size 48 and/or 56 red seedless grapefruit during the 
regulation period

[[Page 66]]

shall complete and submit to the committee, no later than 2 p.m. of the 
business day following the shipment, a report of red seedless grapefruit 
shipments by day for each regulation week.
    (e) Any handler may transfer or loan any or all of their shipping 
allotment (excluding the overshipment allowance) of size 48 and 56 red 
seedless grapefruit to any other handler. Each handler party to such 
transfer or loan shall no later than noon on the Wednesday following the 
regulation week notify the committee so the proper adjustment of records 
may be made. In each case, the committee shall confirm in writing all 
such transactions, prior to the following week, to the handlers 
involved. The committee may act on behalf of handlers wanting to arrange 
allotment loans or participate in the transfer of allotments.
    (f) New handlers with no record of shipments planning to ship red 
seedless grapefruit covered by any percentage size regulation shall 
register with the committee prior to the regulation period so their 
allotments can be properly calculated. Each new handler shall provide on 
a form furnished by the committee their Florida citrus fruit dealer's 
license number, their Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer 
Services' Fruit and Vegetable Division packinghouse registration number, 
and the physical location of the packinghouse where the red seedless 
grapefruit is to be prepared for market. The committee shall notify any 
new handlers of their allotments prior to the regulation period.

    (c) Suspension or denial of certificate of privilege. The committee 
may investigate the handling of repacked fresh citrus fruit shipments

shipper may be suspended or, in the case of an application for the 
issuance of an initial certificate of privilege, may be denied. Such 
suspension of a certificate shall be for a reasonable period of time as 
determined by the committee, but in no event shall it extend beyond the 
end of the then current fiscal period. In the case of the denial of an 
application for the issuance of an initial certificate, such certificate

assessments shall be in payment of such handler's pro rata share of the 
committee's expenses.
    (b) Assessments shall be levied upon handlers at rates established 
by the Secretary. Such rates may be established upon the basis of the 
committee's recommendations and other available information. Such rates 
may be applied to specified containers used in the production area.
    (c) The rate of assessment may be increased at any time by the 
Secretary if he finds such increase is necessary in order that the money 
collected shall be adequate to cover the committee's expenses during a 
given fiscal period. Such increase shall be applicable to all fruit 
handled during such fiscal period.
    (d) The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functining of 
the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it

accordance with one of the following:
    (1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it shall be refunded proportionately 
to the persons from whom collected.

[[Page 76]]

    (2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary may carry over 
such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve: Provided, That 
funds already in the reserve do not equal approximately 1 fiscal 
period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used for any expenses 
authorized pursuant to Sec. 906.32 and for necessary expenses of 
liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such 
termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of 
liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may 
determine to be appropriate. To the extent practical, such funds shall 
be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part 
and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The 
Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to 
account for all receipts and disbursements.
    (c) Upon the removal or expiration of the terms of office of any 
member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and 
disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his possession to 
the committee, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments 
as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the committee full title 
to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant 
to this part.
    (d) The committee may make recommendations to the Secretary for one 
or more of the members thereof, or any other person, to act as a trustee 
for holding records, funds, or any other committee property during 
periods of suspension of this subpart, or during any period or periods 
when regulations are not in effect, and if the Secretary determines such 
action appropriate, he may direct that such person or persons shall act 
as trustee or trustees for the committee.

<R05>
Sec. 915.40  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred to enable the committee 
to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the 
provisions of this part during each fiscal year. The

[[Page 92]]

funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of 
assessments as provided for in Sec. 915.41.

<R05>
Sec. 915.41  Assessments.

    (a) Each person who first handles avocados shall, with respect to 
the avocados so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such 
person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are 
reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during each fiscal 
year. Each such person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the 
ratio between the total quantity of avocados handled by him as the first 
handler thereof during the applicable fiscal year, and the total 
quantity of avocados so handled by all persons during the same fiscal 
year. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of 
the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it 
is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are 
suspended or become inoperative. If a handler does not pay his 
assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the unpaid 
assessment may be subject to an interest charge at rates prescribed by 
the committee with the approval of the Secretary.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment per 55-pounds of 
fruit or equivalent in any container or in bulk, to be paid by each such 
handler. At any time during or after a fiscal year, the Secretary may 
increase the rate of assessment, in order to secure sufficient funds to 
cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expense which 
may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all fruit handled 
during the applicable fiscal year. In order to provide funds for the 
administration of the provisions of this part, the committee may accept 
the payment of assessments in advance, or borrow money on an emergency 
short-term basis. The authority of the committee to borrow money is 
subject to approval of the Secretary and may be used only to meet 
financial obligations as the obligations occur or to allow the committee 
to adjust its reserve funds to meet such obligations.

Sec. 915.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as 
follows:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each 
person entitled to a proportionate refund of the excess assessment shall 
be credited with such refund against the operation of the following 
fiscal year unless such person demands repayment thereof, in which event 
it shall be paid to him: Provided, That any sum paid by a person in 
excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal year may 
be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal year to any 
outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.
    (2) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may 
determine that it is appropriate for the maintenance and functioning of 
the committee that the funds remaining at the end of a fiscal year which 
are in excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations during 
such year may be carried over into following years as a reserve. Such 
reserve may be established at an amount not to exceed approximately 3 
fiscal years' operational expenses. Funds in the reserve may be used to 
cover the necessary expenses of liquidation, in the event of termination 
of this part, and to cover the expenses incurred for the maintenance and 
functioning of the committee during any fiscal year when there is crop 
failure, or during any period of suspension of any or all of the 
provisions of this part. Such reserve may also be used by the committee 
to finance its operations during any fiscal year prior to the time that 
assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses and to cover 
deficits incurred during any fiscal year when income is less than 
expenses. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to

[[Page 93]]

defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in 
such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, 
That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to 
the persons from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this 
part, and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. 
The Secretary may, at any time, require the committee and its members to 
account for all receipts and disbursements.

    Whenever a regulation is in effect pursuant to Sec. 915.51(a)(1), 
the committee shall issue one or more exemption certificates to any 
person who furnishes proof, satisfactory to the committee, that his

certificates shall authorize the person to whom the certificates are 
issued to handle, or have handled, only that portion of his avocados of 
the particular variety which the committee has determined to be mature. 
The committee shall adopt, with the approval of the Secretary,

Federal-State Inspection Service and certified by it as meeting the 
applicable requirements of such regulation: Provided, That such 
inspection and certification shall not be required whenever the avocados 
previously have been so inspected and certified. Promptly thereafter, 
each such handler shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to the

handling.

consumption by charitable institutions; (b) for distribution by relief 
agencies; (c) for commercial processing into products; or (d) in such 
minimum quantities or types of shipments as the committee, with the

safeguards as it may deem necessary to prevent avocados handled under 
the provisions of this section from entering channels of trade for other 
than the specific purposes authorized by this section. Such rules,

shall file applications with the committee for authorization to handle 
avocados pursuant to this section, and that such applications be 
accompanied by a certification by the intended purchaser or receiver

one position on the committee.
    (3) A particular grower, including authorized employees of such

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 916.40  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its 
maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and 
perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The 
funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired in the manner prescribed 
in Sec. 916.41.


<R05>
Sec. 916.41  Assessments.

    (a) As his pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds 
are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a 
fiscal period, each person who first handles nectarines during such 
period shall pay to the committee, upon demand, assessments on all 
nectarines so handled. The payment of assessments for the maintenance 
and functioning of the committee may be required under this part 
throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular 
provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by 
each such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure 
sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such 
period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to 
approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after 
the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in 
order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the 
Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase 
shall be applied to all nectarines handled during the applicable fiscal 
period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the 
provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before 
sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current 
year's shipments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in 
advance, and may also borrow money for such purposes. Furthermore, any 
assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time prescribed by 
the committee may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or 
both. The period of time, rate of interest and late payment charge shall 
be as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. 
Subsequent to such approval, all assessments not paid within the 
prescribed period of time shall be subject to an interest or late 
payment charge or both.

<R05>
Sec. 916.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in 
accordance with one of the following:
    (1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it shall be refunded proportionately 
to the persons from whom it was collected: Provided, That any sum paid 
by a person in excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during any 
fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal

person.
    (2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry 
over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve: Provided,

is sufficient to cover such expenses, (ii) to cover deficits incurred 
during any fiscal year when assessment income is less than expenses, 
(iii) to defray expenses incurred during any

period when any or all provisions of this part are suspended or are 
inoperative, (iv) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the 
event of termination of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not 
required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be 
disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be 
appropriate: Provided, That to the extent practical, such funds shall be 
returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part

account for all receipts and disbursements.
    (c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any 
member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and 
disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his possession to 
the committee, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments 
as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the committee full title 
to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant 
to this part.

the minimum size requirements specified for each size category in this 
section applying the 16-pound sample. A sample consisting of one-half of 
the specified number of fruit for a particular size category shall be 
used, provided such sample weighs at least eight pounds. When one-half 
the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending 
with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit shall be used to 
determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum 
size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a 16-pound sample

<R05>
Sec. 916.356  California Nectarine Grade and Size Regulation.

    (a) During the period beginning April 1 and ending October 31, no 
handler shall ship any package or container of any variety of nectarines 
marked ``CA WELL MAT'' or ``California Well Matured'' except in 
accordance with the following terms and conditions:
    (1) Any lot or package or container of any variety of nectarines 
shall meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade: Provided, That 
nectarines 2 inches in diameter or smaller, shall not have fairly light-
colored, fairly smooth scars which exceed an aggregate area of a circle 
\3/8\ inch in diameter, and nectarines larger than 2 inches in diameter 
shall not have fairly light-colored, fairly smooth scars which exceed an 
aggregate area of a circle \1/2\ inch in diameter: Provided further, 
That an additional tolerance of 25 percent shall be permitted for fruit 
that is not well formed but not badly misshapen: Provided further, That 
nectarines of the Peento type shall be permitted blossom end cracking 
that is well healed and does not exceed the aggregate area of a circle 
\3/8\ inch in diameter, and/or does not exceed a depth that exposes the 
pit: Provided further, That any handler may handle nectarines if such 
nectarines meet ``CA Utility'' quality requirements. The term ``CA 
Utility'' means that not more than 40 percent of the nectarines in any 
container meet or exceed the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade, 
except that when more than 30 percent of the nectarines in any container 
meet or exceed the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade, the additional 
10 percent shall have non-scoreable blemishes as determined when 
applying the U.S. Standards for Grades of Nectarines; and that such 
nectarines are well mature and are:

[[Page 120]]

    (i) Free from insect injury which has penetrated or damaged the 
flesh; split pits which cause an unhealed crack or one or more well 
healed cracks which, either singly or in the aggregate, are more than 
\3/8\ inch in length; mold, brown rot, and decay which has affected the 
edible portion; and
    (ii) Free from serious damage due to skin breaks, cuts, growth 
cracks, bruises, or other causes. Damage to any nectarine is serious 
when it causes a waste of 10 percent or more, by volume, of the 
individual nectarine.
    (iii) Tolerances. Not more than 10 percent, by count, of the 
nectarines in any one container may be below the requirements which are 
prescribed by this paragraph, including not more than 5 percent, by 
count, for any one defect, except split pits. An additional tolerance of 
10 percent, by count, of the nectarines in any one container or bulk lot 
may contain nectarines affected with split pits. This means a total 
tolerance of 20 percent is allowed for all defects, including split 
pits, but not to exceed 15 percent for split pits alone.
    (iv) The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service shall make 
final determinations on maturity through the use of color guides or such 
other tests as determined appropriate by the inspection agency. The 
Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use the maturity guides 
listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(1)(iv) in making maturity 
determinations for the specified varieties when inspecting to the ``well 
matured'' level of maturity. For these varieties, not less than 90 
percent of any lot shall meet the color guide established for the 
variety, and an aggregate area of not less than 90 percent of the fruit 
surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety, except 
that for the Tom Grand variety of nectarines, not less than an aggregate 
area of 80 percent of the fruit surface shall meet the color guide 
established for the variety. For varieties not listed, the Federal or 
Federal-State Inspection Service will use such tests as it deems proper. 
A variance for any variety from the application of the maturity guides 
specified in table 1 to paragraph (a)(1)(iv) may be granted during the 
season to reflect changes in crop, weather, or other conditions that 
would make the specified guides an inappropriate measure of ``well 
matured.''

* Predominant ground color must be breaking yellowish green.

    Note: Consult with the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service 
Supervisor for the maturity guides applicable to the varieties not 
listed above. On varieties with less than 10 percent surface ground 
color required to determine California Well-Matured, the stem cavity 
color will be utilized to make the determination. As a guide, stem 
cavities for most varieties should be at least yellowish-green as 
defined by the H maturity guide. Confirmation may be further established 
by using other California well matured characteristics. *Predominant 
ground color must be breaking yellowish green.
    (v) If a grower or handler believes his/her fruit is meeting the 
appropriate maturity level but the fruit has not been so graded by the 
inspector, he/she may appeal the inspection by calling the officer-in-
charge of the local Federal-State Inspection Service office to arrange 
for an on-site examination of the fruit.

will pack, in accordance with the requirements of a standard pack, not 
more than 108 nectarines in the box; or
    (ii) Such nectarines, when packed other than as specified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, are of a size that a 16-pound 
sample, representative of the nectarines in the package or container, 
contains not more than 100 nectarines, except for Peento-type 
nectarines.

percent is provided, individual packages shall have not more than double

    (2) For packages which contain 10 pounds or less, individual

same as defined in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines 
[7 CFR 51.3145 through 51.3160]; and No. 22D standard lug box means the 
same as defined in section 1380.19 (17) of the ``Regulations of the

Sec. 917.24  Procedure for nominating members of various commodity 
committees.

    (a) The Control Committee shall hold or cause to be held not later 
than January 31 for peaches and not later than February 15 for pears of 
each odd numbered year a meeting or meetings of the growers of the 
fruits in each representation area set forth in Sec. Sec. 917.21 and 
917.22. These meetings shall be supervised by the Control Committee, 
which shall prescribe such procedure as shall be reasonable and fair to 
all persons concerned.
    (b) With respect to each commodity committee only growers of the 
particular fruit who are present at such nomination meetings or 
represented at such meetings by duly authorized employees may 
participate in the nomination and election of nominees for commodity 
committee members and alternates. Each such grower, including employees 
of such grower, shall be entitled to cast but one vote for each position 
to be filled for the representation area in which he produces such 
fruit. All peach growers, or authorized employees, will receive a ballot 
for the nominees in the district in which they produce and are entitled 
to vote accordingly. A peach grower who produces in multiple districts 
is allowed to vote only in one district, and may exchange his/her ballot 
for that of nominees in another district provided the grower is 
producing in the district for which he/she wants to participate. For 
both commodity committees, each such grower, including employees of such 
grower, shall be entitled to cast but one vote for each position to be 
filled for the representation area in which he/she produces such fruit.
    (c) A particular grower, including employees of such growers, shall 
be eligible for membership as principle or alternate to fill only one 
position on a commodity committee. A grower nominated for membership on 
the Pear Commodity Committee must have produced at least 51 percent of 
the pears shipped by him during the previous fiscal period, or he must 
represent an organization which produced at least 51 percent of the 
pears shipped by it during such period. The members and alternates of 
the Peach Commodity Committee shall be growers, or shall be authorized 
employees of such growers and at least 50% of the nominees from each 
representation area shall be pure growers.

[[Page 129]]

    (d) For peaches, no person shall serve more than three (3) 
consecutive two-year terms of office or a total of six (6) consecutive 
years; Provided, That an appointment to fill less than a two-year term 
of office, or serving one (1) term as an alternate, shall not be 
included in determining the (3) consecutive terms of office; Provided 
further, That time served prior to the effective date of this section 
shall not be counted toward consecutive term limits. The members shall 
serve until their respective successors are selected and have qualified.

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 917.36  Expenses.

    Each commodity committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the 
Secretary finds are reasonable and are likely to be incurred by the said 
commodity committee during each fiscal period for the maintenance and 
functioning of such committee, including its proportionate share of the 
expenses of the Control Committee; and for such research and service 
activities relating to handling of the fruit for which the commodity 
committee was established as the Secretary may determine to be 
appropriate. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired by the 
levying of assessments as provided in Sec. 917.37.


<R05>
Sec. 917.37  Assessments.

    (a) As his/her pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and are likely to be incurred by the commodity 
committees during a fiscal period, each handler shall pay to the Control 
Committee, upon demand, assessments on all fruit handled by him/her. The 
payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the 
committees may be required under this part throughout the period it is 
in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are 
suspended or become inoperative.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the respective rate of assessment, which 
handlers shall pay with respect to each fruit during each fiscal period 
in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the respective 
expenses, which may be incurred during such period. At any time during 
or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rates of 
assessment in order to secure funds to cover any later findings by the 
Secretary relative to such expenses, and such increase shall apply to 
all fruit shipped during the fiscal period. Furthermore, any assessment 
not paid by a peach handler within a period of time prescribed by the 
Control Committee may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, 
or both. The period of time, rate of interest and late payment charge 
shall be as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. 
Subsequent to such approval, all assessments for peaches not paid within 
the prescribed period of time shall be subject to an interest or late 
payment charge or both.
    (c) In order to provide funds to carry out the functions of the 
commodity committee prior to commencement of shipments in any season, 
shippers may make advance payments of assessments, which advance 
payments shall be credited to such shippers and the assessments of such 
shippers shall be adjusted so that such assessments are based upon the 
quantity of fruit shipped by such shippers during such season. Any 
shipper who ships fruit for the account of a grower may deduct, from the 
account of sale covering such shipment or shipments, the amount of 
assessments levied on said fruit shipped for the account of such grower.

[71 FR 41352, July 21, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 917.38  Accounting.

    If, at the end of a fiscal period the assessments collected are in 
excess of expenses incurred, each commodity committee, with the approval 
of the Secretary, may carry over such excess into subsequent fiscal 
periods as a reserve: Provided, That funds already in the reserve do not 
exceed approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve funds 
may be used (1) to cover any expenses authorized by this part and (2) to 
cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of 
this part. If any such excess is not retained in a reserve, each handler 
entitled to a proportionate refund shall be credited with such refund 
against the operations of the following fiscal period or be paid such 
refund. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray 
the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such 
manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, That, 
to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the 
persons from whom such funds were collected.

regulations will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act. Such 
regulations may:
    (1) Limit, during any period or periods, the total quantity of any 
grade, size, quality, maturity, or pack, or any combination thereof, of 
any variety or varieties of fruit;
    (2) Limit the shipment of any variety or varieties of fruit by

recommend to the Secretary.
    (b) Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and 
information submitted by the commodity committee or from other available 
information, that a regulation should be modified, suspended, or 
terminated with respect to any or all shipments of fruit in order to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall modify, suspend, or 
terminate such regulation. If the Secretary finds that a regulation 
obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, 
he shall suspend or terminate such regulation. On the same basis and in 
like manner the Secretary may terminate any such modification or 
suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 917.43  Special purpose shipments.

Secretary, prescribe such rules, regulations, and safeguards as it may 
deem necessary to prevent fruit handled under the provisions of this 
section from entering the channels of trade for other than the specified 
purposes authorized by this section. Such rules, regulations, and 
safeguards may include the requirements that handlers shall file 
applications and receive approval from the commodity committee for 
authorization to handle fruit pursuant to this section, and that such 
applications be accompanied by a certification by the intended purchaser 
or receiver that the fruit will not be used for any purpose not 
authorized by this section.


<R05>
Sec. 917.45  Inspection and certification.

    (a) Whenever the handling of any variety of a particular fruit is 
regulated pursuant to Sec. 917.41 or Sec. 917.42, each handler who 
handles such fruit shall, prior thereto, cause such fruit to be 
inspected by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service: Provided, 
That inspection and certification shall not be required if such fruit 
has previously been so inspected and certified. Promptly after 
inspection and certification, each such handler shall submit, or cause 
to be submitted, to the commodity committee a copy of the certificate of 
inspection issued with respect to such fruit. The commodity committees 
may, with the approval of the Secretary, prescribe rules and regulations 
waiving the inspection requirements of this section where it is 
determined that inspection is not available: Provided, That all 
shipments made under such waiver shall comply with all regulations in 
effect.
    (b) The Control Committee may enter into an agreement with the

    (iv) The size of peaches, when packed in loose-filled or tight-
filled containers, shall be marked in accordance with the following 
table 1 and table 2 which specify the tray-pack size designation in 
Column A with the corresponding maximum number of peaches in a 16-pound 
sample of each size of the fruit in Column B: Provided, That the 
following procedure shall be used in determining whether peaches meet 
the minimum size requirements specified for each size category in this 
section applying the 16-pound sample. A sample consisting of one-half of 
the specified number of fruit for a particular size category shall be 
used, provided such sample weighs at least eight pounds. When one-half 
the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending 
with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit shall be used to 
determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum 
size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a 16-pound sample 
shall be used to determine if the fruit meets the minimum size 
requirements.

    (6) The variation in diameter between the smallest and largest peach 
in any individual container shall not exceed one-forth (\1/4\) inch for 
size 80 and smaller and three-eights (\3/8\) inch for peaches larger 
than size 80: Provided, That not more than five (5) percent, by count, 
of the peaches in any individual container may fail to meet the diameter 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (7) Each No. 22D standard lug box or No. 32 standard box of loose-
filled peaches shall bear on one outside end, in plain sight and in 
plain letters, the words ``25 pounds net weight.''

consumer packages shall bear on one outside end in plain sight and in 
plain letters the following information:
    (i) The number of individual consumer packages, the net weight of 
each consumer package, and the size description of the contents: 
Provided, That when consumer packages of different sizes of peaches are 
contained in a master container, the size description of the contents 
shall indicate the minimum size contained therein, using the terms 
``Minimum size 60 and larger,'' or ``Minimum size 70 and larger,'' etc., 
as applicable.
    (ii) The name and address (including zip code) of the shipper.
    (11) Each individual consumer package shall bear the name and

15 \13/16\ x 23\1/4\ to 23\3/4\ inches, and a No. 36 standard box 
measures 5 to 6\1/2\ x 13\1/4\ x 17\1/4\ inches. All dimensions are 
given in depth (inside dimensions) by width and by length (outside 
dimensions). ``Individual consumer packages'' means packages holding 15 
pounds or less net weight of peaches. ``Tree ripe'' means ``tree 
ripened'' and fruit shipped and marked as ``tree ripe,'' ``tree 
ripened,'' or any similar terms using the words ``tree'' and ``ripe'' 
must meet the minimum California Well Matured standards.
    (c) Each container of peaches in plastic, 12x19\3/4\ inch reusable

                    Subpart_Grade and Size Regulation


<R05>
Sec. 917.459  California Peach Grade and Size Regulation.

    (a) During the period beginning April 1 and ending November 23, no 
handler shall ship any package or container of any variety of peaches 
marked ``CA WELL MAT'' or ``California Well Matured'' except in 
accordance with the following terms and conditions:
    (1) Any lot or package or container of any variety of peaches shall 
meet the following requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade: Provided, That an 
additional 25 percent tolerance shall be permitted for fruit with open 
sutures which are damaged, but not seriously damaged: Provided further, 
That peaches of the Peento type shall be permitted blossom end cracking 
that is well healed and does not exceed the aggregate area of a circle 
\3/8\ inch in diameter, and/or does not exceed a depth that exposes the 
pit; Provided further, That any handler may handle peaches if such 
peaches meet ``CA Utility'' quality requirements. The term ``CA 
Utility'' means that not more than 40 percent of the peaches in any 
container meet or exceed the requirement of the U.S. No. 1 grade, except 
that when more than 30 percent of the peaches in any container meet or 
exceed the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade, the additional 10 
percent shall have non-scoreable blemishes as determined when applying 
the U.S. Standards for Grades of Peaches; and that such peaches are well 
mature and are:
    (i) Free from insect injury which has penetrated or damaged the 
flesh; split pits which cause an unhealed crack or one or more healed 
cracks which, either singly or in the aggregate, are more than \1/2\ 
inch in length; and mold, brown rot, and decay; and
    (ii) Free from serious damage due to cuts, skin breaks, growth 
cracks, bruises, scab, rust, blight, disease, hail or other causes. 
Damage to any peach is serious when it causes a waste of 10 percent or 
more, by volume, of the individual peach.
    (iii) Tolerances. Not more than 10 percent, by count, of the peaches 
in any container may be below the requirements prescribed by this 
paragraph. Not more than one-half of this tolerance shall be allowed for 
any one cause. Individual containers in any lot may contain not more 
than one and one-half times the tolerances specified if the percentage 
of defects of the entire lot averages within the tolerances.
    (iv) The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service shall make the 
final determinations on maturity through the use of color chips or other 
tests as determined appropriate by the inspection agency. The Federal or 
Federal-State Inspection Service will use the maturity guides listed in 
Table 1 in making maturity determinations for the specified varieties 
when inspecting to the ``well matured'' level of maturity. For these 
varieties, not less than

[[Page 145]]

90 percent of any lot shall meet the color guide established for the 
variety, and an aggregate area of not less than 90 percent of the fruit 
surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety, except 
that for the Joanna Sweet variety of peaches, any of the fruit surface 
that is not red shall meet the color guide established for the variety, 
including any color noted in the stem cavity. For varieties not listed, 
the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use such tests as 
it deems proper. A variance for any variety from the application of the 
maturity guides specified in Table 1 may be granted during the season to 
reflect changes in crop, weather, or other conditions that would make 
the specified guides an inappropriate measure of ``well matured.''

    Note: Consult with the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service 
Supervisor for the maturity guides applicable to the varieties not 
listed above. On varieties with less than 10 percent surface ground 
color required to determine California Well-Matured, the stem cavity 
color will be utilized to make the determination. As a guide, stem 
cavities for most varieties should be at least yellowish-green as 
defined by the H maturity guide. Confirmation may be further established 
by using other California well matured characteristics.
    (v) If a grower or handler believes his/her fruit is meeting the 
appropriatematurity level but the fruit has not been so graded by the 
inspector, he/she may appeal the inspection by calling the officer-in-
charge of the local Federal-State Inspection Service office to arrange 
for an on-site examination of the fruit.
    (2) Any package or container of Earlitreat, Snow Angel, 
Supechfifteen, or Super Lady variety peaches unless:
    (i) Such peaches when packed in molded forms (tray packs) in a No. 
22D standard lug box or a No. 32 standard box are of a size that will 
pack, in accordance with the requirements of standard pack, not more 
that 96 peaches in the box; or
    (ii) Such peaches in any container when packed other than as 
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section are of a size that a 
16-pound sample, representative of the peaches in the package or 
container, contains not more than 96 peaches except for Peento type 
peaches.
    (3) Any package or container of Island Prince, Snow Peak, Spring 
Princess, or Super Rich variety peaches unless:
    (i) Such peaches when packed in molded forms (tray packs) in a No. 
22D standard lug box or a No. 32 standard box are of a size that will

fruit meets the minimum size requirements.

more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified. For packages 
which contain more than 10 pounds and a tolerance of less than 10 
percent is provided, individual packages shall have not more than double 
the tolerance specified.
    (2) For packages which contain 10 pounds or less, individual 
packages are not restricted as to the percentage of defects.

same as defined in the United States Standards for Grades of Peaches (7 
CFR 51.1210 through 51.1223); and No. 22D standard lug box and No. 12B 
standard fruit (peach) box mean the same as defined in section 1380.19 
(18) of the ``Regulations of the California Department of Food and

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 920.40  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its 
maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and 
perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The 
funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired in the manner prescribed 
in Sec. 920.41.


<R05>
Sec. 920.41  Assessments.

    (a) As his or her pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a 
fiscal period, each person who first handles kiwifruit during such 
period shall pay to the committee, upon demand, assessments on all 
kiwifruit so handled. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and 
functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout 
the period it is in effect, irrespective of whether particular 
provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative. If a handler 
does not pay any assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, 
the assessment may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or 
both, as may be established by the Secretary upon recommendation of the 
committee.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by 
each such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure 
sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such 
period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to 
approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after 
the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in 
order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the 
Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred: Provided, That 
any assessment, excluding any amount collected pursuant to Sec. 
920.55(c), must be limited to a maximum assessment rate of three and 
one-half cents per flat, or the equivalent thereof. The Secretary may 
increase this maximum rate in each succeeding year after the initial 
year of order operation by the Consumer Price Index (cost of living) for 
California as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Such increase 
shall be applied to all kiwifruit handled during the applicable fiscal 
period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the 
provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before 
sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current 
year's shipments, the committee

[[Page 155]]

may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow 
money for such purposes.

[49 FR 39658, Oct. 10, 1984, as amended at 57 FR 1220, Jan. 12, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 920.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in 
accordance with one of the following:
    (1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it shall be refunded proportionately 
to the persons from whom it was collected: Provided, That any sum paid 
by a person in excess of his or her pro rata share of the expenses 
during any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of 
such fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from 
such person.
    (2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry 
over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve: Provided, 
That funds already in the reserve do not equal approximately one fiscal 
period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used: (i) To defray 
expenses, during any fiscal period, prior to the time assessment income 
is insufficient to cover such expenses; (ii) to cover deficits incurred 
during any fiscal year when assessment income is less than expenses; 
(iii) to defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all 
provisions of this part are suspended or are inoperative; and, (iv) to 
cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of 
this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the 
necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as 
the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, That to the 
extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons 
from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part 
and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The 
Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to 
account for all receipts and disbursements.
    (c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any 
member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and 
disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his or her 
possession to the committee, and shall execute such assignments and 
other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the 
committee full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in 
such member pursuant to this part.

[[Page 156]]

    (b) In arriving at its recommendations for regulation pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, the committee shall give consideration to 
current information with respect to the factors affecting the supply and 
demand for kiwifruit during the period or periods when it is proposed 
that such regulations should be made effective. With each such 
recommendation for regulation, the committee shall submit to the 
Secretary the data and information on which such recommendation is 
predicated and such other available information as the Secretary may 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 920.52  Issuance of regulations.

    (a) The Secretary shall regulate, in the manner specified in this 
section, the handling of kiwifruit whenever the Secretary finds, from 
the recommendations and information submitted by the committee, or from 
other available information, that such regulations will tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act. Such regulations may:
    (1) Limit, during any period or periods, the shipment of any 
particular grade, size, quality, maturity, or pack, or any combination 
thereof, of any variety or varieties of kiwifruit grown in the 
production area;
    (2) Limit the shipment of kiwifruit by establishing, in terms of 
grades, sizes, or both, minimum standards of quality and maturity during 
any period when season average prices are expected to exceed the parity 
level;
    (3) Fix the size, capacity, weight, dimensions, markings, or pack of 
the container, or containers, which may be used in the packaging or 
handling of kiwifruit.
    (b) The committee shall be informed immediately of any such 
regulation issued by the Secretary and the committee shall promptly give 
notice thereof to handlers.


<R05>
Sec. 920.53  Modification, suspension, or termination of regulations.

    (a) In the event the committee at any time finds that, by reason of 
changed conditions, any regulations issued pursuant to Sec. 920.52 
should be modified, suspended, or terminated, it shall so recommend to 
the Secretary.
    (b) Whenever the Secretary finds from the recommendations and 
information submitted by the committee or from other available 
information, that a regulation should be modified, suspended, or 
terminated with respect to any or all shipments of kiwifruit in order to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act, the Secretary shall modify, 
suspend, or terminate such regulation. If the Secretary finds that a 
regulation obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy 
of the act, the Secretary shall suspend or terminate such regulation. On 
the same basis and in like manner the Secretary may terminate any such 
modification or suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 920.54  Special purpose shipments.

    (c) The committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary, 
prescribe such rules, regulations, and safeguards as it may deem 
necessary to prevent kiwifruit handled under the provisions of this 
section from entering the channels of trade for other than the specific 
purposes authorized by this section. Such rules, regulations, and 
safeguards may include the requirements that

[[Page 157]]

handlers shall file applications and receive approval from the committee 
for authorization to handle kiwifruit pursuant to this section, and that 
such applications be accompanied by a certification by the intended 
purchaser or receiver that the kiwifruit will not be used for any 
purpose not authorized by this section.


<R05>
Sec. 920.55  Inspection and certification.

    (a) Whenever the handling of any variety of kiwifruit is regulated 
pursuant to Sec. 920.52, or Sec. 920.53, each handler who handles 
kiwifruit shall, prior thereto, cause such kiwifruit to be inspected by 
the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service and certified as meeting 
the applicable requirements of such regulation: Provided, That 
inspection and certification shall not be required for kiwifruit which 
previously have been so inspected and certified if such prior inspection 
was performed within such period as may be established pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section. Promptly after inspection and 
certification, each such handler shall submit, or cause to be submitted, 
to the committee a copy of the certificate of inspection issued with 
respect to such kiwifruit. The committee may, with the approval of the 
Secretary, prescribe rules and regulations waiving the inspection 
requirements of this section where it is determined that inspection is 
not available: Provided, That all shipments made under such waiver shall 
comply with all regulations in effect.
    (b) The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, establish 
a period prior to shipment during which the inspection required by this 
section must be performed.
    (c) The committee may enter into an agreement with the Federal and 
Federal-State Inspection Services with respect to the costs of the 
inspection required by paragraph (a) of this section, and may collect 
from handlers their respective pro rata shares of such costs.

    (a) The manner of nominating grower members and alternate members to 
the committee shall be as follows:
    (1) The committee's mailing of an approved nomination form to all 
kiwifruit growers of record shall constitute notice of nominations. All 
eligible kiwifruit growers may nominate themselves or any other eligible 
kiwifruit grower to vacant committee positions for the nominee's 
district. Completed nomination forms shall be returned to the office of 
the committee by a date specified by the committee and approved by an 
agent of the Secretary. Nomination forms shall provide for names of 
nominees, as well as the nominating grower's name, address, telephone 
number, and signature. Incomplete nominations forms will not be 
considered valid.
    (2) For each district involved in the current year's nominations, 
committee staff, with the Secretary's oversight, shall establish a slate 
of candidates with the names of all qualified nominees received. Persons 
submitting invalid nomination forms shall be notified of such by the 
committee. Within a reasonable time period, a ballot containing a slate 
of candidates shall be mailed to all growers of record within the 
respective district represented by such candidates. The committee shall 
provide a reasonable period of time to growers to cast votes on the 
candidates and return the completed ballots for tallying.
    (3) To be eligible to vote, growers must be producing kiwifruit 
during the crop year nominations are held and within the district 
represented by the candidates on the ballot. A grower may only vote for 
candidates from one district and may only cast one ballot. Growers may 
also cast votes for eligible candidates who do not appear on the ballots 
by writing in the name of such candidates on the ballot. Each ballot 
shall provide for a voter eligibility certification which must include 
the voter's name, address, telephone number, and signature, as well as 
the name(s) of all handlers which handled the current season's crop. At 
the discretion of the Secretary, the ballots may include other 
background information about each candidate.
    (4) In order to be valid, ballots must be executed in accordance 
with the instructions set forth on the ballot, and are to be returned to 
the Secretary's agent who will tally the ballots with such assistance 
from the committee as may be requested by the agent. Such ballots shall 
be postmarked by a date

[[Page 161]]

specified by the committee and approved by an agent of the Secretary.
    (5) The names of the persons receiving the highest total number of 
votes for a particular position shall be submitted to the Secretary as 
the nominees for such positions. In the event of a tie vote, a ballot 
containing only the names of the candidates receiving the tied vote 
shall be mailed to all growers in the affected district.
    (b) In the event of a vacancy as specified in Sec. 920.26, the 
committee shall utilize the same procedure as prescribed in Sec. 
920.122(a)(1) through (a)(5) to fill such vacancy.

    The committee shall, prior to the last day of each fiscal period, 
prepare and mail an annual report to the Secretary and make a copy

This annual report shall contain at least:
    (a) A complete review of the regulatory operations during the fiscal

    (b) An appraisal of the effect of such regulatory operations upon 
the apricot industry; and
    (c) Any recommendations for changes in the program.

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 922.40  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee to 
enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance 
with the provisions of this part during each fiscal period. The funds to 
cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments as 
prescribed in Sec. 922.41.


<R05>
Sec. 922.41  Assessments.

    (a) Each person who first handles apricots shall, with respect to 
the apricots so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such 
person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will 
be incurred by the committee during each fiscal period. Each such 
person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the 
total quantity of apricots handled by him as the first handler thereof 
during the applicable fiscal period and the total quantity of apricots 
so handled by all persons during the same fiscal period. The payment of 
assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be 
required under this part throughout the period it is in effect 
irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or 
become inoperative.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by 
each such person. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the 
Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure 
sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to 
the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to 
all apricots handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to 
provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part 
during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating 
income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, 
the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may 
also borrow money for such purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 922.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as 
follows:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section each 
person entitled to a proportionate refund of any excess assessment shall 
be credited with such refund against the operation

[[Page 170]]

of the following fiscal period unless such person demands repayment 
thereof, in which event it shall be paid to him: Provided, That any sum 
paid by a person in excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during 
any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such 
fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such 
person.
    (2) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may 
determine that it is appropriate for the maintenance and functioning of 
the committee that the funds remaining at the end of a fiscal period 
which are in excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations 
during such period may be carried over into following periods as a 
reserve. Such reserve may be established at an amount not to exceed 
approximately one fiscal period's operational expenses; and such reserve 
may be used to cover the necessary expenses of liquidation, in the event 
of termination of this part, and to cover the expenses incurred for the 
maintenance and functioning of the committee during any fiscal period 
when there is a crop failure, or during any period of suspension of any 
or all of the provisions of this part. Such reserve may also be used by 
the committee to finance its operations, during any fiscal period, prior 
to the time that assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses; 
but any of the reserve funds so used shall be returned to the reserve as 
soon as assessment income is available for this purpose. Upon 
termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary 
expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the 
Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, That to the extent 
practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from 
whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this 
part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The 
Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to 
account for all receipts and disbursements.
    (c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any 
member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and 
disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his possession to 
his successor in office, and shall execute such assignments and other 
instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in such successor 
full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such 
member pursuant to this part.

policy, the committee shall submit to the Secretary a revised marketing 
policy report setting forth the information prescribed in this section. 
The committee shall publicly announce the contents of each marketing

other available information, that such regulations will tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act. Such regulations may:
    (1) Limit, during any period or periods, the shipment of any 
particular grade, size, quality, maturity, or pack, or any combination 
thereof, of any variety or varieties of apricots grown in any district 
or districts of the production area;
    (2) Limit the shipment of apricots by establishing, in terms of 
grades, sizes, or both, minimum standards of quality and maturity during 
any period when season average prices are expected to exceed the parity 
level;
    (3) Fix the size, capacity, weight, dimensions, markings, or pack of 
the container, or containers, which may be used in the packaging or 
handling of apricots.
    (b) The committee shall be informed immediately of any such

    (a) In the event the committee at any time finds that, by reason of 
changed conditions, any regulations issued pursuant to Sec. 922.52

prescribe,
    (c) The committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary,

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 923.40  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee to 
enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance 
with the provisions of this part during each fiscal period. The funds to 
cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments as 
prescribed in Sec. 923.41.


<R05>
Sec. 923.41  Assessments.

    (a) Each person who first handles cherries shall, with respect to 
the cherries so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such 
person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will 
be incurred by the committee during each fiscal period. Each such 
person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the 
total quantity of cherries handled by him as the first handler thereof 
during the applicable fiscal period and the total quantity of cherries 
so handled by all persons during the same fiscal period. The payment of 
assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be 
required under this part throughout the period it is in effect 
irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or 
become inoperative.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by 
each such person. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the 
Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure 
sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to 
the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to 
all cherries handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to 
provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part 
during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating 
income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, 
the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may 
also borrow money for such purpose.
    (c) If a handler does not pay any assessment within the time 
prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be subject to an 
interest or late payment charge, or both, as may be established by USDA 
as recommended by the committee.

<R05>
Sec. 923.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as 
follows:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each 
person entitled to a proportionate refund of any excess assessment shall 
be credited with such refund against the operation of the following 
fiscal period unless such person demands repayment thereof, in which 
event it shall be paid to him: Provided, That any sum paid by a person 
in excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal period 
may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal period to any 
outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.
    (2) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may 
determine that it is appropriate for the maintenance and functioning of 
the committee that the funds remaining at the end of a fiscal period 
which are in excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations 
during such period may be carried over into following periods as a 
reserve. Such reserve may be established at an amount not to exceed 
approximately one fiscal period's operational expenses; and such reserve 
may be used to cover the necessary expenses of liquidation, in the event 
of termination of this part, and to cover the expenses incurred for the 
maintenance and functioning of the committee during any fiscal period 
when there is a crop failure, or during any period of suspension of any 
or all of the provisions of this part. Such reserve may also be used by 
the committee to finance its operations, during any fiscal period, prior 
to the time that assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses; 
but any of the reserve funds so used shall be returned to the reserve as 
soon as assessment income is available for this purpose. Upon 
termination of this part, any funds not required to

[[Page 183]]

defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in 
such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, 
That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to 
the persons from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this 
part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The 
Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to 
account for all receipts and disbursements.
    (c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any 
member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and 
disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his possession to 
his successor in office, and shall execute such assignments and other 
instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in such successor 
full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such 
member pursuant to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 923.43  Contributions.

    The committee may accept voluntary contributions but these shall 
only be used to pay expenses incurred pursuant to Sec. 923.45. 
Furthermore, such contributions shall be free from any encumbrances by 
the donor and the committee shall retain complete control of their use.

    (b) In the event it becomes advisable, because of changes in the 
supply and demand situation for cherries, to modify substantially such 
marketing policy, the committee shall submit to the Secretary a revised 
marketing policy report setting forth the information prescribed in this 
section. The committee shall publicly announce the contents of each 
marketing policy report, including each revised marketing policy report, 
and copies thereof shall be maintained in the office of the committee

Secretary may request.


<R05>

effectuate the declared policy of the act. Such regulations may:
    (1) Limit, during any period or periods, the shipment of any 
particular grade, size, quality, maturity, or pack, or any combination 
thereof, of any variety or varieties of cherries grown in any district 
or districts of the production area;
    (2) Limit the shipment of cherries by establishing, in terms of 
grades, sizes, or both, minimum standards of quality and maturity during 
any period when season average prices are expected to exceed the parity 
level;
    (3) Fix the size, capacity, weight, dimensions, markings, or pack of 
the container, or containers, which may be used in the packaging or 
handling of cherries.
    (b) The committee shall be informed immediately of any such

terminated with respect to any or all shipments of cherries in order to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall modify, suspend, or 
terminate such regulation. On the same basis and in like manner the 
Secretary may terminate any such modification or suspension. If the 
Secretary finds that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall suspend or terminate 
such regulation. On the same basis and in like manner the Secretary may 
terminate any such suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 923.54  Special purpose shipments.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person may, 
without regard to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 923.41, 923.52, 923.53,

safeguards may include the requirements that handlers

[[Page 185]]

shall file applications and receive approval from the committee for 
authorization to handle cherries pursuant to this section, and that such 
applications be accompanied by a certification by the intended purchaser 
or receiver that the cherries will not be used for any purpose not 
authorized by this section. The committee may rescind or deny to any 
packing facility the special purpose shipment certificate if proof

thereof, so that the information contained therein which may adversely 
affect the competitive position of any handler in relation to other 
handlers will not be disclosed. Compilations of general reports from 
data submitted by handlers are authorized, subject to the prohibition of 
disclosure of individual handler's identities or operations.
    (c) Each handler shall maintain for at least two succeeding years

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 924.40  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its 
maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and 
perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part during 
each fiscal period. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired 
by the levying of assessments as prescribed in Sec. 924.41.


<R05>
Sec. 924.41  Assessments.

    (a) Each person who first handles prunes shall, with respect to the 
prunes so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such person's 
pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will be 
incurred by the committee during each fiscal period. Each such person's 
share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the total 
quantity of prunes handled by him as the first handler thereof during 
the applicable fiscal period and the total quantity of prunes so handled 
by all persons during the same fiscal period. The payment of assessments 
for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required 
under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of 
whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become 
inoperative.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by 
each such person. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the 
Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure 
sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to 
the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to 
all prunes handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to 
provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part 
during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating 
income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, 
the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may 
also borrow money for such purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 924.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as 
follows:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this 
section, each person entitled to a proportionate refund of any excess 
assessment shall be credited with such refund against the operation of 
the following fiscal period unless such person demands repayment 
thereof, in which event it shall be paid to him: Provided, That any sum 
paid by a person in excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during 
any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such 
fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such 
person.
    (2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish 
and

[[Page 195]]

maintain during one or more fiscal years an operating monetary reserve 
in an amount not to exceed approximately one fiscal year's operational 
expenses. Funds in such reserve shall be available for use by the 
committee for all expenses authorized pursuant to Sec. 924.40.
    (3) Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray 
the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such 
manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, That 
to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the 
persons from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this 
part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The 
Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to

marketing policy, the committee shall submit to the Secretary a revised 
marketing policy report setting forth the information prescribed in this 
section. The committee shall publicly announce the contents of each 
marketing policy report, including each revised marketing policy report, 
and copies thereof shall be maintained in the office of the committee 
where they shall be available for examination by growers and handlers.


<R05>
Sec. 924.51  Recommendations for regulation.

    (a) Whenever the committee deems it advisable to regulate the 
handling of any variety or varieties of prunes in the manner provided in 
Sec. 924.52, it shall so recommend to the Secretary.
    (b) In arriving at its recommendations for regulation pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, the committee shall give consideration to 
current information with respect to the factors affecting the supply and 
demand for prunes during the period or periods when it is proposed that 
such

[[Page 196]]

regulation should be made effective. With each such recommendation for

information on which such recommendation is predicated and such other 
available information as the Secretary may request.


<R05>
Sec. 924.52  Issuance of regulations.

    (a) The Secretary shall regulate, in the manner specified in this 
section, the handling of prunes whenever he finds, from the 
recommendations and information submitted by the committee, or from 
other available information, that such regulations will tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act. Such regulations may:
    (1) Limit, during any period or periods, the shipment of any 
particular grade, size, quality, maturity, or pack or any combination 
thereof, of any variety or varieties of prunes grown in any district or 
districts: Provided, That whenever any regulation under this paragraph 
prescribes a specific maturity requirement applicable to the handling of 
any variety of prunes, such maturity requirement shall apply uniformly 
to all prunes of such variety grown in both districts;
    (2) Limit the shipment of prunes by establishing, in terms of 
grades, sizes, or both, minimum standards of quality and maturity during 
any period when season average prices are expected to exceed the parity 
level;
    (3) Fix the size, capacity, weight, dimensions, markings, or pack of 
the container, or containers, which may be used in the packaging or 
handling of prunes;
    (4) Prescribe requirements, as provided in this paragraph, 
applicable to exports of any variety of prunes which are different from 
those applicable to the handling of the same variety to other 
destinations.
    (b) The committee shall be informed immediately of any such 
regulation issued by the Secretary, and the committee shall promptly 
give notice thereof to growers and handlers.


<R05>

information, that a regulation should be modified, suspended, or 
terminated with respect to any or all shipments of prunes in order to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall modify, suspend, or 
terminate such regulation. On the same basis and in like manner the 
Secretary may terminate any such modification or suspension. If the 
Secretary finds that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall suspend or terminate 
such regulation. On the same basis and in like manner the Secretary may 
terminate any such suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 924.54  Special purpose shipments.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person may,

the committee, or from other available information, the Secretary may 
relieve from any or all requirements, under or established pursuant to 
Sec. 924.41, Sec. 924.52, Sec. 924.53, or Sec. 924.55, the handling 
of prunes in such minimum quantities, or types of shipments, or for such 
specified purposes (including shipments to facilitate the conduct of 
marketing research and development projects established pursuant to 
Sec. 924.45) as the committee, with approval of the Secretary, may 
prescribe.
    (c) The committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary, 
prescribe such rules, regulations, and safeguards as it may deem 
necessary to prevent prunes handled under the provisions of this section 
from entering the channels of trade for other than the specific purposes 
authorized by this section. Such rules, regulations, and safeguards may 
include the requirements that handlers

[[Page 197]]

shall file applications and receive approval from the committee for 
authorization to handle prunes pursuant to this section, and that such 
applications be accompanied by a certification by the intended purchaser 
or receiver that the prunes will not be used for any purpose not 
authorized by this section.


<R05>
Sec. 924.55  Inspection and certification.

    Whenever the handling of any variety of prunes is regulated pursuant 
to Sec. 924.52 or Sec. 924.53, each handler who handles prunes shall, 
prior thereto, cause such prunes to be inspected by the Federal or 
Federal-State Inspection Service, and certified by it as meeting the 
applicable requirements of such regulation: Provided, That inspection 
and certification shall be required for prunes which previously have 
been so inspected and certified only if such prunes have been regraded, 
resorted, repackaged, or in any other way further prepared for market. 
Promptly after inspection and certification, each such handler shall 
submit, or cause to be submitted, to the committee a copy of the 
certificate of inspection issued with respect to such prunes. The 
committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, prescribe rules and 
regulations modifying the inspection requirements of this section as to 
time and place such inspection shall be performed whenever it is 
determined it would not be practical to perform the required inspection 
at a particular location: Provided, That all such shipments shall comply 
with all regulations in effect.

    (a) Upon request of the committee made with the approval of the 
Secretary, each handler shall furnish to the committee, in such manner 
and at such time as it may prescribe, such reports and other information 
as may be necessary for the committee to perform its duties under this 
part. Such reports may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the 
following: (1) The quantities of each variety of prunes received by a 
handler; (2) the quantities disposed of by him, segregated as to the 
respective quantities subject to regulation and not subject to 
regulation; (3) the date of each such disposition and the identification 
of the carrier transporting such prunes; and (4) the destination of each 
shipment of such prunes.
    (b) All such reports shall be held under appropriate protective 
classification and custody by the committee, or duly appointed employees 
thereof, so that the information contained therein which may adversely 
affect the competitive position of any handler in relation to other 
handlers will not be disclosed. Compilations of general reports from 
data submitted by handlers are authorized, subject to the prohibition of 
disclosure of individual handler's identities or operations.
    (c) Each handler shall maintain for at least two succeeding years 
such records of the prunes received, and of prunes disposed of, by such 
handler as may be necessary to verify reports pursuant to this section.

handling prunes of such handler's own production), whose packing 
facilities are located in an area where either a Washington State Plant 
Industry Division Inspection Office or Oregon State Plant Industry 
Inspection Office or Federal-State Inspector is not readily available to

Committee for a permit authorizing a waiver of inspection. Applications 
shall be made on forms furnished by the Committee and shall contain such 
information as the Committee may require including: Name and address of 
applicant, location of packing facility, distance of packing facility 
from the nearest inspection office, period (approximate beginning and 
ending dates) during which the applicant expects to ship to fresh market

orchard to truckers, etc.), areas or markets to which the applicant 
expects to ship the majority of the prunes. The application shall also 
contain an agreement by applicant
    (1) not to ship or handle any prunes unless such prunes meet the 
grade, size, maturity, container, and all other requirements of the 
marketing agreement and order in effect at time of handling;

prescribe.
    (b) Issuance of permit. Whenever the Committee finds and determines 
from the information contained in the application or from other proof 
satisfactory to the Committee that the applicant is

agreement and order at time of shipment, the Committee shall issue a 
permit authorizing the applicant to ship prunes in accordance with these 
administrative regulations and the terms and conditions of such permit.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its

perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The 
funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired in the manner prescribed 
in Sec. 925.41.


<R05>
Sec. 925.41  Assessments.

    (a) Each person who first handles grapes shall pay to the committee, 
upon demand, such handler's pro rata share of the expenses which the 
Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the 
committee during a fiscal period. The payment of assessments for the 
maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this 
part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether 
particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by 
each such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure 
sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such 
period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to 
approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after 
a fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in 
order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later findings by the 
Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase 
shall be applied to all grapes handled during the applicable fiscal 
period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the 
provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before 
sufficient operating income is available

[[Page 206]]

from assessments in the current period's shipments, the committee may 
accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money 
for such purpose.
    (c) Any assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time 
prescribed by the committee may be subject to an interest or late 
payment charge, or both. The period of time, rate of interest, and late 
payment charge shall be recommended by the committee and approved by the 
Secretary. Subsequent to such approval, all assessments not paid within 
the prescribed time shall be subject to the interest or late payment 
charge, or both.


<R05>
Sec. 925.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in 
accordance with one of the following:
    (1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, it shall be refunded proportionately 
to the persons from whom it was collected: Provided, That any sum paid 
by a person in excess of that person's pro rata share of the expenses 
during any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of 
such fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from 
such person.
    (2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry 
over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve: Provided, 
That funds in the reserve shall not exceed approximately one fiscal 
period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used: (i) To defray 
expenses, during any fiscal period, prior to the time the assessment 
income is sufficient to cover such expenses; (ii) to cover deficits 
incurred during any fiscal period when assessment income is less than 
expenses; (iii) to defray expenses incurred during any period when any 
or all provisions of this part are suspended or are inoperative; or (iv) 
to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination 
of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray 
the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such 
manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, That 
to the extent practicable such funds shall be returned pro rata to the 
persons from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee under this part shall be 
used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be 
accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at 
any time require the committee and its members to account for all 
receipts and disbursements.
    (c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any 
member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and 
disbursements and deliver all property and funds in such member's 
possession to the committee, and shall execute such assignments and 
other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the 
committee full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in

information that a regulation should be modified, suspended, or 
terminated with respect to any or all shipments of grapes in order to 
effectuate the declared policy of the act, the Secretary shall modify,

modification or suspension.

similar packing material, or packed in bags or wrapped in plastic or 
paper, and containers authorized in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, shall be 20 pounds based on the average net weight of grapes in 
a representative sample of containers. Grapes in any such containers 
packed in bags, or wrapped in plastic or paper prior to being placed in 
these containers shall meet a minimum net weight of 18 pounds based on 
the average net weight of grapes in a representative sample of 
containers: Provided, That grapes packed in master containers containing

shall be marked with

[[Page 212]]

the minimum net weight of 20 or 18 pounds.
    (3) Such containers of grapes shall be plainly marked with the 
minimum net weight of grapes contained therein (with numbers and letters 
at least one-fourth inch in height), the name of the variety of the 
grapes and the name of the shipper, as provided in Sec. Sec. 1436.30 
and 1359 of Title 3: California Code of Regulations.
    (4) Such containers of grapes shall be plainly marked with the lot 
stamp number corresponding to the lot inspection conducted by an 
authorized inspector, except that such requirement shall not apply to 
containers in the center tier of a lot palletized in a 3 box by 3 box 
pallet configuration: Provided, That pallets of reusable plastic 
containers shall have the lot stamp number stamped on two USDA-approved 
pallet tags, each affixed to opposite sides of the pallet of containers, 
in addition to other required information on the cards of the individual 
containers.
    (c) Organically grown grapes. Organically grown grapes (defined to 
mean grapes which have been grown for market as natural grapes by 
performing all the normal cultural practices, but not using any 
inorganic fertilizers or agricultural chemicals including insecticides, 
herbicides, and growth regulators, except sulfur) need not meet the 
minimum individual berry size requirements of this section if the 
following conditions and safeguards are met: (1) The handler of such 
grapes has registered and certified with the committee on a date 
specified by the committee the location of the vineyard, the acreage and 
variety of grapes, and such other information as may be needed by the 
committee to carry out these provisions; (2) each container of 
organically grown grapes bears the words ``organically grown'' on one 
outside end of the container in plain letters in addition to

    (d) By-product grapes. The handling of grapes for processing 
(raisins, crushing and other by-products) is exempt from requirements 
specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section if the 
committee determines that the person handling such grapes has secured 
the appropriate permit or order from the County Agricultural 
Commissioner, and the by-product plant or packing plant to which the 
grapes are shipped has adequate facilities for commercial processing, 
grading, packing or manufacturing of by-products for resale.
    (e) Suspension of packing holidays. Upon recommendation of the 
committee and approval of the Secretary, the prohibition against packing 
or repacking grapes on any Saturday, Sunday or on Memorial Day or 
Independence Day holidays of each year, may be modified or suspended to 
permit the handling of grapes provided such handling complies with 
procedures and safeguards specified by the committee as follows:
    (1) All requests for suspension of a packing holiday shall be in 
writing, shall state the reasons the suspension is being requested, and 
shall be submitted to the Committee manager by noon on Wednesday or at 
least 3 days prior to the requested suspension date;
    (2) Upon receipt of a written request, the Committee manager shall 
promptly give reasonable notice to producers and handlers and to the 
Secretary that an assembled Committee meeting will be held to discuss 
the request(s). The representative of the Secretary shall attend the 
meeting via speakerphone or in person, and all votes of the Committee 
members shall be cast in person;
    (3) The Committee members shall consider marketing conditions (i.e., 
supplies of competing commodities to include quantities in inventory, 
the expected demand conditions for grapes in different markets, and any 
pertinent documents which provide data on market conditions), weather 
conditions, labor shortages, the size of the crop remaining to be 
marketed, and other pertinent factors in reaching a decision to suspend 
packing holidays;
    (4) Once a vote is taken, any documents utilized during the meeting 
will be forwarded immediately to the Secretary's representative and a 
summary of the Committee's action and reasons for recommending approval 
or disapproval will be prepared and also forwarded by the committee; and
    (5) The Secretary's representative shall notify the Committee 
manager of

[[Page 213]]

approval or disapproval of the request prior to commencement of the 
suspended packing holiday and the Committee manager shall notify 
handlers and producers accordingly.

regulation are specified in the Title 3: California Code of Regulations 
and are incorporated by reference. Copies of such requirements are

other available data, the Secretary shall fix three base rates of 
assessment for pears that handlers shall pay on pears handled for the 
fresh market during each fiscal period. Such base rates shall include 
one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears 
classified as summer/fall; one rate of assessment for any or all 
varieties or subvarieties of pears, classified as winter; and one rate 
of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears 
classified as other. Upon recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee or 
other available data, the Secretary may also fix supplemental rates of 
assessment on individual varieties or subvarieties categorized within 
the assessment classifications in this paragraph (b)(1) to secure 
sufficient funds to provide for projects authorized under Sec. 927.47. 
At any time during the fiscal period when it is determined on the basis 
of a Fresh Pear Committee recommendation or other information that 
different rates are necessary for fresh pears or for any varieties or 
subvarieties, the Secretary may modify those rates of assessment and 
such new rate shall apply to any or all varieties or subvarieties that 
are shipped during the fiscal period for fresh market.
    (2) Based upon a recommendation of the Processed Pear Committee or 
other available data, the Secretary shall fix three base rates of 
assessment for pears that handlers shall pay on pears handled for 
processing during each fiscal

[[Page 223]]

period. Such base rates shall include one rate of assessment for any or 
all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as summer/fall; one 
rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears, 
classified as winter; and one rate of assessment for any or all 
varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as other. Upon 
recommendation of the Processed Pear Committee or other available data, 
the Secretary may also fix supplemental rates of assessment on 
individual varieties or subvarieties categorized within the assessment 
classifications defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to secure 
sufficient funds to provide for projects authorized under Sec. 927.47. 
At any time during the fiscal period when it is determined on the basis 
of a Processed Pear Committee recommendation or other information that 
different rates are necessary for pears for processing or for any 
varieties or subvarieties, the Secretary may modify those rates of 
assessment and such new rate shall apply to any or all varieties or 
subvarieties of pears that are shipped during the fiscal period for 
processing.
    (c) Based on the recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee, the 
Processed Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary may 
establish additional base rates of assessments, or change or modify the 
base rate classifications defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (d) The Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may 
impose a late payment charge on any handler who fails to pay any 
assessment within the time prescribed. In the event the handler 
thereafter fails to pay the amount outstanding, including the late 
payment charge, within the prescribed time, the Fresh Pear Committee or 
the Processed Pear Committee may impose an additional charge in the form 
of interest on such outstanding amount. The Fresh Pear Committee or the 
Processed Pear Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall 
prescribe the amount of such late payment charge and rate of interest.
    (e) In order to provide funds to carry out the functions of the 
Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee prior to 
commencement of shipments in any season, handlers may make advance 
payments of assessments, which advance payments shall be credited to 
such handlers and the assessments of such handlers shall be adjusted so 
that such assessments are based upon the quantity of each variety or 
subvariety of pears handled by such handlers during such season. 
Further, payment discounts may be authorized by the Fresh Pear Committee 
or the Processed Pear Committee upon the approval of the Secretary to 
handlers making such advance assessment payments.


<R05>
Sec. 927.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, the Fresh Pear Committee or the 
Processed Pear Committee may carryover such excess into subsequent 
fiscal periods as a reserve: Provided, That funds already in the reserve 
do not exceed approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve 
may be used to cover any expense authorized under this part and to cover 
necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this 
part. Any such excess not retained in a reserve or applied to any 
outstanding obligation of the person from whom it was collected shall be 
refunded proportionately to the persons from whom it was collected. Upon 
termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary 
expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the 
Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, That to the extent 
practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from 
whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received pursuant to the provisions of this part shall 
be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be 
accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at 
any time require the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear 
Committee and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.

or the Processed Pear Committee shall retain complete control of their 
use.

approval of the Secretary, may establish or provide for the 
establishment of production and post-harvest research, or marketing 
research and development projects designed to assist, improve, or 
promote the marketing, distribution, and consumption of pears. Such 
projects may provide for any form of marketing promotion, including paid 
advertising. The expense of such projects shall be paid from funds 
collected pursuant to Sec. Sec. 927.41 and 927.45. Expenditures for a 
particular variety or subvariety of pears shall approximate the amount 
of assessments and voluntary contributions collected for that variety or 
subvariety of pears.

    (a) It shall be the duty of the Fresh Pear Committee to investigate, 
from time to time, supply and demand conditions relative to pears and 
each grade, size, and quality of each variety or subvariety thereof. 
Such investigations shall be with respect to the following:
    (1) Estimated production of each variety or subvariety of pears and 
of each grade, size, and quality thereof;
    (2) Prospective supplies and prices of pears and other fruits, both 
in fresh and processed form, which are competitive to the marketing of 
pears;
    (3) Prospective exports of pears and imports of pears from other 
producing areas;
    (4) Probable harvesting period for each variety or subvariety of 
pears;
    (5) The trend and level of consumer income;
    (6) General economic conditions; and
    (7) Other relevant factors.
    (b) On or before August 1 of each year, the Fresh Pear Committee 
shall recommend regulations to the Secretary if it finds, on the basis 
of the investigations specified in this section, that such regulation as 
is provided in Sec. 927.51 will tend to effectuate the declared policy 
of the act.
    (c) In the event the Fresh Pear Committee at any time finds that by 
reason of changed conditions any regulation issued pursuant to Sec. 
927.51 should be modified, suspended, or terminated, it shall so 
recommend to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 927.51  Issuance of regulations; and modification, suspension, 
or termination thereof.

    (a) Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and 
information submitted by the Fresh Pear Committee, or from other 
available information, that regulation, in the manner specified in this 
section, of the shipment of fresh pears would tend to effectuate the 
declared policy of the act, he or she shall so limit the shipment of 
such pears during a specified period or periods. Such regulation may:
    (1) Limit the total quantity of any grade, size, quality, or 
combinations thereof, of any variety or subvariety of pears grown in any 
district and may prescribe different requirements applicable to 
shipments to different export markets;
    (2) Limit, during any period or periods, the shipment of any 
particular grade, size, quality, or any combination thereof, of any 
variety or subvariety, of pears grown in any district or districts of 
the production area; and
    (3) Provide a method, through rules and regulation issued pursuant 
to this part, for fixing markings on the container or containers, which 
may be used in the packaging or handling of pears, including appropriate 
logo or

[[Page 225]]

other container markings to identify the contents thereof.
    (b) Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and 
information submitted by the Fresh Pear Committee, or from other 
available information, that a regulation should be modified, suspended, 
or terminated with respect to any or all shipments of fresh pears grown 
in any district in order to effectuate the declared policy of the act, 
he or she shall so modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation. If the 
Secretary finds, from the recommendations and information submitted by 
the Fresh Pear Committee, or from other available information, that a 
regulation obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy 
of the act, he or she shall suspend or terminate such regulation. On the 
same basis and in like manner, the Secretary may terminate any such 
modification or suspension.

for varieties or subvarieties with less than 200,000 standard boxes or 
container equivalents) of the average quantity of such variety or 
subvariety produced in the particular district and shipped therefrom 
during the immediately preceding three fiscal periods; or
    (2) Such other basis as the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed 
Pear Committee may recommend and the Secretary may approve. The votes so

relative to the variety or subvariety of pears on which such votes were 
computed.

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 929.40  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its 
maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and 
perform its duties in accordance with the provisions hereof. The funds 
to cover such expenses shall be paid to the committee by handlers in the 
manner prescribed in Sec. 929.41.


<R05>
Sec. 929.41  Assessments.

    (a) As a handler's pro rate share of the expenses which the 
Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the 
committee during a fiscal period, a handler shall pay to the committee 
assessments on all cranberries acquired as the first handler thereof 
during such period, except as provided in Sec. 929.55: Provided, That 
no handler shall pay assessments on excess cranberries as provided in 
Sec. 929.57. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and 
functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout 
the period it is in effect, irrespective of whether particular 
provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by 
each handler during a fiscal period in an amount designated to secure 
funds sufficient to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such 
period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to 
approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after 
the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the assessment rate in 
order to secure funds sufficient to cover any later finding by the 
Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase 
shall be applied to all cranberries acquired during the applicable 
fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the 
provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal year, before 
sufficient operating income is available from assessments, the committee 
may accept the payment of assessments in advance and may also borrow 
money for such purposes.
    (c) If a handler does not pay such assessment within the period of 
time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be increased by 
either a late payment charge, or an interest charge, or both, at rates 
prescribed by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 929.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, the committee, with the approval of the 
Secretary, may carryover such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a 
reserve: Provided, That funds already in the reserve do not exceed 
approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be 
used (1) to cover any expenses authorized by this part and (2) to cover 
necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this 
part. If any such excess is not retained in a reserve, it shall be 
refunded proportionately to the handlers from whom the excess was 
collected. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to 
defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in 
such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate; Provided, 
That to the extent practical, such funds

[[Page 239]]

shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were 
collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part 
and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The 
Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to 
account for all receipts and disbursements.

from such other funds as approved by the Secretary.
    (b) The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, establish 
rules and regulations as necessary for the implementation and operation

<R05>
Sec. 929.48  Sales history.

    (a) A sales history for each grower shall be computed by the 
committee in the following manner:
    (1) For growers with acreage with 6 or more years of sales history, 
the sales history shall be computed using an average of the highest four 
of the most recent six years of sales.
    (2) For growers with 5 years of sales history from acreage planted 
or replanted 2 years prior to the first harvest on that acreage, the 
sales history is computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years.
    (3) For growers with 5 years of sales history from acreage planted 
or replanted 1 year prior to the first harvest on that acreage, the 
sales history is computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years and 
in a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume regulation 
shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
    (4) For a grower with 4 years or less of sales history, the sales 
history shall be computed by dividing the total sales from that acreage 
by 4 and in a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume 
regulation shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this 
section.
    (5) For growers with acreage having no sales history, or for the 
first harvest of replanted acres, the sales history will be the average 
first year yields (depending on whether first harvested 1 or 2 years 
after planting or replanting) as established by the committee and 
multiplied by the number of acres.
    (6) In a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume 
regulation, in addition to the sales history computed in accordance with 
paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, additional sales history 
shall be assigned to growers using the formula x=(a-b)c. The letter 
``x'' constitutes the additional number of barrels to be added to the

[[Page 240]]

grower's sales history. The value ``a'' is the expected yield for the 
forthcoming year harvested acreage as established by the committee. The 
value ``b'' is the total sales from that acreage as established by the 
committee divided by four. The value ``c'' is the number of acres 
planted or replanted in the specified year. For acreage with five years 
of sales history: a = the expected yield for the forthcoming sixth year 
harvested acreage (as established by the committee); b = an average of 
the most recent 4 years of expected yields (as established by the 
committee); and c = the number of acres with 5 years of sales history.
    (b) A new sales history shall be calculated for each grower after 
each crop year, using the formulas established in paragraph (a) of this 
section, or such other formula(s) as determined by the committee, with 
the approval of the Secretary.
    (c) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may adopt 
regulations to change the number and identity of years to be used in 
computing sales histories, including the number of years to be used in 
computing the average. The committee may establish, with the approval of 
the Secretary, rules and regulations necessary for the implementation 
and operation of this section.
    (d) Sales histories, starting with the crop year following adoption 
of this part, shall be calculated separately for fresh and processed 
cranberries. The amount of fresh fruit sales history may be calculated 
based on either the delivered weight of the barrels paid for by the 
handler (excluding trash and unusable fruit) or on the weight of the 
fruit paid for by the handler after cleaning and sorting for the retail 
market. Handlers using the former calculation shall allocate delivered 
fresh fruit subsequently used for processing to growers' processing 
sales. Fresh fruit sales history, in whole or in part, may be added to 
process fruit sales history with the approval of the committee in the 
event that the grower's fruit does not qualify as fresh fruit at 
delivery.
    (e) The committee may recommend rules and regulations, with the 
approval of the Secretary, to adjust a grower's sales history to 
compensate for catastrophic events that impact the grower's crop.

<R05>
929.49  Marketable quantity, allotment percentage, and annual allotment.

    (a) Marketable quantity and allotment percentage. If the Secretary 
finds, from the recommendation of the committee or from other available 
information, that limiting the quantity of cranberries purchased from or 
handled on behalf of growers during a crop year would tend to effectuate 
the declared policy of the Act, the Secretary shall determine and 
establish a marketable quantity for that crop year.
    (b) The marketable quantity shall be apportioned among growers by 
applying the allotment percentage to each grower's sales history, 
established pursuant to Sec. 929.48. Such allotment percentage shall be 
established by the Secretary and shall equal the marketable quantity 
divided by the total of all growers' sales histories including the 
estimated total sales history for new growers. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section, no handler shall purchase or handle on 
behalf of any grower cranberries not within such grower's annual 
allotment.
    (c) In any crop year in which the production of cranberries is 
estimated by the committee to be equal to or less than its recommended 
marketable quantity, the committee may recommend that the Secretary 
increase or suspend the allotment percentage applicable to that year. In 
the event it is found that market demand is greater than the marketable 
quantity previously set, the committee may recommend that the Secretary 
increase such quantity.
    (d) Issuance of annual allotments. The committee shall require all 
growers to qualify for such allotment by filing with the committee a 
form wherein growers include the following information:
    (1) The amount of acreage which will be harvested;
    (2) A copy of any lease agreement covering cranberry acreage;
    (3) The name of the handler(s) to whom their annual allotment will 
be delivered;

[[Page 241]]

    (4) Such other information as may be necessary for the 
implementation and operation of this section.
    (e) On or before such date as determined by the committee, with the 
approval of the Secretary, the committee shall issue to each grower an 
annual allotment determined by applying the allotment percentage 
established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to the grower's 
sales history.
    (f) On or before such date as determined by the committee, with the 
approval of the Secretary, in which an allotment percentage is 
established by the Secretary, the committee shall notify each handler of 
the annual allotment that can be handled for each grower whose total 
crop will be delivered to that handler. In cases where a grower delivers 
a crop to more than one handler, the grower must specify how the annual 
allotment will be apportioned among the handlers. If a grower does not 
specify how their annual allotment is to be apportioned among the 
handlers, the Committee will apportion such annual allotment equally 
among those handlers they are delivering their crop to.
    (g) Growers who do not produce cranberries equal to their computed 
annual allotment shall transfer their unused allotment to such growers' 
handlers unless it is transferred to another grower in accordance with 
Sec. 929.50(b) or if it is not assigned in accordance with paragraph 
(i) of this section. The handler shall equitably allocate the unused 
annual allotment to growers with excess cranberries who deliver to such 
handler. Unused annual allotment remaining after all such transfers have 
occurred shall be reported and transferred to the committee by such date 
as established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.
    (h) Handlers who receive cranberries more than the sum of their 
growers' annual allotments have ``excess cranberries,'' pursuant to 
Sec. 929.59, and shall so notify the committee. Handlers who have 
remaining unused allotment pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section are 
``deficient'' and shall so notify the committee. The committee shall 
allocate unused allotment to all handlers having excess cranberries, 
proportional to each handler's total allotment.
    (i) Growers who decide not to grow a crop, during any crop year in 
which a volume regulation is in effect, may choose not to assign their 
allotment to a handler.
    (j) The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, 
rules and regulations necessary for the implementation and operation of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 929.50  Transfers of Sales Histories and Annual Allotments.

    (a) Leases and sales of cranberry acreage--(1) Total or partial 
lease of cranberry acreage. When total or partial lease of cranberry 
acreage occurs, sales history attributable to the acreage being leased 
shall remain with the lessor.
    (2) Total sale of cranberry acreage. When there is a sale of a 
grower's total cranberry producing acreage, the committee shall transfer 
all owned acreage and all associated sales history to such acreage to 
the buyer. The seller and buyer shall file a sales transfer form 
providing the committee with such information as may be requested so 
that the buyer will have immediate access to the sales history 
computation process.
    (3) Partial sale of cranberry acreage. When less than the total 
cranberry producing acreage is sold, sales history associated with that 
portion of the acreage being sold shall be transferred with the acreage. 
The seller shall provide the committee with a sales transfer form 
containing, but not limited to the distribution of acreage and the 
percentage of sales history, as defined in Sec. 929.48(a)(1), 
attributable to the acreage being sold.
    (4) No sale of cranberry acreage shall be recognized unless the 
committee is notified in writing.
    (b) Allotment transfers. During a year of volume regulation, a 
grower may transfer all or part of his/her allotment to another grower. 
If a lease is in effect the lessee shall receive allotment from lessor 
attributable to the acreage leased. Provided, That the transferred 
allotment shall remain assigned to the same handler and that the 
transfer shall take place prior to a date to be recommended by the 
Committee and

[[Page 242]]

approved by the Secretary. Transfers of allotment between growers having 
different handlers may occur with the consent of both handlers.
    (c) The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, 
rules and regulations, as needed, for the implementation and operation 
of this section.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
if the committee deems it advisable to regulate the handling of 
cranberries in the manner provided in Sec. 929.52, it shall so 
recommend to the Secretary by the following appropriate dates:
    (1) An allotment percentage regulation must be recommended by no 
later than March 1;
    (2) A handler withholding program must be recommended by not later 
than August 31. Such recommendation shall include the free and 
restricted percentages for the crop year;
    (3) If both programs are recommended in the same year, the Committee 
shall submit with its recommendation an economic analysis to the USDA 
prior to March 1 of the year in which the programs are recommended.
    (b) An exception to the requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section may be made in a crop year in which, due to unforeseen 
circumstances, a producer allotment regulation is deemed necessary 
subsequent to the March 1 deadline.
    (c) In arriving at its recommendations for regulation pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, the committee shall give consideration to 
current information with respect to the factors affecting the supply of 
and demand for cranberries during the period when it is proposed that 
such regulation should be imposed. With each such recommendation for 
regulation, the committee shall submit to the Secretary the data and 
information on which such recommendation is based and any other 
information the Secretary may request.

Sec. 929.52  Issuance of regulations.

    (a) The Secretary shall regulate, in the manner specified in this 
section, the handling of cranberries whenever the Secretary finds, from 
the recommendations and information submitted by the committee, or from 
other available information, that such regulation will tend to 
effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Such regulation shall limit 
the total quantity of cranberries which may be handled during any fiscal 
period by fixing the free and restricted percentages, applied to 
cranberries acquired by handlers in accordance with Sec. 929.54, and/or 
by establishing an allotment percentage in accordance with Sec. 929.49.
    (b) The committee shall be informed immediately of any such

    (a) In the event the committee at any time finds that, by reason of 
changed conditions, any regulations issued pursuant to Sec. 929.52 
should be modified, suspended, or terminated, it shall so recommend to 
the Secretary.
    (b) Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and 
information submitted by the committee or from other available 
information, that a regulation should be modified, suspended, or 
terminated in order to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he 
shall modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation: Provided, That no 
such modification shall increase the restricted percentage previously

that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared 
policy of the act, he shall suspend or terminate such regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 929.54  Withholding.

    (a) Whenever the Secretary has fixed the free and restricted 
percentages for any fiscal period, as provided for in Sec. 929.52(a), 
each handler shall withhold from handling a portion of the cranberries 
acquired during such period. The withheld portion shall be equal to

[[Page 243]]

the restricted percentage multiplied by the volume of marketable 
cranberries acquired. Such withholding requirements shall not apply to 
any lot of cranberries for which such withholding requirement previously 
has been met by another handler in accordance with Sec. 929.55.
    (b) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall 
prescribe the manner in which, and date or dates during the fiscal 
period by which, handlers shall have complied with the withholding 
requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Withheld cranberries may meet such standards of grade, size, 
quality, or condition as the committee, with the approval of the 
Secretary, may prescribe. The Federal or Federal-State Inspection 
Service may inspect all such cranberries. A certificate of such 
inspection shall be issued which shall include the name and address of 
the handler, the number and type of containers in the lot, the location 
where the lot is stored, identification marks (including lot stamp, if 
used), and the quantity of cranberries in such lot that meet the 
prescribed standards. Promptly after inspection and certification, each 
such handler shall submit to the committee a copy of the certificate of 
inspection issued with respect to such cranberries.
    (d) Any handler who withholds from handling a quantity of 
cranberries in excess of that required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section shall have such excess quantity credited toward the next fiscal 
year's withholding obligation, if any--provided that such credit shall 
be applicable only if the restricted percentage established pursuant to 
Sec. 929.52 was modified pursuant to Sec. 929.53; to the extent such 
excess was disposed of prior to such modification; and after such 
handler furnishes the committee with such information as it prescribes 
regarding such withholding and disposition.
    (e) The Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish 
rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of 
this section.

Sec. 929.55  Interhandler transfer.

    (a) Transfer of cranberries from one handler to another may be made 
without prior notice to the committee, except during a period when a 
volume regulation has been established. If such transfer is made between 
handlers who have packing or processing facilities located within the 
production area, the assessment and withholding obligations provided 
under this part shall be assumed by the handler who agrees to meet such 
obligation. If such transfer is to a handler whose packing or processing 
facilities are outside of the production area, such assessment and 
withholding obligation shall be met by the handler residing within the

limited to, the amount of cranberries being converted and the identities 
of the handlers assuming the responsibility for withholding and 
disposing of the free cranberries being converted to restricted 
cranberries.
    (3) Cranberries converted to replace released cranberries may be 
required to be inspected and meet such standards as may be prescribed 
for withheld cranberries prior to disposal.
    (4) Transactions and agreements negotiated between handlers shall 
include all costs associated with such transactions including the 
purchase of the free cranberries to be converted to restricted 
cranberries and all costs associated with inspection (if applicable) and 
disposal of such restricted cranberries. No costs shall be incurred by 
the committee other than for the normal activities associated with the 
implementation and operation of a volume regulation program.
    (5) Free cranberries belonging to one handler and converted to 
restricted cranberries on the behalf of another handler shall be 
reported to the committee in such manner as prescribed by the committee.
    (c) Except as otherwise directed by the Secretary, as near as 
practicable to the beginning of the marketing season of each fiscal 
period with respect to which the marketing policy proposes regulation 
pursuant to Sec. 929.52(a), the committee shall determine the amount 
per barrel each handler shall deposit with the committee for it to 
release to him, in accordance with this section, all or part of the 
cranberries he is withholding; and the committee shall give notice of 
such amount of deposit to handlers. Such notice shall state the period 
during which such amount of deposit shall be in effect. Whenever the 
committee determines that, by reason of changed conditions or other 
factors, a different amount should therefore be deposited for the 
release of withheld cranberries, it shall give notice to handlers of the 
new amount and the effective period thereof. Each determination as to 
the amount of deposit shall be on the basis of the committee's 
evaluation of the following factors:
    (1) The prices at which growers are selling cranberries to handlers,
    (2) The prices at which handlers are selling fresh market 
cranberries to dealers,
    (3) The prices at which cranberries are being sold for processing in 
products,
    (4) The prices at which handlers are selling cranberry concentrate,
    (5) The prices the committee has paid to purchase cranberries to 
replace released cranberries in accordance with this section, and
    (6) The costs incurred by growers in producing cranberries.
    (7) Each request for release of withheld cranberries shall include, 
in addition to all other information as may be prescribed by the 
committee, the quantity of cranberries the release is requested and 
shall be accompanied by a deposit (a cashier's or certified check made 
payable to the Cranberry Marketing Committee) in an amount equal to the 
twenty percent of the amount determined by multiplying the number of 
barrels stated in the request by the then effective amount per barrel as 
determined in paragraph (c).
    (8) Subsequent deposits equal to, but not less than, the ten percent 
of the remaining outstanding balance shall be payable to the committee 
on a monthly basis commencing on January 1, and concluding by no later 
than August 31 of the fiscal period.
    (9) If the committee determines such a release request is properly 
filled out, is accompanied by the required deposit, and contains a 
certification that the handler is withholding such cranberries, it shall 
release to such handler the quantity of cranberries specified in his 
request.
    (d) Funds deposited for the release of withheld cranberries, 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, shall be used by the 
committee to purchase from handlers unrestricted (free percentage) 
cranberries in an aggregate amount as nearly equal to, but not in excess 
of,

[[Page 245]]

the total quantity of the released cranberries as it is possible to 
purchase to replace the released cranberries.
    (e) All handlers shall be given an equal opportunity to participate 
in such purchase of unrestricted (free percentage) cranberries. If a 
larger quantity is offered than can be purchased, the purchases shall be 
made at the lowest price possible. If two or more handlers offer 
unrestricted (free percentage) cranberries at the same price, purchases 
from such handlers shall be in proportion to the quantity of their 
respective offerings insofar as such division is practicable. The 
committee shall dispose of cranberries purchased as restricted 
cranberries in accordance with Sec. 929.57. Any funds received by the 
committee for cranberries so disposed of, which are in excess of the 
costs incurred by the committee in making such disposition, will accrue 
to the committee's general fund.
    (f) In the event any portion of the funds deposited with the 
committee pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section cannot, for reasons 
beyond the committee's control, be expended to purchase unrestricted 
(free percentage) cranberries to replace those withheld cranberries 
requested to be released, such unexpended funds shall, after deducting 
expenses incurred by the committee, be refunded to the handler who 
deposited the funds. The handler shall equitably distribute such refund 
among the growers delivering to such handler.
    (g) Inspection for restricted (withheld) cranberries released to a 
handler is not required.
    (h) The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, 
rules and regulations for the implementation of this section. Such rules 
and regulations may include, but are not limited to, revisions in the 
payment schedule specified in paragraphs (c)(7) and (c)(8) of this 
section.

Sec. 929.102  Procedure to determine quantity of screened cranberries 
in unscreened lots.

    The determination pursuant to Sec. 929.54 of the quantity of 
screened cranberries contained in an unscreened lot shall be made in 
accordance with the following procedure and on the basis of a sample of 
representative boxes comprising no less than 2 percent of the 
cranberries in the lot:
    (a) The cranberries in the sample are cleaned to remove chaff, and 
the boxes of cleaned berries are weighed. The weight of the boxes 
themselves is then deducted to determine the weight of the cleaned 
berries. The weight of the cleaned berries is divided by the number of 
boxes in the sample to obtain the net weight of cleaned cranberries per 
box. The net weight is multiplied by the number of boxes in the lot to 
obtain the net weight of the berries in the unscreened lot.

[[Page 250]]

    (b) The cleaned berries are run through a separator, having a \9/32\ 
inch screen, and with the bounce boards in the lowest position.
    (c) The berries from the lower three bounce boards are rerun through 
the separator.
    (d) The berries from the upper four bounce boards are thoroughly 
mixed and a random cupful (approximately 1 pint) is used to determine, 
from a count of the sound and unsound berries, the percentage of sound 
berries in the lot.
    (e) Such percentage is adjusted by increasing it by 5 percentage 
points but not to exceed a total of 100 percent. (This increase makes 
the sample comparable to lots of screened cranberries, as such lots 
generally contain an average of 5 percent unsound berries.)
    (f) The net weight, as determined in accordance with paragraph (a) 
of this section, of the berries in the unscreened lot, is multiplied by 
the adjusted percentage to obtain the quantity of screened cranberries 
in the unscreened lot.

    (b) The handler offering any lot of cranberries for inspection shall 
furnish the necessary labor and pay the costs of moving, weighing, and 
otherwise making available the sample the inspector chooses for 
inspection. The size of the sample shall be determined by the inspector. 
In the case of inspection of a lot of unscreened cranberries, the sample 
shall be screened by the handler under the supervision of the inspector 
and the inspection certificate shall show the quantity of cranberries in 
such lot which meets the requirements established for withheld 
cranberries pursuant to Sec. 929.54(c).

    A sales history for each grower shall be computed by the Committee 
in the following manner.
    (a) For each grower with acreage with 7 or more years of sales 
history, a new sales history shall be computed using an average of the 
highest 4 of the most recent 7 years of sales. If the grower has acreage 
with 6 years sales history, a new sales history shall be computed by 
averaging the highest 4 of the 6 years. If the grower has acreage with 5 
years of sales history and such acreage was planted prior to 1995, a new 
sales history shall be computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 
years.
    (b) For growers whose acreage has 5 years of sales history and was 
planted in 1995 or later, the sales history shall be computed by 
averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years and shall be adjusted as provided 
in paragraph (d). For growers whose acreage has 4 years of sales 
history, the sales history shall be computed by averaging all 4 years 
and shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (d). For growers whose 
acreage has 1 to 3 years of sales history, the sales history shall be 
computed by dividing the total years sales by 4 and shall be adjusted as 
provided in paragraph (d).
    (c) For growers with acreage with no sales history or for the first 
harvest of replanted acres, the sales history will be 75 barrels per 
acre for acres planted or re-planted in 2000 and first harvested in 2001 
and 156 barrels per acre for acres planted or re-planted in 1999 and 
first harvested in 2001.
    (d) In addition to the sales history computed in accordance with 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, additional sales history shall 
be assigned to growers with acreage planted in 1995 or later. The 
additional sales histories depending on the date the acreage is planted

    (c) Upon the adoption of this part, the production area shall be 
divided into the following described subdivisions for purposes of this 
section:

District 1--Northern Michigan: that portion of the State of Michigan 
which is north of a line drawn along the northern boundary of Mason 
County and extended east to Lake Huron.
District 2--Central Michigan: that portion of the State of Michigan 
which is south of District 1 and north of a line drawn along the 
northern boundary of Allegan County and extended east to Lake St. Clair.
District 3--Southern Michigan: That portion of the State of Michigan not 
included in Districts 1 and 2.
District 4--The State of New York.
District 5--The State of Oregon.
District 6--The State of Pennsylvania.
District 7--The State of Utah.
District 8--The State of Washington.
District 9--The State of Wisconsin.

    (d) The ratio of grower to handler representation in districts with 
three members shall alternate each time the term of a Board member from 
the representative group having two seats expires. During the initial 
period of the order, the ratio shall be as designated in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (e) Board members from districts with one seat may be either grower 
or handler members and will be nominated and elected as outlined in 
Sec. 930.23.
    (f) If the 3-year average production of a district changes so that a 
different number of seats should be allocated to the district, then the 
Board will be reestablished by the Secretary, and such seats will be 
filled according to the applicable provisions of this part. Each 
district's 3-year average production shall be recalculated annually as 
soon as possible after each season's final production figures are known.
    (g) In order to achieve a fair and balanced representation on the 
Board, and to prevent any one sales constituency from gaining control of 
the Board, not more than one Board member may be from, or affiliated 
with, a single sales constituency in those districts having more than 
one seat on the Board; Provided, That this prohibition shall not apply 
in a district where such a conflict cannot be avoided. There is no 
prohibition on the number of Board members from differing districts that

[[Page 258]]

may be elected from a single sales constituency which may have 
operations in more than one district. However, as provided in Sec. 
930.23, a handler or grower may only nominate Board members and vote in 
one district.
    (h) Subject to the approval of the Secretary, the Board shall at its 
first meeting and annually thereafter elect from among any of its 
members a chairperson and a vice-chairperson and may elect other 
appropriate officers.
    (i) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish 
rules and regulation's necessary and incidental to the administration of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 930.21  Reestablishment.

    Districts, subdivisions of districts, and the distribution of 
representation among growers and handlers within a respective district 
or subdivision thereof, or among the subdivision of districts, may be 
reestablished by the Secretary, subject to the provisions of Sec. 
930.23, based upon recommendations by the Board. In recommending any 
such changes, the Board shall consider:
    (a) The relative importance of producing areas;
    (b) Relative production;
    (c) The geographic locations of producing areas as they would affect 
the efficiency of administration of this part;
    (d) Shifts in cherry production within the districts and the 
production area;
    (e) Changes in the proportion and role of growers and handlers 
within the districts; and
    (f) Other relevant factors.


<R05>
Sec. 930.22  Term of office.

    The term of office of each member and alternate member of the Board 
shall be for three fiscal years: Provided that, of the nine initial 
members and alternates from the combination of Districts 1, 2 and 3, 
one-third of such initial members and alternates shall serve only one 
fiscal year, one-third of such members and alternates shall serve only 
two fiscal years, one-third of such members and alternates shall serve 
three fiscal years; and one-half of the initial members and alternates 
from Districts 4 and 7 shall serve only one fiscal year, and one-half of 
such initial members and alternates shall serve two fiscal years 
(determination of which of the initial members and their alternates 
shall serve for 1 fiscal year, 2 fiscal years, or 3 fiscal years, in 
both instances, shall be by lot). Members and alternate members shall 
serve in such capacity for the portion of the term of office for which 
they are selected and have qualified until their respective successors 
are selected, have qualified and are appointed. The consecutive terms of 
office of grower, handler and public members and alternate members shall 
be limited to two 3-year terms, excluding any initial term lasting less 
than 3 years. The term of office of a member and alternate member for 
the same seat shall be the same. If this part becomes effective on a 
date such that the initial fiscal period is less than six months in 
duration, then the tolling of time for purposes of this subsection shall 
not begin until the beginning of the first 12-month fiscal period.


<R05>
Sec. 930.23  Nomination and election.

    (a) Forms and ballots. Nomination and election of initial and 
successor members and alternate members of the Board shall be conducted 
through petition forms and election ballots distributed to all eligible 
growers and handlers via the U.S. Postal Service or other means, as 
determined by the Secretary. Similar petition forms and election ballots 
shall be used for both members and alternate members and any 
requirements for election of a member shall apply to the election of an 
alternate.
    (b) Nomination. (1) In order for the name of a grower nominee to 
appear on an election ballot, the nominee's name must be submitted with 
a petition form, to be supplied by the Secretary or the Board, which, 
except in District 8, contains at least five signatures of growers, 
other than the nominee, from the nominee's district who are eligible to 
vote in the referendum. Grower petition forms in District 8 must be 
signed by only two growers, other than the nominee, from the nominee's 
district.

[[Page 259]]

    (2) In order for the name of a handler nominee to appear on an 
election ballot, the nominee's name must be submitted with a petition 
form, to be supplied by the Secretary or the Board, which contains the 
signature of one or more handler(s), other than the nominee, from the 
nominee's district who is or are eligible to vote in the election and 
that handle(s) a combined total of no less than five percent (5%) of the 
average production, as that term is used Sec. 930.20, handled in the 
district. Provided, that this requirement shall not apply if its 
application would result in a sales constituency conflict as provided in 
Sec. 930.20(g). The requirement that the petition form be signed by a 
handler other than the nominee shall not apply in any district where 
fewer than two handlers are eligible to vote.
    (3) Only growers, including duly authorized officers or employees of 
growers, who are eligible to serve as grower members of the Board shall 
participate in the nomination of grower members and alternate grower 
members of the Board. No grower shall participate in the submission of 
nominees in more than one district during any fiscal period. If a grower 
produces cherries in more than one district, that grower may select in 
which district he or she wishes to participate in the nominations and 
election process and shall notify the Secretary or the Board of such 
selection. A grower may not participate in the nomination process in one 
district and the election process in a second district in the same 
election cycle.
    (4) Only handlers, including duly authorized officers or employees 
of handlers, who are eligible to serve as handler members of the Board 
shall participate in the nomination of handler members and alternate 
handler members of the Board. No handler shall participate in the 
selection of nominees in more than one district during any fiscal 
period. If a handler handles cherries in more than one district, that 
handler may select in which district he or she wishes to participate in 
the nominations and election process and shall notify the Secretary or 
the Board of such selection. A handler may not participate in the 
nominations process in one district and the elections process in a 
second district in the same election cycle. If a person is a grower and 
a grower-handler only because some or all of his or her cherries were 
custom packed, but he or she does not own or lease and operate a 
processing facility, such person may vote only as a grower.
    (5) In districts entitled to only one Board member, both growers and 
handlers may be nominated for the district's Board seat. Grower and 
handler nominations must follow the petition procedures outlined in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (6) All eligible growers and handlers in all districts may submit 
the names of the nominees for the public member and alternate public 
member of the Board.
    (7) After the appointment of the initial Board, the Secretary or the 
Board shall announce at least 180 days in advance when a Board member's 
term is expiring and shall solicit nominations for that position in the 
manner described in this section. Nominations for such position should 
be submitted to the Secretary or the Board not less than 120 days prior 
to the expiration of such term.
    (c) Election. (1) After receiving nominations, the Secretary or the 
Board shall distribute ballots via the U.S. Postal Service or other 
means, as determined by the Secretary, to all eligible growers and 
handlers containing the names of the nominees by district for the 
respective seats on the Board, excluding the public voting member seat. 
The ballots will clearly indicate that growers and handlers may only 
rank or otherwise vote for nominees in their own district.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, only 
growers, including duly authorized officers or employees of growers, who 
are eligible to serve as grower members of the Board shall participate 
in the election of grower members and alternate grower members of the 
Board. No grower shall participate in the election of Board members in 
more than one district during any fiscal period. If a grower produces 
cherries in more than one district, the grower must vote in the same 
district in which he or she chose to participate in the nominations 
process under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

[[Page 260]]

However, if the grower did not participate in the nominations process, 
he or she may select in which district he or she wishes to vote and 
shall notify the Secretary or the Board of such selection.
    (3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, only 
handlers, including duly authorized officers or employees of handlers, 
who are eligible to serve as handler members of the Board shall 
participate in the election of handler members and alternate handler 
members of the Board. No handler shall participate in the election of 
Board members in more than one district during any fiscal period. If a 
handler does handle cherries in more than one district, he or she must 
vote in the same district in which the handler elected to participate in 
the nominations process under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. However, 
if a handler did not participate in the nominations process, that 
handler may select in which district he or she chooses to vote and shall 
notify the Secretary or the Board of such selection. If a person is a 
grower and a grower-handler only because some or all of his or her 
cherries were custom packed, but he or she does not own or lease and 
operate a processing facility, such person may vote only as a grower.
    (ii) To be seated as a handler representative in any district, the 
successful candidate must receive the support of handler(s) that handled 
a combined total of no less than five percent (5%), of the average 
production, as that term is used in Sec. 930.20, handled in the 
district; Provided, that this paragraph shall not apply if its 
application would result in a sales constituency conflict as provided in 
Sec. 930.20(g).
    (4) In districts entitled to only one Board member, growers and 
handlers may vote for either the grower or handler nominee(s) for the 
single seat allocated to those districts.
    (d) The members of the Board appointed by the Secretary pursuant to 
Sec. 930.24 shall, at the first meeting and whenever necessary 
thereafter, by at least a two-thirds vote of the entire Board, select 
individuals to serve as the public member and alternate public member of 
the Board from the list of nominees received from growers and handlers 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or from other persons 
nominated by the Board. The persons selected shall be subject to 
appointment by the Secretary under Sec. 930.24.
    (e) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish 
rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of 
this section.

Board, or from other qualified individuals. Any nominations made by the 
Board to fill a vacancy must be received by the Secretary within 90 days 
of the effective date of the vacancy. Board members wishing to resign 
from the Board must do so in writing to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 930.28  Alternate members.

    An alternate member of the Board, during the absence of the member 
for whom that member serves as an alternate, shall act in the place and 
stead of such member and perform such other duties as assigned. However, 
if a member is in attendance at a meeting of the Board, an alternate 
member may not act in the place and stead of such member. In the event a 
member and his or her alternate are absent from a meeting of the Board, 
such member may designate, in writing and prior to the meeting, another 
alternate to act in his or her place: Provided, that such alternate 
represents the same group (grower or handler) as the member. In the 
event of the death, removal, resignation or disqualification of a 
member, the alternate shall act for the member until a successor is 
appointed and has qualified.

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 930.40  Expenses.

    The Board is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred for its maintenance and 
functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its 
duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The funds to 
cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments as 
provided in Sec. 930.41.


<R05>
Sec. 930.41  Assessments.

    (a) An assessment may be levied upon handlers annually under this 
part to cover the administrative costs of the Board, costs of 
inspection, and any research, development and promotion activities 
initiated by the Board under Sec. 930.48.
    (b) Each part of an assessment intended to cover the costs of each 
activity in paragraph (a) of this section, must be identified and 
approved by the Board and the Secretary, and any notification or other 
statement regarding assessments provided to handlers must contain such 
information.
    (c) As a pro rata share of the administrative, inspection, research, 
development, and promotion expenses which the Secretary finds reasonable 
and likely to be incurred by the Board during a fiscal period, each 
handler shall pay to the Board assessments on all cherries handled, as 
the handler thereof, during such period: Provided, a handler shall be 
exempt from any assessment only on the tonnage of handled cherries that 
either are diverted by destruction at the handler's facilities according 
to Sec. 930.59 or are cherries represented by grower diversion 
certificates issued pursuant to Sec. 930.58(b) and acquired by handlers 
as described in Sec. 930.59.
    (d) The Secretary, after consideration of the recommendation of the 
Board, shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each handler 
during the fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient 
funds to cover the expenses which may be approved and incurred during 
such period or subsequent period as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary 
may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds 
to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses 
which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cherries 
handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds 
for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first 
part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available 
from assessments, the Board may accept the payment of assessments in 
advance, and may borrow money for such purposes.
    (e) Assessments not paid within a time prescribed by the Board may 
be

[[Page 264]]

made subject to interest or late payment charges, or both. The period of 
time, rate of interest, and late payment charge will be as recommended 
by the Board and approved by the Secretary: Provided, That when interest 
or late payment charges are in effect, they shall be applied to all 
assessments not paid within the prescribed period of time.
    (f) Assessments shall be calculated on the basis of pounds of 
cherries handled. The established assessment rate may be uniform, or may 
vary dependent on the product the cherries are used to manufacture. In 
recommending annual assessment rates, the Board shall consider:
    (1) The differences in the number of pounds of cherries utilized for 
various cherry products; and
    (2) The relative market values of such cherry products.
    (g) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish 
rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 930.42  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, the Board, with the approval of the 
Secretary, may carry over all or any portion of such excess into 
subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve. Such reserve funds may be used 
to cover any expenses authorized by this part, and to cover necessary 
expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. If any 
such excess is not retained in a reserve, it shall be refunded 
proportionately to the handlers from whom the excess was collected. 
Without an additional reserve level approved by the Secretary, the 
amount held in reserve may not exceed approximately one year's 
operational expenses. Upon termination of this part, any funds not 
required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be 
disposed of in such a manner as the Secretary may determine to be 
appropriate: Provided, That to the extent practicable, such funds shall 
be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the Board pursuant to the provisions of 
this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part 
and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The 
Secretary may at any time require the Board and its members to account 
for all receipts and disbursements.

    (a) Quality standards. The Board may establish, with the approval of 
the Secretary, such minimum quality and inspection requirements 
applicable to cherries as will contribute to orderly marketing or be in 
the public interest. If such requirements are adopted, no handler shall 
process cherries into manufactured products or sell manufactured 
products in the current of commerce unless such cherries and/or such 
cherries used in the manufacture of products meet the applicable 
requirements as evidenced by certification acceptable to the Board. The 
Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and 
regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this 
section.
    (b) Inspection and certification. Whenever the handling of any 
cherries requires inspection pursuant to this part, each handler who 
handles cherries shall cause such cherries to be inspected by the 
appropriate division of USDA, and certified by it as meeting the 
applicable requirements of such regulation: Provided, That inspection 
and certification shall be required for cherries which previously have 
been so inspected and certified only if such cherries have been 
regraded, resorted, repackaged, or in any other way further prepared for 
market. Promptly after inspection and certification, each such handler 
shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Board a copy of the 
certificate of inspection issued with respect to such cherries.

<R05>
Sec. 930.48  Research, market development and promotion.

    The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish or 
provide for

[[Page 265]]

the establishment of production and processing research, market research 
and development, and/or promotional activities, including paid 
advertising, designed to assist, improve or promote the efficient 
production and processing, marketing, distribution, and consumption of 
cherries subject to this part. The expense of such projects shall be 
paid from funds collected pursuant to this part and the income from such 
funds.

                               Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 930.50  Marketing policy.

    (a) Optimum supply. On or about July 1 of each crop year, the Board 
shall hold a meeting to review sales data, inventory data, current crop 
forecasts and market conditions in order to establish an optimum supply 
level for the crop year. The optimum supply volume shall be calculated 
as 100 percent of the average sales of the prior three years reduced by 
average sales that represent dispositions of exempt cherries and 
restricted percentage cherries qualifying for diversion credit for the 
same three years, unless the Board determines that it is necessary to 
recommend otherwise with respect to sales of exempt and restricted 
percentage cherries, to which shall be added a desirable carry-out 
inventory not to exceed 20 million pounds or such other amount as the 
Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. This optimum 
supply volume shall be announced by the Board in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (b) Preliminary percentages. On or about July 1 of each crop year, 
the Board shall establish a preliminary free market tonnage percentage 
which shall be calculated as follows: from the optimum supply computed 
in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall deduct the carry-in 
inventory to determine the tonnage requirements (adjusted to a raw fruit 
equivalent) for the current crop year which will be subtracted from the 
current year USDA crop forecast or by an average of such other crop 
estimates the Board votes to use. If the resulting number is positive, 
this would represent the estimated overproduction which would be the 
restricted tonnage. This restricted tonnage would then be divided by the 
sum of the crop forecast(s) for the regulated districts to obtain a 
preliminary restricted percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number, 
for the regulated districts. If subtracting the current crop year 
requirement, computed in the first sentence from the current crop 
forecast, results in a negative number, the Board shall establish a 
preliminary free market tonnage percentage of 100 percent with a 
preliminary restricted percentage of zero. The Board shall announce 
these preliminary percentages in accordance with paragraph (h) of this 
section.
    (c) Interim percentages. Between July 1 and September 15 of each 
crop year, the Board may modify the preliminary free market tonnage and 
restricted percentages to adjust to the actual pack occurring in the 
industry. The Board shall announce any interim percentages in accordance 
with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (d) Final percentages. No later than September 15 of each crop year, 
the Board shall review actual production during the current crop year 
and make such adjustments as are necessary between free and restricted 
tonnage to achieve the optimum supply and recommend such final free 
market tonnage and restricted percentages to the Secretary and announce 
them in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The difference 
between any final free market tonnage percentage designated by the 
Secretary and 100 percent shall be the final restricted percentage. With 
its recommendation, the Board shall report on its consideration of the 
factors in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Factors. When computing preliminary and interim percentages, or 
determining final percentages for recommendation to the Secretary, the 
Board shall give consideration to the following factors:
    (1) The estimated total production of cherries;
    (2) The estimated size of the crop to be handled;
    (3) The expected general quality of such cherry production;
    (4) The expected carryover as of July 1 of canned and frozen 
cherries and other cherry products;

[[Page 266]]

    (5) The expected demand conditions for cherries in different market 
segments;
    (6) Supplies of competing commodities;
    (7) An analysis of economic factors having a bearing on the 
marketing of cherries;
    (8) The estimated tonnage held by handlers in primary or secondary 
inventory reserves; and
    (9) Any estimated release of primary or secondary inventory reserve 
cherries during the crop year.
    (f) Modification. In the event the Board subsequently deems it 
advisable to modify its marketing policy, because of national emergency, 
crop failure, or other major change in economic conditions, it shall 
hold a meeting for that purpose, and file a report thereof with the 
Secretary within 5 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) 
after the holding of such meeting, which report shall show the Board's 
recommended modification and the basis therefor.
    (g) Additional tonnage to sell as free tonnage. In addition, the 
Board, in years when restricted percentages are established, shall make 
available tonnage equivalent to an additional 10 percent, if available, 
of the average sales of the prior 3 years, as defined in paragraph (a) 
of this section, for market expansion.
    (h) Publicity. The Board shall promptly give reasonable publicity to 
growers and handlers of each meeting to consider a marketing policy or 
any modification thereof, and each such meeting shall be open to them 
and to the public. Similar publicity shall be given to growers and 
handlers of each marketing policy report or modification thereof, filed 
with the Secretary and of the Secretary's action thereon. Copies of all 
marketing policy reports shall be maintained in the office of the Board, 
where they shall be made available for examination. The Board shall 
notify handlers, and give reasonable publicity to growers, of its 
computation of the optimum supply, preliminary percentages, and interim 
percentages and shall notify handlers of the Secretary's action on final 
percentages by registered or certified mail.
    (i) Restricted percentages. Restricted percentage requirements 
established under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section may be 
fulfilled by handlers by either establishing an inventory reserve in 
accordance with Sec. 930.55 or Sec. 930.57 or by diversion of product 
in accordance with Sec. 930.59. In years where required, the Board 
shall establish a maximum percentage of the restricted quantity which 
may be established as a primary inventory reserve such that the total 
primary inventory reserve does not exceed 50-million pounds; Provided, 
That such 50-million-pound quantity may be changed upon recommendation 
of the Board and approval of the Secretary. Any such change shall be 
recommended by the Board on or before September 30 of any crop year to 
become effective for the following crop year, and the quantity may be 
changed no more than one time per crop year. Handlers will be permitted 
to divert (at plant or with grower diversion certificates) as much of 
the restricted percentage requirement as they deem appropriate, but may 
not establish a primary inventory reserve in excess of the percentage 
established by the Board for restricted cherries. In the event handlers 
wish to establish inventory reserve in excess of this amount, they may 
do so, in which case it will be classified as a secondary inventory 
reserve and will be regulated accordingly.
    (j) Inventory Reserve Release. In years when inventory reserve 
cherries are available and when the expected availability of cherries 
from the current crop plus expected carryin inventory does not fulfill 
the optimum supply, the Board shall release not later than November 1st 
of the current crop year such volume from the inventory reserve as will 
satisfy the optimum supply.
    (k) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish 
rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 930.51  Issuance of volume regulations.

    (a) Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendation and 
supporting information supplied by the Board, that to designate final 
free market tonnage and restricted percentages for any cherries acquired 
by handlers during the crop year will tend to effectuate the declared 
policy of the Act, the Secretary shall designate such percentages. Such 
regulation designating such percentage shall fix the free market tonnage 
and restricted percentages, totaling 100 percent, which shall be applied 
in accordance with this section, Sec. Sec. 930.55, 930.57 and 930.59 to 
cherries grown in regulated districts, as determined under Sec. 930.52, 
and handled during such fiscal period.
    (b) The Board shall be informed immediately of any such regulation 
issued by the Secretary, and the Board shall promptly give notice 
thereof to handlers.
    (c) That portion of a handler's cherries that are restricted 
percentage cherries is the product of the restricted percentage imposed 
under paragraph (a) of this section multiplied by the tonnage of 
cherries, originating in a regulated district, handled, including those 
diverted according to Sec. 930.59, by that handler in that fiscal year.
    (d) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, shall develop 
rules and regulations which shall provide guidelines for handlers in 
complying with any restricted tonnage requirements, including, but not 
limited to, a grace period of at least 30 days to segregate and 
appropriately document any tonnage they wish to place in the inventory 
reserve and to assemble any applicable diversion certificates.

<R05>
Sec. 930.52  Establishment of districts subject to volume regulations.

    (a) The districts in which handlers shall be subject to any volume 
regulations implemented in accordance with this part shall be those 
districts in which the average annual production of cherries over the 
prior 3 years has exceeded 6 million pounds. Handlers shall become 
subject to volume regulation implemented in accordance with this part in 
the crop year that follows any 3-year period in which the 6-million 
pound average production requirement is exceeded in that district.
    (b) Handlers in districts which are not subject to volume regulation 
would only be so regulated to the extent that they handled cherries 
which were grown in a district subject to regulation as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. In such a case, the handler must place in 
inventory reserve pursuant to Sec. 930.55 or Sec. 930.57 or divert 
pursuant to Sec. 930.59 the required restricted percentage of the crop 
originating in the regulated district.
    (c) Handlers in districts not meeting the production requirement 
described in paragraph (a) of this section in a given year would not be 
subject to volume regulation in the next crop year.
    (d) Any district producing a crop which is less than 50 percent of 
the average annual processed production in that district in the previous 
five years would be exempt from any volume regulation if, in that year, 
a restricted percentage is established.
    (e) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish 
rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of 
this section.

[61 FR 49942, Sept. 24, 1996 as amended at 67 FR 51714, Aug. 8, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 930.53  Modification, suspension, or termination of regulations.

    (a) In the event the Board at any time finds that, by reason of 
changed conditions, any regulations issued pursuant to Sec. Sec. 930.44 
or 930.51 should be modified, suspended, or terminated, it shall so 
recommend to the Secretary.
    (b) Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and 
information submitted by the Board or from other available information, 
that a regulation issued pursuant to Sec. Sec. 930.44 or 930.51 should 
be modified, suspended or terminated with respect to any or all 
shipments of cherries in order to effectuate the declared policy of the 
Act, the Secretary shall modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 930.54  Prohibition on the use or disposition of inventory 
reserve cherries.

    Cherries that are placed in inventory reserve pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 930.50, Sec. 930.51, Sec. 930.55, or Sec. 
930.57 shall not be used or disposed of by any handler or any other 
person except as provided in Sec. 930.50 or in paragraphs (a), (b), or 
(c) of this section.
    (a) If the Board determines that the total available supplies for 
use in commercial outlets are less than the amount needed to meet the 
demand in such outlets, the Board may recommend to the Secretary that a 
portion or all of the primary and/or secondary inventory reserve 
cherries be released for such use.
    (b) The Board may recommend to the Secretary that a portion or all 
of the primary and/or secondary inventory reserve cherries be released 
for sale in certain designated markets. Such designated markets may be 
defined in terms of the use or form of the cherries.
    (c) Cherries in the primary and/or secondary inventory reserve may 
be used at any time for uses exempt from regulation under Sec. 930.62.
    (d) Should the volume of cherries held in the primary inventory 
reserves and, subsequently, the secondary inventory reserves reach a 
minimum amount, which level will be established by the Secretary upon 
recommendation from the Board, the products held in the respective 
reserves shall be released from the reserves and made available to the 
handlers as free tonnage.

    Editorial Note: At 66 FR 232, Jan. 3, 2001, in Sec. 930.54 
paragraph (a), the word ``normal'' was suspended indefinitely.


<R05>
Sec. 930.55  Primary inventory reserves.

    (a) Whenever the Secretary has fixed the free market tonnage and 
restricted percentages for any fiscal period, as provided for in Sec. 
930.51(a), each handler in a regulated district shall place in his or 
her primary inventory reserve for such period, at such time, and in such 
manner, as the Board may prescribe, or otherwise divert, according to 
Sec. 930.59, a portion of the cherries acquired during such period.
    (b) The form of the cherries, frozen, canned in any form, dried, or 
concentrated juice, placed in the primary inventory reserve is at the 
option of the handler. The product(s) placed by the handler in the 
primary inventory reserve must have been produced in either the current 
or the preceding two crop years. Except as may be limited by Sec. 
930.50(i) or as may be permitted pursuant to Sec. Sec. 930.59 and 
930.62, such inventory reserve portion shall be equal to the sum of the 
products obtained by multiplying the weight or volume of the cherries in 
each lot of cherries acquired during the fiscal period by the then 
effective restricted percentage fixed by the Secretary; Provided, That 
in converting cherries in each lot to the form chosen by the handler, 
the inventory reserve obligations shall be adjusted in accordance with 
uniform rules adopted by the Board in terms of raw fruit equivalent.
    (c) Inventory reserve cherries shall meet such standards of grade, 
quality, or condition as the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, 
may establish. All such cherries shall be inspected by USDA. A 
certificate of such inspection shall be issued which shall show, among 
other things, the name and address of the handler, the number and type 
of containers in the lot, the grade of the product, the location where 
the lot is stored, identification marks (can codes or lot stamp), and a 
certification that the cherries meet the prescribed standards. Promptly 
after inspection and certification, each such handler shall submit, or 
cause to be submitted, to the Board, at the place designated by the 
Board, a copy of the certificate of inspection issued with respect to 
such cherries.
    (d) Handlers shall be compensated for inspection costs incurred on 
cherries placed in the primary inventory reserve. All reporting of 
cherries placed in, rotated in and out, or released from an inventory 
reserve shall be in accordance with rules and procedures established by 
the Board, with the approval of the Secretary. The Board could, with the 
approval of the Secretary, also

[[Page 269]]

limit the number of inspections of reserve cherries being rotated into 
inventory reserves for which the Board would be financially liable.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 930.54, handlers may not sell 
inventory reserve cherries prior to their official release by the Board. 
Handlers may rotate cherries in their inventory reserves with prior 
notification to the Board. All cherries rotated into the inventory 
reserve must meet the applicable inspection requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 930.56  Off-premise inventory reserve.

    Any handler may, upon notification to the Board, arrange to hold 
inventory reserve, of his or her own production or which was purchased, 
on the premises of another handler or in an approved commercial storage 
facility in the same manner as though the inventory reserve were on the 
handler's own premises.


<R05>
Sec. 930.57  Secondary inventory reserve.

    (a) In the event the inventory reserve established under Sec. 
930.55 of this part is at its maximum volume, and the Board has 
announced, in accordance with Sec. 930.50, that volume regulation will 
be necessary to maintain an orderly supply of quality cherries for the 
market, handlers in a regulated district may elect to place in a 
secondary inventory reserve all or a portion of the cherries the volume 
regulation would otherwise require them to divert in accordance with 
Sec. 930.59.
    (b) Should any handler in a regulated district exercise his or her 
right to establish a secondary inventory reserve under paragraph (a) of 
this section, all costs of maintaining that reserve, as well as 
inspection costs, will be the responsibility of the individual handler.
    (c) The secondary inventory reserve shall be established in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 930.55 (b) and (c) and such other rules and 
regulations which the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may 
establish.
    (d) The Board shall retain control over the release of any cherries 
from the secondary inventory reserve. No cherries may be released from 
the secondary reserve until all cherries in any primary inventory 
reserve established under Sec. 930.55 have been released. Any release 
of the secondary inventory reserve shall be in accordance with the 
annual marketing policy and with Sec. 930.54.


<R05>
Sec. 930.58  Grower diversion privilege.

    (a) In general. Any grower may voluntarily elect to divert, in 
accordance with the provisions of this section, all or a portion of the 
cherries which otherwise, upon delivery to a handler, would become 
restricted percentage cherries. Upon such diversion and compliance with 
the provisions of this section, the Board shall issue to the diverting 
grower a grower diversion certificate which such grower may deliver to a 
handler, as though there were actual harvested cherries. Any grower 
diversions completed in accordance with this section, but which are 
undertaken in districts subsequently exempted by the Board from volume 
regulation under Sec. 930.52(d), shall qualify for diversion credit.
    (b) Eligible diversion. Grower diversion certificates shall be 
issued to growers only if the cherries are diverted in accordance with 
the following terms and conditions or such other terms and conditions 
that the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. 
Diversion may take such of the following forms which the Board, with the 
approval of the Secretary, may designate: uses exempt under Sec. 
930.62; nonhuman food uses; or other uses, including diversion by 
leaving such cherries unharvested.
    (c) Application/mapping. The Board, with the approval of the 
Secretary, shall develop rules and regulations providing for the 
diversion of cherries by growers. Such regulations may include, among 
other things:
    (1) The form and content of applications and agreements relating to 
the diversion, including provisions for supervision and compensation; 
and
    (2) Provisions for mapping areas in which cherries will be left 
unharvested.
    (d) Diversion certificate. If the Board approves the application it 
shall so notify the applicant and conduct such supervision of the 
applicant's diversion of cherries as may be necessary to assure that the 
cherries have been diverted.

[[Page 270]]

After the diversion has been accomplished, the Board shall issue to the 
diverting grower a diversion certificate stating the weight of cherries 
diverted. Where diversion is carried out by leaving the cherries 
unharvested, the Board shall estimate the weight of cherries diverted on 
the basis of such uniform rule prescribed in rules and regulations as 
the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may recommend to 
implement this section.

<R05>
Sec. 930.59  Handler diversion privilege.

    (a) In general. Handlers handling cherries harvested in a regulated 
district may fulfill any restricted percentage requirement in full or in 
part by acquiring diversion certificates or by voluntarily diverting 
cherries or cherry products in a program approved by the Board, rather 
than placing cherries in an inventory reserve. Upon voluntary diversion 
and compliance with the provisions of this section, the Board shall 
issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion certificate which 
shall satisfy any restricted percentage or diversion requirement to the 
extent of the Board or Department inspected weight of the cherries 
diverted.
    (b) Eligible diversion. Handler diversion certificates shall be 
issued to handlers only if the cherries are diverted in accordance with 
the following terms and conditions or such other terms and conditions 
that the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. Such 
diversion may take place in any form which the Board, with the approval 
of the Secretary, may designate. Tart cherry juice and juice concentrate 
may receive diversion credit but only if diverted in forms approved 
under the terms of this section. Such forms may include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Contribution to a Board-approved food bank or other approved 
charitable organization;
    (2) Use for new product and new market development;
    (3) Export to designated destinations; or
    (4) Other uses or disposition, including destruction of the cherries 
at the handler's facilities.
    (c) Notification. The handler electing to divert cherries through 
means authorized under this section shall first notify the Board of such 
election. Such notification shall describe in detail the manner in which 
the handler proposes to divert cherries including, if the diversion is 
to be by means of destruction of the cherries, a detailed description of 
the means of destruction and ultimate disposition of the cherries. It 
shall also contain an agreement that the proposed diversion is to be 
carried out under the supervision of the Board and that the cost of such 
supervision is to be paid by the handler. Uniform fees for such 
supervision may be established by the Board, pursuant to rules and 
regulations approved by the Secretary.
    (d) Diversion certificate. The Board shall conduct such supervision 
of the handler's diversion of cherries under paragraph (c) of this 
section as may be necessary to assure that the cherries are diverted as 
authorized. After the diversion has been completed, the Board shall 
issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion certificate 
indicating the weight of cherries which may be used to offset any 
restricted percentage requirement.
    (e) Transfer of certificates. Within such restrictions as may be 
prescribed in rules and regulations, including but not limited to 
procedures for transfer of diversion credit and limitations on the type 
of certification eligible for transfer, a handler who acquires diversion 
certificates representing diverted cherries during any crop year may 
transfer such certificates to another handler or handlers. The Board 
must be notified in writing whenever such transfers take place during a 
crop year.
    (f) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish 
rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 930.60  Equity holders.

    (a) Inventory reserve ownership. The inventory reserve shall be the 
sole responsibility of the handlers who place products into the 
inventory reserve. A handler's equity in the primary inventory reserve 
may be transferred to another person upon notification to the Board.

[[Page 271]]

    (b) Agreements with growers. Individual handlers are encouraged to 
have written agreements with growers who deliver their cherries to the 
handler as to how any restricted percentage cherries delivered to the 
handler will be handled and what share, if any, the grower will have in 
the eventual sale of any inventory reserve cherries.
    (c) Rulemaking authority. The Board, with the approval of the 
Secretary, may adopt rules and regulations necessary and incidental to 
the administration of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 930.61  Handler compensation.

    Each handler handling cherries from a regulated district that is 
subject to volume regulations shall be compensated by the Board for 
inspection relating to the primary inventory reserve as the Board may 
deem to be appropriate. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, 
may establish such rules and regulations as are necessary and incidental 
to the administration of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 930.62  Exempt uses.

    (a) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may exempt from 
the provisions of Sec. 930.41, Sec. 930.44, Sec. 940.51, Sec. 
930.53, or Sec. 930.55 through Sec. 930.57 cherries for designated 
uses. Such uses may include, but are not limited to:
    (1) New product and new market development;
    (2) Export to designated destinations;
    (3) Experimental purposes; or
    (4) For any other use designated by the Board, including cherries 
processed into products for markets for which less than 5 percent of the 
preceding 5-year average production of cherries were utilized.
    (b) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, shall prescribe 
such rules, regulations, and safeguards as it may deem necessary to 
ensure that cherries handled under the provisions of this section are 
handled only as authorized.
    (c) Diversion certificates shall not be issued for cherries which 
are used for exempt purposes; Provided, that growers engaging in such 
activities under the authority of Sec. 930.58 shall be issued diversion 
certificates for such activities.

<R05>
Sec. 930.63  Deferment of restricted obligation.

    (a) Bonding. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may 
require handlers to secure bonds on deferred inventory reserve tonnage. 
Handlers may, in order to comply with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
930.50 and 930.51 and regulations issued thereunder, secure bonds on 
restricted percentage cherries to temporarily defer the date that 
inventory reserve cherries must be held to any date requested by the 
handler. This date shall be not later than 60 days prior to the end of 
that crop year. Such deferment shall be conditioned upon the voluntary 
execution and delivery by the handler to the Board of a written 
undertaking within thirty (30) days after the Secretary announces the 
final restricted percentage under Sec. 930.51. Such written undertaking 
shall be secured by a bond or bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable 
to the Board that on or prior to the acceptable deferred date the 
handler will have fully satisfied the restricted percentage amount 
required by Sec. 930.51.
    (b) Rulemaking authority. The Board, with the approval of the 
Secretary, may adopt rules and regulations necessary and incidental to 
the administration of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 930.70  Reports.

    (a) Weekly production, monthly sales, and inventory data. Each 
handler shall, upon request of the Board, file promptly with the Board, 
reports showing weekly production data; monthly sales and inventory 
data; and such other information, including the volume of any cherries 
placed in or released from a primary or secondary inventory reserve or 
diverted, as the Board shall specify with respect to any cherries 
handled by the handler. Such information may be provided to the Board 
members in summary or aggregated form only without any reference to the 
individual sources of the information.
    (b) Other reports. Upon the request of the Board, with the approval 
of the

<R05>
Sec. 930.91  Amendments.

    Amendments to this subpart may be proposed, from time to time, by 
the Board or by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 930.100  Grower diversion certificates.

    (a) In accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the Board may, 
for the 1997 crop year, issue diversion certificates to growers, in 
districts subject to volume regulation (Northwest Michigan, Central 
Michigan, New York, and Utah) who have voluntarily elected to divert in 
the orchard all or a portion of their 1997 tart cherry production which 
otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted percentage 
cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to handlers in 
lieu of delivering cherries.
    (b) Terms and conditions. To be eligible to receive diversion 
credit, growers voluntarily choosing to divert cherries must meet the 
following terms and conditions:
    (1) In order to receive a certificate, a grower must demonstrate, to 
the satisfaction of the Board, that rows or trees which were selected 
for diversion were not harvested. Trees six years old or younger do not 
qualify for diversion.
    (2) The grower must furnish the Board with a total harvested 
production amount so the Board can calculate the amount of grower 
diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificate. The Board 
will confirm the grower's production amount with information provided by 
handlers (to which the grower delivers cherries) on Board Form Number 
Two.
    (3) The grower must agree to allow a Board compliance officer to 
visit the grower's orchard to confirm that diversion has actually taken 
place.
    (c) Calculation of diversion amounts. The weight of cherries 
diverted and left unharvested shall be calculated by the Board after 
growers furnish the Board with the necessary information concerning 
their production. After verification of the volume of cherries diverted, 
the Board shall calculate the amounts of grower diversion tonnage to be 
placed on the diversion certificates and issue such certificates to 
growers. Such amounts shall be determined as follows:
    (1) For whole block diversion, the weight of a harvested sample of 5 
percent of each diverted block, provided by the grower, will be used to 
calculate the total volume of diverted cherries to be credited on the 
diversion certificate. For example, a grower farms 1,000 acres and 
elects to whole block divert a 200 acre block. If 5 percent of the 
harvested trees in the block diverted yield 80,000 pounds of cherries, 
the grower would receive a diversion certificate for 1,600,000 pounds 
(80,000 pounds divided by 5 percent (.05) yields 1,600,000 pounds). The 
rest of the block would remain unharvested.
    (2) For random row diversion, such estimated volume would be 
calculated by applying the percentage of the grower's production 
diverted to the actual average volume per acre of cherries produced and 
harvested. For example, a grower farms 1,000 acres and elects to divert 
20 percent of the harvestable acreage (200 acres). The grower harvests 
the remaining 800 acres and obtains 6,400,000 pounds of cherries, which 
represents a yield per acre of 8,000 pounds. Such grower would receive a 
diversion certificate for 1,600,000 pounds of cherries (8,000 lbs 
multiplied by the 20 percent of the total acreage diverted; in this 
instance, 200 acres).

    When the production level from a district falls below the thresholds 
stated in Sec. 930.20(b)(5), members of the specific district will make 
a recommendation to the Board as to who should be removed from the Board 
and the Board shall submit a recommendation to the Secretary for 
approval. If the recommendation is not made by the Board within a 
reasonable time, the Secretary may select the member and alternate to be 
removed.

charge on any handler whose assessment payment has not been received by 
October 1 of each crop year. The interest rate shall be a rate of one 
percent per month and shall be applied to the unpaid assessment balance 
not paid by the October 1 due date. In addition to the interest charge, 
the Board shall impose a late payment charge on any handler whose 
assessment payment has not been received within 90 days from the due 
date of October 1. The late payment charge shall be 10 percent of the 
unpaid balance.

<R05>
Sec. 930.158  Grower diversion and grower diversion certificates.

    (a) Grower diversion certificates. The Board may issue diversion 
certificates to growers in districts subject to volume regulation who 
have voluntarily elected to divert in the orchard all or a portion of 
their tart cherry production which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, 
would become restricted percentage cherries. Growers may offer the 
diversion certificate to handlers in lieu of delivering cherries. 
Handlers may redeem diversion certificates with the Board through 
November 1 of each crop year. After November 1 of the crop year that 
crop year's grower diversion certificates are no longer valid. Cherries 
that have reached a harvestable, marketable condition will be eligible 
for diversion. Diversion will not be granted to growers whose fruit was 
destroyed before it set and/or matured on the tree, or whose fruit is 
unmarketable. If marketable fruit were to be damaged or destroyed by 
acts of nature such as storms or hail diversion credit could be granted.
    (b) Application and mapping for diversion. Any grower desiring to 
divert cherries using methods other than in-orchard tank shall submit a 
map of the orchard or orchards to be diverted, along with a completed 
Grower Diversion Application, to the Board by April 15 of each crop 
year. The application includes a statement which must be signed by the 
grower which states that the grower agrees to comply with the 
regulations established for a tart cherry diversion program. Each map 
shall contain the grower's name and number assigned by the Board, the 
grower's address, block name or number when appropriate, location of 
orchard or orchards and other information which may be necessary to 
accomplish the desired diversion. On or before July 1, the grower should 
inform the Board of such grower's intention to divert in-orchard and 
what type of diversion will be used. The four types of diversion are 
random row diversion, whole block diversion, partial block diversion and 
in-orchard tank diversion. A grower who informs

[[Page 276]]

the Board about the type of diversion he or she wishes to use by July 1 
can elect to use any diversion method or combination of diversion 
methods. Only random row or in-orchard tank diversion methods may be 
used if the Board is not so informed by July 1. Trees that are four 
years or younger do not qualify for diversion. Annual resubmissions of 
either the map or application will no longer be required. Growers will 
only submit a new application and map if they are participating in the 
grower diversion program for the first time. Growers will need only to 
submit a new orchard map if he/she adds a new block of trees to the 
orchard or changes the orchard layout differently from the map 
previously submitted to the Board.
    (1) Random row diversion. Using the orchard map furnished by the 
grower, the Board will randomly select rows of trees within the orchard 
to be diverted. The amount of cherries to be diverted will be based on 
the preliminary restricted percentage amount established pursuant to 
Sec. 930.50. A grower may elect a different percentage amount; however, 
the grower needs to inform the Board as soon as possible after the 
preliminary percentages are announced of this other amount, but in no 
event shall this be less than seven days in advance of harvest. The 
designated rows indicated by the map must not be harvested. After 
completing harvest of the remaining rows in the orchard, the grower must 
notify the Board and/or the Board's compliance officer. A compliance 
officer will then be allowed to observe the grower's orchard to assure 
that the selected rows have not been harvested. The grower must inform 
the Board of the total production of the orchard to calculate the 
tonnage that was diverted.
    (2) Whole block diversion. Based on maps supplied by the grower, a 
sampling procedure will be used to determine the amount of cherries in 
the orchard to be diverted. A block is defined as rows that run in the 
same direction, are similar in age, and have definable boundaries. The 
Board will require a number of tree sites to be sampled depending on the 
size of the block. A tree site is a planted tree or an area where a tree 
was planted and may have been uprooted or died. If a block has 5 rows or 
less, or 200 or less tree sites, 3 rows would be randomly chosen to be 
sampled, if a block has 6 to 15 rows, or 201-400 tree sites, 4 rows 
would be randomly chosen to be sampled, and if a block has 16 or more 
rows and greater than 400 tree sites, 5 rows would be randomly chosen to 
be sampled. The Board's compliance officer will apply the sampling 
procedure (based on the number of rows or the number of tree sites) 
which results in the fewest number of tree sites required to be sampled. 
From each of the rows to be sampled, ten contiguous tree sites will be 
sampled. Only trees more than five years old will be harvested for the 
sample. For example, if it is determined that five rows are to be 
sampled, 10 contiguous tree sites in each of the five rows will be 
subject to harvest. Trees within the 10 sites which are more than five 
years old will be harvested. The harvested tonnage will be converted to 
a volume that represents the entire block of cherries. If, for example, 
a total of 4,600 pounds is harvested from the sample tree sites and this 
total is divided by 50 tree sites a yield of 92 pounds per tree site is 
obtained. To find the total yield for the block, the 92 pounds per tree 
site yield is multiplied by the 880 tree sites that were mapped in the 
block and that equals 80,960 pounds for that block. The compliance 
officer would be allowed access to the block to oversee the sampling 
process and to confirm that the block has been diverted.
    (3) Partial block diversion. Partial block diversion will also be 
accomplished using maps supplied by the grower. Sampling will be done as 
in whole block diversion except that only partial blocks would be 
selected and sampled. Growers may divert up to five partial blocks, or 
50 percent of a grower's total number of blocks per year. Such block(s) 
must be mapped and will be sampled as described under whole block 
diversion. Rows used in partial block diversion must be contiguous.
    (4) In-orchard tank diversion. Growers wishing to in-orchard tank 
divert must pick the cherries to be diverted and place them in 
harvesting tanks. A compliance officer would then probe the

[[Page 277]]

tanks for volume measurement and observe the destruction of the cherries 
on the grower's premises. Growers wishing to take advantage of this 
option must have at least 10 tanks ready for diversion. The compliance 
officer has up to five days to come to the grower's premises to observe 
the diversion after being contacted.
    (c) Compliance. Growers who voluntarily participate in the grower 
diversion program must sign and file with the Board a Grower Diversion 
Application. By signing the application, a grower agrees to the terms 
and conditions of the grower diversion program as contained in these 
regulations. To be eligible to receive diversion credit, growers 
voluntarily choosing to divert cherries must meet the following terms 
and conditions:
    (1) In order to receive a certificate, a grower must demonstrate, to 
the satisfaction of the Board, that rows or trees which were selected 
for diversion were not harvested. Trees four years old or younger do not 
qualify for diversion.
    (2) The grower must furnish the Board with a total harvested 
production amount so the Board can calculate the amount of grower 
diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificate. The Board 
will confirm the grower's production amount with information provided by 
handlers (to which the grower delivers cherries) on Board form Number 
Two.
    (3) The grower must agree to allow a Board compliance officer to 
visit the grower's orchard to confirm that diversion has actually taken 
place. If the terms and conditions for whole block, partial block or in-
orchard tank diversion are not completed, the Board shall not issue the 
grower a diversion certificate. If a grower who chooses random row 
diversion harvests rows that were designated not to be harvested, the 
grower should inform the Board immediately of the error. The grower will 
then be required to divert twice the amount (rows or trees) incorrectly 
harvested to correct the mistake. The grower will still receive a 
diversion certificate equal to the original requested amount. However, 
in instances where a grower is at the end of harvesting the orchard and 
fails to divert a complete block or specified rows, the Board shall 
multiply by two the difference between the original diversion amount and 
the actual diverted amount. The Board shall subtract that amount from 
the diversion application amount. Thus, the grower would receive a 
grower diversion certificate equal to a portion of the originally 
requested amount. If the grower does not inform the Board of such 
errors, the grower will not receive a diversion certificate.

<R05>
Sec. 930.159  Handler diversion.

    (a) Methods of diversion. Handlers may divert cherries by redeeming 
grower diversion certificates, by destroying cherries at handlers' 
facilities (at-plant), by diverting cherry products accidentally or 
voluntarily destroyed, by donating cherries or cherry products to 
charitable organizations or by using cherries or cherry products for 
exempt purposes under Sec. 930.162, including export to countries other 
than Canada, and Mexico. Once diversion has taken place, handlers will 
receive diversion certificates stating the weight of cherries diverted. 
Diversion credit may be used to fulfill any restricted percentage 
requirement in full or in part. Any information of a confidential and/or 
proprietary nature included in this application would be held in 
confidence pursuant to Sec. 930.73 of the order.
    (b) Board notification and handler plan. Any handler intending to 
divert cherries or cherry products pursuant to Sec. 930.59 of the order 
(except through exempt uses under Sec. 930.62 of the order) must notify 
the Board of such intent and provide a plan by November 1 which shows 
how the handler intends to meet the restricted percentage obligation, 
except that, for the 1997-98 season only, the deadline is February 5, 
1998. The Board may extend this date in individual cases pursuant to a 
written request showing good cause why the plan cannot be provided by 
the due date. A handler will have one year to fulfill such plan. The 
details of the plan shall include, but not be limited to, the name and 
address of the handler, the

[[Page 278]]

total product processed at-plant, product diverted at-plant, in-orchard 
diversion certificates redeemed, anticipated donations to charitable 
outlets, disposition to exempt outlets or uses and detailed plans for 
how and where such disposition will be made, and inventory reserve 
amount. It shall also contain an agreement that the proposed diversion 
is to be carried out under the supervision of the Board and that the 
cost of such supervision is to be paid by the handler. Supervision of 
diversion by means other than destruction of the cherries at a handler's 
facility will be subject to supervision as found necessary by the Board. 
USDA inspectors or Board employees will supervise diversion of cherry 
products at the current hourly rate under USDA's inspection fee schedule 
(7 CFR 52.42). Any cherries not diverted in accordance with the 
handler's plan will be placed into the secondary inventory reserve or 
the primary inventory reserve if a secondary inventory reserve has not 
been established.
    (c) At-plant diversion. Diversion by disposal at-plant may take 
place prior to placing the cherries into the processing line, or after 
processing, but before a finished product is manufactured. Such 
diversion will take place under the supervision of USDA Inspection 
Service or Board employee inspectors. USDA inspectors or Board employees 
or Board agents will supervise diversion of cherry products at-plant at 
the current hourly rate under USDA's inspection fee schedule (7 CFR 
52.42).
    (d) Diversion of finished products. Handlers may be granted 
diversion credit for finished tart cherry products that are accidentally 
destroyed or voluntarily destroyed by the handler. To receive diversion 
credit under this option the cherry products must be owned by the 
handler at the time of accidental or voluntary destruction, be a 
marketable product at the time of processing, be included in the 
handler's end of the year handler plan, and have been assigned a Raw 
Product Equivalent (RPE) by the handler to determine the volume of 
cherries. In addition, the accidental or voluntary destruction and 
disposition of the product must be verified by either a USDA inspector 
or Board agent or employee who witnesses the disposition of the 
accidentally or voluntarily destroyed product. Products will be 
considered as accidentally destroyed if they sustain damage which 
renders them unacceptable in normal market channels. Products which are 
voluntarily destroyed must have deteriorated in condition to such an 
extent that they are not acceptable for use in normal market channels.
    (e) Contributions to approved charitable organizations. When 
diverting by donating cherries or cherry products to charitable 
organizations, handlers should follow the requirements specified herein. 
For contributions to qualify for diversion credit, the contributed 
product should be marked clearly ``NOT FOR RESALE''. The receiving 
organization must be approved by the Board as a qualified recipient of 
contributions of tart cherry products. Such organizations must be tax-
exempt, must not sell the donated products and must be noncompetitive 
with other tart cherry industry sales outlets. Once products are donated 
to an organization, the Board must receive satisfactory documentation of 
the transaction. Handlers should provide the Board with information on 
how the product was used and the volume of product used.
    (f) Grower diversion certificates. To satisfy restricted percentage 
obligations by redeeming grower diversion certificates handlers must 
present to the Board grower diversion certificates obtained from growers 
who have diverted cherries by non-harvest, and who have been issued 
diversion certificates by the Board in accordance with the applicable 
rules and regulations governing the issuance of grower diversion 
certificates. For this crop year July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, 
grower diversion certificates will be valid until February 5, 1998.

either by a handler within the industry or by a food manufacturer. In 
addition, the maximum duration of any credit activity is three years 
from the first date of shipment.
    (2) New market development and market expansion. This includes the 
development of markets for tart cherry products which are not 
commercially established markets and which are not competitive with 
commercial outlets presently utilized by the tart cherry industry 
(including the development of new export markets): Provided, That these 
markets are a geographic area into which tart cherries or products 
derived from them have not been previously sold. The term ``market 
expansion'', includes activities that incrementally expand the sale of 
either tart cherries or the products in which tart cherries are an 
ingredient, such as, but not limited to: Expansions of the geographic 
areas into which tart cherries or tart cherry products are marketed; 
product line extensions; significant improvements to or revisions of 
existing products; packaging innovations; segmentation of markets along 
geographic, demographic, or other definable characteristics; and product 
repositionings.
    (3) Development of export markets. The sale of cherries or cherry 
products, including the development of sales for new or different tart 
cherry products or the expansion of sales for existing tart cherry 
products, to countries other than Canada, and Mexico.
    (4) Experimental purposes. The use of cherries or cherry products in 
preliminary and/or developmental activities intended to result in new 
products, new applications and/or new markets for tart cherry products. 
Any exemption for experimental work shall be limited in scope, duration 
and volume based on information supplied by the applicant at the time a 
request for exemption is made. In no case shall an individual exemption 
for experimental purposes last longer than five years or exceed 100,000 
pounds raw product equivalent of tart cherries.
    (c) Obtaining approval for exempt uses. In order to receive 
exemptions for cherries or cherry products utilized for exempt purposes, 
handlers must apply to the Board for a new exemption or for renewal of 
an existing exemption by November 1 for the next succeeding year, except 
for the 1997 year only, handlers may apply through February 5, 1998. A 
handler shall have one crop year to dispose of cherries or cherry 
products to exempt outlets approved by the Board, unless granted a 
renewal. Handlers applying to the Board for a new exemption or for 
renewal of an existing exemption are subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) When applying to the Board for an exemption for new product 
development, handlers must detail the nature of their new product, how 
it differs from current, existing products and the anticipated short and 
long term sales

[[Page 280]]

volume for the exemption. It will be the Board staff's responsibility to 
analyze and investigate any request and upon completion of that analysis 
authorize or deny the exemption.
    (2) When applying to the Board for an exemption for new market 
development, handlers must detail the nature of their new market, how it 
differs from current, existing markets and the anticipated short and 
long term sales volume for the exemption. It will be the Board staff's 
responsibility to analyze and investigate any request and upon 
completion of that analysis authorize or deny the exemption.
    (3) When applying to the Board for an exemption for the development 
of export markets for tart cherries or cherry products (including juice 
and juice concentrate) in countries other than Canada and Mexico, 
including the expansion of sales in existing export markets, handlers 
must detail the nature of their product, specify whether such product 
differs from current products being sold in export markets, and estimate 
the anticipated short and long term sales volumes for the requested 
exemption.
    (4) When applying to the Board for an exemption for experimental 
purposes, handlers must indicate the preliminary and/or developmental 
experimental activity. Such experimental purposes should be intended to 
result in new products, new applications and/or new markets for existing 
tart cherry products. Any exemption for experimental work shall be 
limited in scope, duration and volume which the proposing party shall 
specify at the time a request for exemption is made. In no case shall an 
exemption for experimental purposes last longer than five years or 
exceed 100,000 pounds raw product equivalent per handler of tart 
cherries during the duration of the experiment.
    (5) To be eligible for new product, new market development and 
market expansion diversion exemptions, a handler must demonstrate 
involvement in the activity for which the exemptions are sought. The 
requesting handler must either be or have been involved in development 
of the product, the market, or market expansion activities for which the 
exemptions are sought or have had financial involvement in the 
activities. This involvement must be demonstrated and established to the 
satisfaction of the Board by the handler requesting the exemptions.
    (d) Review of applications. A Board appointed subcommittee of three 
persons which shall include the manager (or a Board member acting in the 
Manager's stead), the public member and one industry person who is not 
on the Board, shall review applications for exemption or renewal of 
exemption and either approve or deny the exemption. Any denial of an 
application for exemption or renewal of an existing exemption shall be 
served on the applicant by certified mail and shall state the reasons 
for the denial. Within 10 days after the receipt of a denial, the 
applicant may file an appeal, in writing, with the Deputy Administrator, 
Fruit and Vegetable Programs, supported by any arguments and evidence 
the applicant may wish to offer as to why the application for exemption 
or renewal of exemption should have been approved. The Deputy 
Administrator upon consideration of such appeal will take such action as 
deemed appropriate with respect to the application for exemption or 
renewal of exemption.
    (e) Progress report. Each handler that is granted an exemption must 
submit to the Board an annual progress report, due May 1 of each crop 
year. The progress report shall include the results of the exemption 
activity (comparison of intended activity with actual activity) for the 
year in its entirety, the volume of exempted fruit, an analysis of the 
success of the exemption program, and such other information as the 
Board may request.
    (f) Diversion credit; failure to meet terms and conditions of 
exemption. Handler diversion certificates for exempt uses shall be 
issued to handlers provided that terms and conditions applicable to 
exempt uses are satisfied. Diversion certificates will not be issued to 
handlers for any volume of tart cherry products for which such terms and 
conditions are not satisfied and such cherries would be subject to all 
of the terms and conditions of Sec. Sec. 930.41, 930.44, 930.51, 
930.53, and Sec. Sec. 930.55 through 930.57.

termination of an

[[Page 281]]

exemption, any volume of tart cherry products that were granted an 
exemption but were not utilized for the authorized exempt purpose would 
be subject to all of the terms and conditions of Sec. Sec. 930.41, 
930.44, 930.51, 930.53, and Sec. Sec. 930.55 through 930.57.

<R05>
Sec. 930.163  Deferment of restricted obligation.

    A handler may obtain a surety bond on restricted percentage cherries 
to be posted to temporarily defer the date that inventory reserves must 
be held. The surety bond must be posted at two times the market value of 
the quantity of cherries for which the holding obligation is being 
deferred. The Board can temporarily defer the date inventory reserve 
cherries must be held to any date requested by the handler. However, 
this date shall not be later than 60 days prior to the end of the crop 
year. The deferment shall be conditioned on the execution and delivery 
by the handler to the Board of a written undertaking within 30 days 
after the Secretary announces the final restricted percentage under 
Sec. 930.51. The written undertaking (required to be secured by a bond 
or bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board) must 
guarantee that on or prior to the deferment date requested by the 
handler the handler will have fully satisfied the restricted percentage 
obligation. On or prior to the deferment date requested by the handler, 
the handler will have to fully satisfy the restricted percentage 
obligation. In the event, a handler has posted the surety bond, reached 
the deferment date deadline and does not have cherries in the inventory 
reserve to cover his/her inventory reserve obligation, the bond will be 
forfeited to the Board. The Board will then buy cherries to fulfill that 
handler's obligation.

                        Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 932.38  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its 
maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and 
perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The 
funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired in the manner prescribed 
in Sec. 932.39.


<R05>
Sec. 932.39  Assessments.

    (a) As each handler's pro rata share of the expenses which the 
Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the 
committee during a fiscal year, each handler who first handles olives 
during the current crop year shall pay to the committee, upon demand, 
assessments less any amounts which may be credited pursuant to Sec. 
932.45, on all olives to be used in the production of packaged olives, 
including olives to be used in canned ripe olives of the ``tree-
ripened'' type or green olives when such are regulated as packaged 
olives pursuant to Sec. 932.52. The payment of assessments for 
maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this 
part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether 
particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.
    (b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by 
each such handler during a fiscal year in an amount designed to secure 
sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such 
period. At any time during or after the fiscal year, the Secretary may 
increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to 
cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which 
may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all olives handled 
during the applicable crop year. In order to provide funds for the 
administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a 
fiscal year before sufficient operation income is available from 
assessments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in 
advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose.
    (c) Any assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time 
prescribed by the committee may be subject to an interest or late 
payment charge, or both. The period of time, rate of interest and late 
payment charge shall be as recommended by the committee and approved by 
the Secretary. Subsequent to such approval, all assessments not paid 
within the presecribed period of time shall be subject to an interest or 
late payment charge or both.

<R05>
Sec. 932.40  Accounting.

    (a) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the assessments collected are 
in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in 
accordance with one of the following:
    (1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the committee shall refund or credit 
to handler accounts the aforesaid excess. Each handler's share of such 
excess funds shall be the amount of assessments such handler has paid in 
excess of such handler's pro rata share of the actual net expenses of 
the committee for such fiscal year. Excess funds may be used temporarily 
by the committee to defray expenses of the subsequent fiscal year: 
Provided,

[[Page 289]]

That each handler's share of such excess shall be made available to the 
handler by the committee within five months after the end of the fiscal 
year.
    (2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry 
over such excess into subsequent fiscal years as a reserve: Provided, 
That funds already in the reserve do not exceed approximately one fiscal 
year's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used for any expenses 
authorized pursuant to Sec. 932.38 and for necessary expenses of 
liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such 
termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of 
liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may 
determine to be appropriate: Provided, That to the extent practicable, 
such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such 
funds were collected.
    (b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part 
and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The 
Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to 
account for all receipts and disbursements.
    (c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any 
member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and 
disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his possession to 
the committee, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments 
as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the committee full title 
to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant 
to this part.

<R05>
Sec. 932.45  Production research and marketing research and development 
projects.

    (a) The following activities of the committee are authorized under 
this section.
    (1) The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, establish 
or provide for the establishment of production research, and marketing 
research and development projects designed to assist, improve or promote 
the marketing, distribution, and consumption or efficient production of 
California olives. Such projects may provide for any marketing research 
and development projects designed to assist, improve, or promote the 
marketing, distribution, and consumption or efficient production of 
California olives. Such projects may provide for any form of marketing 
promotion including paid advertising. The expenses of such research and 
projects shall be paid from funds collected pursuant to Sec. 932.39 or 
from voluntary contributions. Voluntary contributions may be accepted by 
the committee only to pay the expenses of such projects: Provided, That 
the committee shall retain complete control over the use of such 
contributions which shall be free from any encumbrances.
    (2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may provide 
for crediting a portion of a handler's direct expenditures for paid 
brand advertising for olives. Such expenditures may include, but are not 
limited to, money spent for advertising space in magazines, newspapers, 
outdoor media and transit or time charges for radio and television. No 
handler shall receive credit in excess of such handler's pro rata share 
of the total monies allotted by the committee for brand advertising 
credit. Each advertisement must be published, broadcast or displayed 
during the fiscal year for which credit is requested. Before any 
creditable brand advertising may be undertaken pursuant to this 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary, upon recommendation by 
the committee, shall prescribe appropriate rules and regulations as are 
necessary to effectively regulate such activity.
    (b) In recommending marketing research and development projects 
pursuant to this section, the committee shall give consideration to the 
following factors:
    (1) The expected supply of olives in relation to market 
requirements;
    (2) The supply situation among competing areas and commodities; and

[[Page 290]]

    (3) The need for marketing research with respect to any marketing 
development activity and the need for a coordinated effort with USDA's 
Plentiful Food Program.
    (c) In recommending production research projects pursuant to this 
section, the committee shall give consideration to the extent and need 
for assistance to, and improvement of California olive production.
    (d) If the committee should conclude that a program of production 
research, marketing research, or development should be undertaken or 
continued pursuant to this section in any fiscal year, it shall submit 
the following for the approval of the Secretary:
    (1) Its recommendations as to funds to be obtained pursuant to Sec. 
932.39 or voluntary contributions;
    (2) Its recommendations as to any production research or marketing 
research project; and
    (3) Its recommendation as to promotion activity and paid 
advertising.
    (e) The committee shall, as soon as practicable, prepare and mail 
reports on current production research and marketing research and 
development projects to the Secretary and make a copy of such reports 
available at the committee office for examination by producers, 
handlers, or other interested parties.

Sec. 932.50  Report of marketing policy.

    At least 14 days prior to the start of each crop year (except that 
this period may be shortened by the committee not more than 5 days if 
warranted), the committee shall hold a meeting for the purpose of 
formulating a marketing policy for the coming crop year: Provided, That 
with respect to the 1982-83 crop year the committee shall hold a meeting 
for such purpose as soon as practicable. The committee shall prepare and 
submit to the Secretary promptly after each such meeting, a report 
setting forth its recommended marketing policy for the ensuing crop 
year. In the event it becomes advisable to modify such policy, because 
of changed supply, demand, or other conditions, the committee shall 
formulate a new policy and shall submit a report thereon to the 
Secretary. In developing the marketing policy, the committee shall give 
consideration to the handler carryover, production, probable quality and 
composition of olive sizes in the crop, trade demand, probable imports, 
whether producer prices are likely to exceed parity, the probable 
assessable tonnage and such other factors as may have a bearing on the 
marketing of olives or the administration of this part. Notice of the 
committee's marketing policy, and of any modifications thereof, shall be 
given promptly by reasonable publicity to producers and handlers.

inspection service, as other than canned ripe olives, an equal quantity 
of undersize olives, of any other variety, or by so disposing of an 
equal quantity of olives of that or any other variety of sizes larger 
than undersize of a quality better than culls, and (ii) meet any deficit 
in such handler's cull obligation in one variety by so disposing of an 
equal quantity of cull olives of any other variety, or by so disposing 
of an equal quantity of olives of any variety of sizes larger than 
undersize of a quality better than culls.
    (5) Each handler shall hold at all times a quantity of olives equal

Committee may determine.
    (a) Mail ballot voting. (1) The Committee shall schedule a meeting, 
prior to March 1 of each odd-numbered year, in each producing district 
for the purpose of selecting candidates for member and alternate member 
nominations. A notice of such meetings will be mailed to each producer 
of record in each district. The nomination process is as follows:
    (i) Any person who produces olives in a particular district may 
offer the name of any producer from that district as a candidate for 
either a member or alternate member position in said district.
    (ii) A producer, who produces olives in more than one district, can 
be selected as a candidate for a member or alternate member position in 
only one district.
    (iii) The Committee will notify by mail producers who are selected 
as candidates but are not in attendance at such meetings. Such producers 
have the right to decline such listing on the ballot within 7 days of 
mailing such notice.
    (iv) In the event a producer cannot attend a meeting but wishes to 
be included on the ballot, that producer may notify the Committee office 
in writing no later than 7 days after the date of the nomination meeting 
for the producer's district and request that the producer's name be 
included on the ballot.
    (v) In the event that no candidates or an insufficient number of 
candidates are selected at such meetings for the producer members and 
alternates in the respective districts, the Committee will give written 
notice to producers in said district that additional names may be 
submitted for the specified position(s).
    (2) Following such meetings, and no later than March 15 of each odd-
numbered year, the Committee shall prepare and mail a ballot to each 
producer that delivered olives during that crop year in each district.
    (i) A producer who produces olives in more than one district must 
choose the district in which the producer will vote and notify the 
Committee of that choice. If the Committee is not notified and more than 
one ballot is received from such a producer, the first ballot received 
will be counted. Candidates may only vote in the district in which they 
are seeking nomination.
    (ii) Each ballot will list separately the names of candidates for 
the member positions and the names of candidates for the alternate 
member positions for said district.
    (iii) A ballot will be mailed to producers of record to give them an 
opportunity to vote. Committee records will be used to determine the 
list of producers eligible to cast ballots. However, any producer who is 
not identified in such records may receive a ballot if the Committee 
determines that such producer is eligible to participate in nominations 
in that district.
    (iv) A producer may cast a vote for as many candidates as there are 
member or alternate positions in said district.
    (v) The candidate on each list, as prescribed in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section, who receives the most votes will be the 
nominee for the first position, and until all positions for that 
district are filled, the candidates receiving the second, third and 
fourth highest number of votes will be the nominees for the second, 
third and fourth position respectively.
    (vi) In the event of a tie which would result in elimination of a 
tied candidate, a second ballot with the names of those tied candidates 
will be mailed to producers in said district for another vote.
    (b) Nomination meetings. In lieu of the mail ballot nomination 
procedure specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Committee may 
schedule nomination meetings. In such an event, the following procedure 
will apply:
    (1) Prior to March 15 of each odd-numbered year, the Committee shall 
schedule a nomination meeting to be held in each district for the 
purpose of obtaining nominees for producer members and alternate members 
for such district.

[[Page 299]]

    (2) Nominations for members and balloting thereon shall precede 
nominations and balloting for alternate members.
    (3) The candidate for each position who receives the highest number 
of votes shall be the nominee for the position: Provided, That such 
candidate receives a majority of the ballots cast. If no candidate 
receives such a majority, the two candidates who received the highest 
number of votes shall participate in a run-off balloting to determine 
which is the nominee.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, a producer is a person engaged 
in a proprietary capacity as a single business unit in the production of 
olives for market as packaged olives and includes an individual (owner-
operated), partnership, corporation, association, institution, or other 
legal business unit.

(including duly authorized officers or employees of producers) who 
produced olives within the district shall participate in the nomination 
and election of producer members and alternates.
    (2) Each producer (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) 
shall be entitled to cast only one vote for each position.
    (3) A producer having olive acreage in more than one district may 
participate in nominations and elections in only one district. The 
district in which the producer wishes to participate shall be the 
producer's choice.
    (4) Any member of a producer's family (husband, wife, son or 
daughter) may vote on behalf of an owner-operated, landlord-tenant, 
family enterprise, or other farming unit.
    (5) Any authorized officer or employee of a corporation which is a 
producer may vote.
    (6) Any authorized member of a partnership which is a producer may 
vote.
    (7) Power of attorney (proxies) for voting purposes are not 
accepted.

[62 FR 1244, Jan. 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 932.151  Incoming regulations.

    (a) Inspection stations. Natural condition olives shall be sampled 
and size-graded only at inspection stations which shall be a plant of a 
handler or other place having facilities for sampling and size-grading 
such olives: Provided, That such location and facilities are 
satisfactory to the Inspection Service and the committee: Provided 
further, That upon prior application to, and approval by, the committee, 
a handler may have olives size-graded at an inspection station other 
than the one where the lot was sampled.
    (b) Lot identification. Immediately upon receipt of each lot of 
natural condition olives for which inspection is required, the handler 
shall complete Form COC 3A or 3C, weight and grade report or such other 
lot identification form as may be approved by the committee, which shall 
contain at least the following: (1) Lot number; (2) date; (3) variety; 
and (4) number and type containers. Pending completion of size-grading 
of such lot, or the sampling of such lot if it is to be size-graded by 
sample, the handler shall maintain identity of such lot of olives with 
its corresponding lot weight and grade report.
    (c) Weighing. Each lot of natural condition olives for which 
inspection is required shall be separately weighed to determine the net 
weight of olives. If the lot is to be size-graded by sample, the lot 
shall be weighed upon receipt by the hanlder. If the lot is to be size-
graded by lot, the net weight shall be determined after size-grading by 
weighing all of the component parts resulting from the size-grading 
operations (including culls), and totaling such weights.
    (d) Incoming inspection--(1) General. The handler is responsible for 
the proper performance of all actions connected with the identification 
of lots of olives, the weighing of boxes or bins, the taking of samples, 
the size-grading of samples, and the furnishing of necessary personnel 
for the carrying out of such

[[Page 302]]

actions. All such actions shall be performed under the supervision of 
the Inspection Service.
    (2) Certification. For each lot of olives that are size-graded, the 
handler shall complete Form COC-3A or 3C weight and grade report, which 
shall contain at least the following: (i) Name of handler; (ii) name of 
producer; (iii) county of production; (iv) applicable lot number; (v) 
weight certificate number; (vi) net weight; (vii) number and type of 
containers; (viii) date received; (ix) time received; (x) method of 
size-grade determination (sample or lot); (xi) weight of sample, if 
size-graded by sample; and (xii) the quantity of olives in each size 
designation. The completed Form COC-3A or 3C shall be furnished to the 
Inspection Service which shall certify thereon that the lot was size-
graded as required by Sec. 932.51 if in accordance with the facts.
    (e) Disposition of noncanning olives--(1) Notification and 
inspection of noncanning olives. Prior to disposition of noncanning 
olives the handler shall complete Form COC-5, report of limited and 
undersize and cull olives inspection and disposition, which shall 
contain the following: (i) Type and number of containers; (ii) type of 
olives (undersize or culls); (iii) net weight; (iv) variety; (v) outlet 
(green olives, olive oil, etc.); and (vi) consignee. Before disposition 
of such olives, the completed Form COC-5 shall be furnished to the 
Inspection Service which shall inspect the olives for conformance with 
the information contained thereon, and, if correct, so certify in the 
space provided thereon.
    (2) Control and surveillance. Noncanning olives that have been 
reported on Form COC-5 and inspected by the Inspection Service shall, 
unless such olives are disposed of immediately after being inspected 
under supervision of the inspector, be identified by fixing to each bin 
or pallet of boxes an COC control card which may be obtained from the 
committee. Such olives shall be kept separate and apart from other 
olives in the handler's possession and shall be disposed of only in the 
outlet shown on Form COC-5 and under the supervision of an inspector of 
the Inspection Service.
    (3) Time period for disposition. All required disposition of 
noncanning olives shall be completed not later than September 30 of the 
crop year following the one in which the obligation is incurred or such 
later date that a handler may specify in a notice filed with the 
committee at least 15 days prior to September 15 of such subsequent crop 
year: Provided, That such notice shows that such handler has a 
sufficient quantity of olives held in storage to meet his obligation and 
such later date is not later than the date when he will have completed 
his disposition of olives of the crop year of obligation.
    (4) Olives not subject to incoming inspection. Except as otherwise 
prescribed in Sec. 932.51(b), any lot of olives to be used solely in 
the production of green olives or canned ripe olives of the ``tree 
ripened'' type shall not be subject to incoming inspection: Provided, 
That the applicable requirements of Sec. 932.51(b) are met and the 
handler notifies the Inspection Service, in writing, that such lot is to 
be so used. Notice may be given by writing on the weight certificate 
``Lot to be used solely for use in the production of green olives or 
tree ripened olives'' and a copy of such weight certificate given to the 
Inspection Service.
    (f) Partially exempted lots. (1) Pursuant to Sec. 932.55, any 
handler may process any lot of natural condition olives for use in the 
production of packaged olives which has not first been weighed and size-
graded as an individual lot as required by Sec. 932.51(a) (i) and (ii), 
but was combined with any other lot or lots of natural condition olives, 
only if (i) all the olives in the combined lot are delivered to the 
handler in the same day, (ii) the total net weight of the olives 
delivered to the handler by any person in such day does not exceed 500 
pounds, (iii) each such person had authorized combination of his lot 
with other lots, and (iv) the combined lot of the natural condition 
olives is weighed and size-graded as required by Sec. 932.51(a) (i) and 
(ii) prior to processing the olives.
    (2) Whenever the natural condition olives in partially exempt 
individual lots are combined with other such olives as provided in 
paragraph (f)(1) of

[[Page 303]]

this section, the provision of the section applicable on individual lots 
shall apply instead to a combined lot.
    (3) Each such handler shall file with the committee a weekly report 
showing for each day of the week the respective quantity in combined 
lots together with each person's authorization for combining lots. The 
report shall be filed upon a form supplied by the committee.
    (g) Additional Marketing Order Size Designations. Pursuant to the 
authority in Sec. 932.51(a)(1)(ii), the following additional size 
designations are established:

    (a) Pursuant to section 8e of the act and Part 944-Fruits; Import 
Regulations, the importation into the United States of any avocados is 
prohibited on and after May 28, 1985, unless such avocados grade at

avocados that are imported into the United States. Inspection by the 
Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service with evidence thereof in the 
form of an official inspection certificate, issued by the respective 
service, applicable to the particular shipment of avocados, is required 
on all imports. The inspection and certification services will be 
available upon application in accordance with the rules and regulations 
governing inspection and certification of fresh fruits, vegetables, and 
other products (7 CFR part 51) and in accordance with the regulations 
designating inspection services and procedure for obtaining inspection 
and certification (7 CFR 944.400).
    (c) The term importation means release from custody of the United 
States Customs Service. The term commercial

processing into products means the manufacture of avocado product which 
is preserved by any recognized commercial process, including canning, 
freezing, dehydrating, drying, the addition of chemical substances, or 
by fermentation.
    (d) Any person may import up to 55 pounds of avocados exempt from 
the requirements specified in this section.
    (e) Any lot or portion thereof which fails to meet the import 
requirements, and is not being imported for purposes of consumption by 
charitable institutions, distribution by relief agencies, seed, or 
commercial processing into products; prior to or after reconditioning 
may be exported or disposed of under the supervision of the Federal or 
Federal-State Inspection Service with the costs of certifying the 
disposal of such lot borne by the importer.
    (f) The grade, size, and quality requirements of this section shall 
not be applicable to avocados imported for consumption by charitable 
institutions, distribution by relief agencies, seed, or commercial 
processing into products, but shall be subject to the safeguard 
provisions contained in Sec. 944.350.

    (a) Pursuant to section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement 
Act of 1937, as amended, the importation into the United States of any 
kiwifruit is prohibited unless such kiwifruit meets all the requirements 
of the U.S. No. 1 grade as defined in the United States Standards for 
Grades of Kiwifruit (7 CFR 51.2335 through 51.2340), except that the 
kiwifruit shall be ``not badly misshapen,'' and an additional tolerance 
of 7 percent is provided for kiwifruit that is ``badly misshapen,'' and 
except that such kiwifruit shall have a minimum of 6.2 percent soluble 
solids. Such fruit shall be at least Size 45, which means there shall be 
a maximum of 55 pieces of fruit and the average weight of all samples in 
a specific lot must weigh at least 8 pounds (3.632 kilograms), provided 
that no individual sample may be less than 7 pounds 12 ounces (3.472 
kilograms).
    (b) The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service, Fruit and 
Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, United States 
Department of Agriculture, is designated as the governmental inspection

the United States. Inspection by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection 
Service with evidence thereof in the form of an official inspection 
certificate, issued by the respective service, applicable to a 
particular shipment of kiwifruit, is required on all imports. The 
inspection and certification services will be available upon application 
in accordance with the rules and regulations governing the inspection 
and certification of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other

[[Page 323]]

products (7 CFR part 51) and in accordance with the procedure for 
requesting inspection and designating the agencies to perform required 
inspection and certification (7 CFR 944.400).
    (c) The term importation means release from custody of the United 
States Customs Service. The term commercial processing into products 
means that the kiwifruit is physically altered in form or chemical 
composition through freezing, canning, dehydrating, pulping, juicing, or 
heating of the product. The act of slicing, dicing, or peeling shall not 
be considered commercial processing into products.
    (d) Any lot or portion thereof which fails to meet the import 
requirements and is not being imported for purposes of consumption by 
charitable institutions, distribution by relief agencies, or commercial 
processing into products may be reconditioned or exported. Any failed 
lot which is not reconditioned or exported shall be disposed of under 
supervision of the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service with the 
costs of certifying the disposal of said lot borne by the importer.
    (e) Any person may import up to 200 pounds of kiwifruit in any one 
shipment exempt from the requirements of this section.
    (f) The grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements of this 
section shall not be applicable to kiwifruit imported for consumption by

processing into products, but shall be subject to the safeguard 
provisions contained in Sec. 944.350.

51.1538): A total of not more than 15 percent for defects, including 
therein not more than the following percentage for the defect listed:

of any variety other than the Stanley or Merton varieties, is exempt 
from the requirements specified in this section.

will be available in accordance with the regulation designating 
inspection services and procedure for obtaining inspection and 
certification (7 CFR 944.400).
    (h) Any lot or portion thereof which fails to meet the import 
requirements, and is not being imported for purposes of consumption by 
charitable institutions, distribution by relief agencies, or commercial 
processing into products, prior to or after reconditioning may be 
exported or disposed of under the supervision of the Federal or Federal-
State Inspection Service with the costs of certifying the disposal of 
such fresh prunes borne by the importer.
    (i) It is determined that fresh prunes imported into the United 
States shall meet the same minimum grade, size and quality requirements 
as those established for fresh prunes under Marketing Order No. 924 (7 
CFR part 924).

                    Budget, Expenses and Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 945.40  Expenses.

    The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary 
may find are reasonable and likely to be incurred during each fiscal 
period for its maintenance and functioning, and for such purposes as the 
Secretary, pursuant to this subpart, determines to be appropriate. 
Handlers shall share such expenses upon the basis of a fiscal period. 
Each handler's share of such expense shall be proportionate to the ratio 
between the total quantity of potatoes handled by him as the first 
handler thereof during a fiscal period and the total quantity of 
potatoes handled by all handlers as first handlers thereof during the 
same period.


<R05>
Sec. 945.41  Budget.

    At the beginning of each fiscal period, and as may be necessary 
thereafter, the committee shall prepare an estimated budget of income 
and expenditures necessary for the administration of this part. The 
committee may recommend a rate of assessment calculated to provide 
adequate funds to defray its proposed expenses as authorized in Sec. 
945.40. The committee shall present such budget promptly to the 
Secretary with an accompanying report showing the basis for its 
calculations.


<R05>
Sec. 945.42  Assessments.

    (a) The funds to cover the committee's expenses pursuant to Sec. 
945.40 shall be acquired by the levying of assessments upon handlers as 
provided in this subpart. Each handler who ships potatoes as the first 
handler thereof shall pay assessments to the committee upon demand, 
which assessments shall be in payment of such handler's pro rata share 
of such expenses.
    (b) Assessments shall be levied upon handlers at a rate per 
hundredweight of potatoes or equivalent established by the Secretary. 
Such rate may be established upon the basis of the committee's budget 
recommendations, and other available information.
    (c) At any time during or subsequent to a given fiscal period, the 
committee may recommend the approval of an amended budget and an 
increase in the rate of assessment. Upon the basis of such 
recommendation, or other available information, the Secretary may 
approve an amended budget and increase the rate of assessment. Such 
increase shall be applicable to all potatoes assessable under this part 
and handled by the first handler thereof during such fiscal period.
    (d) The committee may impose a late payment charge or an interest 
charge, or both, on any handler who fails to pay, on or before the due 
date established by the Secretary, the total assessment for which such 
handler is liable. Such due date and the late payment fee and interest 
rate shall be recommended by the committee and approved by the 
Secretary.
    (e) In order to provide funds to carry out its function, after the 
effective date of this subpart the committee may accept advance 
assessments from handlers. Advance assessments received from a handler 
shall be credited toward assessments levied against that handler during 
that fiscal period. In the case of an extreme emergency, the committee 
may also borrow money on a short term basis to provide funds for the 
administration of this part. Any

[[Page 331]]

such borrowed money shall only be used to meet the committee's current 
financial obligations, and the committee shall repay all borrowed money 
by the end of the next fiscal period from assessment income.

<R05>
Sec. 945.43  Accounting.

    (a) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions 
of this part shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this 
part.
    (b) The Secretary may at any time require the committee, its members 
and alternates, employees, agents, and all other persons to account for 
all receipts and disbursements, funds, property, and records for which 
they are responsible. Whenever any person ceases to be a member or 
alternate of the committee, he shall account for all receipts, 
disbursements, funds, and property (including but not limited to books 
and other records) pertaining to the committee's activities for which he 
is responsible, and deliver all such property and funds in his hands to 
such successor, agency, or person as may be designated by the Secretary, 
and shall execute such assignments and other instruments as may be 
necessary or appropriate to vest in such successor, agency, or 
designated person, the right to all of such property and funds and all 
claims vested in such person.
    (c) The committee may make recommendations to the Secretary for one 
or more of the members thereof, or any other person or persons to act as 
trustee or trustees for holding records, funds, or any other committee 
property during periods of suspension of this part, or during any period 
or periods when regulations are not in effect and, if the Secretary 
determines such action appropriate, he may direct that such person or 
persons shall act as trustee or trustees for the committee.


<R05>
Sec. 945.44  Excess funds.

    (a) The funds remaining at the end of a fiscal period which are in 
excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations during such 
period may be carried over, with the approval of the Secretary, into 
following periods as a reserve. Such reserve shall be established at an 
amount not to exceed approximately one fiscal period's budgeted 
expenses. Funds in such reserve shall be available for use by the 
committee for expenses authorized under Sec. 945.40.
    (b) Funds in excess of those placed in the operating reserve shall 
be credited proportionately against a handler's operations of the 
following fiscal period, except that if the handler demands payment, 
such proportionate refund shall be paid to such handler.
    (c) Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray 
the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such 
manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate. To the extent 
practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from 
whom such funds were collected.

forth in this section. The committee shall promptly submit a report 
thereon to the Secretary and notify producers and handlers of the 
contents of such report on the new or revised marketing policy.

effectuate the declared policy of the act.


<R05>
Sec. 945.52  Issuance of regulations.

    (a) The Secretary shall limit the handling of potatoes whenever he 
finds from the recommendations and information submitted by the 
committee, or from other available information, that such regulation

may:
    (1) Regulate in any or all portions of the production area, the 
handling of particular grades, sizes, qualities, or maturities, or any 
combination thereof, of any or all varieties of potatoes during any 
period; or
    (2) Regulate the shipment of particular grades, sizes, qualities, or 
maturities of potatoes differently, for different varieties, for 
different portions of the production area, for different packs, for 
different containers, or for any combination of the foregoing, during 
any period; or
    (3) Fix the size, capacity, weight, dimensions, pack, labeling or 
marking of the container, or containers, which may be used in the 
packaging or handling of potatoes, or both; or

<R05>
Sec. 945.55  Notification of regulation.

                        Certificates of Privilege


<R05>
Sec. 945.120  General.

    Whenever shipments of potatoes for special purposes pursuant to 
Sec. 945.53 are relieved in whole or in part from grade and size 
regulations issued under Sec. 945.52 the committee shall require 
information and evidence as to the manner, methods, and timing of such 
shipments as safeguards against the entry of any such potatoes into 
trade channels other than those for which intended. Such information and 
evidence shall include the requirements set forth below with respect to 
Certificates of Privilege.


<R05>
Sec. 945.121  Qualification.

    Before handling potatoes for special purposes which do not meet 
regulations issued pursuant to Sec. 945.52 a handler must qualify with 
the committee to handle shipments for special purposes. To qualify he 
must (a) apply for and receive a Certificate of Privilege indicating his 
intent to so handle potatoes; (b) agree to comply with reporting and 
other requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 945.121 to 945.125, 
inclusive, with respect to such shipments; and (c) receive approval of 
the committee, or its duly authorized agents, to so handle potatoes. 
Such approval will be based upon evidence furnished in his application 
for a Certificate of Privilege, and other information available to the 
committee.


<R05>
Sec. 945.122  Application.

    (a) Application for a Certificate of Privilege shall be made on 
forms furnished by the committee. Each application may contain, but need 
not be limited to, the name and address of the handler; the quantity by 
grade, size, quality and variety of the potatoes to be shipped; the mode 
of transportation; the consignee; the destination; the purpose for which 
the potatoes are to be used; a certification to the United States 
Department of Agriculture and to the committee as to the truthfulness of 
the information shown thereon; and any other appropriate information or 
documents deemed necessary by the committee or its duly authorized 
agents for the purpose stated in Sec. 945.120.

[[Page 337]]

    (b) The committee may require each handler making shipments of 
potatoes for export to include with his application a copy of the 
Department of Commerce Shipper's Export Declaration Form No. 7525-V 
applicable to such shipment.


<R05>
Sec. 945.123  Approval.

    The committee or its duly authorized agents shall give prompt 
consideration to each application for a Certificate of Privilege. 
Approval of an application, based upon a determination as to whether the 
information contained therein and other information available to the 
committee supports approval, shall be evidenced by the issuance of a 
Certificate of Privilege to the applicant. Each certificate shall cover 
a specified period, and specified qualities and quantities of potatoes 
to be sold or transported to the designated consignee for the purposes 
declared.


<R05>
Sec. 945.124  Reports.

    Each handler of potatoes shipping under Certificates of Privilege 
shall supply the committee with reports as requested by the committee or 
its duly authorized agents showing the name and address of the shipper; 
the car or truck identification; the loading point; destination; 
consignee; the inspection certificate number when inspection is 
required; and any other information deemed necessary by the committee.


<R05>
Sec. 945.125  Disqualification.

    The committee from time to time may conduct surveys of handling of 
potatoes for special purposes requiring Certificates of Privilege to 
determine whether handlers are complying with the requirements and 
regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee 
finds that a handler or consignee is failing to comply with requirements 
and regulations applicable to handling of potatoes in special outlets, 
and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or Certificates of 
Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and further certificates 
denied. Such disqualification shall apply to, and not exceed, a 
reasonable period of time as determined by the committee but in no event 
shall it extend beyond the end of the succeeding fiscal period. Any 
handler who has a certificate rescinded or denied may appeal to the 
committee in writing for reconsideration of his disqualification.
