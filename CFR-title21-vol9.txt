                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 1301.11  Persons required to register.

    (a) Every person who manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, 
or exports any controlled substance or who proposes to engage in the 
manufacture, distribution, dispensing, importation or exportation of any 
controlled substance shall obtain a registration unless exempted by law 
or pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1301.22-1301.26. Only persons actually engaged

<R05>
Sec. 1301.12  Separate registrations for separate locations.

    (a) A separate registration is required for each principal place of 
business or professional practice at one general physical location where 
controlled substances are manufactured, distributed, imported, exported, 
or dispensed by a person.
    (b) The following locations shall be deemed not to be places where 
controlled substances are manufactured, distributed, or dispensed:
    (1) A warehouse where controlled substances are stored by or on 
behalf of a registered person, unless such substances are distributed 
directly from such warehouse to registered locations other than the 
registered location from which the substances were delivered or to 
persons not required to register by

[[Page 15]]

virtue of subsection 302(c)(2) or subsection 1007(b)(1)(B) of the Act 
(21 U.S.C. 822(c)(2) or 957(b)(1)(B));
    (2) An office used by agents of a registrant where sales of 
controlled substances are solicited, made, or supervised but which 
neither contains such substances (other than substances for display 
purposes or lawful distribution as samples only) nor serves as a 
distribution point for filling sales orders; and
    (3) An office used by a practitioner (who is registered at another 
location) where controlled substances are prescribed but neither 
administered nor otherwise dispensed as a regular part of the 
professional practice of the practitioner at such office, and where no 
supplies of controlled substances are maintained.
    (4) A freight forwarding facility, as defined in Sec. 1300.01 of 
this part, provided that the distributing registrant operating the 
facility has submitted written notice of intent to operate the facility 
by registered mail, return receipt requested (or other suitable means of 
documented delivery) and such notice has been approved. The notice shall 
be submitted to the Special Agent in Charge of the Administration's 
offices in both the area in which the facility is located and each area 
in which the distributing registrant maintains a registered location 
that will transfer controlled substances through the facility. The 
notice shall detail the registered locations that will utilize the 
facility, the location of the facility, the hours of operation, the 
individual(s) responsible for the controlled substances, the security 
and recordkeeping procedures that will be employed, and whether 
controlled substances returns will be processed through the facility. 
The notice must also detail what state licensing requirements apply to 
the facility and the registrant's actions to comply with any such 
requirements. The Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Office in the area 
where the freight forwarding facility will be operated will provide 
written notice of approval or disapproval to the person within thirty 
days after confirmed receipt of the notice. Registrants that are 
currently operating freight forwarding facilities under a memorandum of 
understanding with the Administration must provide notice as required by 
this section no later than September 18, 2000 and receive written 
approval from the Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Office in the area 
in which the freight forwarding facility is operated in order to 
continue operation of the facility.

Sec. 1301.13  Application for registration; time for application; expiration 

date; registration for independent activities; application forms, fees, 
contents 
          and signature; coincident activities.

    (a) Any person who is required to be registered and who is not so 
registered may apply for registration at any time. No person required to 
be registered shall engage in any activity for which registration is 
required until the application for registration is granted and a 
Certificate of Registration is issued by the Administrator to such 
person.
    (b) Any person who is registered may apply to be reregistered not 
more than 60 days before the expiration date of his/her registration, 
except that a bulk manufacturer of Schedule I or II controlled 
substances or an importer of Schedule I or II controlled substances may 
apply to be reregistered no more than 120 days before the expiration 
date of their registration.
    (c) At the time a manufacturer, distributor, reverse distributor, 
researcher, analytical lab, importer, exporter or narcotic treatment 
program is first registered, that business activity shall be assigned to 
one of twelve groups, which shall correspond to the months of the year. 
The expiration date of the registrations of all registrants within any 
group will be the last date of the month designated for that group. In 
assigning any of these business activities to a group, the 
Administration may select a group the expiration date of which is less 
than one year from the date such business activity was registered. If 
the business activity is assigned to a group which has an expiration 
date less than three months from the date of which the

[[Page 16]]

business activity is registered, the registration shall not expire until 
one year from that expiration date; in all other cases, the registration 
shall expire on the expiration date following the date on which the 
business activity is registered.
    (d) At the time a retail pharmacy, hospital/clinic, practitioner or 
teaching institution is first registered, that business activity shall 
be assigned to one of twelve groups, which shall correspond to the 
months of the year. The expiration date of the registrations of all 
registrants within any group will be the last day of the month 
designated for that group. In assigning any of the above business 
activities to a group, the Administration may select a group the 
expiration date of which is not less than 28 months nor more than 39 
months from the date such business activity was registered. After the 
initial registration period, the registration shall expire 36 months 
from the initial expiration date.
    (e) Any person who is required to be registered and who is not so 
registered, shall make application for registration for one of the 
following groups of controlled substances activities, which are deemed 
to be independent of each other. Application for each registration shall 
be made on the indicated form, and shall be accompanied by the indicated 
fee. Fee payments shall be made in the form of a personal, certified, or 
cashier's check or money order made payable to the ``Drug Enforcement 
Administration''. The application fees are not refundable. Any person, 
when registered to engage in the activities described in each 
subparagraph in this paragraph, shall be authorized to engage in the 
coincident activities described without obtaining a registration to 
engage in such coincident activities, provided that, unless specifically 
exempted, he/she complies with all requirements and duties prescribed by 
law for persons registered to engage in such coincident activities. Any 
person who engages in more than one group of independent activities 
shall obtain a separate registration for each group of activities, 
except as provided in this paragraph under coincident activities. A 
single registration to engage in any group of independent activities 
listed below may include one or more controlled substances listed in the 
schedules authorized in that group of independent activities. A person 
registered to conduct research with controlled substances listed in 
Schedule I may conduct research with any substances listed in Schedule I 
for which he/she has filed and had approved a research protocol.

Sec. 1301.14  Filing of application; acceptance for filing; defective 
applications.

    (a) All applications for registration shall be submitted for filing 
to the Registration Unit, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of 
Justice, Post Office Box 28083, Central Station, Washington, DC 20005. 
The appropriate registration fee and any required attachments must 
accompany the application.
    (b) Any person required to obtain more than one registration may 
submit all applications in one package. Each application must be 
complete and should not refer to any accompanying application for 
required information.
    (c) Applications submitted for filing are dated upon receipt. If 
found to be complete, the application will be accepted for filing. 
Applications failing to comply with the requirements of this part will 
not generally be accepted for filing. In the case of minor defects as to 
completeness, the Administrator may accept the application for filing 
with a request to the applicant for additional information. A defective 
application will be returned to the applicant within 10 days following 
its receipt with a statement of the reason for not accepting the 
application for filing. A defective application may be corrected and 
resubmitted for filing at any time; the Administrator shall accept for 
filing any application upon resubmission by the applicant, whether 
complete or not.
    (d) Accepting an application for filing does not preclude any 
subsequent request for additional information pursuant to Sec. 1301.15 
and has no bearing on whether the application will be granted.

[62 FR 13948, Mar. 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.15  Additional information.

    The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such documents 
or written statements of fact relevant to the application as he/she 
deems necessary to determine whether the application should be granted. 
The failure of the applicant to provide such documents or statements 
within a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall be deemed 
to be a waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present such 
documents or facts for consideration by the Administrator in granting or 
denying the application.

[62 FR 13948, Mar. 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.16  Amendments to and withdrawal of applications.

    (a) An application may be amended or withdrawn without permission of 
the Administrator at any time before the date on which the applicant 
receives an order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1301.37. An 
application may be amended or withdrawn with permission of the 
Administrator at any time where good cause is shown by the applicant or 
where the amendment or withdrawal is in the public interest.
    (b) After an application has been accepted for filing, the request 
by the applicant that it be returned or the failure of the applicant to 
respond to official correspondence regarding the application, when sent 
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be 
deemed to be a withdrawal of the application.

Sec. 1301.17  Special procedures for certain applications.

    (a) If, at the time of application for registration of a new 
pharmacy, the pharmacy has been issued a license from the appropriate 
State licensing agency, the applicant may include with his/her 
application an affidavit as to the existence of the State license in the 
following form:

[[Page 20]]

                       Affidavit for New Pharmacy

    I, --------------------, the -------------------- (Title of officer,

    This statement is submitted in order to obtain a Drug Enforcement 
Administration registration number. I understand that if any information 
is false, the Administration may immediately suspend the registration 
for this store and commence proceedings to revoke under 21 U.S.C. 824(a) 
because of the danger to public health and safety. I further understand 
that any false information contained in this affidavit may subject me 
personally and the above-named corporation/partnership/business to 
prosecution under 21 U.S.C. 843, the penalties for conviction of which 
include imprisonment for up to 4 years, a fine of not more than $30,000 
or both.

    (b) Whenever the ownership of a pharmacy is being transferred from 
one person to another, if the transferee owns at least one other 
pharmacy licensed in the same State as the one the ownership of which is 
being transferred, the transferee may apply for registration prior to 
the date of transfer. The Administrator may register the applicant and 
authorize him to obtain controlled substances at the time of transfer. 
Such registration shall not authorize the transferee to dispense 
controlled substances until the pharmacy has been issued a valid State 
license. The transferee shall include with his/her application the 
following affidavit:

                   Affidavit for Transfer of Pharmacy

    I, --------------------, the -------------------- (Title of officer, 
official, partner or other position) of -------------------- 
(Corporation, partnership, or sole proprietor), doing business as ------
-------------- (Store name) hereby certify:
    (1) That said company was issued a pharmacy permit No.------------by 
the -------------------- (Board of Pharmacy of Licensing Agency) of the

agency) of the State of ------------ to do business as ----------------
---- (Store name) at -------------------- (Number and Street) ----------
---------- (City) ------------ (State) ------------ (Zip Code).

    This statement is submitted in order to obtain a Drug Enforcement 
Administration registration number.

    I understand that if a DEA registration number is issued, the 
pharmacy may acquire controlled substances but may not dispense them 
until a pharmacy permit or license is issued by the State board of 
pharmacy or licensing agency.
    I understand that if any information is false, the Administration 
may immediately suspend the registration for this store and commence 
proceedings to revoke under 21 U.S.C. 824(a) because of the danger to 
public health and safety. I further understand that any false 
information contained in this affidavit may subject me personally to 
prosecution under 21 U.S.C. 843, the penalties for conviction of which 
include imprisonment for up to 4 years, a fine of not more than $30,000 
or both.

    (c) The Administrator shall follow the normal procedures for 
approving an application to verify the statements in the affidavit. If 
the statements prove to be false, the Administrator may revoke the 
registration on the basis of section 304(a)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 
824(a)(1)) and suspend the registration

[[Page 21]]

immediately by pending revocation on the basis of section 304(d) of the 
Act (21 U.S.C. 824(d)). At the same time, the Administrator may seize 
and place under seal all controlled substances possessed by the 
applicant under section 304(f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(f)). 
Intentional misuse of the affidavit procedure may subject the applicant 
to prosecution for fraud under section 403(a)(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 
843(a)(4)), and obtaining controlled substances through registration by 
fraudulent means may subject the applicant to prosecution under section 
403(a)(3) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 843(a)(3)). The penalties for conviction 
of either offense include imprisonment for up to 4 years, a fine not 
exceeding $30,000 or both.

U.S.C. 824(a)). In the case of a supplemental protocol, a replacement 
certificate of registration shall be issued by the Administrator.
    (d) If the Secretary determines that the protocol is not meritorious 
and/or the applicant is not qualified or competent, he/she shall notify 
the Administrator in writing setting forth the reasons for such 
determination. If the Administrator determines that grounds exist for 
the denial of the application, he/she shall within 10 days issue an 
order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1301.37 and, if requested by the 
applicant, hold a hearing on the application pursuant to Sec. 1301.41. 
If the grounds for denial of the application include a determination by 
the Secretary, the Secretary or his duly authorized agent shall furnish 
testimony and documents pertaining to his determination at such hearing.

shall contain a summary of all comments and objections filed regarding 
the application and shall state the time and place for the hearing, 
which shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of 
such notice in the Federal Register. A hearing pursuant to this section 
may be consolidated with a hearing held pursuant to Sec. 1301.35 or 
Sec. 1301.36 of this part.
    (b) The Administrator shall register an applicant to import a 
controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II if he/she determines 
that such registration is consistent with the public interest and with 
U.S. obligations under international treaties, conventions, or protocols 
in effect on May 1, 1971. In determining the public interest, the 
following factors shall be considered:
    (1) Maintenance of effective controls against diversion of

    (4) Prior conviction record of applicant under Federal and State 
laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of such 
substances;
    (5) Past experience in the manufacture of controlled substances, and 
the existence in the establishment of effective control against 
diversion;
    (6) That the applicant will be permitted to import only:
    (i) Such amounts of crude opium, poppy straw, concentrate of poppy 
straw, and coca leaves as the Administrator finds to be necessary to 
provide for medical, scientific, or other legitimate purposes; or
    (ii) Such amounts of any controlled substances listed in Schedule I 
or II as the Administrator shall find to be necessary to provide for the 
medical, scientific, or other legitimate needs of the United States 
during an emergency in which domestic supplies of such substances are 
found by the Administrator to be inadequate; or
    (iii) Such amounts of any controlled substance listed in Schedule I 
or II as the Administrator shall find to be necessary to provide for the 
medical, scientific, or other legitimate needs of the United States in 
any case in which the Administrator finds that competition among 
domestic manufacturers of the controlled substance is inadequate and 
will not be rendered adequate by the registration of additional 
manufacturers under section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823); or
    (iv) Such limited quantities of any controlled substance listed in 
Schedule I or II as the Administrator shall find

[[Page 29]]

to be necessary for scientific, analytical or research uses; and
    (7) Such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the 
public health and safety.
    (c) In determining whether the applicant can and will maintain 
effective controls against diversion within the meaning of paragraph (b) 
of this section, the Administrator shall consider among other factors:
    (1) Compliance with the security requirements set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 1301.71-1301.76; and
    (2) Employment of security procedures to guard against in-transit 
losses within and without the jurisdiction of the United States.
    (d) In determining whether competition among the domestic 
manufacturers of a controlled substance is adequate within the meaning 
of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(6)(iii) of this section, as well as section 
1002(a)(2)(B) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a)(2)(B)), the Administrator 
shall consider:
    (1) The extent of price rigidity in the light of changes in:
    (i) raw materials and other costs and
    (ii) conditions of supply and demand;
    (2) The extent of service and quality competition among the domestic 
manufacturers for shares of the domestic market including:
    (i) Shifts in market shares and
    (ii) Shifts in individual customers among domestic manufacturers;
    (3) The existence of substantial differentials between domestic 
prices and the higher of prices generally prevailing in foreign markets 
or the prices at which the applicant for registration to import is 
committed to undertake to provide such products in the domestic market 
in conformity with the Act. In determining the existence of substantial 
differentials hereunder, appropriate consideration should be given to 
any additional costs imposed on domestic manufacturers by the 
requirements of the Act and such other cost-related and other factors as 
the Administrator may deem relevant. In no event shall an importer's 
offering prices in the United States be considered if they are lower 
than those prevailing in the foreign market or markets from which the 
importer is obtaining his/her supply;
    (4) The existence of competitive restraints imposed upon domestic 
manufacturers by governmental regulations; and
    (5) Such other factors as may be relevant to the determinations 
required under this paragraph.
    (e) In considering the scope of the domestic market, consideration 
shall be given to substitute products which are reasonably 
interchangeable in terms of price, quality and use.
    (f) The fact that the number of existing manufacturers is small 
shall not demonstrate, in and of itself, that adequate competition among 
them does not exist.

inconsistent with the public interest as defined in section 1008 or with 
the United States obligations under international treaties, conventions, 
or protocols in effect on October 12, 1984.
    (c) The Administrator may limit the revocation or suspension of a 
registration to the particular controlled substance, or substances, with 
respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.
    (d) Before revoking or suspending any registration, the 
Administrator shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 
1301.37 and, if requested by the registrant, shall hold a hearing 
pursuant to Sec. 1301.41.
    (e) The Administrator may suspend any registration simultaneously 
with or at any time subsequent to the service upon the registrant of an 
order to show cause why such registration should not be revoked or 
suspended, in any case where he/she finds that there is an imminent 
danger to the public health or safety. If the Administrator so suspends, 
he/she shall serve with the order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 
1301.37 an order of immediate suspension which shall contain a statement 
of his findings regarding the danger to public health or safety.
    (f) Upon service of the order of the Administrator suspending or 
revoking registration, the registrant shall immediately deliver his/her 
Certificate of Registration, any order forms, and any import or export 
permits in his/her possession to the nearest office of the 
Administration. The suspension or revocation of a registration shall 
suspend or revoke any individual manufacturing or procurement quota 
fixed for the registrant pursuant to part 1303 of this chapter and any 
import or export permits issued to the registrant pursuant to part 1312 
of this chapter. Also, upon service of the order of the Administrator 
revoking or suspending registration, the registrant shall, as instructed 
by the Administrator:

particular controlled substance or substances, the registrant shall be 
given a new Certificate of Registration for all substances not affected 
by such revocation or suspension; no fee shall be required to be paid 
for the new Certificate of Registration. The registrant shall deliver 
the old Certificate of Registration and, if appropriate, any order forms 
in his/her possession to the nearest office of

the Administration. The suspension or revocation of a registration, when 
limited to a particular basic class or classes of controlled substances, 
shall suspend or revoke any individual manufacturing or procurement 
quota fixed for the registrant for such class or classes pursuant to 
part 1303 of this chapter and any import or export permits issued to the 
registrant for such class or classes pursuant to part 1312 of this 
chapter. Also, upon service of the order of the Administrator revoking 
or suspending registration, the registrant shall, as instructed by the 
Administrator:
    (1) Deliver to the nearest office of the Administration or to 
authorized agents of the Administration all of the particular controlled 
substance or substances affected by the revocation or suspension which 
are in his/her possession; or
    (2) Place all of such substances under seal as described in sections 
304(f) or 958(d)(6) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(f) or 958(d)(6)).
    (h) Any suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of 
all proceedings upon the revocation or suspension, including any 
judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Administrator or 
dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any registrant whose 
registration is suspended under paragraph (e) of this section may 
request a hearing on the revocation or suspension of his/her 
registration at a time earlier than specified in the order to show cause 
pursuant to Sec. 1301.37. This request shall be granted by the 
Administrator, who shall fix a date for such hearing as early as 
reasonably possible.
    (i) In the event that an applicant for reregistration (who is doing 
business under a registration previously granted and not revoked or 
suspended) has applied for reregistration at least 45 days before the 
date on which the existing registration is due to expire, and the 
Administrator has issued no order on the application on the date on 
which the existing registration is due to expire, the existing 
registration of the applicant shall automatically be extended and 
continue in effect until the date on which the Administrator so issues 
his/her order. The Administrator may extend any other existing 
registration under the circumstances contemplated in this section even 
though the registrant failed to apply for reregistration at least 45 
days before expiration of the existing registration, with or without 
request by the registrant, if the Administrator finds that such 
extension is not inconsistent with the public health and safety.

Sec. 1301.37  Order to show cause.

    (a) If, upon examination of the application for registration from

regarding the applicant, the Administrator is unable to make the 
determinations required by the applicable provisions of section 303 and/
or section 1008 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823 and 958) to register the

statement of the legal basis for such hearing and for the denial, 
revocation, or suspension of registration and a summary of the matters 
of fact and law asserted.

regarding the issues involved in the denial, revocation, or suspension 
of any registration, and the granting of any application for 
registration to import or to manufacture in bulk a basic class of

appearance, file with the Administrator a waiver of an opportunity for a 
hearing or to participate in a hearing, together with a written 
statement regarding such person's position on the matters of fact and 
law involved in such hearing. Such statement, if admissible, shall be 
made a part of the record and shall be considered in light of the lack 
of opportunity for cross-examination in determining the weight to be 
attached to matters of fact asserted therein.
    (d) If any person entitled to a hearing or to participate in a

time limitation in individual instances), the following information:
    (1) The name, address, registration number, and authorized business 
activity of the registrant discontinuing the business (registrant-
transferor);
    (2) The name, address, registration number, and authorized business 
activity of the person acquiring the business (registrant-transferee);

procure any controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II (if so, the 
basic class or class of the substance should be indicated); and
    (5) The date on which the transfer of controlled substances will 
occur.
    (e) Unless the registrant-transferor is informed by the Special 
Agent in Charge, before the date on which the transfer was stated to 
occur, that the transfer may not occur, the registrant-transferor may 
distribute (without being registered to distribute) controlled 
substances in his/her possession to the registrant-transferee in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) On the date of transfer of the controlled substances, a complete 
inventory of all controlled substances being transferred shall be taken 
in accordance with Sec. 1304.11 of this chapter. This inventory shall 
serve as the final inventory of the registrant-transferor and the 
initial inventory of the registrant-transferee, and a copy of the 
inventory shall be included in the records of each person. It shall not 
be necessary to file a copy of the inventory with the Administration 
unless requested by the Special Agent in Charge. Transfers of any 
substances listed in Schedule I or II shall require

[[Page 35]]

the use of order forms in accordance with part 1305 of this chapter.
    (2) On the date of transfer of the controlled substances, all 
records required to be kept by the registrant-transferor with reference 
to the controlled substances being transferred, under part 1304 of this 
chapter, shall be transferred to the registrant-transferee. 
Responsibility for the accuracy of records prior to the date of transfer 
remains with the transferor, but responsibility for custody and 
maintenance shall be upon the transferee.
    (3) In the case of registrants required to make reports pursuant to 
part 1304 of this chapter, a report marked ``Final'' will be prepared 
and submitted by the registrant-transferor showing the disposition of 
all the controlled substances for which a report is required; no 
additional report will be required from him, if no further transactions 
involving controlled substances are consummated by him. The initial 
report of the registrant-transferee shall account for transactions 
beginning with the day next succeeding the date of discontinuance or 
transfer of business by the transferor-registrant and the substances 
transferred to him shall be reported as receipts in his/her initial 
report.

<R05>
Sec. 1301.71  Security requirements generally.

    (a) All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls 
and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled 
substances. In order to determine whether a registrant has provided 
effective controls against diversion, the Administrator shall use the 
security requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 1301.72-1301.76 as 
standards for the physical security controls and operating procedures 
necessary to prevent diversion. Materials and construction which will 
provide a structural equivalent to the physical security controls set 
forth in Sec. Sec. 1301.72, 1301.73 and 1301.75 may be used in lieu of 
the materials and construction described in those sections.
    (b) Substantial compliance with the standards set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 1301.72-1301.76 may be deemed sufficient by the Administrator 
after evaluation of the overall security system and needs of the 
applicant or registrant. In evaluating the overall security system of a 
registrant or applicant, the Administrator may consider any of the 
following factors as he may deem relevant to the need for strict 
compliance with security requirements:
    (1) The type of activity conducted (e.g., processing of bulk 
chemicals, preparing dosage forms, packaging, labeling, cooperative 
buying, etc.);
    (2) The type and form of controlled substances handled (e.g., bulk 
liquids or dosage units, usable powders or nonusable powders);
    (3) The quantity of controlled substances handled;
    (4) The location of the premises and the relationship such location 
bears on security needs;
    (5) The type of building construction comprising the facility and 
the general characteristics of the building or buildings;
    (6) The type of vault, safe, and secure enclosures or other storage 
system (e.g., automatic storage and retrieval system) used;
    (7) The type of closures on vaults, safes, and secure enclosures;
    (8) The adequacy of key control systems and/or combination lock 
control systems;
    (9) The adequacy of electric detection and alarm systems, if any 
including use of supervised transmittal lines and standby power sources;
    (10) The extent of unsupervised public access to the facility, 
including the presence and characteristics of perimeter fencing, if any;
    (11) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to 
manufacturing and storage areas;
    (12) The procedures for handling business guests, visitors, 
maintenance personnel, and nonemployee service personnel;
    (13) The availability of local police protection or of the 
registrant's or applicant's security personnel;
    (14) The adequacy of the registrant's or applicant's system for 
monitoring the receipt, manufacture, distribution, and disposition of 
controlled substances in its operations; and

[[Page 36]]

    (15) The applicability of the security requirements contained in all 
Federal, State, and local laws and regulations governing the management 
of waste.
    (c) When physical security controls become inadequate as a result of 
a controlled substance being transferred to a different schedule, or as 
a result of a noncontrolled substance being listed on any schedule, or 
as a result of a significant increase in the quantity of controlled 
substances in the possession of the registrant during normal business 
operations, the physical security controls shall be expanded and 
extended accordingly. A registrant may adjust physical security controls 
within the requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 1301.72-1301.76 when the 
need for such controls decreases as a result of a controlled substance 
being transferred to a different schedule, or a result of a controlled 
substance being removed from control, or as a result of a significant 
decrease in the quantity of controlled substances in the possession of 
the registrant during normal business operations.
    (d) Any registrant or applicant desiring to determine whether a 
proposed security system substantially complies with, or is the 
structural equivalent of, the requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 
1301.72-1301.76 may submit any plans, blueprints, sketches or other 
materials regarding the proposed security system either to the Special 
Agent in Charge in the region in which the system will be used, or to 
the Diversion Operations Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, 
Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20537.
    (e) Physical security controls of locations registered under the 
Harrison Narcotic Act or the Narcotics Manufacturing Act of 1960 on 
April 30, 1971, shall be deemed to comply substantially with the 
standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 1301.72, 1301.73 and 1301.75. Any new 
facilities or work or storage areas constructed or utilized for 
controlled substances, which facilities or work or storage areas have 
not been previously approved by the Administration, shall not 
necessarily be deemed to comply substantially with the standards set 
forth in Sec. Sec. 1301.72, 1301.73 and 1301.75, notwithstanding that 
such facilities or work or storage areas have physical security controls 
similar to those previously approved by the Administration.

Sec. 1301.73  Physical security controls for non-practitioners; 

compounders for narcotic treatment programs; manufacturing and compounding 
areas.

    All manufacturing activities (including processing, packaging and 
labeling) involving controlled substances listed in any schedule and all 
activities of compounders shall be conducted in accordance with the 
following:
    (a) All in-process substances shall be returned to the controlled 
substances storage area at the termination of the process. If the 
process is not terminated at the end of a workday (except where a 
continuous process or other normal manufacturing operation should not be 
interrupted), the processing area or tanks, vessels, bins or bulk 
containers containing such substances shall be securely locked, with 
adequate security for the area or building. If such security requires an 
alarm, such alarm, upon unauthorized entry, shall transmit a signal 
directly to a

[[Page 39]]

central station protection company, or local or state police agency 
which has a legal duty to respond, or a 24-hour control station operated 
by the registrant.
    (b) Manufacturing activities with controlled substances shall be 
conducted in an area or areas of clearly defined limited access which is 
under surveillance by an employee or employees designated in writing as 
responsible for the area. ``Limited access'' may be provided, in the 
absence of physical dividers such as walls or partitions, by traffic 
control lines or restricted space designation. The employee designated 
as responsible for the area may be engaged in the particular 
manufacturing operation being conducted: Provided, That he is able to 
provide continuous surveillance of the area in order that unauthorized 
persons may not enter or leave the area without his knowledge.
    (c) During the production of controlled substances, the 
manufacturing areas shall be accessible to only those employees required 
for efficient operation. When it is necessary for employee maintenance 
personnel, nonemployee maintenance personnel, business guests, or 
visitors to be present in or pass through manufacturing areas during 
production of controlled substances, the registrant shall provide for 
adequate observation of the area by an employee specifically authorized 
in writing.

<R05>
Sec. 1301.74  Other security controls for non-practitioners; narcotic 
treatment programs and compounders for narcotic treatment programs.

    (a) Before distributing a controlled substance to any person who the 
registrant does not know to be registered to possess the controlled 
substance, the registrant shall make a good faith inquiry either with 
the Administration or with the appropriate State controlled substances 
registration agency, if any, to determine that the person is registered 
to possess the controlled substance.
    (b) The registrant shall design and operate a system to disclose to 
the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances. The 
registrant shall inform the Field Division Office of the Administration 
in his area of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrant. 
Suspicious orders include orders of unusual size, orders deviating 
substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency.
    (c) The registrant shall notify the Field Division Office of the 
Administration in his area of any theft or significant loss of any 
controlled substances upon discovery of such theft or loss. The supplier 
shall be responsible for reporting in-transit losses of controlled 
substances by the common or contract carrier selected pursuant to Sec. 
1301.74(e), upon discovery of such theft or loss. The registrant shall 
also complete DEA Form 106 regarding such theft or loss. Thefts must be 
reported whether or not the controlled substances are subsequently 
recovered and/or the responsible parties are identified and action taken 
against them.
    (d) The registrant shall not distribute any controlled substance 
listed in Schedules II through V as a complimentary sample to any 
potential or current customer (1) without the prior written request of 
the customer, (2) to be used only for satisfying the legitimate medical 
needs of patients of the customer, and (3) only in reasonable 
quantities. Such request must contain the name, address, and 
registration number of the customer and the name and quantity of the 
specific controlled substance desired. The request shall be preserved by 
the registrant with other records of distribution of controlled 
substances. In addition, the requirements of part 1305 of the chapter 
shall be complied with for any distribution of a controlled substance 
listed in Schedule II. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
``customer'' includes a person to whom a complimentary sample of a 
substance is given in order to encourage the prescribing or recommending 
of the substance by the person.
    (e) When shipping controlled substances, a registrant is responsible 
for selecting common or contract carriers which provide adequate 
security to guard against in-transit losses. When

[[Page 40]]

storing controlled substances in a public warehouse, a registrant is 
responsible for selecting a warehouseman which will provide adequate 
security to guard against storage losses; wherever possible, the 
registrant shall store controlled substances in a public warehouse which 
complies with the requirements set forth in Sec. 1301.72. In addition, 
the registrant shall employ precautions (e.g., assuring that shipping 
containers do not indicate that contents are controlled substances) to 
guard against storage or in-transit losses.
    (f) When distributing controlled substances through agents (e.g., 
detailmen), a registrant is responsible for providing and requiring 
adequate security to guard against theft and diversion while the 
substances are being stored or handled by the agent or agents.
    (g) Before the initial distribution of carfentanil etorphine 
hydrochloride and/or diprenorphine to any person, the registrant must 
verify that the person is authorized to handle the substances(s) by 
contacting the Drug Enforcement Administration.
    (h) The acceptance of delivery of narcotic substances by a narcotic 
treatment program shall be made only by a licensed practitioner employed 
at the facility or other authorized individuals designated in writing. 
At the time of delivery, the licensed practitioner or other authorized 
individual designated in writing (excluding persons currently or 
previously dependent on narcotic drugs), shall sign for the narcotics 
and place his specific title (if any) on any invoice. Copies of these 
signed invoices shall be kept by the distributor.
    (i) Narcotics dispensed or administered at a narcotic treatment 
program will be dispensed or administered directly to the patient by 
either (1) the licensed practitioner, (2) a registered nurse under the 
direction of the licensed practitioner, (3) a licensed practical nurse 
under the direction of the licensed practitioner, or (4) a pharmacist 
under the direction of the licensed practitioner.
    (j) Persons enrolled in a narcotic treatment program will be 
required to wait in an area physically separated from the narcotic 
storage and dispensing area. This requirement will be enforced by the 
program physician and employees.
    (k) All narcotic treatment programs must comply with standards 
established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (after 
consultation with the Administration) respecting the quantities of 
narcotic drugs which may be provided to persons enrolled in a narcotic 
treatment program for unsupervised use.
    (l) DEA may exercise discretion regarding the degree of security 
required in narcotic treatment programs based on such factors as the 
location of a program, the number of patients enrolled in a program and 
the number of physicians, staff members and security guards. Similarly, 
such factors will be taken into consideration when evaluating existing 
security or requiring new security at a narcotic treatment program.

Sec. 1301.76  Other security controls for practitioners.

    (a) The registrant shall not employ, as an agent or employee who has 
access to controlled substances, any person who has been convicted of a 
felony offense relating to controlled substances or who, at any time, 
had an application for registration with the DEA denied, had a DEA 
registration revoked or has surrendered a DEA registration for cause. 
For purposes of this subsection, the term ``for cause'' means a 
surrender in lieu of, or as a consequence of, any federal or state 
administrative, civil or criminal action resulting from an investigation 
of the individual's handling of controlled substances.
    (b) The registrant shall notify the Field Division Office of the 
Administration in his area of the theft or significant loss of any 
controlled substances upon discovery of such loss or theft. The 
registrant shall also complete DEA (or BND) Form 106 regarding such loss 
or theft.
    (c) Whenever the registrant distributes a controlled substance 
(without being registered as a distributor, as permitted in Sec. 
1301.13(e)(1) and/or Sec. Sec. 1307.11-1307.12) he/she shall comply 
with the requirements imposed on nonpractitioners in Sec. 1301.74 (a), 
(b), and (e).
    (d) Central fill pharmacies must comply with Sec. 1301.74(e) when 
selecting private, common or contract carriers to transport filled 
prescriptions to a retail pharmacy for delivery to the ultimate user. 
When central fill pharmacies contract with private, common or contract 
carriers to transport filled prescriptions to a retail pharmacy, the 
central fill pharmacy is responsible for reporting in-transit losses 
upon discovery of such loss by use of a DEA Form 106. Retail pharmacies 
must comply with Sec. 1301.74(e) when selecting private, common or 
contract carriers to retrieve filled prescriptions from a central fill 
pharmacy. When retail pharmacies contract with private, common or 
contract carriers to retrieve filled prescriptions from a central fill 
pharmacy, the retail pharmacy is responsible for reporting in-transit 
losses upon discovery of such loss by use of a DEA Form 106.

Sec. 1301.77  Security controls for freight forwarding facilities.

    (a) All Schedule II-V controlled substances that will be temporarily 
stored at the freight forwarding facility must be either:
    (1) stored in a segregated area under constant observation by 
designated responsible individual(s); or
    (2) stored in a secured area that meets the requirements of Section

that may be locked down (i.e., secured against physical entry in a 
manner consistent with requirements of Section 1301.72(b)(3)(ii) of this 
part) and has a monitored alarm system or is subject to continuous 
monitoring by security personnel will be deemed to meet the requirements 
of Section 1301.72(b)(3) of this Part.
    (b) Access to controlled substances must be kept to an absolute 
minimum number of specifically authorized individuals. Non-authorized 
individuals may not be present in or pass through controlled substances 
storage areas without adequate observation provided by an individual 
authorized in writing by the registrant.

                  Employee Screening--Non-Practitioners


<R05>
Sec. 1301.90  Employee screening procedures.

    It is the position of DEA that the obtaining of certain information 
by non-practitioners is vital to fairly assess

[[Page 42]]

the likelihood of an employee committing a drug security breach. The 
need to know this information is a matter of business necessity, 
essential to overall controlled substances security. In this regard, it 
is believed that conviction of crimes and unauthorized use of controlled 
substances are activities that are proper subjects for inquiry. It is, 
therefore, assumed that the following questions will become a part of an 
employer's comprehensive employee screening program:

    Question. Within the past five years, have you been convicted of a 
felony, or within the past two years, of any misdemeanor or are you 
presently formally charged with committing a criminal offense? (Do not 
include any traffic violations, juvenile offenses or military 
convictions, except by general court-martial.) If the answer is yes, 
furnish details of conviction, offense, location, date and sentence.

    Question. In the past three years, have you ever knowingly used any 
narcotics, amphetamines or barbiturates, other than those prescribed to 
you by a physician? If the answer is yes, furnish details.

    Advice. An authorization, in writing, that allows inquiries to be 
made of courts and law enforcement agencies for possible pending charges 
or convictions must be executed by a person who is allowed to work in an 
area where access to controlled substances clearly exists. A person must 
be advised that any false information or omission of information will 
jeopardize his or her position with respect to employment. The 
application for employment should inform a person that information 
furnished or recovered as a result of any inquiry will not necessarily 
preclude employment, but will be considered as part of an overall 
evaluation of the person's qualifications. The maintaining of fair 
employment practices, the protection of the person's right of privacy, 
and the assurance that the results of such inquiries will be treated by 
the employer in confidence will be explained to the employee.

[40 FR 17143, Apr. 17, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.91  Employee responsibility to report drug diversion.

    Reports of drug diversion by fellow employees is not only a 
necessary part of an overall employee security program but also serves 
the public interest at large. It is, therefore, the position of DEA that 
an employee who has knowledge of drug diversion from his employer by a 
fellow employee has an obligation to report such information to a 
responsible security official of the employer. The employer shall treat 
such information as confidential and shall take all reasonable steps to 
protect the confidentiality of the information and the identity of the 
employee furnishing information. A failure to report information of drug 
diversion will be considered in determining the feasibility of 
continuing to allow an employee to work in a drug security area. The 
employer shall inform all employees concerning this policy.

[40 FR 17143, Apr. 17, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.92  Illicit activities by employees.

    It is the position of DEA that employees who possess, sell, use or 
divert controlled substances will subject themselves not only to State 
or Federal prosecution for any illicit activity, but shall also 
immediately become the subject of independent action regarding their 
continued employment. The employer will assess the seriousness of the 
employee's violation, the position of responsibility held by the 
employee, past record of employment, etc., in determining whether to 
suspend, transfer, terminate or take other action against the employee.

Sec. 1301.93  Sources of information for employee checks.

    DEA recommends that inquiries concerning employees' criminal records 
be made as follows:

    Local inquiries. Inquiries should be made by name, date and place of 
birth, and other identifying information, to local courts and law 
enforcement agencies for records of pending charges and convictions. 
Local practice may require such inquiries to be made in person, rather 
than by mail, and a copy of an authorization from the employee may be 
required by certain law enforcement agencies.
    DEA inquiries. Inquiries supplying identifying information should 
also be furnished to DEA Field Division Offices along with written 
consent from the concerned individual for a check of DEA files for 
records of convictions. The Regional check will result in a national 
check being made by the Field Division Office.

               Aggregate Production and Procurement Quotas


<R05>
Sec. 1303.11  Aggregate production quotas.

    (a) The Administrator shall determine the total quantity of each 
basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II necessary 
to be manufactured during the following calendar year to provide for the 
estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the 
United States, for lawful export requirements, and for the establishment 
and maintenance of reserve stocks.

[[Page 45]]

    (b) In making his determinations, the Administrator shall consider 
the following factors:
    (1) Total net disposal of the class by all manufacturers during the 
current and 2 preceding years;
    (2) Trends in the national rate of net disposal of the class;
    (3) Total actual (or estimated) inventories of the class and of all 
substances manufactured from the class, and trends in inventory 
accumulation;
    (4) Projected demand for such class as indicated by procurement 
quotas requested pursuant to Sec. 1303.12; and
    (5) Other factors affecting medical, scientific, research, and 
industrial needs in the United States and lawful export requirements, as 
the Administrator finds relevant, including changes in the currently 
accepted medical use in treatment with the class or the substances which 
are manufactured from it, the economic and physical availability of raw 
materials for use in manufacturing and for inventory purposes, yield and 
stability problems, potential disruptions to production (including 
possible labor strikes), and recent unforeseen emergencies such as 
floods and fires.
    (c) The Administrator shall, on or before May 1 of each year, 
publish in the Federal Register, general notice of an aggregate 
production quota for any basic class determined by him under this 
section. A copy of said notice shall be mailed simultaneously to each 
person registered as a bulk manufacturer of the basic class. The 
Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written 
comments on or objections to the proposal and shall designate in the 
notice the time during which such filings may be made. The Administrator 
may, but shall not be required to, hold a public hearing on one or more 
issues raised by the comments and objections filed with him. In the 
event the Administrator decides to hold such a hearing, he shall publish 
notice of the hearing in the Federal Register, which notice shall 
summarize the issues to be heard and shall set the time for the hearing 
which shall nnt be less than 30 days after the date of publication of 
the notice. After consideration of any comments or objections, or after 
a hearing if one is ordered by the Administrator, the Administrator 
shall issue and publish in the Federal Register his final order 
determining the aggregate production quota for the basic class of 
controlled substance. The order shall include the findings of fact and 
conclusions of law upon which the order is based. The order shall 
specify the date on which it shall take effect. A copy of said order 
shall be mailed simultaneously to each person registered as a bulk 
manufacturer of the basic class.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.12  Procurement quotas.

    (a) In order to determine the estimated needs for, and to insure an 
adequate and uninterrupted supply of, basic classes of controlled 
substances listed in Schedules I and II (except raw opium being imported 
by the registrant pursuant to an import permit) the Administrator shall 
issue procurement quotas authorizing persons to procure and use 
quantities of each basic class of such substances for the purpose of 
manufacturing such class into dosage forms or into other substances.
    (b) Any person who is registered to manufacture controlled 
substances listed in any schedule and who desires to use during the next 
calendar year any basic class of controlled substances listed in 
Schedule I or II (except raw opium being imported by the registrant 
pursuant to an import permit) for purposes of manufacturing, shall apply 
on DEA Form 250 for a procurement quota for such basic class. A separate 
application must be made for each basic class desired to be procured or 
used. The applicant shall state whether he intends to manufacture the 
basic class himself or purchase it from another manufacturer. The 
applicant shall state separately each purpose for which the basic class 
is desired, the quantity desired for that purpose during the next 
calendar year, and the quantities used and estimated to be used, if any, 
for that purpose during the current and preceding 2 calendar years. If 
the purpose is to manufacture the basic class into dosage form, the 
applicant shall state the official name, common or usual name, chemical 
name, or brand name

[[Page 46]]

of that form. If the purpose is to manufacture another substance, the 
applicant shall state the official name, common or usual name, chemical 
name, or brand name of the substance, and, if a controlled substance 
listed in any schedule, the schedule number and Administration 
Controlled Substances Code Number, as set forth in part 1308 of this 
chapter, of the substance. If the purpose is to manufacture another 
basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II, the 
applicant shall also state the quantity of the other basic class which 
the applicant has applied to manufacture pursuant to Sec. 1303.22 and 
the quantity of the first basic class necessary to manufacture a 
specified unit of the second basic class. DEA Form 250 shall be filed on 
or before April 1 of the year preceding the calendar year for which the 
procurement quota is being applied. Copies of DEA Form 250 may be 
obtained from, and shall be filed with, the Drug & Chemical Evaluation 
Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, 
Washington, DC 20537.
    (c) The Administrator shall, on or before July 1 of the year 
preceding the calendar year during which the quota shall be effective, 
issue to each qualified applicant a procurement quota authorizing him to 
procure and use:
    (1) All quantities of such class necessary to manufacture all 
quantities of other basic classes of controlled substances listed in 
Schedules I and II which the applicant is authorized to manufacture 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.23; and
    (2) Such other quantities of such class as the applicant has applied 
to procure and use and are consistent with his past use, his estimated 
needs, and the total quantity of such class that will be produced.
    (d) Any person to whom a procurement quota has been issued may at 
any time request an adjustment in the quota by applying to the 
Administrator with a statement showing the need for the adjustment. Such 
application shall be filed with the Drug & Chemical Evaluation Section, 
Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 
20537. The Administrator shall increase or decrease the procurement 
quota of such person if and to the extent that he finds, after 
considering the factors enumerated in paragraph (c) of this section and 
any occurrences since the issuance of the procurement quota, that the 
need justifies an adjustment.
    (e) The following persons need not obtain a procurement quota:
    (1) Any person who is registered to manufacture a basic class of 
controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II and who uses all of the 
quantity he manufactures in the manufacture of a substance not 
controlled under the Act;
    (2) Any person who is registered or authorized to conduct chemical 
analysis with controlled substances (for controlled substances to be 
used in such analysis only); and
    (3) Any person who is registered to conduct research with a basic 
class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II and who is 
authorized to manufacture a quantity of such class pursuant to Sec. 
1301.13 of this chapter.
    (f) Any person to whom a procurement quota has been issued, 
authorizing that person to procure and use a quantity of a basic class 
of controlled substances listed in Schedules I or II during the current 
calendar year, shall, at or before the time of giving an order to 
another manufacturer requiring the distribution of a quantity of such 
basic class, certify in writing to such other manufacturer that the 
quantity of such basic class ordered does not exceed the person's unused 
and available procurement quota of such basic class for the current 
calendar year. The written certification shall be executed by the same 
individual who signed the DEA Form 222 transmitting the order. 
Manufacturers shall not fill an order from persons required to apply for 
a procurement quota under paragraph (b) of this section unless the order 
is accompanied by a certification as required under this section. The 
certification required by this section shall contain the following: The 
date of the certification; the name and address of the bulk manufacturer 
to whom the certification is directed; a reference to the number of the 
DEA Form 222 to which the certification applies; the name of the person 
giving the order to which the certification applies; the name of the 
basic class specified in the DEA Form 222 to

[[Page 47]]

which the certification applies; the appropriate schedule within which 
is listed the basic class specified in the DEA Form 222 to which the 
certification applies; a statement that the quantity (expressed in 
grams) of the basic class specified in the DEA Form 222 to which the 
certification applies does not exceed the unused and available 
procurement quota of such basic class, issued to the person giving the 
order, for the current calendar year; and the signature of the 
individual who signed the DEA Form 222 to which the certification 
applies.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.13  Adjustments of aggregate production quotas.

    (a) The Administrator may at any time increase or reduce the 
aggregate production quota for a basic class of controlled substance 
listed in Schedule I or II which he has previously fixed pursuant to 
Sec. 1303.11.
    (b) In determining to adjust the aggregate production quota, the 
Administrator shall consider the following factors:
    (1) Changes in the demand for that class, changes in the national 
rate of net disposal of the class, and changes in the rate of net 
disposal of the class by registrants holding individual manufacturing 
quotas for that class;
    (2) Whether any increased demand for that class, the national and/or 
individual rates of net disposal of that class are temporary, short 
term, or long term;
    (3) Whether any increased demand for that class can be met through 
existing inventories, increased individual manufacturing quotas, or 
increased importation, without increasing the aggregate production 
quota, taking into account production delays and the probability that 
other individual manufacturing quotas may be suspended pursuant to Sec. 
1303.24(b);
    (4) Whether any decreased demand for that class will result in 
excessive inventory accumulation by all persons registered to handle 
that class (including manufacturers, distributors, practitioners, 
importers, and exporters), notwithstanding the possibility that 
individual manufacturing quotas may be suspended pursuant to Sec. 
1303.24(b) or abandoned pursuant to Sec. 1303.27;
    (5) Other factors affecting medical, scientific, research, and 
industrial needs in the United States and lawful export requirements, as 
the Administrator finds relevant, including changes in the currently 
accepted medical use in treatment with the class or the substances which 
are manufactured from it, the economic and physical availability of raw 
materials for use in manufacturing and for inventory purposes, yield and 
stability problems, potential disruptions to production (including 
possible labor strikes), and recent unforeseen emergencies such as 
floods and fires.
    (c) The Administrator in the event he determines to increase or 
reduce the aggregate production quota for a basic class of controlled 
substance, shall publish in the Federal Register general notice of an 
adjustment in the aggregate production quota for that class determined 
by him under this section. A copy of said notice shall be mailed 
simultaneously to each person registered as a bulk manufacturer of the 
basic class. The Administrator shall permit any interested person to 
file written comments on or objections to the proposal and shall 
designate in the notice the time during which such filings may be made. 
The Administrator may, but shall not be required to, hold a public 
hearing on one or more issues raised by the comments and objections 
filed with him. In the event the Administrator decides to hold such a 
hearing, he shall publish notice of the hearing in the Federal Register, 
which notice shall summarize the issues to be heard and shall set the 
time for the hearing, which shall not be less than 10 days after the 
date of publication of the notice. After consideration of any comments 
or objections, or after a hearing if one is ordered by the 
Administrator, the Administrator shall issue and publish in the Federal 
Register his final

[[Page 48]]

order determining the aggregate production for the basic class of 
controlled substance. The order shall include the findings of fact and 
conclusions of law upon which the order is based. The order shall 
specify the date on which it shall take effect. A copy of said order 
shall be mailed simultaneously to each person registered as a bulk 
manufacturer of the basic class.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.24  Inventory allowance.

    (a) For the purpose of determining individual manufacturing quotas 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.23, each registered manufacturer shall be allowed 
as a part of such quota an amount sufficient to maintain an inventory 
equal to,
    (1) For current manufacturers, 50 percent of his average estimated 
net disposal for the current calendar year and the last preceding 
calendar year; or
    (2) For new manufacturers, 50 percent of his reasonably estimated 
net disposal for the next calendar year as determined by the 
Administrator.
    (b) During each calendar year each registered manufacturer shall be 
allowed to maintain an inventory of a basic class not exceeding 65 
percent of his estimated net disposal of that class for that year, as 
determined at the time his quota for that year was determined. At any 
time the inventory of a basic class held by a manufacturer exceeds 65 
percent of his estimated net disposal, his quota for that class is 
automatically suspended and shall remain suspended until his inventory 
is less than 60 percent of his estimated net disposal. The Administrator 
may, upon application and for good cause shown, permit a manufacturer 
whose quota is, or is likely to be, suspended pursuant to this paragraph 
to continue manufacturing and to accumulate an inventory in excess of 65 
percent of his estimated net disposal, upon such conditions and within 
such limitations as the Administrator may find necessary or desirable.
    (c) If, during a calendar year, a registrant has manufactured the 
entire quantity of a basic class allocated to him under an individual 
manufacturing quota, and his inventory of that class is less than 40 
percent of his estimated net disposal of that class for that year, the 
Administrator may, upon application pursuant to Sec. 1303.25, increase 
the quota of such registrant sufficiently to allow restoration of the 
inventory to 50

[[Page 50]]

percent of the estimated net disposal for that year.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.25  Increase in individual manufacturing quotas.

    (a) Any registrant who holds an individual manufacturing quota for a 
basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II may file 
with the Administrator an application on Administration Form 189 for an 
increase in such quota in order for him to meet his estimated net 
disposal, inventory and other requirements during the remainder of such 
calendar year.
    (b) The Administrator, in passing upon a registrant's application 
for an increase in his individual manufacturing quota, shall take into 
consideration any occurrences since the filing of such registrant's 
initial quota application that may require an increased manufacturing 
rate by such registrant during the balance of the calendar year. In 
passing upon such application the Administrator may also take into 
consideration the amount, if any, by which his determination of the 
total quantity for the basic class of controlled substance to be 
manufactured under Sec. 1303.11 exceeds the aggregate of all the 
individual manufacturing quotas for the basic class of controlled 
substance, and the equitable distribution of such excess among other 
registrants.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.26  Reduction in individual manufacturing quotas.

    The Administrator may at any time reduce an individual manufacturing 
quota for a basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or 
II which he has previously fixed in order to prevent the aggregate of 
the individual manufacturing quotas and import permits outstanding or to 
be granted from exceeding the aggregate production quota which has been 
established for that class pursuant of Sec. 1303.11, as adjusted 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.13. If a quota assigned to a new manufacturer 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.23(b), or if a quota assigned to any manufacturer 
is increased pursuant to Sec. 1303.24(c), or if an import permit issued 
to an importer pursuant to part 1312 of this chapter, causes the total 
quantity of a basic class to be manufactured and imported during the 
year to exceed the aggregate production quota which has been established 
for that class pursuant to Sec. 1303.11, as adjusted pursuant to Sec. 
1303.13, the Administrator may proportionately reduce the individual 
manufacturing quotas and import permits of all other registrants to keep 
the aggregate production quota within the limits originally established, 
or, alternatively, the Administrator may reduce the individual 
manufacturing quota of any registrant whose quota is suspended pursuant 
to Sec. 1303.24(b) or Sec. 1301.36 of this chapter, or is abandoned 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.27.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.27  Abandonment of quota.

    Any manufacturer assigned an individual manufacturing quota for any 
basic class pursuant to Sec. 1303.23 may at any time abandon his right 
to manufacture all or any part of such quota by filing with the Drug & 
Chemical Evaluation Section a written notice of such abandonment, 
stating the name and Administration Controlled Substances Code Number, 
as set forth in part 1308 of this chapter, of the substance and the 
amount which he has chosen not to manufacture. The Administrator may, in 
his discretion, allocate such amount among the other manufacturers in 
proportion to their respective quotas.

Sec. 1304.01  Scope of part 1304.

    Inventory and other records and reports required under section 307 
or section 1008(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 827 and 958(d)) shall be in 
accordance with, and contain the information required by, those sections 
and by the sections of this part.

Sec. 1304.02  Definitions.

    Any term contained in this part shall have the definition set forth 
in section 102 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 802) or part 1300 of this chapter.

[62 FR 13958, Mar. 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1304.03  Persons required to keep records and file reports.

    (a) Each registrant shall maintain the records and inventories and 
shall file the reports required by this part, except as exempted by this 
section. Any registrant who is authorized to conduct other activities 
without being registered to conduct those activities, either pursuant to 
Sec. 1301.22(b) of this chapter or pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1307.11-
1307.15 of this chapter, shall maintain the records and inventories and 
shall file the reports required by this part for persons registered to 
conduct such activities. This latter requirement should not be construed 
as requiring stocks of controlled substances being used in various 
activities under one registration to be stored separately, nor that 
separate records are required for each activity. The intent of the 
Administration is to permit the registrant to keep one set of records 
which are adapted by the registrant to account for controlled substances 
used in any activity. Also, the Administration does not wish to acquire 
separate stocks of the same substance to be purchased and stored for 
separate activities. Otherwise, there is no advantage gained by 
permitting several activities under one registration. Thus, when a 
researcher manufactures a controlled item, he must keep a record of the 
quantity manufactured; when he distributes a quantity of the item, he 
must use and keep invoices or order forms to document the transfer; when 
he imports a substance, he keeps as part of his records the 
documentation required of an importer; and when substances are used in 
chemical analysis, he need not keep a record of this because such a 
record would not be required of him under a registration to do chemical 
analysis. All of these records may be maintained in one consolidated 
record system. Similarly, the researcher may store all of his controlled 
items in one place, and every two years take inventory of all items on 
hand, regardless of whether the substances were manufactured by him, 
imported by him, or purchased domestically by him, of whether the 
substances will be administered to subjects, distributed to other 
researchers, or destroyed during chemical analysis.
    (b) A registered individual practitioner is required to keep 
records, as described in Sec. 1304.04, of controlled substances in 
Schedules II, III, IV, and V

[[Page 54]]

which are dispensed, other than by prescribing or administering in the 
lawful course of professional practice.
    (c) A registered individual practitioner is not required to keep 
records of controlled substances in Schedules II, III, IV, and V which 
are prescribed in the lawful course of professional practice, unless 
such substances are prescribed in the course of maintenance or 
detoxification treatment of an individual.
    (d) A registered individual practitioner is not required to keep 
records of controlled substances listed in Schedules II, III, IV and V 
which are administered in the lawful course of professional practice 
unless the practitioner regularly engages in the dispensing or 
administering of controlled substances and charges patients, either 
separately or together with charges for other professional services, for 
substances so dispensed or administered. Records are required to be kept 
for controlled substances administered in the course of maintenance or 
detoxification treatment of an individual.
    (e) Each registered mid-level practitioner shall maintain in a 
readily retrievable manner those documents required by the state in 
which he/she practices which describe the conditions and extent of his/
her authorization to dispense controlled substances and shall make such 
documents available for inspection and copying by authorized employees 
of the Administration. Examples of such documentation include protocols, 
practice guidelines or practice agreements.
    (f) Registered persons using any controlled substances while 
conducting preclinical research, in teaching at a registered 
establishment which maintains records with respect to such substances or 
conducting research in conformity with an exemption granted under 
section 505(i) or 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
U.S.C. 355(i) or 360b(j)) at a registered establishment which maintains 
records in accordance with either of those sections, are not required to 
keep records if he/she notifies the Administration of the name, address, 
and registration number of the establishment maintaining such records. 
This notification shall be given at the time the person applies for 
registration or reregistration and shall be made in the form of an 
attachment to the application, which shall be filed with the 
application.
    (g) A distributing registrant who utilizes a freight forwarding 
facility shall maintain records to reflect transfer of controlled 
substances through the facility. These records must contain the date, 
time of transfer, number of cartons, crates, drums or other packages in 
which commercial containers of controlled substances are shipped and 
authorized signatures for each transfer. A distributing registrant may, 
as part of the initial request to operate a freight forwarding facility, 
request permission to store records at a central location. Approval of 
the request to maintain central records would be implicit in the 
approval of the request to operate the facility. Otherwise, a request to 
maintain records at a central location must be submitted in accordance 
with Sec. 1304.04 of this part. These records must be maintained for a 
period of two years.

Sec. 1304.04  Maintenance of records and inventories.

    (a) Every inventory and other records required to be kept under this 
part shall be kept by the registrant and be available, for at least 2 
years from the date of such inventory or records, for inspection and 
copying by authorized employees of the Administration, except that 
financial and shipping records (such as invoices and packing slips but 
not executed order forms subject to Sec. 1305.13 of this chapter) may 
be kept at a central location, rather than at the registered location, 
if the registrant has notified the Administration of his intention to 
keep central records. Written notification must be submitted by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, in triplicate, 
to the Special Agent in Charge of the Administration in the area in 
which the registrant is located. Unless

[[Page 55]]

the registrant is informed by the Special Agent in Charge that 
permission to keep central records is denied, the registrant may 
maintain central records commencing 14 days after receipt of his 
notification by the Special Agent in Charge.

All notifications must include:
    (1) The nature of the records to be kept centrally.
    (2) The exact location where the records will be kept.
    (3) The name, address, DEA registration number and type of DEA 
registration of the registrant whose records are being maintained 
centrally.
    (4) Whether central records will be maintained in a manual, or 
computer readable form.
    (b) All registrants that are authorized to maintain a central 
recordkeeping system shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The records to be maintained at the central record location 
shall not include executed order forms, prescriptions and/or inventories 
which shall be maintained at each registered location.
    (2) If the records are kept on microfilm, computer media or in any 
form requiring special equipment to render the records easily readable, 
the registrant shall provide access to such equipment with the records. 
If any code system is used (other than pricing information), a key to 
the code shall be provided to make the records understandable.
    (3) The registrant agrees to deliver all or any part of such records 
to the registered location within two business days upon receipt of a 
written request from the Administration for such records, and if the 
Administration chooses to do so in lieu of requiring delivery of such 
records to the registered location, to allow authorized employees of the 
Administration to inspect such records at the central location upon 
request by such employees without a warrant of any kind.
    (4) In the event that a registrant fails to comply with these 
conditions, the Special Agent in Charge may cancel such central 
recordkeeping authorization, and all other central recordkeeping 
authorizations held by the registrant without a hearing or other 
procedures. In the event of a cancellation of central recordkeeping 
authorizations under this paragraph the registrant shall, within the 
time specified by the Special Agent in Charge, comply with the 
requirements of this section that all records be kept at the registered 
location.
    (c) Registrants need not notify the Special Agent in Charge or 
obtain central recordkeeping approval in order to maintain records on an 
in-house computer system.
    (d) ARCOS participants who desire authorization to report from other 
than their registered locations must obtain a separate central reporting 
identifier. Request for central reporting identifiers will be submitted 
to: ARCOS Unit, P.O. Box 28293, Central Station, Washington, DC 20005.
    (e) All central recordkeeping permits previously issued by the 
Administration expired September 30, 1980.
    (f) Each registered manufacturer, distributor, importer, exporter, 
narcotic treatment program and compounder for narcotic treatment program 
shall maintain inventories and records of controlled substances as 
follows:
    (1) Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in 
Schedules I and II shall be maintained separately from all of the 
records of the registrant; and
    (2) Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in 
Schedules III, IV, and V shall be maintained either separately from all 
other records of the registrant or in such form that the information 
required is readily retrievable from the ordinary business records of 
the registrant.
    (g) Each registered individual practitioner required to keep records 
and institutional practitioner shall maintain inventories and records of 
controlled substances in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (h) Each registered pharmacy shall maintain the inventories and 
records of controlled substances as follows:
    (1) Inventories and records of all controlled substances listed in 
Schedules I and II shall be maintained separately from all other records 
of the pharmacy, and prescriptions for such substances shall be 
maintained in a separate prescription file; and

[[Page 56]]

    (2) Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in 
Schedules III, IV, and V shall be maintained either separately from all 
other records of the pharmacy or in such form that the information 
required is readily retrievable from ordinary business records of the 
pharmacy, and prescriptions for such substances shall be maintained 
either in a separate prescription file for controlled substances listed 
in Schedules III, IV, and V only or in such form that they are readily 
retrievable from the other prescription records of the pharmacy. 
Prescriptions will be deemed readily retrievable if, at the time they 
are initially filed, the face of the prescription is stamped in red ink 
in the lower right corner with the letter ``C'' no less than 1 inch high 
and filed either in the prescription file for controlled substances 
listed in Schedules I and II or in the usual consecutively numbered 
prescription file for non-controlled substances. However, if a pharmacy 
employs an ADP system or other electronic recordkeeping system for 
prescriptions which permits identification by prescription number and 
retrieval of original documents by prescriber's name, patient's name, 
drug dispensed, and date filled, then the requirement to mark the hard 
copy prescription with a red ``C'' is waived.

                         Inventory Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1304.11  Inventory requirements.

    (a) General requirements. Each inventory shall contain a complete 
and accurate record of all controlled substances on hand on the date the 
inventory is taken, and shall be maintained in written, typewritten, or 
printed form at the registered location. An inventory taken by use of an 
oral recording device must be promptly transcribed. Controlled 
substances shall be deemed to be ``on hand'' if they are in the 
possession of or under the control of the registrant, including 
substances returned by a customer, ordered by a customer but not yet 
invoiced, stored in a warehouse on behalf of the registrant, and 
substances in the possession of employees of the registrant and intended 
for distribution as complimentary samples. A separate inventory shall be 
made for each registered location and each independent activity 
registered, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. In 
the event controlled substances in the possession or under the control 
of the registrant are stored at a location for which he/she is not 
registered, the substances shall be included in the inventory of the 
registered location to which they are subject to control or to which the 
person possessing the substance is responsible. The inventory may be 
taken either as of opening of business or as of the close of business on 
the inventory date and it shall be indicated on the inventory.
    (b) Initial inventory date. Every person required to keep records 
shall take an inventory of all stocks of controlled substances on hand 
on the date he/she first engages in the manufacture, distribution, or 
dispensing of controlled substances, in accordance with paragraph (e) of 
this section as applicable.

[[Page 57]]

In the event a person commences business with no controlled substances 
on hand, he/she shall record this fact as the initial inventory.
    (c) Biennial inventory date. After the initial inventory is taken, 
the registrant shall take a new inventory of all stocks of controlled 
substances on hand at least every two years. The biennial inventory may 
be taken on any date which is within two years of the previous biennial 
inventory date.
    (d) Inventory date for newly controlled substances. On the effective 
date of a rule by the Administrator pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1308.45, 
1308.46, or 1308.47 of this chapter adding a substance to any schedule 
of controlled substances, which substance was, immediately prior to that 
date, not listed on any such schedule, every registrant required to keep 
records who possesses that substance shall take an inventory of all 
stocks of the substance on hand. Thereafter, such substance shall be 
included in each inventory made by the registrant pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (e) Inventories of manufacturers, distributors, dispensers, 
researchers, importers, exporters and chemical analysts. Each person 
registered or authorized (by Sec. 1301.13 or Sec. Sec. 1307.11-1307.13 
of this chapter) to manufacture, distribute, dispense, import, export, 
conduct research or chemical analysis with controlled substances and 
required to keep records pursuant to Sec. 1304.03 shall include in the 
inventory the information listed below.
    (1) Inventories of manufacturers. Each person registered or 
authorized to manufacture controlled substances shall include the 
following information in the inventory:
    (i) For each controlled substance in bulk form to be used in (or 
capable of use in) the manufacture of the same or other controlled or 
non-controlled substances in finished form, the inventory shall include:
    (A) The name of the substance and
    (B) The total quantity of the substance to the nearest metric unit 
weight consistent with unit size.
    (ii) For each controlled substance in the process of manufacture on 
the inventory date, the inventory shall include:
    (A) The name of the substance;
    (B) The quantity of the substance in each batch and/or stage of 
manufacture, identified by the batch number or other appropriate 
identifying number; and
    (C) The physical form which the substance is to take upon completion 
of the manufacturing process (e.g., granulations, tablets, capsules, or 
solutions), identified by the batch number or other appropriate 
identifying number, and if possible the finished form of the substance 
(e.g., 10-milligram tablet or 10-milligram concentration per fluid ounce 
or milliliter) and the number or volume thereof.
    (iii) For each controlled substance in finished form the inventory 
shall include:
    (A) The name of the substance;
    (B) Each finished form of the substance (e.g., 10-milligram tablet 
or 10-milligram concentration per fluid ounce or milliliter);
    (C) The number of units or volume of each finished form in each 
commercial container (e.g., 100-tablet bottle or 3-milliliter vial); and
    (D) The number of commercial containers of each such finished form 
(e.g. four 100-tablet bottles or six 3-milliliter vials).

distributors. Each person registered or authorized to dispense, conduct 
research, or act as a reverse distributor with controlled substances 
shall include in the inventory the same information required of 
manufacturers pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this 
section. In determining the number of units of each finished form of a 
controlled substance in a commercial container which has been opened, 
the dispenser, researcher, or reverse distributor shall do as follows:
    (i) If the substance is listed in Schedule I or II, make an exact 
count or measure of the contents, or
    (ii) If the substance is listed in Schedule III, IV or V, make an 
estimated count or measure of the contents, unless the container holds 
more than 1,000 tablets or capsules in which case he/she must make an 
exact count of the contents.
    (4) Inventories of importers and exporters. Each person registered 
or authorized to import or export controlled substances shall include in 
the inventory the same information required of manufacturers pursuant to 
paragraphs (e)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section. Each such person who 
is also registered as a manufacturer or as a distributor shall include 
in his/her inventory as an importer or exporter only those stocks of 
controlled substances that are actually separated from his stocks as a 
manufacturer or as a distributor (e.g., in transit or in storage for 
shipment).
    (5) Inventories of chemical analysts. Each person registered or 
authorized to conduct chemical analysis with controlled substances shall 
include in his inventory the same information required of manufacturers 
pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section as to 
substances which have been manufactured, imported, or received by such 
person. If less than 1 kilogram of any controlled substance (other than 
a hallucinogenic controlled substance listed in Schedule I), or less 
than 20 grams of a hallucinogenic substance listed in Schedule I (other 
than lysergic acid diethylamide), or less than 0.5 gram of lysergic acid 
diethylamide, is on hand at the time of inventory, that substance need 
not be included in the inventory. Laboratories of the Administration may 
possess up to 150 grams of any hallucinogenic substance in Schedule I 
without regard to a need for an inventory of those substances. No 
inventory is required of known or suspected controlled substances 
received as evidentiary materials for analysis.

altered or changed by the registrant; any errors must be corrected by 
the Registration Section of the Administration by returning the forms 
with notification of the error.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.12  Procedure for executing DEA Forms 222.

    (a) A purchaser must prepare and execute a DEA Form 222

the space provided. DEA Forms 222 for carfentanil, etorphine 
hydrochloride, and diprenorphine must contain only these substances.

<R05>
Sec. 1305.14  Procedure for endorsing DEA Forms 222.

    (a) A DEA Form 222, made out to any supplier who cannot fill all or 
a part of the order within the time limitation set forth in Sec. 
1305.13, may be endorsed to another supplier for filling. The 
endorsement must be made only by the supplier to whom the DEA Form 222 
was first made, must state (in the spaces provided on the reverse sides 
of Copies 1 and 2 of the DEA Form 222) the name and address of the 
second supplier, and must be signed by a person authorized to obtain and 
execute DEA Forms 222 on behalf of the first supplier. The first 
supplier may not fill any part of an order on an endorsed form. The 
second supplier may fill the order, if possible and if the supplier 
desires to do so, in accordance with Sec. 1305.13(b), (c), and (d), 
including shipping all substances directly to the purchaser.
    (b) Distributions made on endorsed DEA Forms 222 must be reported by 
the second supplier in the same manner as all other distributions except 
that where the name of the supplier is requested on the reporting form, 
the second supplier must record the name, address, and registration 
number of the first supplier.

<R05>
Sec. 1305.15  Unaccepted and defective DEA Forms 222.

    (a) A DEA Form 222 must not be filled if either of the following 
apply:
    (1) The order is not complete, legible, or properly prepared, 
executed, or endorsed.
    (2) The order shows any alteration, erasure, or change of any 
description.
    (b) If a DEA Form 222 cannot be filled for any reason under this 
section, the supplier must return Copies 1 and 2 to the purchaser with a 
statement as to the reason (e.g., illegible or altered).
    (c) A supplier may for any reason refuse to accept any order and if 
a supplier refuses to accept the order, a statement that the order is 
not accepted is sufficient for purposes of this paragraph.
    (d) When a purchaser receives an unaccepted order, Copies 1 and 2 of 
the DEA Form 222 and the statement must be attached to Copy 3 and 
retained in the files of the purchaser in accordance with Sec. 1305.17. 
A defective DEA Form 222 may not be corrected; it must be replaced by a 
new DEA Form 222 for the order to be filled.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.16  Lost and stolen DEA Forms 222.

    (a) If a purchaser ascertains that an unfilled DEA Form 222 has been 
lost, he or she must execute another in triplicate and attach a 
statement containing the serial number and date of the lost form, and 
stating that the goods covered by the first DEA Form 222 were not 
received through loss of that DEA Form 222. Copy 3 of the second form 
and a copy of the statement must be retained with Copy 3 of the DEA Form 
222 first executed. A copy of the statement must be attached to Copies 1 
and 2 of the second DEA Form 222 sent to the supplier. If the first DEA 
Form 222 is subsequently received by the supplier to whom it was 
directed, the supplier must mark upon the face ``Not accepted'' and 
return Copies 1 and 2 to the purchaser, who must attach it to Copy 3 and 
the statement.
    (b) Whenever any used or unused DEA Forms 222 are stolen or lost 
(other than in the course of transmission) by any purchaser or supplier, 
the purchaser or supplier must immediately upon discovery of the theft 
or loss, report the theft or loss to the Special Agent in Charge of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration in the Divisional Office responsible for 
the area in which the registrant is located, stating the serial number 
of each form stolen or lost.
    (c) If the theft or loss includes any original DEA Forms 222 
received from purchasers and the supplier is unable to state the serial 
numbers of the DEA Forms 222, the supplier must report the date or 
approximate date of receipt and the names and addresses of the 
purchasers.
    (d) If an entire book of DEA Forms 222 is lost or stolen, and the 
purchaser is unable to state the serial numbers of the DEA Forms 222 in 
the book, the purchaser must report, in lieu of the numbers of the forms 
contained in the book, the date or approximate date of issuance.
    (e) If any unused DEA Form 222 reported stolen or lost is 
subsequently recovered or found, the Special Agent in Charge of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration in the Divisional Office responsible for the 
area in which the registrant is located must immediately be notified.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.17  Preservation of DEA Forms 222.

attached.
    (b) The supplier must retain Copy 1 of each DEA Form 222 that it has 
filled.
    (c) DEA Forms 222 must be maintained separately from all other 
records of the registrant. DEA Forms 222 are required to be kept 
available for inspection for a period of two years. If a purchaser has 
several registered locations, the purchaser must retain Copy 3 of the 
executed DEA Form 222 and any attached statements or other related 
documents (not including unexecuted DEA Forms 222, which may be kept 
elsewhere under Sec. 1305.12(e)), at the registered location printed on 
the DEA Form 222.
    (d) The supplier of carfentanil, etorphine hydrochloride, and 
diprenorphine must maintain DEA Forms 222 for these substances 
separately from all other DEA Forms 222 and records required to be 
maintained by the registrant.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.18  Return of unused DEA Forms 222.

    If the registration of any purchaser terminates (because the 
purchaser dies, ceases legal existence, discontinues business or 
professional practice, or changes the name or address as shown on the 
purchaser's registration) or is suspended or revoked under Sec. 1301.36 
of this chapter for all Schedule I and II controlled substances for 
which the purchaser is registered, the purchaser must return all unused 
DEA Forms 222 to the nearest office of the Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.19  Cancellation and voiding of DEA Forms 222.

    (a) A purchaser may cancel part or all of an order on a DEA Form 222 
by notifying the supplier in writing of the cancellation. The supplier 
must indicate the cancellation on Copies 1 and 2 of the DEA Form 222 by 
drawing a line through the canceled items and printing ``canceled'' in 
the space provided for number of items shipped.
    (b) A supplier may void part or all of an order on a DEA Form 222 by 
notifying the

[[Page 77]]

purchaser in writing of the voiding. The supplier must indicate the 
voiding in the manner prescribed for cancellation in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

Sec. 1305.22  Procedure for filling electronic orders.

    (a) A purchaser must submit the order to a specific supplier. The 
supplier may initially process the order (e.g., entry of the order into 
the computer system, billing functions, inventory identification, etc.) 
centrally at any location, regardless of the location's registration 
with DEA. Following centralized processing, the supplier may distribute 
the order to one or more registered locations maintained by the supplier 
for filling. The registrant must maintain control of the processing of 
the order at all times.
    (b) A supplier may fill the order for a Schedule I or II controlled 
substance, if possible and if the supplier desires to do so and is 
authorized to do so under Sec. 1305.06.
    (c) A supplier must do the following before filling the order:
    (1) Verify the integrity of the signature and the order by using 
software that complies with Part 1311 of this chapter to validate the 
order.
    (2) Verify that the digital certificate has not expired.
    (3) Check the validity of the certificate holder's certificate by 
checking the Certificate Revocation List. The supplier may cache the 
Certificate Revocation List until it expires.
    (4) Verify the registrant's eligibility to order the controlled 
substances by checking the certificate extension data.
    (d) The supplier must retain an electronic record of every order, 
and, linked to each order, a record of the number of commercial or bulk 
containers furnished on each item and the date on which the supplier 
shipped the containers to the purchaser. The linked record must also 
include any data on the original order that the supplier completes. 
Software used to handle digitally signed orders must comply with part 
1311 of this chapter.
    (e) If an order cannot be filled in its entirety, a supplier may 
fill it in part and supply the balance by additional shipments within 60 
days following the date of the order. No order is valid more than 60 
days after its execution by the purchaser, except as specified in 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (f) A supplier must ship the controlled substances to the registered 
location associated with the digital certificate used to sign the order, 
except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g) When a purchaser receives a shipment, the purchaser must create 
a record of the quantity of each item received and the date received. 
The record must be electronically linked to the original order and 
archived.
    (h) Registered procurement officers of the Defense Supply Center of 
the Defense Logistics Agency may order controlled substances for 
delivery to armed services establishments within the United States. 
These orders may be shipped to locations other than the registered 
location, and in partial shipments at different times not to exceed six 
months from the date of the order, as designated by the procurement 
officer when submitting the order.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.23  Endorsing electronic orders.

    A supplier may not endorse an electronic order to another supplier 
to fill.

Sec. 1305.24  Central processing of orders.

    (a) A supplier that has one or more registered locations and

stored may have one or more of the supplier's registered locations fill 
an electronic order if the supplier does the following:
    (1) Assigns each item on the order to a specific registered location 
for filling.

[[Page 78]]

    (2) Creates a record linked to the central file noting both which 
items a location filled and the location identity.
    (3) Ensures that no item is filled by more than one location.
    (4) Maintains the original order with all linked records on the 
central computer system.
    (b) A company that has central processing of orders must assign 
responsibility for filling parts of orders only to registered locations 
that the company owns and operates.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.25  Unaccepted and defective electronic orders.

    (a) No electronic order may be filled if:
    (1) The required data fields have not been completed.
    (2) The order is not signed using a digital certificate issued by 
DEA.
    (3) The digital certificate used had expired or had been revoked 
prior to signature.
    (4) The purchaser's public key will not validate the digital 
signature.
    (5) The validation of the order shows that the order is invalid for 
any reason.
    (b) If an order cannot be filled for any reason under this section, 
the supplier must notify the purchaser and provide a statement as to the 
reason (e.g., improperly prepared or altered). A supplier may, for any 
reason, refuse to accept any order, and if a supplier refuses to accept 
the order, a statement that the order is not accepted is sufficient for 
purposes of this paragraph.
    (c) When a purchaser receives an unaccepted electronic order from 
the supplier, the purchaser must electronically link the statement of 
nonacceptance to the original order. The original order and the 
statement must be retained in accordance with Sec. 1305.27.

order; the purchaser must issue a new order for the order to be filled.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.26  Lost electronic orders.

    (a) If a purchaser determines that an unfilled electronic order has 
been lost before or after receipt, the purchaser must provide, to the 
supplier, a signed statement containing the unique tracking number and 
date of the lost order and stating that the goods covered by the first 
order were not received through loss of that order.
    (b) If the purchaser executes an order to replace the lost order, 
the purchaser must electronically link an electronic record of the 
second order and a copy of the statement with the record of the first 
order and retain them.
    (c) If the supplier to whom the order was directed subsequently 
receives the first order, the supplier must indicate that it is ``Not 
Accepted'' and return it to the purchaser. The purchaser must link the 
returned order to the record of that order and the statement.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.27  Preservation of electronic orders.

    (a) A purchaser must, for each order filled, retain the original 
signed order and all linked records for that order for two years. The 
purchaser must also retain all copies of each unaccepted or defective 
order and each linked statement.
    (b) A supplier must retain each original order filled and the linked 
records for two years.
    (c) If electronic order records are maintained on a central server, 
the records must be readily retrievable at the registered location.

Sec. 1305.28  Canceling and voiding electronic orders.

    (a) A supplier may void all or part of an electronic order by 
notifying the purchaser of the voiding. If the entire order is voided, 
the supplier must make an electronic copy of the order, indicate on the 
copy ``Void,'' and return it to the purchaser. The supplier is not 
required to retain a record of orders that are not filled.
    (b) The purchaser must retain an electronic copy of the voided 
order.

linked record that nothing was shipped for each item voided.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.29  Reporting to DEA.

                           General Information


<R05>
Sec. 1306.01  Scope of part 1306.

    Rules governing the issuance, filling and filing of prescriptions 
pursuant to section 309 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 829) are set forth 
generally in that section and specifically by the sections of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1306.02  Definitions.

    Any term contained in this part shall have the definition set forth 
in section 102 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 802) or part 1300 of this chapter.

[62 FR 13964, Mar. 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1306.03  Persons entitled to issue prescriptions.

    (a) A prescription for a controlled substance may be issued only by 
an individual practitioner who is:
    (1) Authorized to prescribe controlled substances by the 
jurisdiction in which he is licensed to practice his profession and
    (2) Either registered or exempted from registration pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 1301.22(c) and 1301.23 of this chapter.
    (b) A prescription issued by an individual practitioner may be 
communicated to a pharmacist by an employee or agent of the individual 
practitioner.

[36 FR 7799, Apr. 24, 1971, as amended at 36 FR 18732, Sept. 21, 1971. 
Redesignated at 38 FR 26609, Sept. 24, 1973, as amended at 62 FR 13966, 
Mar. 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1306.04  Purpose of issue of prescription.

    (a) A prescription for a controlled substance to be effective must 
be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner 
acting in the usual course of his professional practice. The 
responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled 
substances is upon the prescribing practitioner, but a corresponding 
responsibility rests with the pharmacist who fills the prescription. An 
order purporting to be a prescription issued not in the usual course of 
professional treatment or in legitimate and authorized research is not a 
prescription within the meaning and intent of section 309 of the Act (21 
U.S.C. 829) and the person knowingly filling such a purported 
prescription, as well as the person issuing it, shall be subject to the 
penalties provided for violations of the provisions of law relating to 
controlled substances.
    (b) A prescription may not be issued in order for an individual 
practitioner to obtain controlled substances for supplying the 
individual practitioner for the purpose of general dispensing to 
patients.
    (c) A prescription may not be issued for the dispensing of narcotic 
drugs listed in any schedule for ``detoxification treatment'' or 
``maintenance treatment'' as defined in Section 102 of the Act (21 
U.S.C. 802).

[36 FR 7799, Apr. 24, 1971. Redesignated at 38 FR 26609, Sept. 24, 1973, 
and amended at 39 FR 37986, Oct. 25, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 1306.05  Manner of issuance of prescriptions.

    (a) All prescriptions for controlled substances shall be dated as 
of, and signed on, the day when issued and shall bear the full name and 
address of the patient, the drug name, strength, dosage form, quantity 
prescribed, directions for use and the name, address and registration 
number of the practitioner. Where a prescription is for gamma-
hydroxybutyric acid, the practitioner shall note on the face of the 
prescription the medical need of the patient for the prescription. A 
practitioner may sign a prescription in the same manner as he would sign 
a check or legal document (e.g., J.H. Smith or

[[Page 80]]

John H. Smith). Where an oral order is not permitted, prescriptions 
shall be written with ink or indelible pencil or typewriter and shall be 
manually signed by the practitioner. The prescriptions may be prepared 
by the secretary or agent for the signature of a practitioner, but the 
prescribing practitioner is responsible in case the prescription does 
not conform in all essential respects to the law and regulations. A 
corresponding liability rests upon the pharmacist, including a 
pharmacist employed by a central fill pharmacy, who fills a prescription 
not prepared in the form prescribed by DEA regulations.
    (b) An individual practitioner exempted from registration under 
Sec. 1301.22(c) of this chapter shall include on all prescriptions 
issued by him or her the registration number of the hospital or other 
institution and the special internal code number assigned to him or her 
by the hospital or other institution as provided in Sec. 1301.22(c) of 
this chapter, in lieu of the registration number of the practitioner 
required by this section. Each written prescription shall have the name 
of the physician stamped, typed, or handprinted on it, as well as the 
signature of the physician.
    (c) An official exempted from registration under Sec. 1301.22(c) 
shall include on all prescriptions issued by him his branch of service 
or agency (e.g., ``U.S. Army'' or ``Public Health Service'') and his 
service identification number, in lieu of the registration number of the 
practitioner required by this section. The service identification number 
for a Public Health Service employee is his Social Security 
identification number. Each prescription shall have the name of the 
officer stamped, typed, or handprinted on it, as well as the signature 
of the officer.

<R05>
Sec. 1306.06  Persons entitled to fill prescriptions.

    A prescription for a controlled substance may only be filled by a 
pharmacist, acting in the usual course of his professional practice and 
either registered individually or employed in a registered pharmacy, a 
registered central fill pharmacy, or registered institutional 
practitioner.

[68 FR 37410, June 24, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1306.07  Administering or dispensing of narcotic drugs.

    (a) The administering or dispensing directly (but not prescribing) 
of narcotic drugs listed in any schedule to a narcotic drug dependent 
person for ``detoxification treatment'' or ``maintenance treatment'' as 
defined in section 102 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 802) shall be deemed to be 
within the meaning of the term ``in the course of his professional 
practice or research'' in section 308(e) and section 102(20) of the Act 
(21 U.S.C. 828 (e)): Provided, That the practitioner is separately 
registered with the Attorney General as required by section 303(g) of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 823(g)) and then thereafter complies with the 
regulatory standards imposed relative to treatment qualification, 
security, records and unsupervised use of drugs pursuant to such Act.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a physician who is not 
specifically registered to conduct a narcotic treatment program from 
administering (but not prescribing) narcotic drugs to a person for the 
purpose of relieving acute withdrawal symptoms when necessary while 
arrangements are being made for referral for treatment. Not more than 
one day's medication may be administered to the person or for the 
person's use at one time. Such emergency treatment may be carried out 
for not more than three days and may not be renewed or extended.
    (c) This section is not intended to impose any limitations on a 
physician or authorized hospital staff to administer or dispense 
narcotic drugs in a hospital to maintain or detoxify a person as an 
incidental adjunct to medical or surgical treatment of conditions other 
than addiction, or to administer or dispense narcotic drugs to persons 
with intractable pain in which no relief or cure is possible or none has 
been found after reasonable efforts.

               Controlled Substances Listed in Schedule II


<R05>
Sec. 1306.11  Requirement of prescription.

    (a) A pharmacist may dispense directly a controlled substance listed 
in Schedule II, which is a prescription drug as determined under the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, only pursuant to a written 
prescription signed by the practitioner, except as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section. A prescription for a Schedule II controlled 
substance may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's 
agent to a pharmacy via facsimile equipment, provided that the original 
written, signed prescription is presented to the pharmacist for review 
prior to the actual dispensing of the controlled substance, except as 
noted in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section. The original 
prescription shall be maintained in accordance with Sec. 1304.04(h) of 
this chapter.
    (b) An individual practitioner may administer or dispense directly a 
controlled substance listed in Schedule II in the course of his 
professional practice without a prescription, subject to Sec. 1306.07.
    (c) An institutional practitioner may administer or dispense 
directly (but not prescribe) a controlled substance listed in Schedule 
II only pursuant to a written prescription signed by the prescribing 
individual practitioner or to an order for medication made by an 
individual practitioner which is dispensed for immediate administration 
to the ultimate user.
    (d) In the case of an emergency situation, as defined by the 
Secretary in Sec. 290.10 of this title, a pharmacist may dispense a 
controlled substance listed in Schedule II upon receiving oral 
authorization of a prescribing individual practitioner, provided that:
    (1) The quantity prescribed and dispensed is limited to the amount 
adequate to treat the patient during the emergency period (dispensing 
beyond the emergency period must be pursuant to a written prescription 
signed by the prescribing individual practitioner);
    (2) The prescription shall be immediately reduced to writing by the 
pharmacist and shall contain all information required in Sec. 1306.05, 
except for the signature of the prescribing individual practitioner;
    (3) If the prescribing individual practitioner is not known to the 
pharmacist, he must make a reasonable effort to determine that the oral 
authorization came from a registered individual practitioner, which may 
include a callback to the prescribing individual practitioner using his 
phone number as listed in the telephone directory and/or other good 
faith efforts to insure his identity; and
    (4) Within 7 days after authorizing an emergency oral prescription, 
the prescribing individual practitioner shall cause a written 
prescription for the emergency quantity prescribed to be delivered to 
the dispensing pharmacist. In addition to conforming to the requirements 
of Sec. 1306.05, the prescription shall have written on its face 
``Authorization for Emergency Dispensing,'' and the date of the oral 
order. The written prescription may be delivered to the pharmacist in 
person or by mail, but if delivered by mail it must be postmarked within 
the 7 day period. Upon receipt, the dispensing pharmacist shall attach 
this prescription to the oral emergency prescription which had earlier 
been reduced to writing. The pharmacist shall notify the nearest office 
of the Administration if the prescribing individual practitioner fails 
to deliver a written prescription to him; failure of the pharmacist to 
do so shall void the authority conferred by this paragraph to dispense 
without a written prescription of a prescribing individual practitioner.
    (5) Central fill pharmacies shall not be authorized under this 
paragraph to prepare prescriptions for a controlled substance listed in 
Schedule II upon receiving an oral authorization from a retail 
pharmacist or an individual practitioner.
    (e) A prescription prepared in accordance with Sec. 1306.05 written 
for a Schedule II narcotic substance to be compounded for the direct 
administration to a patient by parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, 
subcutaneous or intraspinal infusion may be transmitted by the 
practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the pharmacy by facsimile. 
The facsimile serves as the

[[Page 82]]

original written prescription for purposes of this paragraph (e) and it 
shall be maintained in accordance with Sec. 1304.04(h) of this chapter.
    (f) A prescription prepared in accordance with Sec. 1306.05 written 
for Schedule II substance for a resident of a Long Term Care Facility 
may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to 
the dispensing pharmacy by facsimile. The facsimile serves as the 
original written prescription for purposes of this paragraph (f) and it 
shall be maintained in accordance with Sec. 1304.04(h).
    (g) A prescription prepared in accordance with Sec. 1306.05 written 
for a Schedule II narcotic substance for a patient enrolled in a hospice 
care program certified and/or paid for by Medicare under Title XVIII or 
a hospice program which is licensed by the state may be transmitted by 
the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the dispensing pharmacy 
by facsimile. The practitioner or the practitioner's agent will note on 
the prescription that the patient is a hospice patient. The facsimile 
serves as the original written prescription for purposes of this 
paragraph (g) and it shall be maintained in accordance with Sec. 
1304.04(h).

Sec. 1306.12  Refilling prescriptions.

    The refilling of a prescription for a controlled substance listed in 
Schedule II is prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 1306.13  Partial filling of prescriptions.

    (a) The partial filling of a prescription for a controlled substance 
listed in Schedule II is permissible, if the pharmacist is unable to 
supply the full quantity called for in a written or emergency oral 
prescription and he makes a notation of the quantity supplied on the 
face of the written prescription (or written record of the emergency 
oral prescription). The remaining portion of the prescription may be 
filled within 72 hours of the first partial filling; however, if the 
remaining portion is not or cannot be filled within the 72-hour period, 
the pharmacist shall so notify the prescribing individual practitioner. 
No further quantity may be supplied beyond 72 hours without a new 
prescription.
    (b) A prescription for a Schedule II controlled substance written 
for a patient in a Long Term Care Facility (LTCF) or for a patient with 
a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness may be filled in 
partial quantities to include individual dosage units. If there is any 
question whether a patient may be classified as having a terminal 
illness, the pharmacist must contact the practitioner prior to partially 
filling the prescription. Both the pharmacist and the prescribing 
practitioner have a corresponding responsibility to assure that the 
controlled substance is for a terminally ill patient. The pharmacist 
must record on the prescription whether the patient is ``terminally 
ill'' or an ``LTCF patient.'' A prescription that is partially filled 
and does not contain the notation ``terminally ill'' or ``LTCF patient'' 
shall be deemed to have been filled in violation of the Act. For each 
partial filling, the dispensing pharmacist shall record on the back of 
the prescription (or on another appropriate record, uniformly 
maintained, and readily retrievable) the date of the partial filling, 
quantity dispensed, remaining quantity authorized to be dispensed, and 
the identification of the dispensing pharmacist. The total quantity of 
Schedule II controlled substances dispensed in all partial fillings must 
not exceed the total quantity prescribed. Schedule II prescriptions for 
patients in a LTCF or patients with a medical diagnosis documenting a 
terminal illness shall be valid for a period not to exceed 60 days from 
the issue date unless sooner terminated by the discontinuance of 
medication.
    (c) Information pertaining to current Schedule II prescriptions for 
patients in a LTCF or for patients with a medical diagnosis documenting 
a terminal illness may be maintained in a computerized system if this 
system has the capability to permit:
    (1) Output (display or printout) of the original prescription 
number, date of

[[Page 83]]

issue, identification of prescribing individual practitioner, 
identification of patient, address of the LTCF or address of the 
hospital or residence of the patient, identification of medication 
authorized (to include dosage, form, strength and quantity), listing of 
the partial fillings that have been dispensed under each prescription 
and the information required in Sec. 1306.13(b).
    (2) Immediate (real time) updating of the prescription record each 
time a partial filling of the prescription is conducted.
    (3) Retrieval of partially filled Schedule II prescription 
information is the same as required by Sec. 1306.22(b) (4) and (5) for 
Schedule III and IV prescription refill information.

Sec. 1306.14  Labeling of substances and filling of prescriptions.

    (a) The pharmacist filling a written or emergency oral prescription 
for a controlled substance listed in Schedule II shall affix to the 
package a label showing date of filling, the pharmacy name and address, 
the serial number of the prescription, the name of the patient, the name 
of the prescribing practitioner, and directions for use and cautionary 
statements, if any, contained in such prescription or required by law.
    (b) If the prescription is filled at a central fill pharmacy, the 
central fill pharmacy shall affix to the package a label showing the 
retail pharmacy name and address and a unique identifier, (i.e. the 
central fill pharmacy's DEA registration number) indicating that the 
prescription was filled at the central fill pharmacy, in addition to the 
information required under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply 
when a controlled substance listed in Schedule II is prescribed for 
administration to an ultimate user who is institutionalized: Provided, 
That:
    (1) Not more than 7-day supply of the controlled substance listed in 
Schedule II is dispensed at one time;
    (2) The controlled substance listed in Schedule II is not in the 
possession of the ultimate user prior to the administration;
    (3) The institution maintains appropriate safeguards and records 
regarding the proper administration, control, dispensing, and storage of 
the controlled substance listed in Schedule II; and
    (4) The system employed by the pharmacist in filling a prescription 
is adequate to identify the supplier, the product, and the patient, and 
to set forth the directions for use and cautionary statements, if any, 
contained in the prescription or required by law.
    (d) All written prescriptions and written records of emergency oral 
prescriptions shall be kept in accordance with requirements of Sec. 
1304.04(h) of this chapter.

    Prescription information may be provided to an authorized central 
fill pharmacy by a retail pharmacy for dispensing purposes. The 
following requirements shall also apply:
    (a) Prescriptions for controlled substances listed in Schedule II 
may be transmitted electronically from a retail pharmacy to a central 
fill pharmacy including via facsimile. The retail pharmacy transmitting 
the prescription information must:
    (1) Write the word ``CENTRAL FILL'' on the face of the original 
prescription and record the name, address, and DEA registration number 
of the central fill pharmacy to which the prescription has been 
transmitted and, the name of the retail pharmacy pharmacist transmitting 
the prescription, and the date of transmittal;
    (2) Ensure that all information required to be on a prescription 
pursuant to Section 1306.05 of this part is transmitted to the central 
fill pharmacy (either on the face of the prescription or in the 
electronic transmission of information);

[[Page 84]]

    (3) Maintain the original prescription for a period of two years 
from the date the prescription was filled;
    (4) Keep a record of receipt of the filled prescription, including 
the date of receipt, the method of delivery (private, common or contract 
carrier) and the name of the retail pharmacy employee accepting 
delivery.
    (b) The central fill pharmacy receiving the transmitted prescription 
must:
    (1) Keep a copy of the prescription (if sent via facsimile) or an 
electronic record of all the information transmitted by the retail 
pharmacy, including the name, address, and DEA registration number of 
the retail pharmacy transmitting the prescription;
    (2) Keep a record of the date of receipt of the transmitted 
prescription, the name of the pharmacist filling the prescription, and 
the date of filling of the prescription;
    (3) Keep a record of the date the filled prescription was delivered 
to the retail pharmacy and the method of delivery (i.e. private, common 
or contract carrier).

        Controlled Substances Listed in Schedules III, IV, and V


<R05>
Sec. 1306.21  Requirement of prescription.

    (a) A pharmacist may dispense directly a controlled substance listed 
in Schedule III, IV, or V which is a prescription drug as determined 
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, only pursuant to either 
a written prescription signed by a practitioner or a facsimile of a 
written, signed prescription transmitted by the practitioner or the 
practitioner's agent to the pharmacy or pursuant to an oral prescription 
made by an individual practitioner and promptly reduced to writing by 
the pharmacist containing all information required in Sec. 1306.05, 
except for the signature of the practitioner.
    (b) An individual practitioner may administer or dispense directly a 
controlled substance listed in Schedule III, IV, or V in the course of 
his/her professional practice without a prescription, subject to Sec. 
1306.07.
    (c) An institutional practitioner may administer or dispense 
directly (but not prescribe) a controlled substance listed in Schedule 
III, IV, or V only pursuant to a written prescription signed by an 
individual practitioner, or pursuant to a facsimile of a written 
prescription or order for medication transmitted by the practitioner or 
the practitioner's agent to the institutional practitioner-pharmacist, 
or pursuant to an oral prescription made by an individual practitioner 
and promptly reduced to writing by the pharmacist (containing all 
information required in Section 1306.05 except for the signature of the

administration to the ultimate user, subject to Sec. 1306.07.

[62 FR 13965, Mar. 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1306.22  Refilling of prescriptions.

    (a) No prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule 
III or IV shall be filled or refilled more than six months after the 
date on which such prescription was issued and no such prescription 
authorized to be refilled may be refilled more than five times. Each 
refilling of a prescription shall be entered on the back of the 
prescription or on another appropriate document. If entered on another 
document, such as a medication record, the document must be uniformly 
maintained and readily retrievable. The following information must be 
retrievable by the prescription number consisting of the name and dosage 
form of the controlled substance, the date filled or refilled, the 
quantity dispensed, initials of the dispensing pharmacist for each 
refill, and the total number of refills for that prescription. If the 
pharmacist merely initials and dates the back of the prescription it 
shall be deemed that the full face amount of the prescription has been 
dispensed. The prescribing practitioner may authorize additional refills 
of Schedule III or IV controlled substances on the original prescription 
through an oral refill authorization transmitted to the pharmacist 
provided the following conditions are met:
    (1) The total quantity authorized, including the amount of the 
original prescription, does not exceed five refills nor extend beyond 
six months from the

[[Page 85]]

date of issue of the original prescription.
    (2) The pharmacist obtaining the oral authorization records on the 
reverse of the original prescription the date, quantity of refill, 
number of additional refills authorized, and initials the prescription 
showing who received the authorization from the prescribing practitioner 
who issued the original prescription.
    (3) The quantity of each additional refill authorized is equal to or 
less than the quantity authorized for the initial filling of the 
original prescription.
    (4) The prescribing practitioner must execute a new and separate 
prescription for any additional quantities beyond the five refill, six-
month limitation.
    (b) As an alternative to the procedures provided by subsection (a), 
an automated data processing system may be used for the storage and 
retrieval of refill information for prescription orders for controlled 
substances in Schedule III and IV, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Any such proposed computerized system must provide on-line 
retrieval (via CRT display or hard-copy printout) of original 
prescription order information for those prescription orders which are 
currently authorized for refilling. This shall include, but is not 
limited to, data such as the original prescription number, date of 
issuance of the original prescription order by the practitioner, full 
name and address of the patient, name, address, and DEA registration 
number of the practitioner, and the name, strength, dosage form, 
quantity of the controlled substance prescribed (and quantity dispensed 
if different from the quantity prescribed), and the total number of 
refills authorized by the prescribing practitioner.
    (2) Any such proposed computerized system must also provide on-line 
retrieval (via CRT display or hard-copy printout) of the current refill 
history for Schedule III or IV controlled substance prescription orders 
(those authorized for refill during the past six months.) This refill 
history shall include, but is not limited to, the name of the controlled 
substance, the date of refill, the quantity dispensed, the 
identification code, or name or initials of the dispensing pharmacist 
for each refill and the total number of refills dispensed to date for 
that prescription order.
    (3) Documentation of the fact that the refill information entered 
into the computer each time a pharmacist refills an original 
prescription order for a Schedule III or IV controlled substance is 
correct must be provided by the individual pharmacist who makes use of 
such a system. If such a system provides a hard-copy printout of each 
day's controlled substance prescription order refill data, that printout 
shall be verified, dated, and signed by the individual pharmacist who 
refilled such a prescription order. The individual pharmacist must 
verify that the data indicated is correct and then sign this document in 
the same manner as he would sign a check or legal document (e.g., J. H. 
Smith, or John H. Smith). This document shall be maintained in a 
separate file at that pharmacy for a period of two years from the 
dispensing date. This printout of the day's controlled substance 
prescription order refill data must be provided to each pharmacy using 
such a computerized system within 72 hours of the date on which the 
refill was dispensed. It must be verified and signed by each pharmacist 
who is involved with such dispensing. In lieu of such a printout, the 
pharmacy shall maintain a bound log book, or separate file, in which 
each individual pharmacist involved in such dispensing shall sign a 
statement (in the manner previously described) each day, attesting to 
the fact that the refill information entered into the computer that day 
has been reviewed by him and is correct as shown. Such a book or file 
must be maintained at the pharmacy employing such a system for a period 
of two years after the date of dispensing the appropriately authorized 
refill.
    (4) Any such computerized system shall have the capability of 
producing a printout of any refill data which the user pharmacy is 
responsible for maintaining under the Act and its implementing 
regulations. For example, this would include a refill-by-refill audit 
trail for any specified strength and dosage form of any controlled 
substance

[[Page 86]]

(by either brand or generic name or both). Such a printout must include 
name of the prescribing practitioner, name and address of the patient, 
quantity dispensed on each refill, date of dispensing for each refill, 
name or identification code of the dispensing pharmacist, and the number 
of the original prescription order. In any computerized system employed 
by a user pharmacy the central recordkeeping location must be capable of 
sending the printout to the pharmacy within 48 hours, and if a DEA 
Special Agent or Diversion Investigator requests a copy of such printout 
from the user pharmacy, it must, if requested to do so by the Agent or 
Investigator, verify the printout transmittal capability of its system 
by documentation (e.g., postmark).
    (5) In the event that a pharmacy which employs such a computerized 
system experiences system down-time, the pharmacy must have an auxiliary 
procedure which will be used for documentation of refills os Schedule 
III and IV controlled substance prescription orders. This auxiliary 
procedure must insure that refills are authorized by the original 
prescription order, that the maximum number of refills has not been 
exceeded, and that all of the appropriate data is retained for on-line 
data entry as soon as the computer system is available for use again.
    (c) When filing refill information for original prescription orders 
for Schedule III or IV controlled substances, a pharmacy may use only 
one of the two systems described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this 
section.

                      Exempt Chemical Preparations


<R05>
Sec. 1308.23  Exemption of certain chemical preparations; application.

    (a) The Administrator may, by regulation, exempt from the 
application of all or any part of the Act any chemical preparation or 
mixture containing one or more controlled substances listed in any 
schedule, which preparation or mixture is intended for laboratory, 
industrial, educational, or special research purposes and not for 
general administration to a human being or other animal, if the 
preparation or mixture either:
    (1) Contains no narcotic controlled substance and is packaged in 
such a form or concentration that the packaged quantity does not present 
any significant potential for abuse (the type of packaging and the 
history of abuse of the same or similar preparations may be considered 
in determining the potential for abuse of the preparation or mixture); 
or
    (2) Contains either a narcotic or nonnarcotic controlled substance 
and one or more adulterating or denaturing agents in such a manner, 
combination, quantity, proportion, or concentration, that the 
preparation or mixture does not present any potential for abuse. If the 
preparation or mixture contains a narcotic controlled substance, the 
preparation or mixture must be formulated in such a manner that it 
incorporates methods of denaturing or other means so that the 
preparation or mixture is not liable to be abused or have ill effects, 
if abused, and so that the narcotic substance cannot in practice be 
removed.
    (b) Any person seeking to have any preparation or mixture containing 
a controlled substance and one or more noncontrolled substances exempted 
from the application of all or any part of the Act, pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, may apply to the Administrator, Drug 
Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20537.
    (c) An application for an exemption under this section shall contain 
the following information:
    (1) The name, address, and registration number, if any, of the 
applicant;
    (2) The name, address, and registration number, if any, of the 
manufacturer or importer of the preparation or mixture, if not the 
applicant;
    (3) The exact trade name or other designation of the preparation or 
mixture;
    (4) The complete qualitative and quantitative composition of the 
preparation or mixture (including all active and inactive ingredients 
and all controlled and noncontrolled substances);
    (5) The form of the immediate container in which the preparation or 
mixture will be distributed with sufficient descriptive detail to 
identify the preparation or mixture (e.g., bottle, packet, vial, soft 
plastic pillow, agar gel plate, etc.);
    (6) The dimensions or capacity of the immediate container of the 
preparation or mixture;

[[Page 101]]

    (7) The label and labeling, as defined in part 1300 of this chapter, 
of the immediate container and the commercial containers, if any, of the 
preparation or mixture;
    (8) A brief statement of the facts which the applicant believes 
justify the granting of an exemption under this paragraph, including 
information on the use to which the preparation or mixture will be put;
    (9) The date of the application; and
    (10) Which of the information submitted on the application, if any, 
is deemed by the applicant to be a trade secret or otherwise 
confidential and entitled to protection under subsection 402(a)(8) of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 842(a) (8)) or any other law restricting public 
disclosure of information.
    (d) The Administrator may require the applicant to submit such 
documents or written statements of fact relevant to the application as 
he deems necessary to determine whether the application should be 
granted.
    (e) Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of an 
application for an exemption under this section, the Administrator shall 
notify the applicant of his acceptance or nonacceptance of his 
application, and if not accepted, the reason therefor. The Administrator 
need not accept an application for filing if any of the requirements 
prescribed in paragraph (c) or requested pursuant to paragraph (d) is 
lacking or is not set forth as to be readily understood. If the 
applicant desires, he may amend the application to meet the requirements 
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. If the application is 
accepted for filing, the Administrator shall issue and publish in the 
Federal Register his order on the application, which shall include a 
reference to the legal authority under which the order is based. This 
order shall specify the date on which it shall take effect. The 
Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written 
comments on or objections to the order within 60 days of the date of 
publication of his order in the Federal Register. If any such comments 
or objections raise significant issues regarding any finding of fact or 
conclusion of law upon which the order is based, the Administrator shall 
immediately suspend the effectiveness of the order until he may 
reconsider the application in light of the comments and objections 
filed. Thereafter, the Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, or amend 
his original order as he determines appropriate.
    (f) The Administrator may at any time revoke or modify any exemption 
granted pursuant to this section by following the procedures set forth 
in paragraph (e) of this section for handling an application for an 
exemption which has been accepted for filing. The Administrator may also 
modify or revoke the criteria by which exemptions are granted (and 
thereby modify or revoke all preparations and mixtures granted under the 
old criteria) and modify the scope of exemptions at any time.

<R05>
Sec. 1308.24  Exempt chemical preparations.

    (a) The chemical preparations and mixtures approved pursuant to 
Sec. 1308.23 are exempt from application of sections 302, 303, 305, 
306, 307, 308, 309, 1002, 1003 and 1004 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 822-823, 
825-829, 952-954) and Sec. 1301.74 of this chapter, to the extent 
described in paragraphs (b) to (h) of this section. Substances set forth 
in paragraph (j) of this section shall be exempt from the application of 
sections 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 1002, 1003 and 1004 of the Act (21 
U.S.C. 825-829, 952-954) and Sec. Sec. 1301.71--1301.73 and 1301.74 
(a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) of this chapter to the extent as hereinafter 
may be provided.
    (b) Registration and security: Any person who manufactures an exempt 
chemical preparation or mixture must be registered under the Act and 
comply with all relevant security requirements regarding controlled 
substances being used in the manufacturing process until the preparation 
or mixture is in the form described in paragraph (i) of this section. 
Any other person who handles an exempt chemical preparation after it is 
in the form described in paragraph (i) of this section is not required 
to be registered under the Act to handle that preparation, and the 
preparation is not required to be stored

[[Page 102]]

in accordance with security requirements regarding controlled 
substances.
    (c) Labeling: In lieu of the requirements set forth in part 1302 of 
this chapter, the label and the labeling of an exempt chemical 
preparation must be prominently marked with its full trade name or other 
description and the name of the manufacturer or supplier as set forth in 
paragraph (i) of this section, in such a way that the product can be 
readily identified as an exempt chemical preparation. The label and 
labeling must also include in a prominent manner the statement ``For 
industrial use only'' or ``For chemical use only'' or ``For in vitro use 
only--not for human or animal use'' or ``Diagnostic reagent--for 
professional use only'' or a comparable statement warning the person 
reading it that human or animal use is not intended. The symbol 
designating the schedule of the controlled substance is not required on 
either the label or the labeling of the exempt chemical preparation, nor 
is it necessary to list all ingredients of the preparation.
    (d) Records and reports: Any person who manufactures an exempt 
chemical preparation or mixture must keep complete and accurate records 
and file all reports required under part 1304 of this chapter regarding 
all controlled substances being used in the manufacturing process until 
the preparation or mixture is in the form described in paragraph (i) of 
this section. In lieu of records and reports required under part 1304 of 
this chapter regarding exempt chemical preparations, the manufacturer 
need only record the name, address, and registration number, if any, of 
each person to whom the manufacturer distributes any exempt chemical 
preparation. Each importer or exporter of an exempt narcotic chemical 
preparation must submit a semiannual report of the total quantity of 
each substance imported or exported in each calendar half-year within 30 
days of the close of the period to the Drug and Chemical Evaluation 
Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, 
Washington, DC 20537. Any other person who handles an exempt chemical 
preparation after it is in the form described in paragraph (i) of this 
section is not required to maintain records or file reports.
    (e) Quotas, order forms, prescriptions, import, export, and 
transshipment requirements: Once an exempt chemical preparation is in 
the form described in paragraph (i) of this section, the requirements 
regarding quotas, order forms, prescriptions, import permits and 
declarations, export permit and declarations, and transshipment and 
intransit permits and declarations do not apply. These requirements do 
apply, however, to any controlled substances used in manufacturing the 
exempt chemical preparation before it is in the form described in 
paragraph (i) of this section.
    (f) Criminal penalties: No exemption granted pursuant to Sec. 
1308.23 affects the criminal liability for illegal manufacture, 
distribution, or possession of controlled substances contained in the 
exempt chemical preparation. Distribution, possession, and use of an 
exempt chemical preparation are lawful for registrants and 
nonregistrants only as long as such distribution, possession, or use is 
intended for laboratory, industrial, or educational purposes and not for 
immediate or subsequent administration to a human being or other animal.
    (g) Bulk materials: For materials exempted in bulk quantities, the 
Administrator may prescribe requirements other than those set forth in 
paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section on a case-by-case basis.
    (h) Changes in chemical preparations: Any change in the quantitative 
or qualitative composition of the preparation or mixture after the date 
of application, or change in the trade name or other designation of the 
preparation or mixture, set forth in paragraph (i) of this section, 
requires a new application for exemption.
    (i) A listing of exempt chemical preparations may be obtained by 
submitting a written request to the Drug and Chemical Evaluation 
Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537.
    (j) The following substances are designated as exempt chemical 
preparations for the purposes set forth in this section.

[[Page 103]]

    (1) Chloral. When packaged in a sealed, oxygen-free environment, 
under nitrogen pressure, safeguarded against exposure to the air.
    (2) Emit\R\ Phenobarbital Enzyme Reagent B. In one liter quantities 
each with a 5 ml. retention sample for repackaging as an exempt chemical 
preparation only.

derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the 
resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed 
of such plant which is incapable of germination] and
    (2) Not used, or intended for use, for human consumption, has been 
exempted by the Administrator from the application of the Act and this 
chapter.
    (b) As used in this section, the following terms shall have the

to Sec. 1308.23, the person claiming the exemption must present 
rigorous scientific evidence, including well-documented scientific

________________________________________________________________________
(Date)
Administrator, Drug Enforcement
Administration
Department of Justice,
Washington, DC 20537.
    Dear Sir: The undersigned ------------ hereby petitions the 
Administrator to initiate proceedings for the issuance (amendment or 
repeal) of a rule or regulation pursuant to section 201 of the 
Controlled Substances Act.
    Attached hereto and constituting a part of this petition are the 
following:
    (A) The proposed rule in the form proposed by the petitioner. (If 
the petitioner seeks the amendment or repeal of an existing rule, the 
existing rule, together with a reference to the section in the Code of 
Federal Regulations where it appears, should be included.)

[[Page 108]]

    (B) A statement of the grounds which the petitioner relies for the 
issuance (amendment or repeal) of the rule. (Such grounds shall include 
a reasonably concise statement of the facts relied upon by the 
petitioner, including a summary of any relevant medical or scientific 
evidence known to the petitioner.)
    All notices to be sent regarding this petition should be addressed 
to:

________________________________________________________________________

    Respectfully yours,

________________________________________________________________________

                        (Signature of petitioner)

    (c) Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of a 
petition, the Administrator shall notify the petitioner of his 
acceptance or nonacceptance of the petition, and if not accepted, the 
reason therefor. The Administrator need not accept a petition for filing 
if any of the requirements prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section 
is lacking or is not set forth so as to be readily understood. If the 
petitioner desires, he may amend the petition to meet the requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section. If accepted for filing, a petition may 
be denied by the Administrator within a reasonable period of time 
thereafter if he finds the grounds upon which the petitioner relies are 
not sufficient to justify the initiation of proceedings.
    (d) The Administrator shall, before initiating proceedings for the 
issuance, amendment, or repeal of any rule either to control a drug or 
other substance, or to transfer a drug or other substance from one 
schedule to another, or to remove a drug or other substance entirely 
from the schedules, and after gathering the necessary data, request from 
the Secretary a scientific and medical evaluation and the Secretary's 
recommendations as to whether such drug or other substance should be so 
controlled, transferred, or removed as a controlled substance. The 
recommendations of the Secretary to the Administrator shall be binding 
on the Administrator as to such scientific and medical matters, and if 
the Secretary recommends that a drug or other substance not be 
controlled, the Administrator shall not control that drug or other 
substance.
    (e) If the Administrator determines that the scientific and medical 
evaluation and recommendations of the Secretary and all other relevant 
data constitute substantial evidence of potential for abuse such as to 
warrant control or additional control over the drug or other substance, 
or substantial evidence that the drug or other substances should be 
subjected to lesser control or removed entirely from the schedules, he 
shall initiate proceedings for control, transfer, or removal as the case 
may be.
    (f) If and when the Administrator determines to initiate 
proceedings, he shall publish in the Federal Register general notice of 
any proposed rule making to issue, amend, or repeal any rule pursuant to 
section 201 of the Act. Such published notice shall include a statement 
of the time, place, and nature of any hearings on the proposal in the 
event a hearing is requested pursuant to Sec. 1308.44. Such hearings 
may not be commenced until after the expiration of at least 30 days from 
the date the general notice is published in the Federal Register. Such 
published notice shall also include a reference to the legal authority 
under which the rule is proposed, a statement of the proposed rule, and, 
in the discretion of the Administrator, a summary of the subjects and 
issues involved.
    (g) The Administrator may permit any interested persons to file 
written comments on or objections to the proposal and shall designate in 
the notice of proposed rule making the time during which such filings 
may be made.

publication of the notice of hearing in the Federal Register, file with 
the Administrator a written notice of his intention to participate in 
such hearing in the form prescribed in Sec. 1316.48 of this chapter. 
Any person filing a request for a hearing need not also file a notice of 
appearance; the request for a hearing shall be deemed to be a notice of 
appearance.
    (c) Any interested person may, within the period permitted for 
filing a request for a hearing, file with the Administrator a waiver of 
an opportunity for a hearing or to participate in a hearing, together 
with a written statement regarding his position on the matters of fact

be made a part of the record and shall be considered in light of the 
lack of opportunity for cross-examination in determining the weight to 
be attached to matters of fact asserted therein.
    (d) If any interested person fails to file a request for a hearing; 
or if he so files and fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed 
to have waived his opportunity for the hearing or to participate in the 
hearing, unless he shows good cause for such failure.
    (e) If all interested persons waive or are deemed to waive their 
opportunity for the hearing or to participate in the hearing, the 
Administrator may cancel the hearing, if scheduled, and issue his final 
order pursuant to Sec. 1308.45 without a hearing.

    (b) The requirement of registration is waived for any person who 
distributes a product containing a List I chemical that is regulated

with the Administration to manufacture, distribute or dispense a 
controlled substance.
    (c) The requirement of registration is waived for any person who 
imports or exports a product containing a List I chemical that is 
regulated pursuant to Sec. 1300.02(b)(28)(i)(D), if that person is

that is regulated pursuant to Sec. 1300.02(b)(28)(i)(D) of this 
chapter, in a single transaction to an individual for legitimate medical

the definition of ``ordinary over-the-counter pseudoephedrine or 
phenylpropanolamine product'' under Sec. 1300.02(b)(31) of this 
chapter.
    (f) The requirement of registration is waived for any person whose

or exportation of the List I chemical.
    (i) If any person exempted under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) 
or (g) of this section also engages in the distribution, importation or 
exportation of a List I chemical, other than as described in such 
paragraph, the person shall obtain a registration for such activities, 
as required by Sec. 1309.21 of this part.

granted under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this section 
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec. Sec. 1309.43 through 
1309.46 and 1309.51 through 1309.55 of this part. In considering the 
revocation or suspension of a person's waiver granted pursuant to 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the Administrator shall also 
consider whether action to revoke or suspend the person's controlled 
substance registration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824 is warranted.

section shall comply with the security requirements set forth in

registration, notice must be promptly given of such fact and DEA Form 
510a must be requested by writing to the Registration Unit of the 
Administration at the foregoing address.
    (d) Each application for registration shall include the

an application, shall be signed by the applicant, if an individual; by a 
partner of the applicant, if a partnership; or by an officer of the

attorney for each such individual. The power of attorney shall be signed 
by a person who is authorized to sign applications under this paragraph

The appropriate registration fee and any required attachments must 
accompany the application.
    (b) Any person required to obtain more than one registration may 
submit all applications in one package. Each application must be 
complete and must not refer to any accompanying application for required 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.34  Acceptance for filing; defective applications.

    (a) Applications submitted for filing are dated upon receipt. If 
found to be complete, the application will be accepted for filing. 
Applications failing to comply with the requirements of this part will 
not generally be accepted for filing. In the case of minor defects as to 
completeness, the Administrator may accept the application for filing 
with a request to the applicant for additional information. A defective 
application will be returned to the applicant within 10 days of receipt 
with a statement of the reason for not accepting the application for 
filing. A defective application may be corrected and resubmitted for 
filing at any time.
    (b) Accepting an application for filing does not preclude any 
subsequent request for additional information pursuant to Sec. 1309.35 
and has no bearing on whether the application will be granted.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.35  Additional information.

    The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such documents 
or written statements of fact relevant to the application as he deems 
necessary to determine whether the application should be granted. The 
failure of the applicant to provide such documents or statements within 
a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall be deemed to be a 
waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present such documents or 
facts for consideration by the Administrator in granting or denying the 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.36  Amendments to and withdrawals of applications.

    (a) An application may be amended or withdrawn without permission of 
the Administration at any time before the date on which the applicant 
receives an order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1309.46. An 
application may be amended or withdrawn with permission of the 
Administrator at any time where good cause is shown by the applicant or 
where the amendment or withdrawal is in the public interest.
    (b) After an application has been accepted for filing, the request 
by the applicant that it be returned or the failure of the applicant to 
respond to official correspondence regarding the application, including 
a request that the applicant submit the required fee, when sent by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be deemed 
to be a withdrawal of the application.

                              Registration


<R05>
Sec. 1309.41  Administrative review generally.

    The Administrator may inspect, or cause to be inspected, the 
establishment of an applicant or registrant, pursuant to subpart A of 
part 1316 of this chapter. The Administrator shall review the

Sec. 1309.42  Certificate of registration; denial of registration.

    (a) The Administrator shall issue a Certificate of Registration (DEA 
Form 511) to an applicant if the issuance of registration or 
reregistration is required under the applicable provisions of section 
303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823). In the event that the issuance of 
registration or reregistration is not required, the Administrator shall 
deny the application. Before denying any application, the Administrator 
shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to Section 1309.46 and, if 
requested by the applicant, shall hold a hearing on the application 
pursuant to Sec. 1309.51.
    (b) The Certificate of Registration (DEA Form 511) shall contain the 
name, address, and registration number of the registrant, the activity 
authorized by the registration, the amount of fee paid, and the

certificate of registration at the registered location in a readily 
retrievable manner and shall permit inspection of the certificate by any 
official, agent or employee of the Administration or of any Federal, 
State, or local agency engaged in enforcement of laws relating to List I 
chemicals or controlled substances.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.43  Suspension or revocation of registration.

determines.
    (b) The Administrator may revoke any registration pursuant to 
section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)).
    (c) Before revoking or suspending any registration, the 
Administrator shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to Section 
1309.46 and, if requested by the registrant, shall hold a hearing 
pursuant to Section 1309.51. Notwithstanding the requirements of this 
Section, however, the Administrator may suspend any registration pending 
a final order pursuant to Sec. 1309.44.
    (d) Upon service of the order of the Administrator suspending or 
revoking registration, the registrant shall immediately deliver his or 
her Certificate of Registration to the nearest office of the 
Administration. Also, upon service of the order of the Administrator 
revoking or suspending registration, the registrant shall, as instructed 
by the Administrator:
    (1) Deliver all List I chemicals in his or her possession that were

particular chemical or chemicals, the registrant shall be given a new 
Certificate of Registration for all substances not affected by such 
revocation or suspension; no fee shall be required for the new 
Certificate of Registration. The registrant shall deliver the old 
Certificate of Registration to the nearest office of the Administration. 
Also, upon service of the order of the Administrator revoking or

Sec. 1309.44  Suspension of registration pending final order.

    (a) The Administrator may suspend any registration simultaneously 
with or at any time subsequent to the service upon the registrant of an 
order to show cause why such registration should not be revoked or 
suspended, in any case where he finds that there is an imminent danger 
to the public health or safety. If the Administrator so suspends, he 
shall serve with the order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1309.46 an 
order of immediate suspension that shall contain a statement of his 
findings regarding the danger to public health or safety.
    (b) Upon service of the order of immediate suspension, the 
registrant shall promptly return his Certificate of Registration to the 
nearest office of the Administration. Also, upon service of the order of 
immediate suspension, the registrant shall, as instructed by the 
Administrator:
    (1) Deliver to the nearest office of the Administration or to 
authorized agents of the Administration all of the particular chemical 
or chemicals in his or her possession that were obtained under the 
authority of a registration or an exemption from registration granted by 
the Administrator by regulation, which are affected by the revocation or 
suspension; or
    (2) Place all of such chemicals under seal as described in section 
304(f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(f)).
    (c) Any suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of 
all proceedings upon the revocation or suspension, including any 
judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Administrator or 
dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any registrant whose 
registration is suspended under this section may request a hearing on 
the revocation or suspension of his registration at a time earlier than 
specified in the order to show cause pursuant to Section 1309.46, which 
request shall be granted by the Administrator, who shall fix a date for 
such hearing as early as reasonably possible.

Sec. 1309.45  Extension of registration pending final order.

    In the event that an applicant for reregistration (who is doing 
business under a registration previously granted and not revoked or 
suspended) has applied for reregistration at least 45 days before the 
date on which the existing registration is due to expire, and the 
Administrator has issued no order on the application on the date on 
which the existing registration is due to expire, the existing 
registration of the applicant shall automatically be extended and 
continue in effect until the date on which the Administrator so issues 
his order. The Administrator may extend any other existing registration 
under the circumstances contemplated in this section even though the 
registrant failed to apply for reregistration at least 45 days before 
expiration of the existing registration, with or without request by the 
registrant, if the Administrator finds that such extension is not 
inconsistent with the public health and safety.


<R05>

    (a) If, upon examination of the application for registration from 
any applicant and other information gathered by the Administration 
regarding the applicant, the Administrator is unable to make the 
determinations required by the applicable provisions of section 303 of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) to register the applicant, the Administrator 
shall serve upon the applicant an order to show cause why the 
application for registration should not be denied.
    (b) If, upon information gathered by the Administration regarding 
any registrant, the Administrator determines that the registration of 
such registrant is subject to suspension or revocation pursuant to 
section 304 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824), the Administrator shall serve 
upon the registrant an order to show cause why the registration should 
not be revoked or suspended.

[[Page 118]]

    (c) The order to show cause shall call upon the applicant or 
registrant to appear before the Administrator at a time and place stated 
in the order, which shall not be less than 30 days after the date of

written consent.

                          Security Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1309.71  General security requirements.

    (a) All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls 
and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of List I chemicals. 
Specific attention shall be paid to storage of and controlling access to 
List I chemicals as follows:
    (1) Chemicals shall be stored in containers sealed in such a manner 
as to indicate any attempts at tampering with the container. Where 
chemicals cannot be stored in sealed containers, access to the chemicals 
should be controlled through physical means or through human or 
electronic monitoring.
    (2) In retail settings open to the public where drugs containing 
ephedrine as the sole active medicinal ingredient are distributed, such 
drugs will be stocked behind a counter where only employees have access.
    (b) In evaluating the effectiveness of security controls and 
procedures, the Administrator shall consider the following factors:

[[Page 120]]

    (1) The type, form, and quantity of List I chemicals handled;
    (2) The location of the premises and the relationship such location 
bears on the security needs;
    (3) The type of building construction comprising the facility and 
the general characteristics of the building or buildings;
    (4) The availability of electronic detection and alarm systems;
    (5) the extent of unsupervised public access to the facility;
    (6) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to List 
I chemicals;
    (7) The procedures for handling business guests, visitors, 
maintenance personnel, and nonemployee service personnel in areas where 
List I chemicals are processed or stored;
    (8) The adequacy of the registrant's or applicant's systems for 
monitoring the receipt, distribution, and disposition of List I 
chemicals in its operations.
    (c) Any registrant or applicant desiring to determine whether a 
proposed system of security controls and procedures is adequate may 
submit materials and plans regarding the proposed security controls and 
procedures either to the Special Agent in Charge in the region in which 
the security controls and procedures will be used, or to the Chemical 
Operations Section Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Washington, D.C. 20537.

67 FR 14861, Mar. 28, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 1309.72  Felony conviction; employer responsibilities.

    (a) The registrant shall exercise caution in the consideration of 
employment of persons who will have access to listed chemicals, who have 
been convicted of a felony offense relating to controlled substances or 
listed chemicals, or who have, at any time, had an application for 
registration with the DEA denied, had a DEA registration revoked, or 
surrendered a DEA registration for cause. (For purposes of this 
subsection, the term ``for cause'' means a surrender in lieu of, or as a 
consequence of, any Federal or State administrative, civil or criminal 
action resulting from an investigation of the individual's handling of 
controlled substances or listed chemicals.) The registrant should be 
aware of the circumstances regarding the action against the potential 
employee and the rehabilitative efforts following the action. The 
registrant shall assess the risks involved in employing such persons, 
including the potential for action against the registrant pursuant to 
Sec. 1309.43, If such person is found to have diverted listed 
chemicals, and, in the event of employment, shall institute procedures 
to limit the potential for diversion of List I chemicals.
    (b) It is the position of DEA that employees who possess, sell, use 
or divert listed chemicals or controlled substances will subject 
themselves not only to State or Federal prosecution for any illicit 
activity, but shall also immediately become the subject of independent 
action regarding their continued employment. The employer will assess 
the seriousness of the employee's violation, the position of 
responsibility held by the employee, past record of employment, etc., in 
determining whether to suspend, transfer, terminate or take other action 
against the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.73  Employee responsibility to report diversion.

    Reports of listed chemical diversion by fellow employees is not only 
a necessary part of an overall employee security program but also serves 
the public interest at large. It is, therefore, the position of DEA that 
an employee who has knowledge of diversion from his employer by a fellow 
employee has an obligation to report such information to a responsible 
security official of the employer. The employer shall treat such 
information as confidential and shall take all reasonable steps to 
protect the confidentiality of the information and the identity of the 
employee furnishing information. A failure to report information of 
chemical diversion will be considered in determining the feasibility of 
continuing to allow an employee to work in an area with access to 
chemicals. The employer shall inform all employees concerning this 
policy.

Sec. 1310.05  Reports.

    (a) Each regulated person shall report to the Special Agent in 
Charge of the DEA Divisional Office for the area in which the regulated 
person making the report is located, as follows:
    (1) Any regulated transaction involving an extraordinary quantity of 
a listed chemical, an uncommon method of payment or delivery, or any 
other circumstance that the regulated person believes may indicate that 
the listed chemical will be used in violation of this part.
    (2) Any proposed regulated transaction with a person whose 
description or other identifying characteristic the

[[Page 126]]

Administration has previously furnished to the regulated person.
    (3) Any unusual or excessive loss or disappearance of a listed 
chemical under the control of the regulated person. The regulated person 
responsible for reporting a loss in-transit is the supplier.
    (4) Any domestic regulated transaction in a tableting machine or an 
encapsulating machine.
    (b) Each report submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
shall, whenever possible, be made orally to the DEA Divisional Office 
for the area in which the regulated person making the report is located 
at the earliest practicable opportunity after the regulated person 
becomes aware of the circumstances involved and as much in advance of 
the conclusion of the transaction as possible. Written reports of 
transactions listed in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this 
section will subsequently be filed as set forth in Sec. 1310.06 within 
15 days after the regulated person becomes aware of the circumstances of 
the event. A transaction may not be completed with a person whose 
description or identifying characteristic has previously been furnished 
to the regulated person by the Administration unless the transaction is 
approved by the Administration.
    (c) Each regulated person who imports or exports a tableting 
machine, or encapsulation machine, shall file a report (not a 486) of 
such importation or exportation with the Administration at the following 
address on or before the date of importation or exportation: Drug 
Enforcement Administration, P.O. Box 27284, Washington, DC 20038. In 
order to facilitate the importation or exportation of any tableting 
machine or encapsulating machine and implement the purpose of the Act, 
regulated persons may wish to report to the Administration as far in 
advance as possible. A copy of the report may be transmitted directly to 
the Drug Enforcement Administration through electronic facsimile media. 
Any tableting machine or encapsulating machine may be imported or 
exported if that machine is needed for medical, commercial, scientific, 
or other legitimate uses. However, an importation or exportation of a 
tableting machine or encapsulating machine may not be completed with a 
person whose description or identifying characteristic has previously 
been furnished to the regulated person by the Administration unless the 
transaction is approved by the Administration.
    (d) Each regulated bulk manufacturer of a listed chemical shall 
submit manufacturing, inventory and use data on an annual basis as set 
forth in Sec. 1310.06(h). This data shall be submitted annually to the 
Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA), Washington, D.C. 20537, on or before the 15th day of March of the 
year immediately following the calendar year for which submitted. A 
business entity which manufactures a listed chemical may elect to report 
separately by individual location or report as an aggregate amount for 
the entire business entity provided that they inform the DEA of which 
method they will use. This reporting requirement does not apply to drug 
or other products which are exempted under Sec. Sec. 1310.01(f)(1)(iv) 
or 1310.01(f)(1)(v) except as set forth in Sec. 1310.06(h)(5). Bulk 
manufacturers that produce a listed chemical solely for internal 
consumption shall not be required to report for that listed chemical. 
For purposes of these reporting requirements, internal consumption shall 
consist of any quantity of a listed chemical otherwise not available for 
further resale or distribution. Internal consumption shall include (but 
not be limited to) quantities used for quality control testing, 
quantities consumed in-house or production losses. Internal consumption 
does not include the quantities of a listed chemical consumed in the 
production of exempted products. If an existing standard industry report 
contains the information required in Sec. 1310.06(h) and such 
information is separate or readily retrievable from the report, that 
report may be submitted in satisfaction of this requirement. Each report 
shall be submitted to the DEA under company letterhead and signed by an 
appropriate, responsible official. For purposes of this paragraph only, 
the term regulated bulk manufacturer of a listed chemical means a person 
who manufactures a listed chemical by means of

[[Page 127]]

chemical synthesis or by extraction from other substances. The term bulk 
manufacturer does not include persons whose sole activity consists of 
the repackaging or relabeling of listed chemical products or the 
manufacture of drug dosage form products which contain a listed 
chemical.
    (e) Each regulated person required to report pursuant to Sec. 
1310.03(c) of this part shall either:
    (1) Submit a written report, containing the information set forth in 
Sec. 1310.06(i) of this part, on or before the 15th day of each month 
following the month in which the distributions took place. The report 
shall be submitted under company letterhead, signed by the person 
authorized to sign the registration application forms on behalf of the 
registrant, to the Chemical Control Section, Office of Diversion 
Control, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537; or
    (2) Upon request to and approval by the Administration, submit the 
report in electronic form, either via computer disk or direct electronic 
data transmission, in such form as the Administration shall direct. 
Requests to submit reports in electronic form should be submitted to the 
Chemical Control Section, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Washington, DC 20537, ATTN: Electronic Reporting.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the 
following distributions to nonregulated persons, and the following 
export transactions, are not subject to the reporting requirements in 
Sec. 1310.03(c):
    (1) Distributions of sample packages of drug products when those 
packages contain not more than two solid dosage units or the equivalent 
of two dosage units in liquid form, not to exceed 10 milliliters of 
liquid per package, and not more than one package is distributed to an 
individual or residential address in any 30-day period.
    (2) Distributions of drug products by retail distributors that may 
not include face-to-face transactions to the extent that such 
distributions are consistent with the activities authorized for a retail 
distributor as specified in Sec. 1300.02(b)(29) of this chapter.
    (3) Distributions of drug products to a resident of a long term care 
facility or distributions of drug products to a long term care facility 
for dispensing to or for use by a resident of that facility.
    (4) Distributions of drug products in accordance with a valid 
prescription.
    (5) Exports which have been reported to the Administrator under 
Sec. Sec. 1313.31 and 1313.32 of this chapter or which are subject to a 
waiver granted under Sec. 1313.21 of this chapter.
    (g) The Administrator may revoke any or all of the exemptions listed 
in paragraph (f) of this section for an individual regulated person if 
the Administrator finds that drug products distributed by the regulated 
person are being used in violation of the regulations in this chapter or 
the Controlled Substances Act. The Administrator will notify the 
regulated person of the revocation, as provided in Sec. 1313.41(a) of 
this chapter. The revocation will be effective upon receipt of the 
notice by the person. The regulated person has the right to an expedited 
hearing regarding the revocation, as provided in Sec. 1313.56(a) of 
this chapter.

Sec. 1310.07  Proof of identity.

    (a) Each regulated person who engages in a regulated transaction 
must identify the other party to the transaction. For domestic 
transaction, this shall be accomplished by having the other party 
present documents which would verify the identity, or registration 
status if a registrant, of the other party to the regulated person at 
the time the order is placed. For export transactions, this shall be 
accomplished by good faith inquiry through reasonably available research 
documents or publicly available information which would indicate the 
existence of the foreign customer. No proof of identity is required for 
foreign suppliers.
    (b) The regulated person must verify the existence and apparent 
validity of a business entity ordering a listed chemical, tableting 
machine or encapsulating machine. For domestic transactions, this may be 
accomplished by such methods as checking the telephone directory, the 
local credit bureau, the local Chamber of Commerce or the local Better 
Business Bureau, or, if the business entity is a registrant, by 
verification of the registration. For export transactions, a good faith 
inquiry to verify the existence and apparent validity of a foreign 
business entity may be accomplished by such methods as verifying the 
business telephone listing through international telephone information, 
the firm's listing in international or foreign national chemical 
directories or other commerce directories or trade publications, 
confirmation through foreign subsidiaries of the U.S. regulated person, 
verification through the country of destination's embassy Commercial 
Attache, or official documents provided by the purchaser which confirm 
the existence and apparent validity of the business entity.
    (c) When transacting business with a new representative of a firm, 
the regulated person must verify the claimed agency status of the 
representative.
    (d) For sales to individuals or cash purchasers, the type of 
documents and other evidence of proof must consist of at least a 
signature of the purchaser, a driver's license and one other form of 
identification. Any exports to individuals or exports paid in cash are 
suspect and should be handled as such. For such exports, the regulated 
person shall diligently obtain from the purchaser or independently seek 
to confirm clear documentation which proves the person is properly 
identified such as through foreign identity documents, driver's license, 
passport information and photograph, etc. Any regulated person who fails 
to adequately prove the identity of the other party to the transaction 
may be subject to the specific penalties provided for violations of law 
related to regulated transactions in listed chemicals.
    (e) For a new customer who is not an individual or cash customer, 
the regulated person shall establish the identity of the authorized 
purchasing agent or agents and have on file that person's signature, 
electronic password, or other identification. Once the authorized 
purchasing agent has been established, the agent list may be updated 
annually rather than on each order. The regulated person must ensure 
that shipments are not made unless the order is placed by an authorized 
agent of record.
    (f) With respect to electronic orders, the identity of the purchaser 
shall consist of a computer password, identification number or some 
other means of identification consistent with electronic orders and with 
Sec. 1310.07(e).

Sec. 1310.10  Removal of the exemption of drugs distributed under the 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

    (a) The Administrator may remove from exemption under Sec. 
1310.01(b)(28)(i)(D) any drug or group of drugs that the Administrator 
finds

[[Page 133]]

is being diverted to obtain a listed chemical for use in the illicit 
production of a controlled substance. In removing a drug or group of 
drugs from the exemption the Administrator shall consider:
    (1) The scope, duration, and significance of the diversion;
    (2) Whether the drug or group of drugs is formulated in such a way 
that it cannot be easily used in the illicit production of a controlled 
substance; and
    (3) Whether the listed chemical can be readily recovered from the 
drug or group of drugs.
    (b) Upon determining that a drug or group of drugs should be removed 
from the exemption under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Administrator shall issue and publish in the Federal Register his 
proposal to remove the drug or group of drugs from the exemption, which 
shall include a reference to the legal authority under which the 
proposal is based. The Administrator shall permit any interested person 
to file written comments on or objections to the proposal. After 
considering any comments or objections filed, the Administrator shall 
publish in the Federal Register his final order.
    (c) The Administrator shall limit the removal of a drug or group of 
drugs from exemption under paragraph (a) of this section to the most 
identifiable type of the drug or group of drugs for which evidence of 
diversion exists unless there is evidence, based on the pattern of 
diversion and other relevant factors, that the diversion will not be 
limited to that particular drug or group of drugs.
    (d) Any manufacturer seeking reinstatement of a particular drug 
product that has been removed from an exemption may apply to the 
Administrator for reinstatement of the exemption for that particular 
drug product on the grounds that the particular drug product is 
manufactured and distributed in a manner that prevents diversion. In 
determining whether the exemption should be reinstated the Administrator 
shall consider:
    (1) The package sizes and manner of packaging of the drug product;
    (2) The manner of distribution and advertising of the drug product;
    (3) Evidence of diversion of the drug product;
    (4) Any actions taken by the manufacturer to prevent diversion of 
the drug product; and
    (5) Such other factors as are relevant to and consistent with the 
public health and safety, including the factors described in paragraph 
(a) of this section as applied to the drug product.
    (e) Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the 
application for reinstatement of the exemption, the Administrator shall 
notify the applicant of his acceptance or non-acceptance of his 
application, and if not accepted, the reason therefor. If the 
application is accepted for filing, the Administrator shall issue and 
publish in the Federal Register his order on the reinstatement of the 
exemption for the particular drug product, which shall include a 
reference to the legal authority under which the order is based. This 
order shall specify the date on which it shall take effect. The 
Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written 
comments on or objections to the order. If any such comments raise 
significant issues regarding any finding of fact or conclusion of law 
upon which the order is based, the Administrator shall immediately 
suspend the effectiveness of the order until he may reconsider the 
application in light of the comments and objections filed. Thereafter, 
the Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, or amend his original order 
as he determines appropriate.
    (f) Unless the Administrator has evidence that the drug product is 
being diverted, as determined by applying the factors set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, and the Administrator so notifies the 
applicant, transactions involving a specific drug product will not be 
considered regulated transactions during the following periods:
    (1) While a bonafide application for reinstatement of exemption 
under paragraph (d) of this section for the specific drug product is 
pending resolution, provided that the application for reinstatement is 
filed not later than 60 days after the publication of the final order 
removing the exemption; and
    (2) For a period of 60 days following the Administrator's denial of 
an application for reinstatement.

[[Page 134]]

    (g) An order published by the Administrator in the Federal Register, 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, to reinstate an exemption may 
be modified or revoked with respect to a particular drug product upon a 
finding that:
    (1) Applying the factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section 
to the particular drug product, the drug product is being diverted; or
    (2) There is a significant change in the data that led to the 
issuance of the final rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) The following categories of chemical mixtures are automatically 
exempt from the provisions of the Controlled Substances Act as described 
in paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Harvested plant material that contains ephedrine, N-
methylephedrine, N-methylpseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, 
phenylpropanolamine, and/or pseudoephedrine, that is in its natural 
state or has been processed in a way (such as grinding, chopping, 
mulching or cutting) that preserves the natural constituents in the 
ratios that are found in the plant's natural state. Plant material 
subjected to chemical or physical extraction, concentration, chemical 
reaction, or other treatment that alters the plant's natural 
constituents or the ratios of the plant constituents are not exempt.
    (2) Chemical mixtures that are distributed directly to an 
incinerator for destruction or directly to an authorized waste recycler 
or reprocessor where such distributions are documented on United States 
Environmental Protection Agency Form 8700-22; persons distributing the 
mixture to the incinerator or recycler must maintain and make available 
to agents of the Administration, upon request, such documentation for a 
period of no less than two years.
    (3) Completely formulated paints and coatings: Completely formulated 
paints and coatings are only those formulations that contain all the 
components of the paint or coating for use in the final application 
without the need to add any additional substances except a thinner if 
needed in certain cases. A completely formulated paint or coating is 
defined as any clear or pigmented liquid, liquefiable or mastic 
composition designed for application to a substrate in a thin layer that 
is converted to a clear or opaque solid protective, decorative, or 
functional adherent film after application. Included in this category 
are clear coats, topcoats, primers, varnishes, sealers, adhesives, 
lacquers, stains, shellacs, inks, and temporary protective coatings.
    (e) The Administrator may, at any time, terminate or modify the 
exemption for any chemical mixture which has been granted an exemption 
pursuant to the concentration limits as specified in paragraph (c) of 
this section or pursuant to the category exemption as specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section. In terminating or modifying an exemption, 
the Administrator shall issue, and publish in the Federal Register, 
notification of the removal of an exemption for a product or group of 
products for which evidence of diversion has been found, as well as the 
date on which the termination of exemption shall take effect. The 
Administrator shall permit any interested party to file written comments 
on or objections to the order within 60 days of the date of publication 
of the order in the Federal Register. If any such comments or objections 
raise significant issues regarding any finding of fact or conclusion of 
law upon which the order is

[[Page 137]]

based, the Administrator shall immediately suspend the effectiveness of 
the order until he may reconsider the order in light of comments and 
objections filed. Thereafter, the Administrator shall reinstate, 
terminate, or amend the original order as determined appropriate.
    (f) The Administrator may modify any part of the criteria for 
exemption as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section upon 
evidence of diversion or attempted diversion. In doing so, the 
Administrator shall issue and publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 
the Federal Register. The Administrator shall permit any interested 
persons to file written comments on or objections to the proposal. After 
considering any comments or objections filed, the Administrator shall 
publish in the Federal Register a final order.

shall be notified in writing and the Administrator shall issue, and 
publish in the Federal Register, an order on the application. This order 
shall specify the date on which it shall take effect. The Administrator 
shall permit any interested person to file written comments on or 
objections to the order. If any comments or objections raise significant 
issues regarding any findings of fact or conclusions of law upon which 
the order is based, the Administrator may suspend the effectiveness of 
the order until he has reconsidered the application in light of the 
comments and objections filed. Thereafter, the Administrator shall 
reinstate, terminate, or amend the original order as deemed appropriate.
    (f) The Administrator may, at any time, terminate or modify an 
exemption for any product pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. In 
terminating or modifying an exemption, the Administrator shall issue,

in writing, of any change in the quantitative or qualitative composition 
of a chemical mixture that has been granted an exemption by application. 
Changes include those greater than the range of concentration given in 
the application or that remove non-listed chemical(s) given in the 
application as part of the formulation. A new application will be 
required only if reformulation results in a new product having a 
different commercial application or can no longer be defined as part of 
a group of exempted chemicals. DEA must be notified of reformulation at 
least 30 days in advance of marketing the reformulated mixture. For a 
change in name or other designation, code, or any identifier, a written 
notification is required. DEA must be notified of any changes at least 
60 days in advance of the effective date for the change.
    (h) Each manufacturer seeking exemption must apply for such an 
exemption. A formulation granted exemption by publication in the Federal 
Register will not be exempted for all manufacturers.
    (i) The following chemical mixtures, in the form and quantity listed 
in the application submitted (indicated as the ``date'' ) are designated 
as exempt chemical mixtures for the purposes set forth in this section

Sec. 1310.21  Sale by Federal departments or agencies of chemicals 
which could be used to manufacture controlled substances.

    (a) A Federal department or agency may not sell from the stocks of 
the department or agency any chemical which, as determined by the 
Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, could be used in 
the manufacture of a controlled substance, unless the Administrator 
certifies in writing to the head of the department or agency that there 
is no reasonable cause to believe that the sale of the specific chemical 
to a specific person would result in the illegal manufacture of a 
controlled substance. For purposes of this requirement, reasonable cause 
to believe means that the Administration has knowledge of facts which 
would cause a reasonable person to reasonably conclude that a chemical 
would be diverted to the illegal manufacture of a controlled substance.
    (b) A Federal department or agency must request certification by 
submitting a written request to the Administrator, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Washington, DC 20537, Attention: Domestic Chemical 
Control Unit (ODID). A request for certification may be transmitted 
directly to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Domestic Chemical 
Control Unit through electronic facsimile media. A request for 
certification must be submitted no later than fifteen calendar days 
before the proposed sale is to take place. In order to facilitate the 
sale of chemicals from Federal departments' or agencies' stocks, Federal 
departments or agencies may wish to submit requests as far in advance of 
the fifteen calendar days as possible. The written notification of the 
proposed sale must include:
    (1) The name and amount of the chemical to be sold;
    (2) The name and address of the prospective bidder;
    (3) The name and address of the prospective end-user, in cases where 
a sale is being brokered;
    (4) Point(s) of contact for the prospective bidder and, where 
appropriate, prospective end-user; and
    (5) The end use of the chemical.
    (c) Within fifteen calendar days of receipt of a request for 
certification, the Administrator will certify in writing to the head of 
the Federal department or agency that there is, or is not, reasonable 
cause to believe that the sale of the specific chemical to the specific 
bidder and end-user would result in the illegal manufacture of a 
controlled substance. In making this determination, the following 
factors must be considered:
    (1) Past experience of the prospective bidder or end-user in the 
maintenance of effective controls against diversion of listed chemicals 
into other than legitimate medical, scientific, and industrial channels;
    (2) Compliance of the prospective bidder or end-user with applicable 
Federal, state and local law;
    (3) Prior conviction record of the prospective bidder or end-user 
relating to listed chemicals or controlled substances under Federal or 
state laws; and
    (4) Such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the 
public health and safety.
    (d) If the Administrator certifies to the head of a Federal 
department or agency that there is no reasonable cause to believe that 
the sale of a specific chemical to a prospective bidder and end-user 
will result in the illegal manufacture of a controlled substance, that 
certification will be effective for one year from the date of issuance 
with respect to further sales of the same chemical to the same 
prospective bidder and end-user, unless the Administrator notifies the 
head of the Federal department or agency in writing that the 
certification is withdrawn. If the

[[Page 141]]

certification is withdrawn, DEA will also provide written notice to the 
bidder and end-user, which will contain a statement of the legal and 
factual basis for this determination.
    (e) If the Administrator determines there is reasonable cause to 
believe the sale of the specific chemical to a specific bidder and end-
user would result in the illegal manufacture of a controlled substance, 
DEA will provide written notice to the head of a Federal department or 
agency refusing to certify the proposed sale under the authority of 21 
U.S.C. 890. DEA also will provide, within fifteen calendar days of 
receiving a request for certification from a Federal department or 
agency, the same written notice to the prospective bidder and end-user, 
and this notice also will contain a statement of the legal and factual 
basis for the refusal of certification. The prospective bidder and end-
user may, within thirty calendar days of receipt of notification of the 
refusal, submit written comments or written objections to the 
Administrator's refusal. At the same time, the prospective bidder and 
end-user also may provide supporting documentation to contest the 
Administrator's refusal. If such written comments or written objections 
raise issues regarding any finding of fact or conclusion of law upon 
which the refusal is based, the Administrator will reconsider the 
refusal of the proposed sale in light of the written comments or written 
objections filed. Thereafter, within a reasonable time, the 
Administrator will withdraw or affirm the original refusal of 
certification as he determines appropriate. The Administrator will 
provide written reasons for any affirmation of the original refusal. 
Such affirmation of the original refusal will constitute a final 
decision for purposes of judicial review under 21 U.S.C. 877.
    (f) If the Administrator determines there is reasonable cause to 
believe that an existing certification should be withdrawn, DEA will 
provide written notice to the head of a Federal department or agency of 
such withdrawal under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 890. DEA also will 
provide, within fifteen calendar days of withdrawal of an existing 
certification, the same written notice to the bidder and end-user, and 
this notice also will contain a statement of the legal and factual basis 
for the withdrawal. The bidder and end-user may, within thirty calendar 
days of receipt of notification of the withdrawal of the existing 
certification, submit written comments or written objections to the 
Administrator's withdrawal. At the same time, the bidder and end-user 
also may provide supporting documentation to contest the Administrator's 
withdrawal. If such written comments or written objections raise issues 
regarding any finding of fact or conclusion of law upon which the 
withdrawal of the existing certification is based, the Administrator 
will reconsider the withdrawal of the existing certification in light of 
the written comments or written objections filed. Thereafter, within a 
reasonable time, the Administrator will withdraw or affirm the original 
withdrawal of the existing certification as he determines appropriate. 
The Administrator will provide written reasons for any affirmation of 
the original withdrawal of the existing certification. Such affirmation 
of the original withdrawal of the existing certification will constitute 
a final decision for purposes of judicial review under 21 U.S.C. 877.

    Biometric authentication means authentication based on measurement 
of the individual's physical features or repeatable actions where those 
features or actions are both unique to the individual and measurable.
    Cache means to download and store information on a local server or 
hard drive.
    Certificate Policy means a named set of rules that sets forth the 
applicability of the specific digital certificate to a particular 
community or class of application with common security requirements.
    Certificate Revocation List (CRL) means a list of revoked, but 
unexpired certificates issued by a Certification Authority.
    Certification Authority (CA) means an organization that is 
responsible for verifying the identity of applicants, authorizing and 
issuing a digital certificate, maintaining a directory of public keys, 
and maintaining a Certificate Revocation List.
    CSOS means controlled substance ordering system.
    Digital certificate means a data record that, at a minimum:
    (1) Identifies the certification authority issuing it;
    (2) Names or otherwise identifies the certificate holder;
    (3) Contains a public key that corresponds to a private key under 
the sole control of the certificate holder;
    (4) Identifies the operational period; and
    (5) Contains a serial number and is digitally signed by the 
Certification Authority issuing it.
    Digital signature means a record created when a file is 
algorithmically transformed into a fixed length digest that is then 
encrypted using an asymmetric cryptographic private key associated with 
a digital certificate. The combination of the encryption and algorithm 
transformation ensure that the signer's identity and the integrity of 
the file can be confirmed.
    Electronic signature means a method of signing an electronic message 
that identifies a particular person as the source of the message and 
indicates the person's approval of the information contained in the 
message.
    FIPS means Federal Information Processing Standards. These Federal 
standards, as incorporated by reference in Sec. 1311.08, prescribe 
specific performance requirements, practices, formats, communications

signatures.
    Key pair means two mathematically related keys having the properties 
that:
    (1) One key can be used to encrypt a message that can only be 
decrypted using the other key; and
    (2) Even knowing one key, it is computationally infeasible to 
discover the other key.
    NIST means the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
    Private key means the key of a key pair that is used to create a 
digital signature.

[[Page 143]]

    Public key means the key of a key pair that is used to verify a 
digital signature. The public key is made available to anyone who will 
receive digitally signed messages from the holder of the key pair.
    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) means a structure under which a 
Certification Authority verifies the identity of applicants, issues, 
renews, and revokes digital certificates, maintains a registry of public 
keys, and maintains an up-to-date Certificate Revocation List.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.05  Standards for technologies for electronic transmission 
of orders.

    (a) A registrant or a person with power of attorney to sign orders 
for Schedule I and II controlled substances may use any technology to 
sign and electronically transmit orders if the technology provides all 
of the following:
    (1) Authentication: The system must enable a recipient to positively 
verify the signer without direct communication with the signer and 
subsequently demonstrate to a third party, if needed, that the sender's 
identity was properly verified.
    (2) Nonrepudiation: The system must ensure that strong and 
substantial evidence is available to the recipient of the sender's 
identity, sufficient to prevent the sender from successfully denying 
having sent the data. This criterion includes the ability of a third 
party to verify the origin of the document.
    (3) Message integrity: The system must ensure that the recipient, or 
a third party, can determine whether the contents of the document have 
been altered during transmission or after receipt.
    (b) DEA has identified the following means of electronically signing 
and transmitting order forms as meeting all of the standards set forth 
in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) Digital signatures using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
technology.

<R04>
Subpart B_Obtaining and Using Digital Certificates for Electronic Orders


<R05>
Sec. 1311.10  Eligibility to obtain a CSOS digital certificate.

    The following persons are eligible to obtain a CSOS digital 
certificate from the DEA Certification Authority to sign electronic 
orders for controlled substances.

[[Page 144]]

    (a) The person who signed the most recent DEA registration 
application or renewal application and a person authorized to sign a 
registration application.
    (b) A person granted power of attorney by a DEA registrant to sign 
orders for one or more schedules of controlled substances.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.15  Limitations on CSOS digital certificates.

    (a) A CSOS digital certificate issued by the DEA Certification 
Authority will authorize the certificate holder to sign orders for only 
those schedules of controlled substances covered by the registration 
under which the certificate is issued.
    (b) When a registrant, in a power of attorney letter, limits a 
certificate applicant to a subset of the registrant's authorized 
schedules, the registrant is responsible for ensuring that the 
certificate holder signs orders only for that subset of schedules.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.20  Coordinators for CSOS digital certificate holders.

    (a) Each registrant, regardless of number of digital certificates 
issued, must designate one or more responsible persons to serve as that 
registrant's CSOS coordinator regarding issues pertaining to issuance 
of, revocation of, and changes to digital certificates issued under that 
registrant's DEA registration. While the coordinator will be the main 
point of contact between one or more DEA registered locations and the 
CSOS Certification Authority, all digital certificate activities are the 
responsibility of the registrant with whom the digital certificate is 
associated. Even when an individual registrant, i.e., an individual 
practitioner, is applying for a digital certificate to order controlled 
substances a CSOS Coordinator must be designated; though in such a case, 
the individual practitioner may also serve as the coordinator.
    (b) Once designated, coordinators must identify themselves, on a 
one-time basis, to the Certification Authority. If a designated 
coordinator changes, the Certification Authority must be notified of the 
change and the new responsibilities assumed by each of the registrant's 
coordinators, if applicable. Coordinators must complete the application 
that the DEA Certification Authority provides and submit the following:
    (1) Two copies of identification, one of which must be a government-
issued photographic identification.
    (2) A copy of each current DEA Certificate of Registration (DEA form 
223) for each registered location for which the coordinator will be 
responsible or, if the applicant (or their employer) has not been issued 
a DEA registration, a copy of each application for registration of the 
applicant or the applicant's employer.
    (3) The applicant must have the completed application notarized and 
forward the completed application and accompanying documentation to the 
DEA Certification Authority.
    (c) Coordinators will communicate with the Certification Authority 
regarding digital certificate applications, renewals and revocations. 
For applicants applying for a digital certificate from the DEA 
Certification Authority, and for applicants applying for a power of 
attorney digital certificate for a DEA registrant, the registrant's 
Coordinator must verify the applicant's identity, review the application 
package, and submit the completed package to the Certification 
Authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.25  Requirements for obtaining a CSOS digital certificate.

    (a) To obtain a certificate to use for signing electronic orders for 
controlled substances, a registrant or person with power of attorney for 
a registrant must complete the application that the DEA Certification 
Authority provides and submit the following:
    (1) Two copies of identification, one of which must be a government-
issued photographic identification.
    (2) A current listing of DEA registrations for which the individual 
has authority to sign controlled substances orders.
    (3) A copy of the power of attorney from the registrant, if 
applicable.
    (4) An acknowledgment that the applicant has read and understands 
the Subscriber Agreement and agrees to the statement of subscriber 
obligations that DEA provides.

[[Page 145]]

    (b) The applicant must provide the completed application to the 
registrant's coordinator for CSOS digital certificate holders who will 
review the application and submit the completed application and 
accompanying documentation to the DEA Certification Authority.
    (c) When the Certification Authority approves the application, it 
will send the applicant a one-time use reference number and access code, 
via separate channels, and information on how to use them. Using this 
information, the applicant must then electronically submit a request for 
certification of the public digital signature key. After the request is 
approved, the Certification Authority will provide the applicant with 
the signed public key certificate.
    (d) Once the applicant has generated the key pair, the Certification 
Authority must prove that the user has possession of the key. For public 
keys, the corresponding private key must be used to sign the certificate 
request. Verification of the signature using the public key in the 
request will serve as proof of possession of the private key.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.30  Requirements for storing and using a private key for 
digitally signing orders.

    (a) Only the certificate holder may access or use his or her digital 
certificate and private key.
    (b) The certificate holder must provide FIPS-approved secure storage 
for the private key, as discussed by FIPS 140-2, 180-2, 186-2, and 
accompanying change notices and annexes, as incorporated by reference in 
Sec. 1311.08.
    (c) A certificate holder must ensure that no one else uses the 
private key. While the private key is activated, the certificate holder 
must prevent unauthorized use of that private key.
    (d) A certificate holder must not make back-up copies of the private 
key.
    (e) The certificate holder must report the loss, theft, or 
compromise of the private key or the password, via a revocation request, 
to the Certification Authority within 24 hours of substantiation of the 
loss, theft, or compromise. Upon receipt and verification of a signed 
revocation request, the Certification Authority will revoke the 
certificate. The certificate holder must apply for a new certificate 
under the requirements of Sec. 1311.25.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.35  Number of CSOS digital certificates needed.

    A purchaser of Schedule I and II controlled substances must obtain a 
separate CSOS certificate for each registered location for which the 
purchaser will order these controlled substances.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.40  Renewal of CSOS digital certificates.

    (a) A CSOS certificate holder must generate a new key pair and 
obtain a new CSOS digital certificate when the registrant's DEA 
registration expires or whenever the information on which the 
certificate is based changes. This information includes the registered 
name and address, the subscriber's name, and the schedules the 
registrant is authorized to handle. A CSOS certificate will expire on 
the date on which the DEA registration on which the certificate is based 
expires.
    (b) The Certification Authority will notify each CSOS certificate 
holder 45 days in advance of the expiration of the certificate holder's 
CSOS digital certificate.
    (c) If a CSOS certificate holder applies for a renewal before the 
certificate expires, the certificate holder may renew electronically 
twice. For every third renewal, the CSOS certificate holder must submit 
a new application and documentation, as provided in Sec. 1311.25.
    (d) If a CSOS certificate expires before the holder applies for a 
renewal, the certificate holder must submit a new application and 
documentation, as provided in Sec. 1311.25.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.45  Requirements for registrants that allow powers of attorney 
to obtain CSOS digital certificates under their DEA registration.

    (a) A registrant that grants power of attorney must report to the 
DEA Certification Authority within 6 hours of either of the following 
(advance notice may be provided, where applicable):
    (1) The person with power of attorney has left the employ of the 
institution.

[[Page 146]]

    (2) The person with power of attorney has had his or her privileges 
revoked.
    (b) A registrant must maintain a record that lists each person 
granted power of attorney to sign controlled substances orders.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.50  Requirements for recipients of digitally signed orders.

    (a) The recipient of a digitally signed order must do the following 
before filling the order:
    (1) Verify the integrity of the signature and the order by having 
the system validate the order.
    (2) Verify that the certificate holder's CSOS digital certificate 
has not expired by checking the expiration date against the date the 
order was signed.
    (3) Check the validity of the certificate holder's certificate by 
checking the Certificate Revocation List.
    (4) Check the certificate extension data to determine whether the 
sender has the authority to order the controlled substance.
    (b) A recipient may cache Certificate Revocation Lists for use until 
they expire.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.55  Requirements for systems used to process digitally signed 
orders.

    (a) A CSOS certificate holder and recipient of an electronic order 
may use any system to write, track, or maintain orders provided that the 
system has been enabled to process digitally signed documents and that 
it meets the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (b) A system used to digitally sign Schedule I or II orders must

digital signature cannot be validated.
    (5) The system must validate that the DEA registration number 
contained in the body of the order corresponds to the registration 
number associated with the specific certificate by separately generating 
the hash value of the registration number and certificate subject 
distinguished name serial number and comparing that hash value to the 
hash value contained in the certificate extension for the DEA 
registration number. If the hash values are not

[[Page 147]]

equal the system must invalidate the order.
    (6) The system must check the Certificate Revocation List 
automatically and invalidate any order with a certificate listed on the 
Certificate Revocation List.
    (7) The system must check the validity of the certificate and the

Act (21 U.S.C. 823); or
    (3) That the domestic supply of any controlled substance is 
inadequate for scientific studies, and that the importation of that

    (b) The Administrator may require that such non-narcotic controlled 
substances in Schedule III as he shall designate by regulation in Sec.

in the case of shipments transported under immediate transportation 
entries, in order that the District Director may compare it with the 
original copy (Copy 1) and the bill of lading upon arrival of the 
merchandise. If a discrepancy is noted between corresponding items upon 
different copies of a permit bearing the same serial number when 
compared by the District Director, he shall refuse to permit entry of 
the merchandise until the facts are communicated to the Administration 
and further instructions are received.

at the weighing by the District Director of the U.S. Customs Service, 
such difference shall be seized subject to forfeiture, pending an 
explanation; except that shipments of substances exceeding the maximum 
authorized amount by less than 1 percent may be released to the importer 
upon the filing by him of an amended import permit. If the substance is 
included in Schedule I, it will be summarily forfeited to the 
Government.
    (b) If the shipment made under the permit is less than the maximum 
amount authorized to be imported under the permit as determined at the 
weighing by the District Director of the U.S. Customs Service, such 
difference, when ascertained by the Administration, shall be recredited 
to the tentative allotment against which the quantity covered by the 
permit was charged, and the balance of any such tentative allotment with 
any such recredits will remain available to the importer to whom made 
(unless previously revoked in whole or in part), for importations 
pursuant to any permit or permits as are requested and issued during the 
remainder of the calendar year to which the allotment is applicable. No 
permit shall be issued for importation of a quantity of controlled 
substances as a charge against the tentative allotment for a given 
calendar year, after the close of such calendar year, unless the 
Director of the Administration decides to make an exception for good 
cause shown.

<R05>
Sec. 1316.53  Time and place of hearing.

    The hearing will commence at the place and time designated in the 
notice of hearing published in the Federal Register but thereafter it 
may be moved to a different place and may be continued from day to day 
or recessed to a later day without notice other than announcement 
thereof by the presiding officer at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.54  Prehearing conference.

    The presiding officer on his own motion, or on the motion of any 
party for good cause shown, may direct all parties to appear at a 
specified time and place for a conference for:

    (b) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admission of facts, 
and documents.
    (c) The possibility of limiting the number of expert witnesses.

[[Page 178]]

    (d) The identification and, if practicable, the scheduling of all 
witnesses to be called.

    The presiding officer may have the prehearing conference reported 
verbatim and shall make a ruling reciting the action taken at the

control the subsequent course of the hearing unless modified by a 
subsequent ruling.


<R05>

identification of witnesses subsequent to prehearing conference.

    All documentary evidence and affidavits not submitted and all 
witnesses not identified at the prehearing conference shall be submitted 
or identified to the presiding officer as soon as possible, with a 
showing that the offering party had good cause for failing to so submit 
or identify at the prehearing conference. If the presiding officer 
determines that good cause does exist, the documents or affidavits shall 
be submitted or witnesses identified to all parties sufficiently in 
advance of the offer of such documents or affidavits or witnesses at the 
hearing to avoid prejudice or surprise to the other parties. If the 
presiding officer determines that good cause does not exist, he may 
refuse to admit as evidence such documents or affidavits or the 
testimony of such witnesses.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.58  Summary of testimony; affidavits.

to testify, be sworn or make affirmation.
    (b) Affidavits submitted at the prehearing conference or pursuant to 
Sec. 1316.57 with good cause may be examined by all parties and 
opposing affidavits may be submitted to the presiding officer within a 
period of time fixed by him. Affidavits admitted into evidence shall be 
considered in light of the lack of opportunity for cross-examination in 
determining the weight to be attached to statements made therein.

Redesignated at 38 FR 26609, Sept. 24, 1973]


<R05>

competent, relevant, material and not unduly repetitious.
    (b) Opinion testimony shall be admitted when the presiding officer

such authenticity at a later time upon a showing of good cause for 
failure to have filed such written objection.

at the hearing and may be described for purposes of the record, or may 
be admitted in evidence as exhibits.

request, shall be afforded opportunity to controvert such fact.

following documents:
    (1) The order to show cause or notice of hearing;

[[Page 179]]

    (2) Any notice of waiver or modification of rules made pursuant to 
Sec. 1316.44 or otherwise;
    (3) Any waiver of hearing (together with any statement filed

<R05>
Sec. 1316.60  Objections; offer of proof.

    If any party in the hearing objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or to other limitation of the scope of any examination or 
cross-examination, he shall state briefly the grounds for such objection 
without extended argument or debate thereon except as permitted by the 
presiding officer. A ruling of the presiding officer on any such 
objection shall be a part of the transcript together with such offer of 
proof as has been made if a proper foundation has been laid for its 
admission. An offer of proof made in connection with an objection taken 
to any ruling of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered 
oral testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance of the 
evidence which the party contends would be adduced by such testimony; 
and, if the excluded evidence consists of evidence in documentary or 
written form a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification 
and shall accompany the records as the offer of proof.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.61  Exceptions to rulings.

    Exceptions to rulings of the presiding officer are unnecessary. It 
is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the presiding 
officer is sought, makes known the action that he desires the presiding 
officer to take, or his objection to an action taken, and his grounds 
therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.62  Appeal from ruling of presiding officer.

    Rulings of the presiding officer may not be appealed to the 
Administrator prior to his consideration of the entire hearing, except 
with the consent of the presiding officer and where he certifies on the 
record or in writing that the allowance of an interlocutory appeal is 
clearly necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense, or prejudice to 
any party or substantial detriment to the public interest. If an appeal 
is allowed, any party in the hearing may file a brief in quintuplicate 
with the Administrator within such period that the presiding officer 
directs. No oral argument will be heard unless the Administrator directs 
otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.63  Official transcript; index; corrections.

    (a) Testimony given at a hearing shall be reported verbatim. The 
Administration will make provision for a stenographic record of the 
testimony and for such copies of the transcript thereof as it requires 
for its own purpose.
    (b) At the close of the hearing, the presiding officer shall afford 
the parties and witnesses time (not longer than 30 days, except in 
unusual cases) in which to submit written proposed corrections of the 
transcript, pointing out errors that may have been made in transcribing 
the testimony. The presiding officer shall promptly thereafter order 
such corrections made as in his judgment are required to make the 
transcript conform to the testimony.

specific and complete citations of the pages of the transcript and 
exhibits) and citations of authorities relied upon.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.65  Report and record.

    (a) As soon as practicable after the time for the parties to file 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law has expired, the 
presiding officer shall

[[Page 180]]

prepare a report containing the following:

party in the hearing. The report shall be considered to have been served 
when it is mailed to such party or its attorney of record.
    (c) Not less than twenty-five days after the date on which he caused 
copies of his report to be served upon the parties, the presiding

the facts and circumstances surrounding the seizure, to the United

forfeiture is brought. If the documents are not in satisfactory 
condition when first received, a reasonable time for correction may be 
allowed. If correction is not made within a reasonable time the 
documents may be treated as nugatory, and the case shall proceed as 
though they had not been tendered.
    (b) The filing of the claim and the posting of the bond does not 
entitle the claimant to possession of the property, however, it does 
stop the administrative forfeiture proceedings. The bond posted to cover 
corts may be in cash, certified check, or satisfactory sureties. The 
costs and expenses secured by the bond are such as are incurred after 
the filing of the bond including storage cost, safeguarding, court fees, 
marshal's costs, etc.

petition for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture. Such petition 
shall be filed in triplicate with the DEA Asset Forfeiture Section or

the property, if the property is subject to administrative forfeiture 
pursuant to Sec. 1316.77, and addressed to the Attorney General if the 
property is subject to judicial forfeiture pursuant to Sec. 1316.78. 
The petition must be executed and sworn to by the person alleging

description of the property, including motor and serial numbers, if any, 
and the date and place of seizure; (2) the petitioner's interest in the 
property, which shall be supported by bills of sale, contracts,

<R05>
Sec. 1316.90  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The following definitions, regulations, and criteria are 
designed to establish and implement procedures required by sections 6079 
and 6080 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-690 (102 
Stat. 4181). They are intended to supplement existing law and procedures 
relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified statutory 
authority. The provisions of these regulations do not affect the 
existing legal and equitable rights and remedies of those with an 
interest in property seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions 
relieve interested parties from their existing obligations and 
responsibilities in pursuing their interests through such courses of 
action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intent of Congress 
to minimize the adverse impact on those entitled to legal or equitable 
relief occasioned by the prolonged detention of property subject to 
forfeiture due to violations of law involving personal use quantities of 
controlled substances, and conveyances seized for drug-related offenses. 
The definition of personal use quantities of a controlled substance as 
contained herein is intended to distinguish between those quantities 
small in amount which are generally considered to be possessed for 
personal consumption and not for further distribution, and those larger 
quantities generally considered to be subject to further distribution.
    (b) In this regard, for violations involving the possession of 
personal use quantities of a controlled substance, section 6079(b)(2) 
requires either that administrative forfeiture be completed within 21 
days of the seizure of the property, or alternatively, that procedures 
are established that provide a means by which an individual entitled to 
relief may initiate an expedited administrative review of the legal and 
factual basis of the seizure for forfeiture. Should an individual 
request relief pursuant to these regulations and be entitled to the 
return of the seized property, such property shall be returned 
immediately following that determination, and the administrative 
forfeiture process shall cease. Should the individual not be entitled to 
the return of the seized property, however, the administrative 
forfeiture of that property shall proceed. The owner may, in any event, 
obtain release of property pending the administrative forfeiture by 
submitting to the agency making the determination, property sufficient 
to preserve the government's vested interest for purposes of the 
administrative forfeiture.
    (c) Section 6080 requires a similar expedited review by the Attorney 
General or his representative in those instances where a conveyance is 
being forfeited in a civil judicial proceeding following its seizure for 
a drug-related offense.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.91  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meanings 
specified:
    (a) The term Appraised Value means the estimated domestic price at 
the time of seizure at which such or similar property is freely offered 
for sale.
    (b) The term Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel means a vessel that:
    (1) Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of 
fish or an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the 
catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;
    (2) Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by 
gutting, decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or 
brine chilling; or

[[Page 185]]

    (3) Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports fish, 
fish products, or materials directly related to fishing or the 
preparation of fish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish 
tender vessel or fish processing facility.
    (c) The term Controlled Substance has the meaning given in section 
802 of title 21, United States Code (U.S.C.).
    (d) The term Drug-Related Offense means any proscribed offense which 
involves the possession, distribution, manufacture, cultivation, sale, 
transfer, or the attempt or conspiracy to possess, distribute, 
manufacture, cultivate, sell or transfer any substance the possession of 
which is prohibited by Title 21, U.S.C.
    (e) The term Immediately means within 20 days of the filing of a 
petition for expedited release by an owner.
    (f) The term Interested Party means one who was in legal possession 
of the property at the time of seizure and is entitled to legal 
possession at the time of the granting of the petition for expedited 
release. This includes a lienholder (to the extent of his interest in 
the property) whose claim is in writing (except for a maritime lien 
which need not be in writing), unless the collateral is in the posession 
of the secured party. The agreement securing such lien must create or 
provide for a security interest in the collateral, describe the 
collateral, and be signed by the debtor.
    (g) The term Legal and Factual Basis of the Seizure means a 
statement of the applicable law under which the property is seized, and 
a statement of the circumstances of the seizure sufficiently precise to 
enable an owner or other interested party to identify the date, place, 
and use or acquisition which makes the property subject to forfeiture.
    (h) The term Normal and Customary Manner means that inquiry 
suggested by particular facts and circumstances which would customarily 
be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual in a like or similar 
situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and circumstances is 
unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive knowledge is 
sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is persuasive but 
not conclusive or controlling in determining whether an owner acted in a 
normal and customary manner to ascertain how property would be used by 
another legally in possession of the property. The failure to act in a 
normal and customary manner as defined herein will result in the denial 
of a petition for expedited release of the property and is intended to 
have the desirable effect of inducing owners of the property to exercise 
greater care in transferring possession of their property.
    (i) The term Owner means one having a legal and possessory interest 
in the property seized for forfeiture. Even though one may hold primary 
and direct title to the property seized, such person may not have 
sufficient actual beneficial interest in the property to support a 
petition as owner if the facts indicate that another person had dominion 
and control over the property.
    (j) The term Personal Use Quantities means possession of controlled 
substances in circumstances where there is no other evidence of an 
intent to distribute, of to facilitate the manufacturing, compounding, 
processing, delivering, importing or exporting of any controlled 
substance. Evidence of personal use quantities shall not include 
sweepings or other evidence of possession of quantities of a controlled 
substance for other than personal use.
    (1) Such other evidence shall include:
    (i) Evidence, such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia, 
drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug 
``cutting'' agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to 
process, package or distribute a controlled substance;
    (ii) Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a 
controlled substance with intent to distribute;
    (iii) The arrest and/or conviction record of the person or persons 
in actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for 
offenses under Federal, State or local law that indicates an intent to 
distribute a controlled substance;
    (iv) The controlled substance is related to large amounts of cash or 
any amount of prerecorded government funds;

[[Page 186]]

    (v) The controlled substance is possessed under circumstances that 
indicate such a controlled substance is a sample intended for 
distribution in anticipation of a transaction involving large 
quantities, or is part of a larger delivery; or
    (vi) Statements by the possessor, or otherwise attributable to the 
possessor, including statements of conspirators, that indicate 
possession with intent to distribute.
    (2) Possession of a controlled substance shall be presumed to be for 
personal use when there are no indicia of illicit drug trafficking or 
distribution such as, but not limited to, the factors listed above and 
the amounts do not exceed the following quantities:
    (i) One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of heroin;
    (ii) One gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable 
amount of--
    (A) Coca leaves, except coba leaves and extracts of coca leaves frol 
which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivations of ecgonine or their salts have 
been removed;
    (B) Cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of 
isomers;

controlled substances in personal use quantities the owner may petition 
the seizing agency for expedited release of the property.
    (b) Where property described in paragraph (a) of this section is a 
commercial fishing industry vessel proceeding to or from a fishing area 
or intermediate port of call or actually engaged in fishing operations, 
which would be subject to seizure for administrative forfeiture for a 
violation of law involving controlled substances in personal use 
quantities, a summons to appear shall be issued in lieu of a physical 
seizure. The vessel shall report to the port designated in the summons. 
The seizing agency shall be authorized to effect administrative 
forfeiture as if the vessel had been physically seized. Upon answering 
the summons to appear on or prior to the last reporting date specified 
in the summons, the

[[Page 187]]

owner of the vessel may file a petition for expedited release pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section and the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section and other provishons in this subpart pertaining to a 
petition for expedited release shall apply as if the vessel had been 
physically seized.
    (c) The owner filing the petition for expedited release shall 
establish the following:
    (1) The owner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized 
property as owner or otherwise;
    (2) The owner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the 
property in a normal and customary manner; and
    (3) The owner did not know or consent to the illegal use of the 
property, or in the event that the owner knew or should have known of 
the illegal use, the owner did what reasonably could be expected to 
prevent the violation.
    (d) In addition to those factors listed in paragraph (c) of this 
section, if an owner can demonstrate that the owner has other statutory 
rights or defenses that would cause the owner to prevail on the issue of 
forfeiture, such factors shall also be considered in ruling on the 
petition for expedited release.
    (e) A petition for expedited release must be filed in a timely 
manner to be considered by the seizing agency. In order to be filed in a 
timely manner, the petition must be received by the appropriate seizing 
agency within 20 days from the date of the first publication of the 
notice of seizure. The petition must be executed and sworn to by the 
owner and both the envelope and the request must be clearly marked 
``PETITION FOR EXPEDITED RELEASE.'' Such petition shall be filed in 
triplicate with the Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field 
office in the judicial district in which the property was seized, 
depending upon which agency seized the property. The petition shall be 
addressed to the Director of the FBI or to the Administrator of the DEA,

forfeiture action.

    (a) Upon receipt of a petition for expedited release filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1316.92(a), the seizing agency shall determine first whether a 
final administrative determination of the case, without regard to the 
provisions of this subpart, can be made within 21 days of the seizure. 
If such a final administrative determination is made within 21 days, no 
further action need be taken under this subpart.
    (b) If no such final administrative determination is made within 21 
days of the seizure, the following procedure shall apply. The seizing 
agency shall, within 20 days after the receipt of the petition for 
expedited release, determine whether the petition filed by the owner has 
established the factors listed in Sec. 1316.92(c) and:
    (1) If the seizing agency determines that those factors have been 
established, it shall terminate the administrative proceedings and 
return the property to the owner (or in the case of a commercial fishing 
industry vessel for which a summons has been issued shall dismiss the 
summons), except where it is evidence of a violation of law; or
    (2) If the seizing agency determines that those factors have not 
been established, the agency shall proceed with the administrative 
forfeiture.

release of the property by posting a substitute res with the seizing 
agency. The

[[Page 188]]

property will be released to the owner upon the payment of an amount 
equal to the appraised value of the property if it is not evidence of a 
violation of law or has design or other characteristics that 
particularly suit it for use in illegal activities. This payment must be 
in the form of a traveler's check, a money order, a cashier's check or 
an irrevocable letter of credit made payable to the seizing agency. A 
bond in the form of a cashier's check will be considered as paid once 
the check has been accepted for payment by the financial institution 
which issued the check.
    (b) If a substitute res is posted and the property is 
administratively forfeited, the seizing agency will forfeit the 
substitute res in lieu of the property.


<R05>

forfeiture action.

    (a) Where a conveyance has been seized and is being forfeited in a 
judicial proceeding for a drug-related offense, the owner may petition 
the United States Attorney for an expedited release of the conveyance.

establish the following:
    (1) The owner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized 
conveyance as owner or otherwise;
    (2) The owner has statutory rights or defenses that would show to a 
substantial probability that the owner would prevail on the issue of 
forfeiture;
    (3) The owner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the 
conveyance in a normal and customary manner; and
    (4) The owner did not know or consent to the illegal use of the

manner in order to be considered by the United States Attorney. To be 
considered as filed in a timely manner, the petition must be received by 
the appropriate United States Attorney within 20 days from the date of 
the first publication of the notice of the action and arrest of the 
property, or within 30 days after filing of the claim, whichever occurs 
later. The petition must be executed and sworn to by the owner, and both 
the envelope and the request must be clearly marked ``PETITION FOR 
EXPEDITED RELEASE.'' Such petition shall be filed in triplicate and 
addressed to and filed with the United States Attorney prosecuting the 
conveyance for forfeiture with a copy to the seizing agency.
    (d) The petition shall include the following:
    (1) A complete description of the conveyance, including the 
identification number, and the date and place of seizure;

seized conveyance.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.96  Ruling on a petition for expedited release of a conveyance 
in a judicial forfeiture action.

    (a) Upon receipt of a petition for expedited release filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1316.95, the United States Attorney shall rule on the petition 
within 20 days of receipt. A petition shall be deemed filed on the date 
it is received by the United States Attorney.
    (b) If the United States Attorney does not rule on the petition for 
expedited release within 20 days after the date on which it is filed, 
the conveyance shall be returned to the owner or interested party 
pending further forfeiture proceedings, except where it is evidence of a 
violation of law. Release of conveyance under provisions of this 
paragraph shall not affect the forfeiture action with respect to that 
conveyance.
    (c) Upon a favorable ruling on the petition for expedited release, 
the United States Attorney shall, where necessary, move to terminate the 
judicial proceedings against the conveyance and immediately direct the 
return of the conveyance except where it is evidence of a violation of 
law.

[[Page 189]]

    (d) If, within 20 days, the United States Attorney denies the 
petition for expedited release, the government shall retain possession 
of the conveyance until the owner provides a substitute res bond 
pursuant to Sec. 1316.98 or the forfeiture is finalized.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.97  Initiating judicial forfeiture proceeding against a conveyance 
within 60 days of the filing of a claim and cost bond.

    (a) The United States Attorney shall file a complaint for forfeiture 
of the conveyance within 60 days of the filing of the claim and cost 
bond.
    (b) Upon the failure of the United States Attorney to file a 
complaint for forfeiture of a conveyance within 60 days unless the court 
extends the 60-day period following a showing of good cause, or unless 
the owner and the United States Attorney agree to such an extension, the 
court shall order the return of the conveyance and the return of any 
bond.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.98  Substitute res bond in a judicial forfeiture action against 
a conveyance.

    (a) Where a conveyance is being forfeited in a judicial proceeding 
for a drug-related offense, the owner may obtain release of the property 
by filing a substitute res bond with the seizing agency. The conveyance 
will be released to the owner upon the payment of a bond in the amount 
of the appraised value of the conveyance if it is not evidence of a 
violation of law or has design or other characteristics that 
particularly suit it for use in illegal activities. This bond must be in 
the form of a traveler's check, a money order, a cashier's check or an 
irrevocable letter of credit made payable to the Department of Justice 
or to the United States Customs Service depending on which agency seized 
the conveyance. A bond in the form of a cashier's check will be 
considered as paid once the check has been accepted for payment by the 
financial institution which issued the check.
    (b) If a substitute res bond is filed and the conveyance is 
judicially forfeited, the court will forfeit the bond in lieu of the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.99  Notice provisions.

    (a) Special notice provision. At the time of seizure of property 
defined in Sec. 1316.91 for violations involving the possession of

petition for expedited release and for the posting of a substitute res 
bond as set forth in sections 6079 and 6080 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act 
of 1988 and implementing regulations.
    (b) Standard notice provision. The standard notice to the owner as 
required by title 19, U.S.C., section 1607 and applicable regulations, 
shall be made at the earliest practicable opportunity after determining 
ownership of the seized property or conveyance and shall include the 
legal and factual basis of the seizure.

Sec. 1401.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to prescribe rules, guidelines and

amended, 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.2  The Office of National Drug Control Policy--organization 
and functions.

    (a) The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was created 
by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., and 
reestablished under 21 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. The mission of ONDCP is to

of the Federal government, to consult with States and localities and 
assist their anti-drug efforts, to conduct a national media campaign, 
and to annually promulgate the National Drug Control Strategy.
    (b) ONDCP is headed by the Director of National Drug Control Policy. 
The Director is assisted by a Deputy Director of National Drug Control 
Policy, a Deputy Director for Supply Reduction, a Deputy Director for 
Demand Reduction, and a Deputy Director for State and Local Affairs.
    (c) Offices within ONDCP include Chief of Staff, and the Offices of 
Legal Counsel, Strategic Planning, Legislative Affairs, Programs Budget 
and Evaluation, Supply Reduction, Demand Reduction, Public Affairs, 
State and Local Affairs, and the Financial Management Office.

telephone, they may call the Office of Public Affairs at (202) 395-6618. 
This number should not be used to make FOIA requests. All oral requests 
for information under FOIA will be rejected.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.3  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part:
    (a) All the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act apply.
    (b) Commercial-use request means a request from or on behalf of one 
who seeks information for a cause or purpose that furthers the 
commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person or 
institution on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether 
a requester properly belongs in this category, ONDCP will consider the 
intended use of the information.
    (c) Direct costs means the expense actually expended to search, 
review, or duplicate in response to a FOIA request. For example, direct 
costs include 116% of the salary of the employee performing work and the 
actual costs incurred while operating equipment.
    (d) Duplicate means the process of making a copy of a document. Such 
copies may take the form of paper, microform, audio-visual materials, or 
machine-readable documentation. ONDCP will provide a copy of the 
material in a form that is usable by the requester.
    (e) Educational institution means preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher 
education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution 
of professional education, or an institution of vocational education 
that operates a program or programs of scholarly research.

[[Page 194]]

    (f) Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is defined in this 
section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting 
scientific research not intended to promote any particular product or 
industry.
    (g) Records and any other terms used in this part in reference to 
information includes any information that would be an agency record 
subject to the requirements of this part when maintained in any format, 
including electronic format.
    (h) Representative of the news media means any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. News is information about current 
events or information that would be of interest to the public. Examples 
of the news media include television or radio stations that broadcast to 
the public at large and publishers of news periodicals that make their 
products available to the general public for purchase or subscription. 
Freelance journalists may be regarded as working for the news media 
where they demonstrate a reasonable basis for expecting publication 
through that organization, even though not actually employed by it.
    (i) Request means a letter or other written communication seeking 
records or information under FOIA.
    (j) Review means the process of examining documents that are located 
during a search to determine if any portion should lawfully be withheld. 
It is the processing of determining disclosability.
    (k) Search means to review, manually or by automated means, agency 
records for the purpose of locating those records responsive to a 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.4  Access to information.

    The Office of National Drug Control Policy makes available 
information pertaining to matters issued, adopted, or promulgated by 
ONDCP, that are within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). A public reading 
area and the ONDCP FOIA Handbook are located at http://
www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/about/about.html.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.5  How to request records.

    (a) Each request must reasonably describe the record(s) sought 
including the type of document, specific event or action, originator of 
the record, date or time period, subject matter, location, and all other 
pertinent data.
    (b) Requests must be received by ONDCP through the mail or by 
electronic facsimile transmission. Mailed requests must be addressed to 
Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, Office of Legal Counsel, Washington, DC 20503. The applicable 
fax number is (202) 395-5543.
    (c) The words ``FOIA REQUEST'' or ``REQUEST FOR RECORDS'' must be 
clearly marked on the cover-letter, letter and envelope. The time 
limitations imposed by Sec. 1401.7 will not begin until the Office of 
the General Counsel identifies a letter or fax as a FOIA request.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.6  Expedited process.

    (a) Requests and appeals will be given expedited treatment whenever 
ONDCP determines either:
    (1) The lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to 
pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; 
or
    (2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged 
federal government activity occurs and the request is made by a person 
primarily engaged in disseminating information.
    (b) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of 
the initial request for records or at a later time.
    (c) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a 
statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's 
knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting 
expedited processing. A requester within the category in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section also must establish a particular urgency to 
inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, 
beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. 
The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of 
administrative discretion.
    (d) Within ten days of receipt of a request for expedited 
processing, ONDCP will decide whether to grant it and will

[[Page 195]]

notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited 
treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and will be 
processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing 
is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.7  Prompt response.

    The General Counsel, or designee, will determine within 20 days 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the 
receipt of a FOIA request whether it is appropriate to grant the request 
and will provide written notification to the person making the request. 
If the request is denied, the written notification will include the 
names of the individuals who participated in the determination, the 
reasons for the denial, and that an appeal may be lodged within the 
Office of National Drug Control Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.8  Extension of time.

    (a) In unusual circumstances, the Office of General Counsel may 
extend the time limit prescribed in Sec. 1401.7 or Sec. 1401.9 by 
written notice to the FOIA requester. The notice will state the reasons 
for the extension and the date a determination is expected. The 
extension period may be divided among the initial request and an appeal 
but will not exceed a total of 10 working days (excepting Saturdays, 
Sundays, or legal public holidays).
    (b) The phrase ``unusual circumstances'' means:
    (1) The requested records are located in establishments that are 
separated from the office processing the request;
    (2) A voluminous amount of separate and distinct records are 
demanded in a single request; or
    (3) Another agency or two or more components in the same agency have 
substantial interest in the determination of the request.
    (c) Where unusual circumstance exist, ONDCP may provide an 
opportunity for amendment of the initial request so that the request may 
be timely processed. Refusal by the person to reasonably modify the 
request or arrange an alternative time frame shall be considered as a 
factor for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(6)(C).
    (d) ONDCP may aggregate requests by a requester or a group of 
requestors where multiple requests reasonably appear to be a single 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.9  Appeals.

    An appeal to the ONDCP must explain in writing the legal and factual 
basis for the appeal. It must be received by mail at the address 
specified in Sec. 1401.5 within 30 days of receipt of a denial. The 
Director or designee will decide the appeal within 20 days (excepting 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the Director or 
designee deny an appeal in whole or in part, the written determination 
will contain the reason for the denial, the names of the individuals who 
participated in the determination, and the provisions for judicial 
review.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.10  Fees to be charged--general.

    ONDCP will recoup the full allowable costs it incurs in response to 
a FOIA request.

commercial use.
    (3) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. ONDCP will 
charge the cost of reproduction, excluding charges for the first 100 
pages. Requesters must meet the criteria in Sec. 1401.3(h), and the 
request must not be made for a commercial use. A request that supports 
the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered 
a commercial use.
    (4) All other requesters. ONDCP will recover the full direct cost of 
the search and the reproduction of records, excluding the first 100 
pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time. Requests 
for records concerning the requester will be treated under the fee 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, which permits fees 
only for reproduction.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.13  Waiver or reduction of fees.

    Fees chargeable in connection with a request may be waived or 
reduced where ONDCP determines that disclosure is in the public interest 
because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding 
of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily 
in the commercial interest of the requester.

Sec. 1402.1  Purpose.

    Other government agencies, U.S. citizens or permanent resident 
aliens may request that classified information in files of the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) be reviewed for possible 
declassification and release. This part prescribes the procedures for 
such review and subsequent release or denial.

[[Page 197]]


<R05>
Sec. 1402.2  Responsibility.

    All requests for the mandatory declassification review of classified 
information in ONDCP files should be addressed to the Security Officer, 
Office of National Drug Control Policy, Executive Office of the 
President, Washington, DC 20500, who will acknowledge receipt of the 
request. When a request does not reasonably describe the information 
sought, the requester shall be notified that unless additional 
information is provided, or the scope of the request is narrowed, no 
further action will be taken.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.3  Information in the custody of ONDCP.

    Information contained in ONDCP files and under the exclusive 
declassification jurisdiction of ONDCP will be reviewed by the Director 
of the Office of Planning, Budget, and Administration of ONDCP and/or 
the office of primary interest to determine whether, under the 
declassification provisions of section 3.1 of Executive Order 12356 (3 
CFR, 1982 Comp., p. 166), the requested information may be declassified. 
If the information may not be released, in whole or in part, the 
requester shall be given a brief statement as to the reasons for denial, 
a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the Director of 
ONDCP, and a notice that such an appeal must be filed within 60 days in 
order to be considered.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.4  Information classified by another agency.

    When a request is received for information that was classified by 
another agency, the Director of the Office of Planning, Budget, and 
Administration of ONDCP will forward the request and a copy of the 
document(s) along with any other related materials, to the appropriate 
agency for review and determination as to release. Recommendations as to 
release or denial may be made if appropriate. The requester will be 
notified of the referral, unless the receiving agency objects on the 
grounds that its association with the information requires protection.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.5  Appeal procedure.

    Appeals reviewed as a result of a denial will be routed to the 
Director of ONDCP, who will take action as necessary to determine 
whether any part of the information may be declassified. If so, the 
Director shall notify the requester of this determination and shall make 
any information available that is declassified and is otherwise 
releasable. If continued classification is required, the requester shall 
be notified by the Director of ONDCP of the reasons therefore.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.6  Fees.

    There will normally be no fees charged for the mandatory review of 
classified material for declassification under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.7  Suggestions and complaints.

    Suggestions and complaints regarding the information security 
program of ONDCP should be submitted, in writing, to the Security 
Officer, Office of National Drug Control Policy, Washington, DC 20500.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 1403.1  Purpose and scope of this part.

    This part establishes uniform administrative rules for Federal 
grants and cooperative agreements and subawards to State, local and 
Indian tribal governments.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.2  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains general rules pertaining to this part and 
procedures for control of exceptions from this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for:
    (1) Goods and other tangible property received;
    (2) Services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees; and
    (3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current 
services or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance 
claims, and other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of:
    (1) Earnings during a given period from services performed by the 
grantee and goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers, 
and
    (2) Amounts becoming owed to the grantee for which no current 
services or performance is required by the grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from ``programmatic'' 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means:
    (1) With respect to a grant, the Federal agency, and
    (2) With respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash contributions.

[[Page 199]]

    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for ``grant'' and 
``subgrant'' in this section and except where qualified by ``Federal'') 
a procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a 
procurement subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means:
    (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269 ``Financial Status 
Report'' (or other equivalent report);
    (2) For construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 
Stat. 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for 
the special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) means charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and service, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of in-kind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.

[[Page 200]]

    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of ``grant'' in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than 
``equipment'' as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either
    (1) Temporary withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds 
pending corrective action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to 
terminate the grant, or
    (2) In action taken by a suspending official in accordance with 
agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. ``Termination'' does not include:
    (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's 
underestimate of the unobligated balance in a prior period;
    (2) Withdrawal of the unobligated balance as of the expiration of a 
grant;
    (3) Refusal to extend a grant or award additional funds, to make a 
competing or noncompeting continuation, renewal, extension, or 
supplemental award; or
    (4) Voiding of a grant upon determination that the award was 
obtained fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from 
inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined

[[Page 201]]

by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative funds 
authorized.

<R04>
                    Subpart B_Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1403.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive Order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the States will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and

[[Page 203]]

its effective date but need submit for approval only the amended 
portions of the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grantee or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals;
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions; and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
                    Subpart C_Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 1403.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expend and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information

[[Page 204]]

must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as canceled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time 
and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible the 
grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest

[[Page 205]]

earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments 
for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 1403.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

                                             acceptable to the Federal
                                             agency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 1403.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.

[[Page 206]]

    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal cost-sharing 
requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind 
contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of another 
Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any other 
award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 1403.25, shall not count towards satisfying 
a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly 
permitted in the terms of the assistant agreement. (This use of general 
program income is described in Sec. 1403.25(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:

[[Page 207]]

    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 1403.22, in the same way as depreciation 
or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donates real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal

[[Page 208]]

funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement 
will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use of rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc., and interest earned 
on any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments levies, fines, 
and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 1403.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1403.31 and 
Sec. 1403.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award

[[Page 209]]

period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see 
paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the 
Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 
1403.36 shall be followed.

[57 FR 55092, Nov. 24, 1992, as amended at 62 FR 45939, 45941, Aug. 29, 
1997]

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 1403.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 1403.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types 
of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants 
and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct

[[Page 210]]

payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from 
nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 1403.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, 
supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget format the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1403.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for those purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. 
However, in those situations were a grantee or subgrantee is disposing 
of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement 
real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the 
disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency.

[[Page 211]]

The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by applying the 
awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the 
original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any 
actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant is 
still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 1403.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed

[[Page 212]]

for the original project or program or for other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment 
will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 1403.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension.''


<R05>
Sec. 1403.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will

[[Page 213]]

follow paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.

[[Page 214]]

    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 1403.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

[[Page 215]]

    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed. (1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 1403.36(d)(2)(i) 
apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types

[[Page 216]]

of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the 
proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.

[[Page 217]]

    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1403.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
constructing cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is

[[Page 218]]

one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all 
the contractor's obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)
    (4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 
874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3). 
(All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)
    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or 
requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive 
Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR 
part 15). (Contracts, subcontracts, and subgrants of amounts in excess 
of $100,000).
    (13) Mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency 
which are contained in the state energy conservation plan issued in

Sec. 1403.37  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow state law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a

[[Page 219]]

cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to 
local and Indian tribal governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 1403.42 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part 
do not apply to the award and administration of subgrants:
    (1) Section 1403.10;
    (2) Section 1403.11;

              Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 1403.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.

[[Page 220]]

    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decision making purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required 
in accordance with paragraph Sec. 1403.41(e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, 
the grantee shall not be

[[Page 221]]

required to convert its accounting system but shall develop such accrual 
information through an analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter of credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 1403.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs--(1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method. (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction 
grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, 
however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, 
specified in Sec. 1403.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 1403.41(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance. (i) When a 
construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays 
to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will 
provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and

[[Page 222]]

due date shall be governed by Sec. 1403.41(b) (3) and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 1403.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 1403.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 1403.41(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1403.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this Part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 1403.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantees.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at 
which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage 
chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.

[[Page 223]]

    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records. Unless 
required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are 
not required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to Debarment and Suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 1403.35).


<R05>
Sec. 1403.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 1403.43 awards may be terminated in 
whole or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the

[[Page 224]]

case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 
1403.43 or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                 Subpart D_After-The-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1403.50  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this time frame. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report: In accordance with Sec. 
1403.32(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of all federally owned 
property (as distinct from property acquired with grant funds) for which 
it is accountable and request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.51  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 1403.42;
    (d) Property management requirements in Sec. 1403.31 and Sec. 
1403.32; and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 1403.26.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.52  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursement,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR ch. II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

Subpart E--Entitlement [Reserved]

Appendix A to Part 1403--OMB Circular A-128, ``Audits of State and Local 
                              Governments''

Circular No. A-128
April 12, 1985.

[[Page 225]]

To the Heads of Executive Departments and Establishments
Subject: Audits of State and Local Governments.
    1. Purpose. This Circular is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act 
of 1984, Pub. L. 98-502. It establishes audit requirements for State and 
local governments that receive Federal aid, and defines Federal 
responsibilities for implementing and monitoring those requirements.
    2. Supersession. The Circular supersedes Attachment P, ``Audit 
Requirements,'' of Circular A-102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to 
State and local governments.''
    3. Background. The Single Audit Act builds upon earlier efforts to 
improve audits of Federal aid programs. The Act requires State or local 
governments that receive $100,000 or more a year in Federal funds to 
have an audit made for that year. Section 7505 of the Act requires the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prescribe policies, 
procedures and guidelines to implement the Act. It specifies that the 
Director shall designate ``cognizant'' Federal agencies, determine 
criteria for making appropriate charges to federal programs for the cost 
of audits, and provide procedures to assure that small firms or firms 
owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals have the opportunity 
to participate in contracts for single audits.
    4. Policy. The Single Audit Act requires the following:
    a. State or local governments that receive $100,000 or more a year 
in Federal financial assistance shall have an audit made in accordance 
with this Circular.
    b. State or local governments that receive between $25,000 and 
$100,000 a year shall have an audit made in accordance with this 
Circular, or in accordance with Federal laws and regulations governing 
the programs they participate in.
    c. State or local governments that receive less than $25,000 a year 
shall be exempt from compliance with the Act and other Federal audit 
requirements. These State and local governments shall be governed by 
audit requirements prescribed by State or local law or regulation.
    d. Nothing in this paragraph exempts State or local governments from 
maintaining records of Federal financial assistance or from providing 
access to such records to Federal agencies, as provided for in Federal 
law or in Circular A-102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to state or 
local governments.''
    5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Circular the following

loans, loan guarantees, property, interest subsidies, insurance, or 
direct appropriations, but does not include direct Federal cash 
assistance to individuals. It includes awards received directly from 
Federal agencies, or indirectly through other units of States and local 
governments.
    c. Federal agency has the same meaning as the term ``agency'' in 
section 551(1) of Title 5, United States Code.
    d. Generally accepted accounting principles has the meaning

    (1) Resource use is consistent with laws, regulations, and policies;
    (2) Resources are safeguarded against waste, loss, and misuse; and
    (3) Reliable data are obtained, maintained, and fairly disclosed in 
reports.
    h. Indian tribe means any Indian tribe, band, nations, or other 
organized group or community, including any Alaskan Native village or 
regional or village corporations (as defined in, or established under, 
the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act) that is recognized by the 
United States as eligible for the special programs and services provided 
by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.
    i. Local government means any unit of local government within a 
State, including a county, a borough, municipality, city, town, 
township, parish, local public authority, special district, school 
district, intrastate district, council of government, and any other

    6. Scope of audit. The Single Act provides that:
    a. The audit shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance 
with generally accepted government auditing standards covering financial 
and compliance audits.
    b. The audit shall cover the entire operations of a State or local 
government or, at the option of that government, it may cover 
departments, agencies or establishments that received, expended, or 
otherwise administered Federal financial assistance during the year. 
However, if a State or local government receives $25,000 or more in 
General Revenue Sharing Funds in a fiscal year, it shall have an audit 
of its entire operations. A series of audits of individual departments, 
agencies, and establishments for the same fiscal year may be considered 
a single audit.
    c. Public hospitals and public colleges and universities may be 
excluded from State and local audits and the requirements of this 
Circular. However, if such entities are excluded, audits of these 
entities shall be made in accordance with statutory requirements and the 
provisions of Circular A-110, ``Uniform requirements for grants to 
universities, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations.''
    d. The auditor shall determine whether:
    (1) The financial statements of the government, department, agency 
or establishment present fairly its financial position and the results 
of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles;
    (2) The organization has internal accounting and other control 
systems to provide reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal 
financial assistance programs in compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations; and
    (3) The organization has complied with laws and regulations that may 
have material effect on its financial statements and on each major 
Federal assistance program.
    7. Frequency of audit. Audits shall be made annually unless the 
State or local government has, by January 1, 1987, a constitutional or 
statutory requirement for less frequent audits. For those governments, 
the cognizant agency shall permit biennial audits, covering both years, 
if the government so requests. It shall also honor requests for biennial 
audits by governments that have an administrative policy calling for 
audits less frequent than annual, but only for fiscal years beginning 
before January 1, 1987.
    8. Internal control and compliance reviews. The Single Audit Act 
requires that the independent auditor determine and report on whether 
the organization has internal control systems to provide reasonable 
assurance that it is managing Federal assistance programs in compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations.
    a. Internal control review. In order to provide this assurance the 
auditor must make a study and evaluation of internal control systems 
used in administering Federal assistance programs. The study and 
evaluation must be made whether or not the auditor intends to place 
reliance on such systems. As part of this review, the auditor shall:
    (1) Test whether these internal control systems are functioning in 
accordance with prescribed procedures.
    (2) Examine the recipient's system for monitoring subrecipients and 
obtaining and acting on subrecipient audit reports.
    b. Compliance review. The law also requires the auditor to determine 
whether the organization has complied with laws and regulations that may 
have a material effect on each major Federal assistance program.
    (1) In order to determine which major programs are to be tested for 
compliance, State and local governments shall identify in their accounts 
all Federal funds received and expended and the programs under which 
they were received. This shall include funds received directly from 
Federal agencies and through other State and local governments.
    (2) The review must include the selection and testing of a 
representative number of charges from each major Federal assistance 
program. The selection and testing of transactions shall be based on the 
auditor's professional judgment considering such factors as the amount 
of expenditures for the program and the individual awards; the newness 
of the program or changes in its conditions; prior experience with the 
program, particularly as revealed in audits and other evaluations (e.g., 
inspections program reviews); the extent to which the program is carried 
out through subrecipients; the extent to which the program contracts for 
goods or services; the level to which the program is already subject to 
program reviews or other forms of independent oversight; the adequacy of 
the controls for ensuring compliance; the exception of adherence or lack 
of adherence to the applicable laws and regulations; and the potential 
impact of adverse findings.

[[Page 227]]

    (a) In making the test of transactions, the auditor shall determine 
whether:
--The amounts reported as expenditures were for allowable services, and
--The records show that those who received services or benefits were 
eligible to receive them.
    (b) In addition to transaction testing, the auditor shall determine 
whether:
--Matching requirements, levels of effort and earmarking limitations 
were met,
--Federal financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements 
contain information that is supported by the books and records from 
which the basic financial statements have been prepared, and
--Amounts claimed or used for matching were determined in accordance 
with OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost principles for State and local 
governments,'' and Attachment F of Circular A-102, ``Uniform 
requirements for grants to State and local governments.''
    (c) The principal compliance requirements of the largest Federal aid 
programs may be ascertained by referring to the Compliance Supplement 
for Single Audits of State and Local Governments, issued by OMB and 
available from the Government Printing Office. For those programs not 
covered in the Compliance Supplement, the auditor may ascertain 
compliance requirements by researching the statutes, regulations, and 
agreements governing individual programs.
    (3) Transactions related to other Federal assistance programs that 
are selected in connection with examinations of financial statements and 
evaluations of internal controls shall be tested for compliance with 
Federal laws and regulations that apply to such transactions.
    9. Subrecipients. State or local governments that receive Federal 
financial assistance and provide $25,000 or more of it in a fiscal year 
to a subrecipient shall:
    a. Determine whether State or local subrecipients have met the audit 
requirements of this Circular and whether subrecipients covered by 
Circular A-110, ``Uniform requirements for grants to universities, 
hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations,'' have met that 
requirement;
    b. Determine whether the subrecipient spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subrecipient made in 
accordance with this Circular, Circular A-110, or through other means 
(e.g., program reviews) if the subrecipient has not yet had such an 
audit;
    c. Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instances of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    d. Consider whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of 
the recipient's own records; and
    e. Require each subrecipient to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements as necessary to comply 
with this Circular.
    10. Relation to other audit requirements. The Single Audit Act 
provides that an audit made in accordance with this Circular shall be in 
lieu of any financial or financial compliance audit required under 
individual Federal assistance programs. To the extent that a single 
audit provides Federal agencies with information and assurances they 
need to carry out their overall responsibilities, they shall rely upon 
and use such information. However, a Federal agency shall make any 
additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities 
under Federal law and regulation. Any additional Federal audit effort 
shall be planned and carried out in such a way as to avoid duplication.
    a. The provisions of this Circular do not limit the authority of 
Federal agencies to make, or contract for audits and evaluations of 
Federal financial assistance programs, nor do they limit the authority 
of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal audit official.
    b. The provisions of this Circular do not authorize any State or 
local government or subrecipient thereof to constrain Federal agencies, 
in any manner, from carrying out additional audits.
    c. A Federal agency that makes or contracts for audits in addition 
to the audits made by recipients pursuant to this Circular shall, 
consistent with other applicable laws and regulations, arrange for 
funding the cost of such additional audits. Such additional audits 
include economy and efficiency audits, program results audits, and 
program evaluations.
    11. Cognizant agency responsibilities. The Single Audit Act provides 
for cognizant Federal agencies to oversee the implementation of this 
Circular.
    a. The Office of Management and Budget will assign cognizant 
agencies for States and their subdivisions and larger local governments 
and their subdivisions. Other Federal agencies may participate with an 
assigned cognizant agency, in order to fulfill the cognizance 
responsibilities. Smaller governments not assigned a cognizant agency 
will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency that provides 
them the most funds whether directly or indirectly.
    b. A cognizant agency shall have the following responsibilities:
    (1) Ensure that audits are made and reports are received in a timely 
manner and in accordance with the requirements of this Circular.

[[Page 228]]

    (2) Provide technical advice and liaison to State and local 
governments and independent auditors.
    (3) Obtain or make quality control reviews of selected audits made 
by non-Federal audit organizations, and provide the results, when 
appropriate, to other interested organizations.
    (4) Promptly inform other affected Federal agencies and appropriate 
Federal law enforcement officials of any reported illegal acts or 
irregularities. They should also inform State or local law enforcement 
and prosecuting authorities, if not advised by the recipient, of any 
violation of law within their jurisdiction.
    (5) Advise the recipient of audits that have been found not to have 
met the requirements set forth in this Circular. In such instances, the 
recipient will be expected to work with the auditor to take corrective 
action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency shall 
notify the recipient and Federal awarding agencies of the facts and make 
recommendations for followup action. Major inadequacies or repetitive 
substandard performance of independent auditors shall be referred to 
appropriate professional bodies for disciplinary action.
    (6) Coordinate, to the extent practicable, audits made by or for 
Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to 
this Circular; so that the additional audits build upon such audits.
    (7) Oversee the resolution of audit findings that affect the 
programs of more than one agency.
    12. Illegal acts or irregularities. If the auditor becomes aware of 
illegal acts or other irregularities, prompt notice shall be given to 
recipient management officials above the level of involvement. (See also 
paragraph 13(a)(3) below for the auditor's reporting responsibilities.) 
The recipient, in turn, shall promptly notify the cognizant agency of 
the illegal acts or irregularities and of proposed and actual actions, 
if any. Illegal acts and irregularities include such matters as 
conflicts of interest, falsification of records or reports, and 
misappropriations of funds or other assets.
    13. Audit reports. Audit reports must be prepared at the completion 
of the audit. Reports serve many needs of State and local governments as 
well as meeting the requirements of the Single Audit Act.
    a. The audit report shall state that the audit was made in 
accordance with the provisions of this Circular. The report shall be 
made up of at least:
    (1) The auditor's report on financial statements and on a schedule 
of Federal assistance; the financial statements; and a schedule of 
Federal assistance, showing the total expenditures for each Federal 
assistance program as identified in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance. Federal programs or grants that have not been assigned a 
catalog number shall be identified under the caption ``other Federal 
assistance.''
    (2) The auditor's report on the study and evaluation of internal 
control systems must identify the organization's significant internal 
accounting controls, and those controls designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that Federal programs are being managed in compliance with 
laws and regulations. It must also identify the controls that were 
evaluated, the controls that were not evaluated, and the material 
weaknesses identified as a result of the evaluation.
    (3) The auditor's report on compliance containing:
--A statement of positive assurance with respect to those items tested 
for compliance, including compliance with law and regulations pertaining 
to financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements;
--Negative assurance on those items not tested;
--A summary of all instances of noncompliance; and
--An identification of total amounts questioned, if any, for each 
Federal assistance award, as a result of noncompliance.
    b. The three parts of the audit report may be bound into a single 
report, or presented at the same time as separate documents.
    c. All fraud abuse, or illegal acts or indications of such acts, 
including all questioned costs found as the result of these acts that 
auditors become aware of, should normally be covered in a separate 
written report submitted in accordance with paragraph 13f.
    d. In addition to the audit report, the recipient shall provide 
comments on the findings and recommendations in the report, including a 
plan for corrective action taken or planned and comments on the status 
of corrective action taken on prior findings. If corrective action is 
not necessary, a statement describing the reason it is not should 
accompany the audit report.
    e. The reports shall be made available by the State or local 
government for public inspection within 30 days after the completion of 
the audit.
    f. In accordance with generally accepted government audit standards, 
reports shall be submitted by the auditor to the organization audited 
and to those requiring or arranging for the audit. In addition, the 
recipient shall submit copies of the reports to each Federal department 
or agency that provided Federal assistance funds to the recipient. 
Subrecipients shall submit copies to recipients that provided them 
Federal assistance funds. The reports shall be sent within 30 days after 
the completion of the audit, but no later than one year after the end of 
the audit period unless a longer period is agreed to with the cognizant 
agency.
    g. Recipients of more than $100,000 in Federal funds shall submit 
one copy of the audit

[[Page 229]]

report within 30 days after issuance to a central clearinghouse to be 
designated by the Office of Management and Budget. The clearinghouse 
will keep completed audits on file and follow up with State and local 
governments that have not submitted required audit reports.
    h. Recipients shall keep audit reports on file for three years from 
their issuance.
    14. Audit Resolution. As provided in paragraph 11, the cognizant 
agency shall be responsible for monitoring the resolution of audit 
findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency. 
Resolution of findings that relate to the programs of a single Federal 
agency will be the responsibility of the recipient and that agency. 
Alternate arrangements may be made on a case-by-case basis by agreement 
among the agencies concerned.
    Resolution shall be made within six months after receipt of the 
report by the Federal departments and agencies. Corrective action should 
proceed as rapidly as possible.
    15. Audit workpapers and reports. Workpapers and reports shall be 
retained for a minimum of three years from the date of the audit report, 
unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency to 
extend the retention period. Audit workpapers shall be made available 
upon request to the cognizant agency or its designee or the General 
Accounting Office, at the completion of the audit.
    16. Audit Costs. The cost of audits made in accordance with the 
provisions of this Circular are allowable charges to Federal assistance 
programs.
    a. The charges may be considered a direct cost or an allocated 
indirect cost, determined in accordance with the provision of Circular 
A-87, ``Cost principles for State and local governments.''
    b. Generally, the percentage of costs charged to Federal assistance 
programs for a single audit shall not exceed the percentage that Federal 
funds expended represent of total funds expended by the recipient during 
the fiscal year. The percentage may be exceeded, however, if appropriate 
documentation demonstrates higher actual cost.
    17. Sanctions. The Single Audit Act provides that no cost may be 
charged to Federal assistance programs for audits required by the Act 
that are not made in accordance with this Circular. In cases of 
continued inability or unwillingness to have a proper audit, Federal 
agencies must consider other appropriate sanctions including:
--Withhodling a percentage of assistance payments until the audit is 
completed satisfactorily,
--Withholding or disallowing overhead costs, and
--Suspending the Federal assistance agreement until the audit is made.
    18. Auditor Selection. In arranging for audit services State and 
local governments shall follow the procurement standards prescribed by 
Attachment O of Circular A-102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to 
State and local governments.'' The standards provide that while 
recipients are encouraged to enter into intergovernmental agreements for 
audit and other services, analysis should be made to determine whether 
it would be more economical to purchase the services from private firms. 
In instances where use of such intergovernmental agreements are required 
by State statutes (e.g., audit services) these statutes will take 
precedence.
    19. Small and Minority Audit Firms. Small audit firms and audit 
firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals shall have the maximum practicable opportunity to 
participate in contracts awarded to fulfill the requirements of this 
Circular. Recipients of Federal assistance shall take the following 
steps to further this goal:
    a. Assure that small audit firms and audit firms owned and 
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals are 
used to the fullest extent practicable.
    b. Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and 
arrange time frames for the audit so as to encourage and facilitate 
participation by small audit firms and audit firms owned and controlled 
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
    c. Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for 
larger audits intend to subcontract with small audit firms and audit 
firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals.
    d. Encourage contracting with small audit firms or audit firms owned 
and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals 
which have traditionally audited government programs and, in such cases 
where this is not possible, assure that these firms are given 
consideration for audit subcontracting opportunities.
    e. Encourage contracting with consortiums of small audit firms as 
described in paragraph (a) above when a contract is too large for an 
individual small audit firm or audit firm owned and controlled by 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
    f. Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such 
organizations as the Small Business Administration in the solicitation 
and utilization of small audit firms or audit firms owned and controlled 
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
    20. Reporting. Each Federal agency will report to the Director of 
OMB on or before March 1, 1987, and annually thereafter on the 
effectiveness of State and local governments in carrying out the 
provisions of this Circular. The report must identify each State or 
local government or Indian tribe that, in the

[[Page 230]]

opinion of the agency, is failing to comply with Circular.
    21. Regulations. Each Federal agency shall include the provisions of 
this Circular in its regulations implementing the Single Audit Act.
    22. Effective date. This Circular is effective upon publication and 
shall apply to fiscal years of State and local governments that begin 
after December 31, 1984. Earlier implementation is encouraged. However, 
until it is implemented, the audit provisions of Attachment P to 
Circular A-102 shall continue to be observed.
    23. Inquiries. All questions or inquiries should be addressed to 
Financial Management Division, Office of Management and Budget, 
telephone number (202) 395-3993.
    24. Sunset review date. This Circular shall have an independent 
policy review to ascertain its effectiveness three years from the date 
of issuance.

    Director.

<R05>
Sec. 1404.50  How is this part written?

    (a) This part uses a ``plain language'' format to make it easier for 
the general public and business community to use. The section headings 
and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read 
together.
    (b) Pronouns used within this part, such as ``I'' and ``you,'' 
change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being 
addressed. The pronoun ``we'' always is the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy.
    (c) The ``Covered Transactions'' diagram in the appendix to this 
part shows the levels or ``tiers'' at which the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy enforces an exclusion under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.75  Do terms in this part have special meanings?

    This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meaning. 
Those terms are defined in Subpart I of this part. For example, three 
important terms are--
    (a) Exclusion or excluded, which refers only to discretionary 
actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under this part or 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);
    (b) Disqualification or disqualified, which refers to prohibitions 
under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 
12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. 
Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an 
agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have 
special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and
    (c) Ineligibility or ineligible, which generally refers to a person 
who is either excluded or disqualified.


<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 1404.100  What does this part do?

    This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension 
for Office of National Drug Control Policy nonprocurement activities. It 
also provides for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded 
under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the 
consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by 
statute, executive order, or other legal authority. This part satisfies 
the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and 
Suspension'' (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, 
``Debarment and Suspension'' (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 
6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).


<R05>
Sec. 1404.105  Does this part apply to me?

    Portions of this part (see table at Sec. 1404.25(b)) apply to you 
if you are a(n)--
    (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a 
participant or principal in a covered transaction;
    (b) Respondent (a person against whom the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy has initiated a debarment or suspension action);
    (c) Office of National Drug Control Policy debarring or suspending 
official; or
    (d) Office of National Drug Control Policy official who is 
authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.

[[Page 234]]


<R05>
Sec. 1404.110  What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension system?

    (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures 
the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with 
responsible persons.
    (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not 
presently responsible.
    (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take 
only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a 
person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.115  How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in 
covered transactions?

    With the exceptions stated in Sec. Sec. 1404.120, 1404.315, and 
1404.420, a person who is excluded by the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy or any other Federal agency may not:
    (a) Be a participant in a(n) Office of National Drug Control Policy 
transaction that is a covered transaction under subpart B of this part;
    (b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency 
that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for 
debarment and suspension; or
    (c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those 
covered transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.120  May we grant an exception to let an excluded person 
participate in a covered transaction?

    (a) The Director of National Drug Control Policy may grant an 
exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular 
covered transaction. If the Director of National Drug Control Policy 
grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the 
reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive 
Order 12549.
    (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does 
not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.125  Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system 
affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement 
common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also 
ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the 
FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in 
Federal procurement transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.130  Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system 
affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after 
August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate 
in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an 
exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.135  May the Office of National Drug Control Policy exclude 
a person who is not currently participating in a nonprocurement transaction?

    Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may 
exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may 
reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.140  How do I know if a person is excluded?

    Check the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) to determine whether a 
person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains 
the EPLS and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. 
When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the 
nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the 
agency enters the information about the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.145  Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as 
well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

    Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part--

[[Page 235]]

    (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to--
    (1) Provide for their inclusion in the EPLS; and
    (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to 
check for disqualified persons before entering into covered 
transactions.
    (b) Does not specify the--
    (1) Office of National Drug Control Policy transactions for which a 
disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-
case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, 
Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;
    (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or
    (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike 
exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action 
that a Federal agency takes.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Covered Transactions


<R05>
Sec. 1404.200  What is a covered transaction?

    A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction 
that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a 
transaction at--
    (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see 
appendix to this part); or
    (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and 
another person.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.205  Why is it important if a particular transaction is a 
covered transaction?

    The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.
    (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the 
responsibilities laid out in Subpart C of this part. Those include 
responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier 
from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include 
responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered 
transactions with persons at the next lower tier.
    (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier 
transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this 
part.
    (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal 
in the transaction unless--
    (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you 
to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your 
exclusion, as permitted under Sec. 1404.310 or Sec. 1404.415; or
    (2) A(n) Office of National Drug Control Policy official obtains an 
exception from the Director of National Drug Control Policy to allow you 
to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under Sec. 1404.120.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.210  Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

    All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in Sec. 1404.970, are 
covered transactions unless listed in Sec. 1404.215. (See appendix to 
this part.)


<R05>
Sec. 1404.215  Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered 
transactions?

    The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered 
transactions:
    (a) A direct award to--
    (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;
    (2) A public international organization;
    (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign 
government; or
    (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more 
foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.
    (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if 
a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental 
Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 et 
seq., those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are 
not affected if the person is excluded.
    (c) Federal employment.
    (d) A transaction that the Office of National Drug Control Policy 
needs to

[[Page 236]]

respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.
    (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as 
a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless 
the Office of National Drug Control Policy specifically designates it to 
be a covered transaction.
    (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental 
operations.
    (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the 
transaction is prohibited by law.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.220  Are any procurement contracts included as covered 
transactions?

    (a) Covered transactions under this part--
    (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a 
Federal agency; but
    (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal 
participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to 
this part).
    (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered 
transaction if any of the following applies:
    (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement 
transaction that is covered under Sec. 1404.210, and the amount of the 
contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
    (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) Office of National 
Drug Control Policy official. In that case, the contract, regardless of 
the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who 
awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a 
contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the 
appendix to this part.
    (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.225  How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate 
is a covered transaction?

    As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a 
covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the 
transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next 
higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that 
you must comply with applicable portions of this part.


<R04>
    Subpart C_Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

                    Doing Business With Other Persons


<R05>
Sec. 1404.300  What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction 
with another person at the next lower tier?

    When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the 
next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to 
do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:
    (a) Checking the EPLS; or
    (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this 
rule; or
    (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with 
that person.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.305  May I enter into a covered transaction with an excluded 
or disqualified person?

    (a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction 
with an excluded person, unless the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy grants an exception under Sec. 1404.120.
    (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is 
disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an 
exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or 
regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.310  What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person 
with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an 
excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency 
excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the 
transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a 
decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, 
if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper 
and appropriate.
    (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-
cost time extensions) with any excluded

[[Page 237]]

person, unless the Office of National Drug Control Policy grants an 
exception under Sec. 1404.120.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.315  May I use the services of an excluded person as a 
principal under a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an 
excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were 
using the services of that person in the transaction before the person 
was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that 
person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about 
whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough 
review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
    (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a 
principal under a covered transaction unless the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy grants an exception under Sec. 1404.120.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.320  Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions 
are eligible to participate?

    Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether 
any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or 
disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the 
method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not 
required to, check the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.325  What happens if I do business with an excluded person 
in a covered transaction?

    If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded 
person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue 
a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.330  What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower 
tiers with whom I intend to do business?

    Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the 
next lower tier, you must require that participant to--
    (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the 
transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless Sec. 1404.440 
requires you to use specific methods.
    (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person 
with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next 
lower tier.

            Disclosing Information--Primary Tier Participants


<R05>
Sec. 1404.335  What information must I provide before entering into a 
covered transaction with the Office of National Drug Control Policy?

    Before you enter into a covered transaction at the primary tier, you 
as the participant must notify the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy office that is entering into the transaction with you, if you 
know that you or any of the principals for that covered transaction:
    (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;
    (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of 
the offenses listed in Sec. 1404.800(a) or had a civil judgment 
rendered against you for one of those offenses within that time period;
    (c) Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly 
charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with 
commission of any of the offenses listed in Sec. 1404.800(a); or
    (d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or 
local) terminated within the preceding three years for cause or default.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.340  If I disclose unfavorable information required under 
Sec. 1404.335, will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?

    As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable 
information about yourself or a principal under Sec. 1404.335 will not 
necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered 
transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether 
to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any 
additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the 
disclosed information.

[[Page 238]]


<R05>
Sec. 1404.345  What happens if I fail to disclose information required 
under Sec. 1404.335?

    If we later determine that you failed to disclose information under 
Sec. 1404.335 that you knew at the time you entered into the covered 
transaction, we may--
    (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the transaction; or
    (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and 
debarment.

or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?

    (a) You as an agency official may continue covered transactions with 
an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if 
the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are

knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person?

    If a participant knowingly does business with an excluded or 
disqualified person, you as an agency official may refer the matter for 
suspension and debarment consideration. You may also disallow costs, 
annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, or take any 
other appropriate remedy.


<R05>

<R04>
                 Subpart E_Excluded Parties List System


<R05>
Sec. 1404.500  What is the purpose of the Excluded Parties List System 
(EPLS)?

    The EPLS is a widely available source of the most current 
information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.505  Who uses the EPLS?

    (a) Federal agency officials use the EPLS to determine whether to 
enter into a transaction with a person, as required under Sec. 
1404.430.
    (b) Participants also may, but are not required to, use the EPLS to 
determine if--
    (1) Principals of their transactions are excluded or disqualified, 
as required under Sec. 1404.320; or
    (2) Persons with whom they are entering into covered transactions at 
the next lower tier are excluded or disqualified.
    (c) The EPLS is available to the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.510  Who maintains the EPLS?

    In accordance with the OMB guidelines, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) maintains the EPLS. When a Federal agency takes an 
action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement 
debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about 
the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.515  What specific information is in the EPLS?

    (a) At a minimum, the EPLS indicates--
    (1) The full name (where available) and address of each excluded or 
disqualified person, in alphabetical order, with cross references if 
more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;
    (3) The cause for the action;
    (4) The scope of the action;
    (5) Any termination date for the action;
    (6) The agency and name and telephone number of the agency point of 
contact for the action; and
    (7) The Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), or other similar code 
approved by the GSA, of the excluded or disqualified person, if 
available.
    (b)(1) The database for the EPLS includes a field for the Taxpayer 
Identification Number (TIN) (the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual) of an excluded or disqualified person.
    (2) Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the 
identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 
1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection 
Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).


<R05>
Sec. 1404.520  Who places the information into the EPLS?

    Federal officials who take actions to exclude persons under this 
part or officials who are responsible for identifying disqualified 
persons must enter the following information about those persons into 
the EPLS:
    (a) Information required by Sec. 1404.515(a);
    (b) The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the excluded or 
disqualified person, including the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual, if the number is available and may be disclosed under law;
    (c) Information about an excluded or disqualified person, generally 
within five working days, after--
    (1) Taking an exclusion action;
    (2) Modifying or rescinding an exclusion action;

[[Page 241]]

    (3) Finding that a person is disqualified; or
    (4) Finding that there has been a change in the status of a person 
who is listed as disqualified.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.525  Whom do I ask if I have questions about a person in the 
EPLS?

    If you have questions about a person in the EPLS, ask the point of 
contact for the Federal agency that placed the person's name into the 
EPLS. You may find the agency point of contact from the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.530  Where can I find the EPLS?

    (a) You may access the EPLS through the Internet, currently at 
http://epls.arnet.gov.
    (b) As of November 26, 2003, you may also subscribe to a printed 
version. However, we anticipate discontinuing the printed version. Until 
it is discontinued, you may obtain the printed version by purchasing a 
yearly subscription from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or by calling the 
Government Printing Office Inquiry and Order Desk at (202) 783-3238.

   Subpart F_General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment 
                                 Actions


<R05>
Sec. 1404.600  How do suspension and debarment actions start?

    When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for 
suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We 
refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending 
or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.605  How does suspension differ from debarment?

    Suspension differs from debarment in that--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A suspending official . . .           A debarring official . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Imposes suspension as a temporary    Imposes debarment for a

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 1404.610  What procedures does the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy use in suspension and debarment actions?

    In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions 
as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness.
    (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart 
and subpart G of this part.
    (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and 
subpart H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.615  How does the Office of National Drug Control Policy notify 
a person of a suspension or debarment action?

    (a) The suspending or debarring official sends a written notice to 
the last known street address, facsimile number, or e-mail address of--
    (1) You or your identified counsel; or
    (2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, 
officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.
    (b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.

[[Page 242]]


<R05>
Sec. 1404.620  Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment 
actions?

    Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a 
suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one 
agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are 
encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their 
suspension and debarment actions.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.625  What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

    If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is 
effective as follows:
    (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment 
of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all 
covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is 
limited--
    (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, 
divisions, or other organizational elements; or
    (2) To specific types of transactions.
    (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension 
or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official--
    (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and
    (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.630  May the Office of National Drug Control Policy impute 
conduct of one person to another?

    For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct 
as follows:
    (a) Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization. We may 
impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any 
officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual 
associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper 
conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of 
duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's 
knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of 
the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval 
or acquiescence.
    (b) Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual, or 
between individuals. We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other 
improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one 
individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper 
conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason 
to know of the improper conduct.
    (c) Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization. 
We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one 
organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred 
in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, 
association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the 
improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or 
influence the activities of the organization responsible for the 
improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is 
evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.635  May the Office of National Drug Control Policy settle a 
debarment or suspension action?

    Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if 
it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.640  May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

    Yes, if we enter into a settlement with you in which you agree to be 
excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide 
effect.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.645  Do other Federal agencies know if the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy agrees to a voluntary exclusion?

    (a) Yes, we enter information regarding a voluntary exclusion into 
the EPLS.
    (b) Also, any agency or person may contact us to find out the 
details of a voluntary exclusion.

<R04>
                          Subpart G_Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 1404.700  When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

    Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart 
and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose 
suspension only when that official determines that--
    (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to 
suspect, an offense listed under Sec. 1404.800(a), or
    (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for 
debarment listed under Sec. 1404.800(b) through (d); and
    (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.705  What does the suspending official consider in issuing 
a suspension?

    (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the 
suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is 
available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not 
important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can 
reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending 
official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative 
agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant 
documents.
    (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official 
findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/
or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.
    (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the 
public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For 
example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate 
action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the 
circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential 
business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.710  When does a suspension take effect?

    A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the 
decision to suspend.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.715  What notice does the suspending official give me if I 
am suspended?

    After deciding to suspend you, the suspending official promptly 
sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you--
    (a) That you have been suspended;
    (b) That your suspension is based on--
    (1) An indictment;
    (2) A conviction;
    (3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities 
which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with you; or
    (4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your 
affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;
    (c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on 
notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under Sec. 1404.700 for 
imposing suspension;
    (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment 
proceedings;
    (f) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, Subpart F of this 
part, and any other Office of National Drug Control Policy procedures 
governing suspension decision making; and
    (g) Of the governmentwide effect of your suspension from procurement 
and nonprocurement programs and activities.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.720  How may I contest a suspension?

    If you as a respondent wish to contest a suspension, you or your 
representative must provide the suspending official with information in 
opposition to the suspension. You may do this orally or in writing, but 
any information provided orally that you consider important must also be 
submitted in writing for the official record.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.725  How much time do I have to contest a suspension?

    (a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or 
make rrangements to appear and present, the

[[Page 244]]

information and argument to the suspending official within 30 days after 
you receive the Notice of Suspension.
    (b) We consider the notice to be received by you--
    (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street 
address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;
    (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after 
we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or
    (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days 
after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.730  What information must I provide to the suspending official 
if I contest a suspension?

    (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a 
respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify--
    (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the 
Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;
    (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations 
implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, 
or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only 
those agencies;
    (3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of 
Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the 
notice; and
    (4) All of your affiliates.
    (b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false 
information, the Office of National Drug Control Policy may seek further 
criminal, civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.735  Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity 
to challenge the facts on which the suspension is based?

    (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to 
challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that--
    (1) Your suspension is based upon an indictment, conviction, civil 
judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which 
an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;
    (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to 
information contained in the Notice of Suspension;
    (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the 
suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the 
suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's 
decision whether to continue the suspension; or
    (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office 
of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a 
State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the 
government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the 
same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-
finding.
    (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the 
suspending official determines that--
    (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; 
and
    (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over 
facts material to the suspension.
    (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts 
under this section, the suspending official or designee must conduct 
additional proceedings to resolve those facts.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.740  Are suspension proceedings formal?

    (a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal 
manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you 
to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the suspending official 
is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in 
creating an official record upon which the official will base a final 
suspension decision.
    (b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any 
documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.745  How is fact-finding conducted?

    (a) If fact-finding is conducted--
    (1) You may present witnesses and other evidence, and confront any 
witness presented; and

[[Page 245]]

    (2) The fact-finder must prepare written findings of fact for the 
record.
    (b) A transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings must be made, 
unless you as a respondent and the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy agree to waive it in advance. If you want a copy of the 
transcribed record, you may purchase it.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.750  What does the suspending official consider in deciding 
whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

    (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information 
contained in the official record. The record includes--
    (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial 
decision to suspend you;
    (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or 
opposition to, the suspension; and
    (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.
    (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may 
reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly 
erroneous.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.755  When will I know whether the suspension is continued 
or terminated?

    The suspending official must make a written decision whether to 
continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing 
the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending

<R05>
Sec. 1404.805  What notice does the debarring official give me if I 
am proposed for debarment?

    After consideration of the causes in Sec. 1404.800 of this subpart, 
if the debarring official proposes to debar you, the official sends you 
a Notice of Proposed Debarment, pursuant to Sec. 1404.615, advising 
you--
    (a) That the debarring official is considering debarring you;
    (b) Of the reasons for proposing to debar you in terms sufficient to 
put you on notice of the conduct or transactions upon which the proposed 
debarment is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) under Sec. 1404.800 upon which the debarring

nonprocurement programs and activities.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.810  When does a debarment take effect?

    A debarment is not effective until the debarring official issues a 
decision. The debarring official does not issue a decision until the 
respondent has had an opportunity to contest the proposed debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.815  How may I contest a proposed debarment?

    If you as a respondent wish to contest a proposed debarment, you or 
your representative must provide the debarring official with information 
in opposition to the proposed debarment. You may do this orally or in 
writing, but any information provided orally that you consider important 
must also be submitted in writing for the official record.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.820  How much time do I have to contest a proposed debarment?

    (a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or 
make arrangements to appear and present, the information and argument to 
the debarring official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of 
Proposed Debarment.
    (b) We consider the Notice of Proposed Debarment to be received by 
you--
    (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street 
address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;
    (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after 
we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or
    (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days 
after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.825  What information must I provide to the debarring official 
if I contest a proposed debarment?

respondent your submission to the debarring official must identify--
    (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the 
Notice of

[[Page 247]]

Proposed Debarment. Include any information about any of the factors 
listed in Sec. 1404.860. A general denial is insufficient to raise a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the debarment;
    (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations 
implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, State, 
or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only 
those agencies;

Proposed Debarment that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) 
stated in the notice; and

information, the Office of National Drug Control Policy may seek further 
criminal, civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.830  Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity 
to challenge the facts on which a proposed debarment is based?

    (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to 
challenge the facts if the debarring official determines that--
    (1) Your debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment;
    (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to 
information contained in the Notice of Proposed Debarment; or
    (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the 
proposed debarment are not factual in nature, or are not material to the 
debarring official's decision whether to debar.
    (b) You will have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts 
if the debarring official determines that--
    (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; 
and
    (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over 
facts material to the proposed debarment.
    (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts 
under this section, the debarring official or designee must conduct 
additional proceedings to resolve those facts.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.835  Are debarment proceedings formal?

    (a) Debarment proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal 
manner. The debarring official may use flexible procedures to allow you 
as a respondent to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the 
debarring official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or 
procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will 
base the decision whether to debar.
    (b) You or your representative must submit any documentary evidence 
you want the debarring official to consider.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.840  How is fact-finding conducted?

Policy agree to waive it in advance. If you want a copy of the 
transcribed record, you may purchase it.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.845  What does the debarring official consider in deciding 
whether to debar me?

    (a) The debarring official may debar you for any of the causes in 
Sec. 1404.800. However, the official need not debar you even if a cause 
for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of your 
acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth at 
Sec. 1404.860.
    (b) The debarring official bases the decision on all information 
contained in the official record. The record includes--
    (1) All information in support of the debarring official's proposed 
debarment;
    (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or 
in opposition to, the proposed debarment; and
    (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.
    (c) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring

[[Page 248]]

official may reject any resultant findings, in whole or in part, only 
after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or 
clearly erroneous.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.850  What is the standard of proof in a debarment action?

    (a) In any debarment action, we must establish the cause for 
debarment by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (b) If the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil 
judgment, the standard of proof is met.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.855  Who has the burden of proof in a debarment action?

    (a) We have the burden to prove that a cause for debarment exists.
    (b) Once a cause for debarment is established, you as a respondent 
have the burden of demonstrating to the satisfaction of the debarring 
official that you are presently responsible and that debarment is not 
necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.860  What factors may influence the debarring official's 
decision?

    This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the 
debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and 
the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider 
other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a 
particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as 
one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative 
of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the 
debarring official may consider the following factors:
    (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may 
result from the wrongdoing.
    (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.
    (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For 
example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State 
agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the 
debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the 
debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior 
history of wrongdoing.
    (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an 
agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate 
in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of 
conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in 
this part.
    (e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a 
Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide 
but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for 
debarment specified in this part.
    (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried 
out the wrongdoing.
    (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and 
recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for 
debarment.
    (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and 
administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any 
investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and 
have made or agreed to make full restitution.
    (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies 
during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In 
determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may 
consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all 
pertinent information known to you.
    (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.
    (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the 
wrongdoing.
    (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or 
remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing 
programs to prevent recurrence.
    (m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.
    (n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the 
debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a 
timely manner.
    (o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances 
surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the 
investigation available to the debarring official.

[[Page 249]]

    (p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal 
control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.
    (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against 
the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause 
for debarment.
    (r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the 
circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the 
debarment.
    (s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a 
particular case.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.865  How long may my debarment last?

    (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of 
debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which 
your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three 
years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may 
impose a longer period of debarment.
    (b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official 
may consider the factors in Sec. 1404.860. If a suspension has preceded 
your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were 
suspended.
    (c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the 
Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed 
five years.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.870  When do I know if the debarring official debars me?

    (a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to 
debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record 
closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, 
information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may 
extend that period for good cause.
    (b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to 
Sec. 1404.615 that the official decided, either--
    (1) Not to debar you; or
    (2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:
    (i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;
    (ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;

dates; and

transactions and contracts that are subject to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), throughout the executive branch of the 
Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee 
grants an exception.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.875  May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision 
to debar me?

    Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to 
reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope 
of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and 
support it with documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.880  What factors may influence the debarring official during 
reconsideration?

    The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based 
on--
    (a) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your 
debarment was based;
    (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.885  May the debarring official extend a debarment?

    (a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest.
    (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment 
solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the 
initial debarment action was based.
    (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an 
additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the 
applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to 
extend the debarment.

                     Subpart A_Purpose and Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 1405.100  What does this part do?

    This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 
1988 (41 U.S.C. 701 et seq., as amended) that applies to grants. It also 
applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other 
financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.


<R05>
Sec. 1405.105  Does this part apply to me?

    (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either--
    (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy; or
    (2) A(n) Office of National Drug Control Policy awarding official. 
(See definitions of award and recipient in Sec. Sec. 1405.605 and 
1405.660, respectively.)
    (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            If you are . . .                    see subparts . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) A recipient who is not an            A, B and E.
 individual.
(2) A recipient who is an individual...  A, C and E.
(3) A(n) Office of National Drug         A, D and E.
 Control Policy awarding official.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 1405.110  Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this 
part?

    This part does not apply to any award that the Director of National 
Drug Control Policy determines that the application of this part would 
be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States 
or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.


<R05>
Sec. 1405.115  Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

    It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred 
or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as 
described in Sec. 1405.510(c). However, this part does not apply 
directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is 
carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of 
Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace 
coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

[[Page 255]]


<R04>
      Subpart B_Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals


<R05>
Sec. 1405.200  What must I do to comply with this part?

    There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than 
an individual.
    (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, 
to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a 
condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific 
measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail 
in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to--
    (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-
free awareness program for your employees (see Sec. Sec. 1405.205 
through 1405.220); and
    (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating 
drug statutes in the workplace (see Sec. 1405.225).
    (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your 
Federal awards (see Sec. 1405.230).


<R05>
Sec. 1405.205  What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

    You must publish a statement that--
    (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, 
distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance 
is prohibited in your workplace;
    (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for 
violating that prohibition; and
    (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under 
any award, he or she:
    (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must 
do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.


<R05>
Sec. 1405.210  To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

    You must require that a copy of the statement described in Sec. 
1405.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the 
performance of any Federal award.


<R05>
Sec. 1405.215  What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?

    You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform 
employees about--
    (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
    (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
    (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee 
assistance programs; and
    (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse 
violations occurring in the workplace.


<R05>
Sec. 1405.220  By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement 
and establish my drug-free awareness program?

    If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy 
statement as described in Sec. 1405.205 and an ongoing awareness 
program as described in Sec. 1405.215, you must publish the statement 
and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                If . . .                          then you . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) The performance period of the award  must have the policy statement
 is less than 30 days.                    and program in place as soon
                                          as possible, but before the
                                          date on which performance is
                                          expected to be completed.
(b) The performance period of the award  must have the policy statement
 is 30 days or more.                      and program in place within 30
                                          days after award.
(c) You believe there are extraordinary  may ask the Office of National
 circumstances that will require more     Drug Control Policy awarding
 than 30 days for you to publish the      official to give you more time
 policy statement and establish the       to do so. The amount of
 awareness program.                       additional time, if any, to be
                                          given is at the discretion of
                                          the awarding official.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 256]]


<R05>
Sec. 1405.225  What actions must I take concerning employees who are 
convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

    There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a 
drug violation in the workplace:
    (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is 
engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, 
as required by Sec. 1405.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the 
conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must--
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Include the employee's position title;
    (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;
    (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the 
conviction; and
    (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted 
employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his 
or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a 
central point for the receipt of the notices.
    (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's 
conviction, you must either--
    (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or
    (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes 
by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other 
appropriate agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1405.230  How and when must I identify workplaces?

    (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each Office of 
National Drug Control Policy award. A failure to do so is a violation of 
your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces--
    (1) To the Office of National Drug Control Policy official that is 
making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or
    (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the 
performance of the award, in which case you must make the information 
available for inspection upon request by Office of National Drug Control 
Policy officials or their designated representatives.
    (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the 
actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where 
work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used 
(e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway 
department while in operation, State employees in each local 
unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    (c) If you identified workplaces to the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy awarding official at the time of application or award, as 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that 
you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must 
inform the Office of National Drug Control Policy awarding official.


<R04>
        Subpart C_Requirements for Recipients Who Are Individuals


<R05>
Sec. 1405.300  What must I do to comply with this part if I am an 
individual recipient?

    As a condition of receiving a(n) Office of National Drug Control 
Policy award, if you are an individual recipient, you must agree that--
    (a) You will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity related to the award; and
    (b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will 
report the conviction:
    (1) In writing.
    (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.
    (3) To the Office of National Drug Control Policy awarding official 
or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless Sec. 
1405.301 or the award document designates a central point for the 
receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must 
include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

of a recipient if the Director of National Drug Control Policy 
determines that such a waiver would be in the public interest. This
