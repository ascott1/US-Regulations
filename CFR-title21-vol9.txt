                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB 
control numbers as

[[Page vi]]

amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

registered, that business activity shall be assigned to one of twelve 
groups, which shall correspond to the months of the year. The expiration 
date of the registrations of all registrants within any group will be 
the last date of the month designated for that group. In assigning any 
of the above business activities to a group, the Administration may 
select a group the expiration date of which is less than one year from 
the date such business activity was registered. If the business activity 
is assigned to a group which has an expiration date less than three 
months from the date of which the business activity is registered, the 
registration shall not expire until one year from that expiration date; 
in all other cases, the registration shall expire on the expiration date 
following the date on which the business activity is registered.
    (d) At the time a retail pharmacy, hospital/clinic, practitioner or 
teaching institution is first registered, that business activity shall 
be assigned to one of twelve groups, which shall correspond to the 
months of the year. The expiration date of the registrations of all 
registrants within any group will be the last day of the month 
designated for that group. In assigning any of the

above business activities to a group, the Administration may select a 
group the expiration date of which is not less than 28 months nor more 
than 39 months from the date such business activity was registered. 
After the initial registration period, the registration shall expire 36 
months from the initial expiration date.

Administration registration number. I understand that if any information 
is false, the Administration may immediately suspend the registration 
for this store and commence proceedings to revoke under 21 U.S.C. 824(a) 
because of the danger to public health and safety. I further understand 
that any false information contained in this affidavit may subject me 
personally and the above-named corporation/partnership/business to 
prosecution under 21 U.S.C. 843, the penalties for conviction of which 
include imprisonment for up to 4 years, a fine of not more than $30,000

one

[[Page 18]]

person to another, if the transferee owns at least one other pharmacy 
licensed in the same State as the one the ownership of which is being 
transferred, the transferee may apply for registration prior to the date 
of transfer. The Administrator may register the applicant and authorize 
him to obtain controlled substances at the time of transfer. Such 
registration shall not authorize the transferee to dispense controlled 
substances until the pharmacy has been issued a valid State license. The 
transferee shall include with his application the following affidavit:

                   Affidavit for Transfer of Pharmacy

    I, ----------------, the ------------------------ (Title of officer,

licensing agency) of the State of ---------------- to do business as --
-------------- (Store name) at ---------------- (Number and Street) ----
------------ (City) ---------------- (State) ---------------- (Zip 
Code).
    This statement is submitted in order to obtain a Drug Enforcement 
Administration registration number.
    I understand that if a DEA registration number is issued, the 
pharmacy may acquire controlled substances but may not dispense them 
until a pharmacy permit or license is issued by the State board of 
pharmacy or licensing agency.
    I understand that if any information is false, the Administration 
may immediately suspend the registration for this store and commence 
proceedings to revoke under 21 U.S.C. 824(a) because of the danger to 
public health and safety. I further understand that any false 
information contained in this affidavit may subject me personally to 
prosecution under 21 U.S.C. 843, the penalties for conviction of which 
include imprisonment for up to 4 years, a fine of not more than $30,000 
or both.

    (c) The Administrator shall follow the normal procedures for 
approving an application to verify the statements in the affidavit. If 
the statements prove to be false, the Administrator may revoke the 
registration on the basis of section 1304(a)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 
824(a)(1)) and suspend the registration immediately by pending 
revocation on the basis of section 1304(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 
824(d)). At the same time, the Administrator may seize and place under 
seal all controlled substances possessed by the applicant under section 
1304(f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(f)). International misuse of the 
affidavit procedure may subject the applicant to prosecution for fraud 
under section 403(a)(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 843(a)(4)), and obtaining 
controlled substances under a registration fraudulently gotten may 
subject the applicant to prosecution under section 403(a)(3) of the Act 
(21 U.S.C. 843(a)(3)). The penalties for conviction of either offense 
include imprisonment for up to 4 years, a fine not exceeding $30,000 or

[[Page 19]]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.42   Action on applications for research in Schedule I substances.

    (a) In the case of an application for registration to conduct 
research with controlled substances listed in Schedule I, the 
Administrator shall process the application and protocol and forward a 
copy of each to the Secretary within 7 days after receipt. The Secretary 
shall determine the qualifications and competency of the applicant, as 
well as the merits of the protocol (and shall notify the Administrator 
of his determination) within 21 days after receipt of the application 
and complete protocol, except that in the case of a clinical 
investigation, the Secretary shall have 30 days to make such 
determination and notify the Administrator. The Secretary, in 
determining the merits of the protocol, shall consult with the 
Administrator as to effective procedures to safeguard adequately against 
diversion of such controlled substances from legitimate medical or 
scientific use.
    (b) An applicant whose protocol is defective shall be notified by 
the Secretary within 21 days after receipt of such protocol from the 
Administrator (or in the case of a clinical investigation within 30 
days), and he shall be requested to correct the existing defects before 
consideration shall be given to his submission.
    (c) If the Secretary determines the applicant qualified and 
competent and the research protocol meritorious, he shall notify the 
Administrator in writing of such determination. The Administrator shall 
issue a certificate of registration within 10 days after receipt of this 
notice, unless he determines that the certificate of registration should 
be denied on a ground specified in section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 
824(a)). In the case of a supplemental protocol, a replacement 
certificate of registration shall be issued by the Administrator.
    (d) If the Secretary determines that the protocol is not meritorious 
and/or the applicant is not qualified or competent, he shall notify the 
Administrator in writing setting forth the reasons for such 
determination. If the Administrator determines that grounds exist for 
the denial of the application, he shall within 10 days issue an order to 
show cause pursuant to Sec. 1301.48 and, if requested by the applicant, 
hold a hearing on the application pursuant to Sec. 1301.51. If the 
grounds for denial of the application include a determination by the 
Secretary, the Secretary or his duly authorized agent shall furnish 
testimony and documents pertaining to his determination at such hearing.
    (e) Supplemental protocols will be processed in the same manner as 
original research protocols. If the processing of an application or 
research protocol is delayed beyond the time limits imposed by this 
section, the applicant shall be so notified in writing.

Sec. 1301.43   Application for bulk manufacture of Schedule I and II substances.

    (a) In the case of an application for registration or reregistration 
to manufacture in bulk a basic class of controlled substance listed in 
Schedule I or II, the Administrator shall, upon the filing of such 
application, publish in the Federal Register a notice naming the 
applicant and stating that such applicant has applied to be registered 
as a bulk manufacturer of a basic class of narcotic or nonnarcotic 
controlled substance, which class shall be identified. A copy of said 
notice shall be mailed simultaneously to each person registered as a 
bulk manufacturer of that basic class and to any other applicant 
therefor. Any such person may, within 60 days from the date of 
publication of the notice in the Federal Register, file with the 
Administrator written comments on or objections to the issuance of the 
proposed registration.
    (b) In order to provide adequate competition, the Administrator 
shall not be required to limit the number of manufacturers in any basic 
class to a number less than that consistent with maintenance of 
effective controls against diversion solely because a smaller number is 
capable of producing an adequate and uninterrupted supply.
    (c) This section shall not apply to the manufacture of basic classes 
of controlled substances listed in Schedules I or II as an incident to 
research or

Sec. 1301.46   Suspension of registration pending final order.

    (a) The Administrator may suspend any registration simultaneously 
with or at any time subsequent to the service upon the registrant of an 
order to show cause why such registration should not be revoked or 
suspended, in any case where he finds that there is an imminent danger 
to the public health or safety. If the Administrator so suspends, he 
shall serve with the order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1301.48 an 
order of immediate suspension which shall contain a statement of his 
findings regarding the danger to public health or safety.
    (b) Upon service of the order of immediate suspension, the 
registrant shall promptly return his Certificate of Registration and any 
order forms in his possession to the nearest office of the 
Administration. The suspension of any registration under this section 
shall suspend any quota fixed for the registrant pursuant to part 1303 
of this chapter. Also, upon service of the order of the Administrator

all proceedings upon the revocation or suspension, including any 
judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Administrator or 
dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any registrant whose 
registration is suspended under this section may request a hearing on 
the revocation or suspension of his registration at a time earlier than 
specified in the order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1301.48, which 
request shall be granted by the Administrator, who shall fix a date for 
such hearing as early as reasonably possible.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.47   Extension of registration pending final order.

    In the event that an applicant for reregistration (who is doing 
business under a registration previously granted and not revoked or 
suspended) has applied for reregistration at least 45 days before the 
date on which the existing registration is due to expire, and the 
Administrator has issued no order on the application on the date on 
which the existing registration is due to expire, the existing 
registration of the applicant shall automatically be extended and 
continue in effect until the date on which the Administrator so issues 
his order. The Administrator may extend any other existing registration 
under the circumstances contemplated in this section even though the 
registrant failed to apply for reregistration at least 45 days before 
expiration of the existing registration, with or without request by the 
registrant, if the Administrator finds that such extension is not 
inconsistent with the public health and safety.

<R05>
Sec. 1301.48   Order to show cause.

    (a) If, upon examination of the application for registration from 
any applicant and other information gathered by the Administration 
regarding the applicant, the Administrator is unable to make the 
determinations required by the applicable provisions of section 303 of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) to register the applicant, the Administrator 
shall serve upon the applicant an order to show cause why the 
registration should not be denied.

any registrant, the Administrator determines that the registration of 
such registrant is subject to suspension or revocation pursuant to 
section 304 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824), the Administrator shall serve 
upon the registrant an order to show cause why the registration should 
not be revoked or suspended.
    (c) The order to show cause shall call upon the applicant or 
registrant to appear before the Administrator at a time and place stated 
in the order, which shall not be less than 30 days after the date of

conclusions of law.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.53   Waiver or modification of rules.

    The Administrator or the presiding officer (with respect to matters 
pending before him) may modify or waive any rule in this part by notice 
in advance of the hearing, if he determines that no party in the hearing 
will be unduly prejudiced and the ends of justice will thereby be 
served. Such notice of modification or waiver shall be made a part of 
the record of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.54   Request for hearing or appearance; waiver.

    (a) Any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to Secs. 1301.42, 
1301.44, or 1301.45 and desiring a hearing shall, within 30 days after 
the date of receipt of the order to shown cause, file with the 
Administrator a written request for a hearing in the form prescribed in 
Sec. 1316.47 of this chapter.
    (b) Any person entitled to participate in a hearing pursuant to

file with the Administrator a waiver of an opportunity for a hearing or 
to participate in a hearing, together with a written statement regarding 
such person's position on the matters of fact and law involved in such 
hearing. Such statement, if admissible, shall be made a part of the 
record and shall be considered in light of the lack of opportunity for 
cross-examination in determining the weight to be attached to matters of 
fact asserted therein.
    (d) If any person entitled to a hearing or to participate in a 
hearing pursuant to Secs. 1301.42, 1301.44, or 1301.45 fails to file a 
request for a hearing or a notice of appearance, or if such person so 
files and fails to appear at the hearing, such person shall be deemed to 
have waived the opportunity for a hearing or to participate in the 
hearing, unless such person shows good cause for such failure.
    (e) If all persons entitled to a hearing or to participate in a 
hearing waive or are deemed to waive their opportunity for the hearing 
or to participate in the hearing, the Administrator may cancel the 
hearing, if scheduled, and issue his final order pursuant to 
Sec. 1301.57 without a hearing.

                          Security Repuirements


<R05>
Sec. 1301.71   Security requirements generally.

    (a) All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls 
and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled 
substances. In order to determine whether a registrant has provided 
effective controls against diversion, the Administrator shall use the 
security requirements set forth in Secs. 1301.72-1301.76 as standards 
for the physical security controls and operating procedures necessary to 
prevent diversion. Materials and construction which will provide a 
structural equivalent to the physical security controls set forth in 
Secs. 1301.72, 1301.73 and 1301.75 may be used in lieu of the materials 
and construction described in those sections.
    (b) Substantial compliance with the standards set forth in 
Secs. 1301.72-1301.76 may be deemed sufficient by the Administrator 
after evaluation of the overall security system and needs of the 
applicant or registrant. In evaluating the overall security system of a 
registrant or applicant, the Administrator may consider any of the 
following factors as he may deem relevant to the need for strict 
compliance with security requirements:
    (1) The type of activity conducted (e.g., processing of bulk 
chemicals, preparing dosage forms, packaging, labeling, cooperative 
buying, etc.);
    (2) The type and form of controlled substances handled (e.g., bulk 
liquids or dosage units, usable powders or nonusable powders);
    (3) The quantity of controlled substances handled;

[[Page 25]]

    (4) The location of the premises and the relationship such location 
bears on security needs;
    (5) The type of building construction comprising the facility and 
the general characteristics of the building or buildings;
    (6) The type of vault, safe, and secure enclosures or other storage 
system (e.g., automatic storage and retrieval system) used;
    (7) The type of closures on vaults, safes, and secure enclosures;
    (8) The adequacy of key control systems and/or combination lock 
control systems;
    (9) The adequacy of electric detection and alarm systems, if any 
including use of supervised transmittal lines and standby power sources;
    (10) The extent of unsupervised public access to the facility, 
including the presence and characteristics of perimeter fencing, if any;
    (11) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to 
manufacturing and storage areas;
    (12) The procedures for handling business guests, visitors, 
maintenance personnel, and nonemployee service personnel;
    (13) The availability of local police protection or of the 
registrant's or applicant's security personnel, and;
    (14) The adequacy of the registrant's or applicant's system for 
monitoring the receipt, manufacture, distribution, and disposition of 
controlled substances in its operations.
    (c) When physical security controls become inadequate as a result of 
a controlled substance being transferred to a different schedule, or as 
a result of a noncontrolled substance being listed on any schedule, or 
as a result of a significant increase in the quantity of controlled 
substances in the possession of the registrant during normal business 
operations, the physical security controls shall be expanded and 
extended accordingly. A registrant may adjust physical security controls 
within the requirements set forth in Secs. 1301.72-1301.76 when the need 
for such controls decreases as a result of a controlled substance being 
transferred to a different schedule, or a result of a controlled 
substance being removed from control, or as a result of a significant 
decrease in the quantity of controlled substances in the possession of 
the registrant during normal business operations.
    (d) Any registrant or applicant desiring to determine whether a 
proposed security system substantially complies with, or is the 
structural equivalent of, the requirements set forth in Secs. 1301.72-
1301.76 may submit any plans, blueprints, sketches or other materials 
regarding the proposed security system either to the Special Agent in 
Charge in the region in which the system will be used, or to the 
Diversion Operations Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, 
Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20537.
    (e) Physical security controls of locations registered under the 
Harrison Narcotic Act or the Narcotics Manufacturing Act of 1960 on 
April 30, 1971, shall be deemed to comply substantially with the 
standards set forth in Secs. 1301.72, 1301.73 and 1301.75. Any new 
facilities or work or storage areas constructed or utilized for 
controlled substances, which facilities or work or storage areas have 
not been previously approved by the Administration, shall not 
necessarily be deemed to comply substantially with the standards set 
forth in Secs. 1301.72, 1301.73 and 1301.75, notwithstanding that such 
facilities or work or storage areas have physical security controls 
similar to those previously approved by the Administration.

    (iii) Having a ceiling constructed of the same material, or in the 
alternative, a cage shall be erected which reaches and is securely 
attached to the structural ceiling of the building. A lighter gauge mesh 
may be used for the ceilings of large enclosed areas if walls are at 
least 14 feet in height,
    (iv) Is equipped with a door constructed of No. 10 gauge steel 
fabric on a metal door frame in a metal door flange, and in all other 
respects conforms to all the requirements of 21 CFR 1301.72(b)(3)(ii), 
and
    (v) Is equipped with an alarm system which upon unauthorized entry 
shall transmit a signal directly to a central station protection agency 
or a local or state police agency, each having a legal duty to respond, 
or to a 24-hour control station operated by the registrant, or to such 
other source of protection as the Administrator may approve;
    (5) An enclosure of masonry or other material, approved in writing 
by the Administrator as providing security comparable to a cage;
    (6) A building or enclosure within a building which has been 
inspected and approved by DEA or its predecessor agency, BNDD, and 
continues to provide adequate security against the diversion of Schedule 
III through V controlled substances, of which fact written 
acknowledgment has been made by the Special Agent in Charge of DEA for 
the area in which such building or enclosure is situated;
    (7) Such other secure storage areas as may be approved by the 
Administrator after considering the factors listed in Sec. 1301.71(b), 
(1) through (14);
    (8) (i) Schedule III through V controlled substances may be stored 
with Schedules I and II controlled substances under security measures 
provided by 21 CFR 1301.72(a);
    (ii) Non-controlled drugs, substances and other materials may be 
stored with Schedule III through V controlled substances in any of the 
secure storage areas required by 21 CFR 1301.72(b), provided that 
permission for such storage of non-controlled items is obtained in 
advance, in writing, from the Special Agent in Charge of DEA for the 
area in which such storage area is situated. Any such permission 
tendered must be upon the Special Agent in Charge's written 
determination that such non-segregated storage does not diminish 
security effectiveness for Schedules III through V controlled 
substances.
    (c) Multiple storage areas. Where several types or classes of 
controlled substances are handled separately by the registrant or 
applicant for different purposes (e.g., returned goods, or goods in 
process), the controlled substances may be stored separately, provided 
that each storage area complies with the requirements set forth in this 
section.
    (d) Accessibility to storage areas. The controlled substances 
storage areas shall be accessible only to an absolute minimum number of 
specifically authorized employees. When it is necessary for employee 
maintenance personnel, nonemployee maintenance personnel, business 
guests, or visitors to be present in or pass through controlled 
substances storage areas, the registrant shall provide for adequate 
observation of the area by an employee specifically authorized in 
writing.

Sec. 1301.73   Physical security controls for non-practitioners; compounders for narcotic treatment programs; manufacturing and compounding areas.

    All manufacturing activities (including processing, packaging and 
labeling) involving controlled substances listed in any schedule and all 
activities of compounders shall be conducted in accordance with the 
following:
    (a) All in-process substances shall be returned to the controlled 
substances storage area at the termination of the process. If the 
process is not terminated at the end of a workday (except where a 
continuous process or other normal manufacturing operation should not be 
interrupted), the processing area or tanks, vessels, bins or bulk 
containers containing such substances shall be securely locked, with 
adequate security for the area or building. If such security requires an 
alarm, such alarm, upon unauthorized entry, shall transmit a signal 
directly to a central station protection company, or local or state 
police agency which has a legal duty to respond, or a 24-hour control 
station operated by the registrant.
    (b) Manufacturing activities with controlled substances shall be 
conducted in an area or areas of clearly defined limited access which is 
under surveillance by an employee or employees designated in writing as 
responsible for the area. ``Limited access'' may be provided, in the 
absence of physical dividers such as walls or partitions, by traffic 
control lines or restricted space designation. The employee designated 
as responsible for the area may be engaged in the particular 
manufacturing operation being conducted: Provided, That he is able to 
provide continuous surveillance of the area in order that unauthorized 
persons may not enter or leave the area without his knowledge.
    (c) During the production of controlled substances, the 
manufacturing areas shall be accessible to only those employees required 
for efficient operation. When it is necessary for employee maintenance 
personnel, nonemployee maintenance personnel, business guests, or 
visitors to be present in or pass through manufacturing areas during 
production of controlled substances, the registrant shall provide for 
adequate observation of the area by an employee specifically authorized 
in writing.

<R05>
Sec. 1301.74   Other security controls for non-practitioners; narcotic treatment programs and compounders for narcotic treatment programs.

    (a) Before distributing a controlled substance to any person who the 
registrant does not know to be registered to possess the controlled 
substance, the registrant shall make a good faith inquiry either with 
the Administration or with the appropriate State controlled substances 
registration agency, if any, to determine that the person is registered 
to possess the controlled substance.
    (b) The registrant shall design and operate a system to disclose to 
the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances. The 
registrant shall inform the Field Division Office of the Administration 
in his area of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrant. 
Suspicious orders include orders of unusual size, orders deviating 
substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency.
    (c) The registrant shall notify the Field Division Office of the 
Administration in his area of any theft or significant loss of any 
controlled substances upon discovery of such theft or loss. The supplier 
shall be responsible for reporting in-transit losses of controlled 
substances by the common or contract carrier selected pursuant to 
Sec. 1301.74(e), upon discovery of such theft or loss. The registrant 
shall also complete DEA Form 106 regarding such theft or loss. Thefts 
must be reported whether or not the controlled substances are 
subsequently recovered and/or the responsible parties are identified and 
action taken against them.
    (d) The registrant shall not distribute any controlled substance 
listed in Schedules II through V as a complimentary sample to any 
potential or current customer (1) without the prior written request of 
the customer, (2) to be used only for satisfying the legitimate medical 
needs of patients of the customer, and (3) only in reasonable 
quantities. Such request must contain

[[Page 29]]

the name, address, and registration number of the customer and the name 
and quantity of the specific controlled substance desired. The request 
shall be preserved by the registrant with other records of distribution 
of controlled substances. In addition, the requirements of part 1305 of 
the chapter shall be complied with for any distribution of a controlled 
substance listed in Schedule II. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``customer'' includes a person to whom a complimentary sample of a 
substance is given in order to encourage the prescribing or recommending 
of the substance by the person.
    (e) When shipping controlled substances, a registrant is responsible 
for selecting common or contract carriers which provide adequate 
security to guard against in-transit losses. When storing controlled 
substances in a public warehouse, a registrant is responsible for 
selecting a warehouseman which will provide adequate security to guard 
against storage losses; wherever possible, the registrant shall store 
controlled substances in a public warehouse which complies with the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 1301.72. In addition, the registrant 
shall employ precautions (e.g., assuring that shipping containers do not 
indicate that contents are controlled substances) to guard against 
storage or in-transit losses.
    (f) When distributing controlled substances through agents (e.g., 
detailmen), a registrant is responsible for providing and requiring 
adequate security to guard against theft and diversion while the 
substances are being stored or handled by the agent or agents.
    (g) Before the initial distribution of carfentanil etorphine 
hydrochloride and/or diprenorphine to any person, the registrant must 
verify that the person is authorized to handle the substances(s) by 
contacting the Drug Enforcement Administration.
    (h) The acceptance of delivery of narcotic substances by a narcotic 
treatment program shall be made only by a licensed practitioner employed 
at the facility or other authorized individuals designated in writing. 
At the time of delivery, the licensed practitioner or other authorized 
individual designated in writing (excluding persons currently or 
previously dependent on narcotic drugs), shall sign for the narcotics 
and place his specific title (if any) on any invoice. Copies of these 
signed invoices shall be kept by the distributor.
    (i) Narcotics dispensed or administered at a narcotic treatment 
program will be dispensed or administered directly to the patient by 
either (1) the licensed practitioner, (2) a registered nurse under the 
direction of the licensed practitioner, (3) a licensed practical nurse 
under the direction of the licensed practitioner, or (4) a pharmacist 
under the direction of the licensed practitioner.
    (j) Persons enrolled in a narcotic treatment program will be 
required to wait in an area physically separated from the narcotic 
storage and dispensing area. This requirement will be enforced by the 
program physician and employees.
    (k) All narcotic treatment programs must comply with standards 
established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (after 
consultation with the Administration) respecting the quantities of 
narcotic drugs which may be provided to persons enrolled in a narcotic 
treatment program for unsupervised use.
    (l) DEA may exercise discretion regarding the degree of security 
required in narcotic treatment programs based on such factors as the 
location of a program, the number of patients enrolled in a program and 
the number of physicians, staff members and security guards. Similarly, 
such factors will be taken into consideration when evaluating existing 
security or requiring new security at a narcotic treatment program.

However, pharmacies and institutional practitioners (as defined in 
Sec. 1304.02(e) of this chapter) may disperse such substances throughout 
the stock of noncontrolled substances in such a manner as to obstruct 
the theft or diversion of the controlled substances.
    (c) This section shall also apply to nonpractitioners authorized to 
conduct research or chemical analysis under another registration.
    (d) Carfentanil etorphine hydrochloride and diprenorphine shall be 
stored in a safe or steel cabinet equivalent to a U.S. Government Class 
V security container.

Sec. 1301.76   Other security controls for practitioners.

    (a) The registrant shall not employ, as an agent or employee who has 
access to controlled substances, any person who has been convicted of a 
felony offense relating to controlled substances or who, at any time, 
had an application for registration with the DEA denied, had a DEA 
registration revoked or has surrendered a DEA registration for cause. 
For purposes of this subsection, the term ``for cause'' means a 
surrender in lieu of, or as a consequence of, any federal or state 
administrative, civil or criminal action resulting from an investigation 
of the individual's handling of controlled substances.
    (b) The registrant shall notify the Field Division Office of the 
Administration in his area of the theft or significant loss of any 
controlled substances upon discovery of such loss or theft. The 
registrant shall also complete DEA (or BND) Form 106 regarding such loss 
or theft.
    (c) Whenever the registrant distributes a controlled substance 
(without being registered as a distributor, as permitted in 
Sec. 1301.22(b) and/or Secs. 1307.11-1307.14), he shall comply with the 
requirements imposed on nonpractitioners in Sec. 1301.74 (a), (b), and 
(e).

                 Employee Screening--Non- Practitioners


<R05>
Sec. 1301.90   Employee screening procedures.

    It is the position of DEA that the obtaining of certain information 
by non-practitioners is vital to fairly assess the likelihood of an 
employee committing a drug security breach. The need to know this 
information is a matter of business necessity, essential to overall 
controlled substances security. In this regard, it is believed that 
conviction of crimes and unauthorized use of controlled substances are 
activities that are proper subjects for inquiry. It is, therefore, 
assumed that the following questions will become a part of an employer's 
comprehensive employee screening program:

    Question. Within the past five years, have you been convicted of a 
felony, or within the past two years, of any misdemeanor or are you 
presently formally charged with committing a criminal offense? (Do not 
include any traffic violations, juvenile offenses or military 
convictions, except by general court-martial.) If the answer is yes, 
furnish details of conviction, offense, location, date and sentence.

    Question. In the past three years, have you ever knowingly used any 
narcotics, amphetamines or barbiturates, other than those prescribed to 
you by a physician? If the answer is yes, furnish details.

    Advice. An authorization, in writing, that allows inquiries to be 
made of courts and law enforcement agencies for possible pending charges 
or convictions must be executed by a person who is allowed to work in an 
area where access to controlled substances clearly exists. A person must 
be advised that any false information or omission of information will 
jeopardize his or her position with respect to employment. The 
application for employment should inform a person that information 
furnished or recovered as a result of any inquiry will not necessarily 
preclude employment, but will be considered as part of an overall 
evaluation of the person's qualifications. The maintaining of fair 
employment practices, the protection of the person's right of privacy, 
and the assurance

[[Page 31]]

that the results of such inquiries will be treated by the employer in 
confidence will be explained to the employee.

[40 FR 17143, Apr. 17, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.91   Employee responsibility to report drug diversion.

    Reports of drug diversion by fellow employees is not only a 
necessary part of an overall employee security program but also serves 
the public interest at large. It is, therefore, the position of DEA that 
an employee who has knowledge of drug diversion from his employer by a 
fellow employee has an obligation to report such information to a 
responsible security official of the employer. The employer shall treat 
such information as confidential and shall take all reasonable steps to 
protect the confidentiality of the information and the identity of the 
employee furnishing information. A failure to report information of drug 
diversion will be considered in determining the feasibility of 
continuing to allow an employee to work in a drug security area. The 
employer shall inform all employees concerning this policy.

[40 FR 17143, Apr. 17, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.92   Illicit activities by employees.

    It is the position of DEA that employees who possess, sell, use or 
divert controlled substances will subject themselves not only to State 
or Federal prosecution for any illicit activity, but shall also 
immediately become the subject of independent action regarding their 
continued employment. The employer will assess the seriousness of the 
employee's violation, the position of responsibility held by the 
employee, past record of employment, etc., in determining whether to 
suspend, transfer, terminate or take other action against the employee.

[40 FR 17143, Apr. 17, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.93   Sources of information for employee checks.

    DEA recommends that inquiries concerning employees' criminal records 
be made as follows:

    Local inquiries. Inquiries should be made by name, date and place of 
birth, and other identifying information, to local courts and law 
enforcement agencies for records of pending charges and convictions. 
Local practice may require such inquiries to be made in person, rather 
than by mail, and a copy of an authorization from the employee may be 
required by certain law enforcement agencies.
    DEA inquiries. Inquiries supplying identifying information should 
also be furnished to DEA Field Division Offices along with written 
consent from the concerned individual for a check of DEA files for 
records of convictions. The Regional check will result in a national 
check being made by the Field Division Office.

               Aggregate Production and Procurement Quotas


<R05>
Sec. 1303.11   Aggregate production quotas.

    (a) The Administrator shall determine the total quantity of each 
basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II necessary 
to be manufactured during the following calendar year to provide for the 
estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the 
United States, for lawful export requirements, and for the establishment 
and maintenance of reserve stocks.

[[Page 35]]

    (b) In making his determinations, the Administrator shall consider 
the following factors:
    (1) Total net disposal of the class by all manufacturers during the 
current and 2 preceding years;
    (2) Trends in the national rate of net disposal of the class;
    (3) Total actual (or estimated) inventories of the class and of all 
substances manufactured from the class, and trends in inventory 
accumulation;
    (4) Projected demand for such class as indicated by procurement 
quotas requested pursuant to Sec. 1303.12; and
    (5) Other factors affecting medical, scientific, research, and 
industrial needs in the United States and lawful export requirements, as 
the Administrator finds relevant, including changes in the currently 
accepted medical use in treatment with the class or the substances which 
are manufactured from it, the economic and physical availability of raw 
materials for use in manufacturing and for inventory purposes, yield and 
stability problems, potential disruptions to production (including 
possible labor strikes), and recent unforeseen emergencies such as 
floods and fires.
    (c) The Administrator shall, on or before May 1 of each year, 
publish in the Federal Register, general notice of an aggregate 
production quota for any basic class determined by him under this 
section. A copy of said notice shall be mailed simultaneously to each 
person registered as a bulk manufacturer of the basic class. The 
Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written 
comments on or objections to the proposal and shall designate in the 
notice the time during which such filings may be made. The Administrator 
may, but shall not be required to, hold a public hearing on one or more 
issues raised by the comments and objections filed with him. In the 
event the Administrator decides to hold such a hearing, he shall publish 
notice of the hearing in the Federal Register, which notice shall 
summarize the issues to be heard and shall set the time for the hearing 
which shall nnt be less than 30 days after the date of publication of 
the notice. After consideration of any comments or objections, or after 
a hearing if one is ordered by the Administrator, the Administrator 
shall issue and publish in the Federal Register his final order 
determining the aggregate production quota for the basic class of 
controlled substance. The order shall include the findings of fact and 
conclusions of law upon which the order is based. The order shall 
specify the date on which it shall take effect. A copy of said order 
shall be mailed simultaneously to each person registered as a bulk 
manufacturer of the basic class.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.12   Procurement quotas.

    (a) In order to determine the estimated needs for, and to insure an 
adequate and uninterrupted supply of, basic classes of controlled 
substances listed in Schedules I and II (except raw opium being imported 
by the registrant pursuant to an import permit) the Administrator shall 
issue procurement quotas authorizing persons to procure and use 
quantities of each basic class of such substances for the purpose of 
manufacturing such class into dosage forms or into other substances.
    (b) Any person who is registered to manufacture controlled 
substances listed in any schedule and who desires to use during the next 
calendar year any basic class of controlled substances listed in 
Schedule I or II (except raw opium being imported by the registrant 
pursuant to an import permit) for purposes of manufacturing, shall apply 
on DEA (or BND) Form 250 for a procurement quota for such basic class. A 
separate application must be made for each basic class desired to be 
procured or used. The applicant shall state whether he intends to 
manufacture the basic class himself or purchase it from another 
manufacturer. The applicant shall state separately each purpose for 
which the basic class is desired, the quantity desired for that purpose 
during the next calendar year, and the quantities used and estimated to 
be used, if any, for that purpose during the current and preceding 2 
calendar years. If the purpose is to manufacture the basic class into 
dosage form, the applicant shall state the official name, common or 
usual name, chemical

[[Page 36]]

name, or brand name of that form. If the purpose is to manufacture 
another substance, the applicant shall state the official name, common 
or usual name, chemical name, or brand name of the substance, and, if a 
controlled substance listed in any schedule, the schedule number and 
Administration Controlled Substances Code Number, as set forth in part 
1308 of this chapter, of the substance. If the purpose is to manufacture 
another basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II, 
the applicant shall also state the quantity of the other basic class 
which the applicant has applied to manufacture pursuant to Sec. 1303.22 
and the quantity of the first basic class necessary to manufacture a 
specified unit of the second basic class. DEA (or BND) Form 250 shall be 
filed on or before April 1 of the year preceding the calendar year for 
which the procurement quota is being applied. Copies of DEA (or BND) 
Form 250 may be obtained from, and shall be filed with, the Drug Control 
Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, 
Washington, DC 20537.
    (c) The Administrator shall, on or before July 1 of the year 
preceding the calendar year during which the quota shall be effective, 
issue to each qualified applicant a procurement quota authorizing him to 
procure and use:
    (1) All quantities of such class necessary to manufacture all 
quantities of other basic classes of controlled substances listed in 
Schedules I and II which the applicant is authorized to manufacture 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.23; and
    (2) Such other quantities of such class as the applicant has applied 
to procure and use and are consistent with his past use, his estimated 
needs, and the total quantity of such class that will be produced.
    (d) Any person to whom a procurement quota has been issued may at 
any time request an adjustment in the quota by applying to the 
Administrator with a statement showing the need for the adjustment. Such 
application shall be filed with the Drug Control Section, Drug 
Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20537. 
The Administrator shall increase or decrease the procurement quota of 
such person if and to the extent that he finds, after considering the 
factors enumerated in paragraph (c) of this section and any occurrences 
since the issuance of the procurement quota, that the need justifies an 
adjustment.
    (e) The following persons need not obtain a procurement quota:
    (1) Any person who is registered to manufacture a basic class of 
controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II and who uses all of the 
quantity he manufactures in the manufacture of a subsance not controlled 
under the Act;
    (2) Any person who is registered or authorized to conduct chemical 
analysis with controlled substances (for controlled substances to be 
used in such analysis only); and
    (3) Any person who is registered to conduct research with a basic 
class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II and who is 
authorized to manufacture a quantity of such class pursuant to 
Sec. 1301.22(b) of this chapter.
    (f) Any person to whom a procurement quota has been issued, 
authorizing that person to procure and use a quantity of a basic class 
of controlled substances listed in Schedules I or II during the current 
calendar year, shall, at or before the time of giving an order to 
another manufacturer requiring the distribution of a quantity of such 
basic class, certify in writing to such other manufacturer that the 
quantity of such basic class ordered does not exceed the person's unused 
and available procurement quota of such basic class for the current 
calendar year. The written certification shall be executed by the same 
individual who signed the DEA Form 222 transmitting the order. 
Manufacturers shall not fill an order from persons required to apply for 
a procurement quota under paragraph (b) of this section unless the order 
is accompanied by a certification as required under this section. The 
certification required by this section shall contain the following: The 
date of the certification; the name and address of the bulk manufacturer 
to whom the certification is directed; a reference to the number of the 
DEA Form 222 to which the certification applies; the name of the person 
giving the order to which the certification applies; the name of the 
basic class specified in the DEA Form 222 to

[[Page 37]]

which the certification applies; the appropriate schedule within which 
is listed the basic class specified in the DEA Form 222 to which the 
certification applies; a statement that the quantity (expressed in 
grams) of the basic class specified in the DEA Form 222 to which the 
certification applies does not exceed the unused and available 
procurement quota of such basic class, issued to the person giving the 
order, for the current calendar year; and the signature of the 
individual who signed the DEA Form 222 to which the certification 
applies.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.13   Adjustments of aggregate production quotas.

    (a) The Administrator may at any time increase or reduce the 
aggregate production quota for a basic class of controlled substance 
listed in Schedule I or II which he has previously fixed pursuant to 
Sec. 1303.11.
    (b) In determining to adjust the aggregate production quota, the 
Administrator shall consider the following factors:
    (1) Changes in the demand for that class, changes in the national 
rate of net disposal of the class, and changes in the rate of net 
disposal of the class by registrants holding individual manufacturing 
quotas for that class;
    (2) Whether any increased demand for that class, the national and/or 
individual rates of net disposal of that class are temporary, short 
term, or long term;
    (3) Whether any increased demand for that class can be met through 
existing inventories, increased individual manufacturing quotas, or 
increased importation, without increasing the aggregate production 
quota, taking into account production delays and the probability that 
other individual manufacturing quotas may be suspended pursuant to 
Sec. 1303.24(b);
    (4) Whether any decreased demand for that class will result in 
excessive inventory accumulation by all persons registered to handle 
that class (including manufacturers, distributors, practitioners, 
importers, and exporters), notwithstanding the possibility that 
individual manufacturing quotas may be suspended pursuant to 
Sec. 1303.24(b) or abandoned pursuant to Sec. 1303.27;
    (5) Other factors affecting medical, scientific, research, and 
industrial needs in the United States and lawful export requirements, as 
the Administrator finds relevant, including changes in the currently 
accepted medical use in treatment with the class or the substances which 
are manufactured from it, the economic and physical availability of raw 
materials for use in manufacturing and for inventory purposes, yield and 
stability problems, potential disruptions to production (including 
possible labor strikes), and recent unforeseen emergencies such as 
floods and fires.
    (c) The Administrator in the event he determines to increase or 
reduce the aggregate production quota for a basic class of controlled 
substance, shall publish in the Federal Register general notice of an 
adjustment in the aggregate production quota for that class determined 
by him under this section. A copy of said notice shall be mailed 
simultaneously to each person registered as a bulk manufacturer of the 
basic class. The Administrator shall permit any interested person to 
file written comments on or objections to the proposal and shall 
designate in the notice the time during which such filings may be made. 
The Administrator may, but shall not be required to, hold a public 
hearing on one or more issues raised by the comments and objections 
filed with him. In the event the Administrator decides to hold such a 
hearing, he shall publish notice of the hearing in the Federal Register, 
which notice shall summarize the issues to be heard and shall set the 
time for the hearing, which shall not be less than 10 days after the 
date of publication of the notice. After consideration of any comments 
or objections, or after a hearing if one is ordered by the 
Administrator, the Administrator shall issue and publish in the Federal 
Register his final order determining the aggregate production for the 
basic class of controlled

[[Page 38]]

substance. The order shall include the findings of fact and conclusions 
of law upon which the order is based. The order shall specify the date 
on which it shall take effect. A copy of said order shall be mailed 
simultaneously to each person registered as a bulk manufacturer of the 
basic class.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.22   Procedure for applying for individual manufacturing quotas.

    Any person who is registered to manufacture any basic class of 
controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II and who desires to 
manufacture a quantity of such class shall apply on DEA (or BND) Form 
189 for a manufacturing quota for such quantity of such class. Copies of 
DEA (or BND) Form 189 may be obtained from, and shall be filed (on or 
before May 1 of the year preceding the calendar year for which the 
manufacturing quota is being applied) with, the Drug Control Section, 
Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 
20537. A separate application must be made for each basic class desired 
to be manufactured. The applicant shall state:
    (a) The name and Administration Controlled Substances Code Number, 
as set forth in part 1308 of this chapter, of the basic class.
    (b) For the basic class in each of the current and preceding 2 
calendar years,
    (1) The authorized individual manufacturing quota, if any;
    (2) The actual or estimated quantity manufactured;
    (3) The actual or estimated net disposal;
    (4) The actual or estimated inventory allowance pursuant to 
Sec. 1303.24; and
    (5) The actual or estimated inventory as of December 31;
    (c) For the basic class in the next calendar year,
    (1) The desired individual manufacturing quota; and
    (2) Any additional factors which the applicant finds relevant to the 
fixing of his individual manufacturing quota, including the trend of 
(and recent changes in) his and the national rates of net disposal, his 
production cycle and current inventory position, the econolic and 
physical availability of raw materials for use in manufacturing and for 
inventory purposes, yield and stability problems, potential disruptions 
to production (including possible labor strikes) and recent unforeseen 
emergencies such as floods and fires.

Sec. 1303.23   Procedure for fixing individual manufacturing quotas.

    (a) In fixing individual manufacturing quotas for a basic class of 
controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II, the Administrator shall 
allocate to each applicant who is currently manufacturing such class a 
quota equal to 100 percent of the estimated net disposal of that 
applicant for the next calendar year, adjusted--
    (1) By the amount necessary to increase or reduce the estimated 
inventory of the applicant on December 31 of the current year to his 
estimated inventory allowance for the next calendar year, pursuant to 
Sec. 1303.24, and
    (2) By any other factors which the Administrator deems relevant to 
the

[[Page 39]]

fixing of the individual manufacturing quota of the applicant, including 
the trend of (and recent changes in) his and the national rates of net 
disposal, his production cycle and current inventory position, the 
economic and physical availability of raw materials for use in 
manufacturing and for inventory purposes, yield and stability problems, 
potential disruptions to production (including possible labor strikes), 
and recent unforeseen emergencies such as floods and fires.
    (b) In fixing individual manufacturing quotas for a basic class of 
controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II, the Administrator shall 
allocate to each applicant who is not currently manufacturing such class 
a quota equal to 100 percent of the reasonably estimated net disposal of 
that applicant for the next calendar year, as determined by the 
Administrator, adjusted--
    (1) By the amount necessary to provide the applicant his estimated 
inventory allowance for the next calendar year, pursuant to 
Sec. 1303.24, and
    (2) By any other factors which the Administrator deems relevant to 
the fixing of the individual manufacturing quota of the applicant, 
including the trend of (and recent changes in) the national rate of net 
disposal, his production cycle and current inventory position, the 
economic and physical availability of raw materials for use in 
manufacturing and for inventory purposes, yield and stability problems, 
potential disruptions to production (including possible labor strikes), 
and recent unforeseen emergencies such as floods and fires.
    (c) The Administrator shall, on or before March 1 of each year, 
adjust the individual manufacturing quota allocated for that year to 
each applicant in paragraph (a) of this section by the amount necessary 
to increase or reduce the actual inventory of the applicant to December 
31 of the preceding year to his estimated inventory allowance for the 
current calendar year, pursuant to Sec. 1303.24.

[36 FR 7786, Apr. 24, 1971, as amended at 37 FR 15920, Aug. 8, 1972. 
Redesignated at 38 FR 26609, Sept. 24, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 1303.24   Inventory allowance.

    (a) For the purpose of determining individual manufacturing quotas 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.23, each registered manufacturer shall be allowed 
as a part of such quota an amount sufficient to maintain an inventory 
equal to,
    (1) For current manufacturers, 50 percent of his average estimated 
net disposal for the current calendar year and the last preceding 
calendar year; or
    (2) For new manufacturers, 50 percent of his reasonably estimated 
net disposal for the next calendar year as determined by the 
Administrator.
    (b) During each calendar year each registered manufacturer shall be 
allowed to maintain an inventory of a basic class not exceeding 65 
percent of his estimated net disposal of that class for that year, as 
determined at the time his quota for that year was determined. At any 
time the inventory of a basic class held by a manufacturer exceeds 65 
percent of his estimated net disposal, his quota for that class is 
automatically suspended and shall remain suspended until his inventory 
is less than 60 percent of his estimated net disposal. The Administrator 
may, upon application and for good cause shown, permit a manufacturer 
whose quota is, or is likely to be, suspended pursuant to this paragraph 
to continue manufacturing and to accumulate an inventory in excess of 65 
percent of his estimated net disposal, upon such conditions and within 
such limitations as the Administrator may find necessary or desirable.
    (c) If, during a calendar year, a registrant has manufactured the 
entire quantity of a basic class allocated to him under an individual 
manufacturing quota, and his inventory of that class is less than 40 
percent of his estimated net disposal of that class for that year, the 
Administrator may, upon application pursuant to Sec. 1303.25, increase 
the quota of such registrant sufficiently to allow restoration of the 
inventory to 50 percent of the estimated net disposal for that year.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.25   Increase in individual manufacturing quotas.

    (a) Any registrant who holds an individual manufacturing quota for a 
basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II may file 
with the Administrator an application on Administration Form 189 for an 
increase in such quota in order for him to meet his estimated net 
disposal, inventory and other requirements during the remainder of such 
calendar year.
    (b) The Administrator, in passing upon a registrant's application 
for an increase in his individual manufacturing quota, shall take into 
consideration any occurrences since the filing of such registrant's 
initial quota application that may require an increased manufacturing 
rate by such registrant during the balance of the calendar year. In 
passing upon such application the Administrator may also take into 
consideration the amount, if any, by which his determination of the 
total quantity for the basic class of controlled substance to be 
manufactured under Sec. 1303.11 exceeds the aggregate of all the 
individual manufacturing quotas for the basic class of controlled 
substance, and the equitable distribution of such excess among other 
registrants.

<R05>
Sec. 1303.26   Reduction in individual manufacturing quotas.

    The Administrator may at any time reduce an individual manufacturing 
quota for a basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or 
II which he has previously fixed in order to prevent the aggregate of 
the individual manufacturing quotas and import permits outstanding or to 
be granted from exceeding the aggregate production quota which has been 
established for that class pursuant of Sec. 1303.11, as adjusted 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.13. If a quota assigned to a new manufacturer 
pursuant to Sec. 1303.23(b), or if a quota assigned to any manufacturer 
is increased pursuant to Sec. 1303.24(c), or if an import permit issued 
to an importer pursuant to part 1312 of this chapter, causes the total 
quantity of a basic class to be manufactured and imported during the 
year to exceed the aggregate production quota which has been established 
for that class pursuant to Sec. 1303.11, as adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1303.13, the Administrator may proportionately reduce the 
individual manufacturing quotas and import permits of all other 
registrants to keep the aggregate production quota within the limits

<R05>
Sec. 1304.02   Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following terms shall have the meanings 
specified:
    (a) The term Act means the Controlled Substances Act (84 Stat. 1242; 
21 U.S.C. 801) and/or the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act 
(84 Stat. 1285; 21 U.S.C. 951).
    (b) The term commercial container means any bottle, jar, tube, 
ampule, or other receptacle in which a substance is held for 
distribution or dispensing to an ultimate user, and in addition, any box 
or package in which the receptacle is held for distribution or 
dispensing to an ultimate user. The term commercial container does not 
include any package liner, package insert of other material kept with or 
within a commercial container, nor any carton, crate, drum, or other 
package in which commercial containers are stored or are used for 
shipment of controlled substances.
    (c) The term dispenser means an individual practitioner, 
institutional practitioner, pharmacy or pharmacist who dispenses a 
controlled substance.
    (d) The term individual practitioner means a physician, dentist, 
veterinarian, or other individual licensed, registered, or otherwise 
permitted, by the United States or the jurisdiction in which he 
practices, to dispense a controlled substance in the course of 
professional practice, but does not include a pharmacist, a pharmacy, or 
an institutional practitioner.
    (e) The term institutional practitioner means a hospital or other 
person (other than an individual) licensed, registered, or otherwise 
permitted, by the United States or the jurisdiction in which it 
practices, to dispense a controlled substance in the course of 
professional practice, but does not include a pharmacy.
    (f) The term mid-level practitioner means an individual practitioner 
(as defined in Sec. 1304.02(d)), other than a physician, dentist, 
veterinarian, or podiatrist, who is licensed, registered, or otherwise 
permitted by the United States or the jurisdiction in which he/she 
practices, to dispense a controlled substance in the course of 
professional practice. Examples of mid-level practitioners include, but 
are not limited to, health care providers such as nurse practitioners, 
nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists and 
physician assistants who are authorized to dispense controlled 
substances by the state in which they practice.

[[Page 44]]

    (g) The term name means the official name, common or usual name, 
chemical name, or brand name of a substance.
    (h) The term pharmacist means any pharmacist licensed by a State to 
dispense controlled substances, and shall include any other person 
(e.g., pharmacist intern) authorized by a State to dispense controlled 
substances under the supervision of a pharmacist licensed by such State.
    (i) The term readily retrievable means that certain records are kept 
by automatic data processing systems or other electronic or mechanized 
recordkeeping systems in such a manner that they can be separated out 
from all other records in a reasonable time and/or records are kept on 
which certain items are asterisked, redlined, or in some other manner 
visually identifiable apart from other items appearing on the records.
    (j) Any term not defined in this section shall have the definition 
set forth in sections 102 and 1001 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 802 and 951) 
and in Secs. 1301.02 and 1311.02 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 1304.03   Persons required to keep records and file reports.

    (a) Each registrant shall maintain the records and inventories and 
shall file the reports required by this part, except as exempted by this 
section. Any registrant who is authorized to conduct other activities 
without being registered to conduct those activities, either pursuant to 
Sec. 1301.22(b) of this chapter or pursuant to Secs. 1307.11-1307.15 of 
this chapter, shall maintain the records and inventories and shall file 
the reports required by this part for persons registered to conduct such 
activities. This latter requirement should not be construed as requiring 
stocks of controlled substances being used in various activities under 
one registration to be stored separately, nor that separate records are 
required for each activity. The intent of the Administration is to 
permit the registrant to keep one set of records which are adapted by 
the registrant to account for controlled substances used in any 
activity. Also, the Administration does not wish to acquire separate 
stocks of the same substance to be purchased and stored for separate 
activities. Otherwise, there is no advantage gained by permitting 
several activities under one registration. Thus, when a researcher 
manufactures a controlled item, he must keep a record of the quantity 
manufactured; when he distributes a quantity of the item, he must use 
and keep invoices or order forms to document the transfer; when he 
imports a substance, he keeps as part of his records the documentation 
required of an importer; and when substances are used in chemical 
analysis, he need not keep a record of this because such a record would 
not be required of him under a registration to do chemical analysis. All 
of these records may be maintained in one consolidated record system. 
Similarly, the researcher may store all of his controlled items in one 
place, and every two years take inventory of all items on hand, 
regardless of whether the substances were manufactured by him, imported 
by him, or purchased domestically by him, of whether the substances will 
be administered to subjects, distributed to other researchers, or 
destroyed during chemical analysis.
    (b) A registered individual practitioner is required to keep 
records, as described in Sec. 1304.04, of controlled substances in 
Schedules II, III, IV, and V which are dispensed, other than by 
prescribing or administering in the lawful course of professional 
practice.
    (c) A registered individual practitioner is not required to keep 
records of controlled substances in Schedules II, III, IV, and V which 
are prescribed in the lawful course of professional practice, unless 
such substances are prescribed in the course of maintenance or 
detoxification treatment of an individual.
    (d) A registered individual practitioner is not required to keep 
records of controlled substances listed in Schedules II, III, IV and V 
which are administered in the lawful course of professional practice 
unless the practitioner regularly engages in the dispensing or 
administering of controlled substances and charges patients, either 
separately or together with charges for

[[Page 45]]

other professional services, for substances so dispensed or 
administered. Records are required to be kept for controlled substances 
administered in the course of maintenance or detoxification treatment of 
an individual.
    (e) Each registered mid-level practitioner shall maintain in a 
readily retrievable manner those documents required by the state in 
which he/she practices which describe the conditions and extent of his/
her authorization to dispense controlled substances and shall make such 
documents available for inspection and copying by authorized employees 
of the Administration. Examples of such documentation include protocols, 
practice guidelines or practice agreements.
    (f) A registered person using any controlled substance in research 
conducted in conformity with an exemption granted under section 505(i) 
or 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i) 
or 360b(j)) at a registered establishment which maintains records in 
accordance with either of those sections is not required to keep records 
if he notifies the Administration of the name, address, and registration 
number of the establishment maintaining such records.
    (g) A registered person using any controlled substance in 
preclinical research or in teaching at a registered establishment which 
maintains records with respect to such substances is not required to 
keep records if he notifies the Administration of the name, address, and 
registration number of the establishment maintaining such records.
    (h) Notice required by paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section shall 
be given at the time the person applies for registration or 
reregistration and shall be made in the form of an attachment to the 
application, which shall be filed with the application.

<R05>
Sec. 1304.04  Maintenance of records and inventories.

    (a) Every inventory and other records required to be kept under this 
part shall be kept by the registrant and be available, for at least 2 
years from the date of such inventory or records, for inspection and 
copying by authorized employees of the Administration, except that 
financial and shipping records (such as invoices and packing slips but 
not excuted order forms subject to Sec. 1305.13 of this chapter) may be 
kept at a central location, rather than at the registered location, if 
the registrant has notified the Administration of his intention to keep 
central records. Written notification must be submitted by registered or 
certified mail, return receipt requested, in triplicate, to the Special 
Agent in Charge of the Administration in the area in which the 
registrant is located. Unless the registrant is informed by the Special 
Agent in Charge that permission to keep central records is denied, the 
registrant may maintain central records commencing 14 days after receipt 
of his notification by the Special Agent in Charge.

All notifications must include:
    (1) The nature of the records to be kept centrally.
    (2) The exact location where the records will be kept.
    (3) The name, address, DEA registration number and type of DEA 
registration of the registrant whose records are being maintained 
centrally.
    (4) Whether central records will be maintained in a manual, or 
computer readable form.
    (b) All registrants that are authorized to maintain a central 
recordkeeping system shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The records to be maintained at the central record location 
shall not include executed order forms, prescriptions and/or inventories 
which shall be maintained at each registered location.
    (2) If the records are kept on microfilm, computer media or in any 
form requiring special equipment to render the records easily readable, 
the registrant shall provide access to such equipment with the records. 
If any

[[Page 46]]

code system is used (other than pricing information), a key to the code 
shall be provided to make the records understandable.
    (3) The registrant agrees to deliver all or any part of such records 
to the registered location within two business days upon receipt of a 
written request from the Administration for such records, and if the 
Administration chooses to do so in lieu of requiring delivery of such 
records to the registered location, to allow authorized employees of the 
Administration to inspect such records at the central location upon 
request by such employees without a warrant of any kind.
    (4) In the event that a registrant fails to comply with these 
conditions, the Special Agent in Charge may cancel such central 
recordkeeping authorization, and all other central recordkeeping 
authorizations held by the registrant without a hearing or other 
procedures. In the event of a cancellation of central recordkeeping 
authorizations under this paragraph the registrant shall, within the 
time specified by the Special Agent in Charge, comply with the 
requirements of this section that all records be kept at the registered 
location.
    (c) Registrants need not notify the Special Agent in Charge or 
obtain central recordkeeping approval in order to maintain records on an 
in-house computer system.
    (d) ARCOS participants who desire authorization to report from other 
than their registered locations must obtain a separate central reporting 
identifier. Request for central reporting identifiers will be submitted 
to: ARCOS Unit, P.O. Box 28293, Central Station, Washington, DC 20005.
    (e) All central recordkeeping permits previously issued by the 
Administration will expire on September 30, 1980. Registrants who desire 
to continue maintaining central records will make notification to the 
local Special Agent in Charge as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (f) Each registered manufacturer, distributor, importer, exporter, 
narcotic treatment program and compounder for narcotic treatment program 
shall maintain inventories and records of controlled substances as 
follows:
    (1) Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in 
Schedules I and II shall be maintained separately from all of the 
records of the registrant; and
    (2) Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in 
Schedules III, IV, and V shall be maintained either separately from all 
other records of the registrant or in such form that the information 
required is readily retrievable from the ordinary business records of 
the registrant.
    (g) Each registered individual practitioner required to keep records 
and institutional practitioner shall maintain inventories and records of 
controlled substances in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (h) Each registered pharmacy shall maintain the inventories and 
records of controlled substances as follows:
    (1) Inventories and records of all controlled substances listed in 
Schedules I and II shall be maintained separately from all other records 
of the pharmacy, and prescriptions for such substances shall be 
maintained in a separate prescription file; and
    (2) Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in 
Schedules III, IV, and V shall be maintained either separately from all 
other records of the pharmacy or in such form that the information 
required is readily retrievable from ordinary business records of the 
pharmacy, and prescriptions for such substances shall be maintained 
either in separate prescription file for controlled substances listed in 
Schedules III, IV, and V only or in such form that they are readily 
retrievable from the other prescription records of the pharmacy. 
Prescriptions will be deemed readily retrievable if, at the time they 
are initially filed, the face of the prescription is stamped in red ink 
in the lower right corner with the letter ``C'' no less than 1-inch high 
and filed either in the prescription file for controlled substances 
listed in

[[Page 47]]

Schedules I and II or in the usual consecutively numbered prescription 
file for non-controlled substances.

                         Inventory Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1304.11   General requirements for inventories.

    (a) Each inventory shall contain a complete and accurate record of 
all controlled substances on hand on the date the inventory is taken. 
Controlled substances shall be deemed to be ``on hand'' if they are in 
the possession of or under the control of the registrant, including 
substances returned by a customer, substances ordered by a customer but 
not yet invoiced, substances stored in a warehouse on behalf of the 
registrant, and substances in the possession of employees of the 
registrant and intended for distribution as complimentary samples.
    (b) A separate inventory shall be made by a registrant for each 
registered location. In the event controlled substances in the 
possession or under the control of the registrant at a location for 
which he is not registered, the substances shall be included in the 
inventory of the registered location to which they are subject to 
control or to which the person possessing the substance is responsible. 
Each inventory for a registered location shall be kept at the registered 
location.
    (c) A separate inventory shall be made by a registrant for each 
independent activity for which he is registered, except as provided in 
Sec. 1304.18.
    (d) A registrant may take an inventory on a date that is within 4 
days of his biennial inventory date pursuant to Sec. 1304.13 if he 
notifies in advance the Special Agent in Charge of the Administration in 
his area of the date on which he will take the inventory. A registrant 
may take an inventory either as of the opening of business or as of the 
close of business on the inventory date. The registrant shall indicate 
on the inventory records whether the inventory is taken as of the 
opening or as of the close of business and the date the inventory is 
taken.
    (e) An inventory must be maintained in a written, typewritten or 
printed form. An inventory taken by use of an oral recording device must 
be promptly transcribed.

packaging and distribution as soon as all processing other than mere 
packaging has been completed. Tinctures, extracts, or other products 
manufactured partly for distribution and partly for use in further 
manufacture shall be reported produced as soon as manufacture is 
complete and they are ready either for use in further manufacture or for 
packaging for distribution.
    (i) No accumulations of cocaine or ecgonine or other narcotic 
controlled substances in their pure or near-pure states shall be 
permitted to remain inactively in process. All such products nearing 
completion of their respective processes and approaching a condition of 
purity shall be carefully protected, promptly completed, and immediately 
transferred to finished stocks and reported as produced.
    (j) In making conversions of coca alkaloids and their salts to 
cocaine alkaloid and to anhydrous ecgonine alkaloid, the quantity of the 
particular alkaloid or salt in avoirdupois ounces shall be multiplied by 
a conversion factor arrived at by ascertaining the ratio, carried to the 
fourth decimal place, between the molecular weight of such alkaloid or 
salt and the molecular weight of cocaine alkaloid (303.172) or anhydrous 
ecgonine alkaloid (185.125), as the case may be, such weights being

Sec. 1304.38   Reports from manufacturers importing poppy straw or concentrate of poppy straw.

    (a) Every manufacturer importing poppy straw or concentrate of poppy 
straw shall submit in addition to Form 333, Form DEA 247(c) accounting 
for the importation and for all manufacturing operations performed 
between importation and the production in bulk of finished marketable 
products, standardized in accordance with the U.S. Pharmacopeia, 
National Formulary, or other recognized medical standards. Subsequent 
manufacture from such products, including bottling or packaging 
operations, shall be accounted for in the returns on DEA Form 333 
(Sec. 1304.38) and its supplements. DEA Form 247(c) shall be submitted 
quarterly to the Drug Control Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, 
Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20537, on or before the 15th day 
of the month immediately following the period for which it is submitted.
    (b) The report of manufacture from poppy straw or concentrate of 
poppy straw shall consist of summaries with supporting detail sheets 
accounting for original manufacture from poppy straw to concentrate, and 
from concentrate of poppy straw, production from morphine for further 
manufacture and also accounting for all stocks of poppy

[[Page 62]]

straw, concentrate of poppy straw, morphine for further manufacture and 
other crude alkaloids.
    (c) The detail sheets (DEA 247(c)) supporting the summary of 
manufacture from poppy straw or concentrate of poppy straw shall show 
separately the amount of poppy straw or concentrate imported, the poppy 
straw used for production of concentrate, the concentrate used for 
extraction of alkaloids, subsequent manufacture from those alkaloids and 
the inventory of poppy straw and concentrate of poppy straw at the close 
of the reporting period.
    (d) Upon importation of poppy straw or concentrate of poppy straw, 
samples will be selected and assays made by the importing manufacturer 
in a manner and according to a method previously approved by DEA. Where 
final assay data is not determined at the time of rendering report, the 
report shall be made on the basis of the best data available, subject to 
adjustment, and the necessary adjusting entries shall be made on the 
next report.
    (e) Upon withdrawal of poppy straw or concentrate of poppy straw 
from Customs custody, the importing manufacturer shall assign to each 
lot or container an identification number by which the poppy straw or 
concentrate will be associated with the lot assay and identified in 
reports.
    (f) Where factory procedure is such that partial withdrawals of 
poppy straw or concentrate are made from individual containers, there 
shall be attached to each container a stock record card on which shall 
be kept a complete record of all withdrawals therefrom.
    (g) Concentrate of poppy straw and derivatives produced for 
exclusive use in further manufacturing purposes shall be reported 
produced when they come into existence in that form in which they are to 
be so used. Alkaloids or derivatives produced exclusively for 
distribution shall be reported as produced when manufacture has actually 
been completed and the finished marketable product ready for packaging 
and distribution. Such products shall be regarded as ready for packaging 
and distribution as soon as all processing other than mere packaging has 
been completed. Products manufactured partly for distribution and partly 
for use in further manufacture will be reported produced as soon as 
manufacture is complete and they are ready either for use in further 
manufacture or for packaging for distribution.
    (h) Subject to Sec. 1303.24(c) of this chapter, no accumulations of 
morphine or other narcotic controlled substances in their pure or near-
pure states shall be permitted to remain inactively in process for an 
unreasonable time in light of efficient industrial practices. All such 
products nearing completion of their respective processes and 
approaching a condition of purity shall be carefully protected, promptly 
completed, and immediately transferred to finished stocks, and reported 
as produced.
    (i) In making conversions of concentrate of poppy straw alkaloids 
and their salts to anhydrous morphine the quantity of the particular 
alkaloid or salt in avoirdupois ounces shall be multiplied by a 
conversion factor arrived at by ascertaining the ratio, carried to the 
fourth decimal place, between the respective molecular weight of such 
alkaloid or salt and the molecular weight of anhydrous morphine 
(285.16), such weights being computed to the third decimal place from 
the chemical formulae of the substances and the atomic weights of 
elements, as adopted by the International Committee on Chemical Elements 
and published in the latest edition of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia.

Sec. 1305.10   Procedure for endorsing order forms.

    (a) An order form made out to any supplier who cannot fill all or a 
part of the order within the time limitation set forth in Sec. 1305.09 
may be endorsed to another supplier for filling. The endorsement hall be 
made only by the supplier to whom the order form was first made, shall 
state (in the spaces provided on the reverse sides of Copies 1 and 2 of 
the order form) the name and address of the second supplier, and shall 
be signed by a person authorized to obtain and execute order forms on 
behalf of the first supplier. The first supplier may not fill any part 
of an order on an endorsed form. The second supplier shall fill the 
order, if possible and if he desires to do so, in accordance with 
Sec. 1305.09 (b), (c), and (d), including shipping all substances 
directly to the purchaser.
    (b) Distributions made on endorsed order forms shall be reported by 
the second supplier in the same manner as all other distributions except 
that where the name of the supplier is requested on the reporting form, 
the second supplier shall record the name, address and registration 
number of the first supplier.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.11   Unaccepted and defective order forms.

    (a) No order form shall be filled if it:
    (1) Is not complete, legible, or properly prepared, executed, or 
endorsed; or
    (2) Shows any alteration, erasure, or change of any description.
    (b) If an order form cannot be filled for any reason under this 
section, the supplier shall return Copies 1 and 2 to the purchaser with 
a statement as to the reason (e.g., illegible or altered). A supplier 
may for any reason refuse to accept any order and if a supplier refuses 
to accept the order, a statement that the order is not accepted shall be 
sufficient for purposes of this paragraph.
    (c) When received by the purchaser, Copies 1 and 2 of the order form 
and the statement shall be attached to Copy 3 and retained in the files 
of the purchaser in accordance with Sec. 1305.13. A defective order form 
may not be corrected; it must be replaced by a new order form in order 
for the order to be filled.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.12   Lost and stolen order forms.

    (a) If a purchaser ascertains that an unfilled order form has been 
lost, he shall execute another in triplicate and a statement containing 
the serial number and date of the lost form, and stating that the goods 
covered by the first order form were not received through loss of that 
order form. Copy 3 of the second form and a copy of the statement shall 
be retained with Copy 3 of the order form first executed. A copy of the 
statement shall be attached to Copies 1 and 2 of the second order form 
sent to the supplier. If the first order form is subsequently received 
by the supplier to whom it was directed, the supplier shall mark upon 
the face thereof ``Not accepted'' and return Copies 1 and 2 to the 
purchaser, who shall attach it to Copy 3 and the statement.
    (b) Whenever any used or unused order forms are stolen from or lost 
(otherwise than in the course of transmission) by any purchaser or 
supplier, he shall immediately upon discovery of such theft or loss, 
report the same to the Registration Unit, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Department of Justice, Post Office Box 28083, Central 
Station, Washington, DC 20005, stating the serial number of each form 
stolen or lost. If the theft or loss includes any original order forms 
received from purchasers and the supplier is unable to state the serial 
numbers of such order forms, he shall report the date or approximate 
date of receipt thereof and the names and addresses of the purchasers. 
If an entire book of order

[[Page 68]]

forms is lost or stolen, and the purchaser is unable to state the serial 
numbers of the order forms contained therein, he shall report, in lieu 
of the numbers of the forms contained in such book, the date or 
approximate date of issuance thereof. If any unused order form reported 
stolen or lost is subsequently recovered or found, the Registration 
Branch of the Administration shall immediately be notified.

<R05>
Sec. 1305.13   Preservation of order forms.

been filled. He shall also retain in his files all copies of each 
unaccepted or defective order form and each statement attached thereto.
    (b) The supplier shall retain Copy 1 of each order form which he has 
filled.
    (c) Order forms must be maintained separately from all other records 
of the registrant. Order forms are required to be kept available for 
inspection for a period of 2 years. If a purchaser has several 
registered locations, he must retain Copy 3 of the executed order forms 
and any attached statements or other related documents (not including 
unexecuted order forms which may be kept elsewhere pursuant to 
Sec. 1305.06(e)) at the registered location printed on the order form.
    (d) The supplier of carfentanil etorphine hydrochloride and 
diprenorphine shall maintain order forms for these substances separately 
from all other order forms and records required to be maintained by the 
registrant.

<R05>
Sec. 1305.14   Return of unused order forms.

    If the registration of any purchaser terminates (because the 
purchaser dies, ceases legal existence, discontinues business or 
professional practice, or changes his name or address as shown on his 
registration) or is suspended or revoked pursuant to Secs. 1301.45 or 
1301.46 of this chapter as to all controlled substances listed in 
Schedules I and II for which he is registered, he shall return all 
unused order forms for such substance to the nearest office of the 
Administration.

<R05>
Sec. 1305.15   Cancellation and voiding of order forms.

    (a) A purchaser may cancel part or all of an order on an order form 
by notifying the supplier in writing of such cancellation. The supplier 
shall indicate the cancellation on Copies 1 and 2 of the order form by 
drawing a line through the canceled items and printing ``canceled'' in 
the space provided for number of items shipped.
    (b) A supplier may void part or all of an order on an order form by 
notifying the purchaser in writing of such voiding. The supplier shall 
indicate the voiding in the manner prescribed for cancellation in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) No cancellation or voiding permitted by this section shall 
affect in any way contract rights of either the purchaser or the 
supplier.

<R05>
Sec. 1305.16   Special procedure for filling certain order forms.

    (a) The purchaser of carfentanil etorphine hydrochloride or 
diprenorphine shall submit copy 1 and 2 of the order form to the 
supplier and retain copy 3 in his own files.
    (b) The supplier, if he determines that the purchaser is a 
veterinarian engaged in zoo and exotic animal practice, wildlife 
management programs and/or research and authorized by the Administrator 
to handle these substances shall fill the order in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 1305.09 except that:
    (1) Order forms for carfentanil etorphine hydrochloride and 
diprenorphine shall only contain these substances in reasonable 
quantities and (2) the substances shall only be shipped to the purchaser 
at the location printed by the Administration

                           General Information


<R05>
Sec. 1306.01   Scope of Part 1306.

    Rules governing the issuance, filling and filing of prescriptions 
pursuant to section 309 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 829) are set forth 
generally in that section and specifically by the sections of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1306.02   Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following terms shall have the meanings 
specified:
    (a) The term Act means the Controlled Substances Act (84 Stat. 1242; 
21 U.S.C. 801).
    (b) The term individual practitioner means a physician, dentist, 
veterinarian, or other individual licensed, registered, or otherwise 
permitted, by the United States or the jurisdiction in which he 
practices, to dispense a controlled substance in the course of 
professional practice, but does not include a pharmacist, a pharmacy, or 
an institutional practitioner.
    (c) The term institutional practitioner means a hospital or other 
person (other than an individual) licensed, registered, or otherwise 
permitted, by the United States or the jurisdiction in which it 
practices, to dispense a controlled substance in the course of 
professional practice, but does not include a pharmacy.
    (d) The term pharmacist means any pharmacist licensed by a State to 
dispense controlled substances, and shall include any other person 
(e.g., a pharmacist intern) authorized by a State to dispense controlled 
substances under the supervision of a pharmacist licensed by such State.
    (e) A Long Term Care Facility (LTCF) means a nursing home, 
retirement care, mental care or other facility or institution which 
provides extended health care to resident patients.
    (f) The term prescription means an order for medication which is 
dispensed to or for an ultimate user but does not include an order for 
medication which is dispensed for immediate administration to the 
ultimate used. (e.g., an order to dispense a drug to a bed patient for 
immediate administration in a hospital is not a prescription.)
    (g) The terms register and registered refer to registration required 
and permitted by section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823).
    (h) The term home infusion pharmacy means a pharmacy which compounds 
solutions for direct administration to a patient in a private residence, 
Long Term Care Facility or hospice setting by means of parenteral, 
intravenous,

[[Page 70]]

intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraspinal infusion.
    (i) Any term not defined in this section shall have the definition 
set forth in section 102 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 802) or Sec. 1301.02 of 
this chapter.

(21 U.S.C. 801, et seq.)

<R05>
Sec. 1306.03   Persons entitled to issue prescriptions.

    (a) A prescription for a controlled substance may be issued only by 
an individual practitioner who is:
    (1) authorized to prescribe controlled substances by the 
jurisdiction in which he is licensed to practice his profession and
    (2) either registered or exempted from registration pursuant to 
Secs. 1301.24(c) and 1301.25 of this chapter.
    (b) A prescription issued by an individual practitioner may be 
communicated to a pharmacist by an employee or agent of the individual 
practitioner.

[36 FR 7799, Apr. 24, 1971, as amended at 36 FR 18732, Sept. 21, 1971. 
Redesignated at 38 FR 26609, Sept. 24, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 1306.04   Purpose of issue of prescription.

    (a) A prescription for a controlled substance to be effective must 
be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner 
acting in the usual course of his professional practice. The 
responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled 
substances is upon the prescribing practitioner, but a corresponding 
responsibility rests with the pharmacist who fills the prescription. An 
order purporting to be a prescription issued not in the usual course of 
professional treatment or in legitimate and authorized research is not a 
prescription within the meaning and intent of section 309 of the Act (21 
U.S.C. 829) and the person knowingly filling such a purported 
prescription, as well as the person issuing it, shall be subject to the 
penalties provided for violations of the provisions of law relating to 
controlled substances.
    (b) A prescription may not be issued in order for an individual 
practitioner to obtain controlled substances for supplying the 
individual practitioner for the purpose of general dispensing to 
patients.
    (c) A prescription may not be issued for the dispensing of narcotic 
drugs listed in any schedule for ``detoxification treatment'' or 
``maintenance treatment'' as defined in Section 102 of the Act (21 
U.S.C. 802).

[36 FR 7799, Apr. 24, 1971. Redesignated at 38 FR 26609, Sept. 24, 1973, 
and amended at 39 FR 37986, Oct. 25, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 1306.05   Manner of issuance of prescriptions.

    (a) All prescriptions for controlled substances shall be dated as 
of, and signed on, the day when issued and shall bear the full name and 
address of the patient, the drug name, strength, dosage form, quantity 
prescribed, directions for use and the name, address and registration 
number of the practitioner. A practitioner may sign a prescription in 
the same manner as he would sign a check or legal document (e.g., J.H. 
Smith or John H. Smith). Where an oral order is not permitted, 
prescriptions shall be written with ink or indelible pencil or 
typewriter and shall be manually signed by the practitioner. The 
prescriptions may be prepared by the secretary or agent for the 
signature of a practitioner, but the prescribing practitioner is 
responsible in case the prescription does not conform in all essential 
respects to the law and regulations. A corresponding liability rests 
upon the pharmacist who fills a prescription not prepared in the form 
prescribed by these regulations.
    (b) An individual practitioner exempted from registration under 
Sec. 1301.24(c) of this chapter shall include on all prescriptions 
issued by him or her the registration number of the hospital or other 
institution and the special internal code number assigned to him or her 
by the hospital or other institution as provided in Sec. 1301.24(c) of 
this chapter, in lieu of the registration number of the practitioner 
required by this section. Each written prescription shall have the name 
of the physician stamped, typed, or handprinted on it,

[[Page 71]]

as well as the signature of the physician.
    (c) An official exempted from registration under Sec. 1301.25 shall 
include on all prescriptions issued by him his branch of service or 
agency (e.g., ``U.S. Army'' or ``Public Health Service'') and his 
service identification number, in lieu of the registration number of the 
practitioner required by this section. The service identification number 
for a Public Health Service employee is his Social Security 
identification number. Each prescription shall have the name of the 
officer stamped, typed, or handprinted on it, as well as the signature 
of the officer.

<R05>
Sec. 1306.06   Persons entitled to fill prescriptions.

    A prescription for controlled substances may only be filled by a 
pharmacist acting in the usual course of his professional practice and 
either registered individually or employed in a registered pharmacy or 
registered institutional practitioner.


<R05>
Sec. 1306.07   Administering or dispensing of narcotic drugs.

    (a) The administering or dispensing directly (but not prescribing) 
of narcotic drugs listed in any schedule to a narcotic drug dependent 
person for ``detoxification treatment'' or ``maintenance treatment'' as 
defined in section 102 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 802) shall be deemed to be 
within the meaning of the term ``in the course of his professional 
practice or research'' in section 308(e) and section 102(20) of the Act 
(21 U.S.C. 828 (e)): Provided, That the practitioner is separately 
registered with the Attorney General as required by section 303(g) of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 823(g)) and then thereafter complies with the 
regulatory standards imposed relative to treatment qualification, 
security, records and unsupervised use of drugs pursuant to such Act.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a physician who is not 
specifically registered to conduct a narcotic treatment program from 
administering (but not prescribing) narcotic drugs to a person for the 
purpose of relieving acute withdrawal symptoms when necessary while 
arrangements are being made for referral for treatment. Not more than 
one day's medication may be administered to the person or for the 
person's use at one time. Such emergency treatment may be carried out 
for not more than three days and may not be renewed or extended.
    (c) This section is not intended to impose any limitations on a 
physician or authorized hospital staff to administer or dispense 
narcotic drugs in a hospital to maintain or detoxify a person as an 
incidental adjunct to medical or surgical treatment of conditions other 
than addiction, or to administer or dispense narcotic drugs to persons 
with intractable pain in which no relief or cure is possible or none has 
been found after reasonable efforts.

[39 FR 37986, Oct. 25, 1974]

               Controlled Substances Listed in Schedule II


<R05>
Sec. 1306.11   Requirement of prescription.

    (a) A pharmacist may dispense directly a controlled substance in 
Schedule II, which is a prescription drug as determined by the Federal 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, only pursuant to a written prescription 
signed by the practitioner, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section. A prescription for a Schedule II controlled substance may be 
transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agency to a 
pharmacy via facsimile equipment, provided the original written, signed 
prescription is presented to the pharmacist for review prior to the 
actual dispensing of the controlled substance, except as noted in 
paragraph (e) or (f) of this section. The original prescription shall be 
maintained in accordance with Sec. 1304.04(h).
    (b) An individual practitioner may administer or dispense directly a 
controlled substance listed in Schedule II in the course of his 
professional practice without a prescription, subject to Sec. 1306.07.
    (c) An institutional practitioner may administer or dispense 
directly (but not prescribe) a controlled substance listed in Schedule 
II only pursuant to a

[[Page 72]]

written prescription signed by the prescribing individual practitioner 
or to an order for medication made by an individual practitioner which 
is dispensed for immediate administration to the ultimate user.
    (d) In the case of an emergency situation, as defined by the 
Secretary in Sec. 290.10 of this title, a pharmacist may dispense a 
controlled substance listed in Schedule II upon receiving oral 
authorization of a prescribing individual practitioner, provided that:
    (1) The quantity prescribed and dispensed is limited to the amount 
adequate to treat the patient during the emergency period (dispensing 
beyond the emergency period must be pursuant to a written prescription 
signed by the prescribing individual practitioner);
    (2) The prescription shall be immediately reduced to writing by the 
pharmacist and shall contain all information required in Sec. 1306.05, 
except for the signature of the prescribing individual practitioner;
    (3) If the prescribing individual practitioner is not known to the 
pharmacist, he must make a reasonable effort to determine that the oral 
authorization came from a registered individual practitioner, which may 
include a callback to the prescribing individual practitioner using his 
phone number as listed in the telephone directory and/or other good 
faith efforts to insure his identity; and
    (4) Within 72 hours after authorizing an emergency oral 
prescription, the prescribing individual practitioner shall cause a 
written prescription for the emergency quantity prescribed to be 
delivered to the dispensing pharmacist. In addition to conforming to the 
requirements of Sec. 1306.05, the prescription shall have written on its 
face ``Authorization for Emergency Dispensing,'' and the date of the 
oral order. The written prescription may be delivered to the pharmacist 
in person or by mail, but if delivered by mail it must be postmarked 
within the 72-hour period. Upon receipt, the dispensing pharmacist shall 
attach this prescription to the oral emergency prercription which had 
earlier been reduced to writing. The pharmacist shall notify the nearest 
office of the Administration if the prescribing individual practitioner 
fails to deliver a written prescription to him; failure of the 
pharmacist to do so shall void the authority conferred by this paragraph 
to dispense without a written prescription of a prescribing individual 
practitioner.
    (e) A prescription prepared in accordance with Sec. 1306.05 written 
for a Schedule II narcotic substance to be compounded for the direct 
administration to a patient by parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, 
subcutaneous or intraspinal infusion may be transmitted by the 
practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the home infusion pharmacy 
by facsimile. The facsimile serves as the original written prescription 
for purposes of this paragraph (e) and it shall be maintained in 
accordance with Sec. 1304.04(h).
    (f) A prescription prepared in accordance with Sec. 1306.05 written 
for Schedule II substance for a resident of a Long Term Care Facility 
may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to 
the dispensing pharmacy by facsimile. The facsimile serves as the 
original written prescription for purposes of this paragraph (f) and it 
shall be maintained in accordance with Sec. 1304.04(h).

<R05>
Sec. 1306.12   Refilling prescriptions.

    The refilling of a prescription for a controlled substance listed in 
Schedule II is prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 1306.13   Partial filling of prescriptions.

    (a) The partial filling of a prescription for a controlled substance 
listed in Schedule II is permissible, if the pharmacist is unable to 
supply the full quantity called for in a written or emergency oral 
prescription and he makes a notation of the quantity supplied on the 
face of the written prescription (or written record of the emergency 
oral prescription). The remaining portion of the prescription may be 
filled within 72 hours of the first partial filling; however, if the 
remaining portion is not or cannot be filled within the 72-hour period, 
the

[[Page 73]]

pharmacist shall so notify the prescribing individual practitioner. No 
further quantity may be supplied beyond 72 hours without a new 
prescription.
    (b) A prescription for a Schedule II controlled substance written 
for a patient in a Long Term Care Facility (LTCF) or for a patient with 
a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness may be filled in 
partial quantities to include individual dosage units. If there is any 
question whether a patient may be classified as having a terminal 
illness, the pharmacist must contract the practitioner prior to 
partially filling the prescription. Both the pharmacist and the 
prescribing practitioner have a corresponding responsibility to assure 
that the controlled substance is for a terminally ill patient. The 
pharmacist must record on the prescription whether the patient is 
``terminally ill'' or an ``LTCF patient.'' A prescription that is 
partially filled and does not contain the notation ``terminally ill'' or 
``LTCF patient'' shall be deemed to have been filled in violation of the 
Act. For each partial filling, the dispensing pharmacist shall record on 
the back of the prescription (or on another appropriate record, 
uniformly maintained, and readily retrievable) the date of the partial 
filling, quantity dispensed, remaining quantity authorized to be 
dispensed, and the identification of the dispensing pharmacist. Prior to 
any subsequent partial filling the pharmacist is to determine that the 
additional partial filling is necessary. The total quantity of Schedule 
II controlled substances dispensed in all partial fillings must not 
exceed the total quantity prescribed. Schedule II prescriptions for 
patients in a LTCF or patients with a medical diagnosis documenting a 
terminal illness shall be valid for a period not to exceed 60 days from 
the issue date unless sooner terminated by the discontinuance of 
medication.

<R05>
Sec. 1306.21   Requirement of prescription.

    (a) A pharmacist may dispense directly a controlled substance listed 
in Schedule III or IV, which is a prescription drug as determined under 
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, only pursuant to either a 
written prescription signed by a practitioner or a facsimile of a

<R05>
Sec. 1306.22   Refilling of prescriptions.

    (a) No prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule 
III or IV shall be filled or refilled more than six months after the 
date on which such prescription was issued and no such prescription 
authorized to be refilled may be refilled more than five times. Each 
refilling of a prescription shall be entered on the back of the 
prescription or on another appropriate document. If entered on another 
document, such as a medication record, the document must be uniformly 
maintained and readily retrievable. The following information must be 
retrievable by the prescription number consisting of the name and dosage 
form of the controlled substance, the date filled or refilled, the 
quantity dispensed, initials of the dispensing pharmacist for each 
refill, and the total number of refills for that prescription. If the 
pharmacist merely initials and dates the back of the prescription it 
shall be deemed that the full face amount of the prescription has been 
dispensed. The prescribing practitioner may authorize additional refills 
of Schedule III or IV controlled substances on the original prescription 
through an oral refill authorization transmitted to the pharmacist 
provided the following conditions are met:
    (1) The total quantity authorized, including the amount of the 
original prescription, does not exceed five refills nor extend beyond 
six months from the date of issue of the original prescription.
    (2) The pharmacist obtaining the oral authorization records on the 
reverse of the original prescription the date, quantity of refill, 
number of additional refills authorized, and initials the prescription 
showing who received the authorization from the prescribing

[[Page 75]]

practioner who issued the original prescription.
    (3) The quantity of each additional refill authorized is equal to or 
less than the quantity authorized for the initial filling of the 
original prescription.
    (4) The prescribing practitioner must execute a new and separate 
prescription for any additional quantities beyond the five refill, six-
month limitation.
    (b) As an alternative to the procedures provided by subsection (a), 
an automated data processing system may be used for the storage and 
retrival of refill information for prescription orders for controlled 
substances in Schedule III and IV, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Any such proposed computerized system must provide on-line 
retrieval (via CRT display or hard-copy printout) of original 
prescription order information for those prescription orders which are 
currently authorized for refilling. This shall include, but is not 
limited to, data such as the original prescription number, date of 
issuance of the original prescription order by the practitioner, full 
name and address of the patient, name, address, and DEA registration 
number of the practitioner, and the name, strength, dosage form, 
quantity of the controlled substance prescribed (and quantity dispensed 
if different from the quantity prescribed), and the total number of 
refills authorized by the prescribing practitioner.
    (2) Any such proposed computerized system must also provide on-line 
retrieval (via CRT display or hard-copy printout) of the current refill 
history for Schedule III or IV controlled substance prescription orders 
(those authorized for refill duing the past six months.) This refill 
history shall include, but is not limited to, the name of the controlled 
substance, the date of refill, the quantity dispensed, the 
identification code, or name or initials of the dispensing pharmacist 
for each refill and the total number of refills dispensed to date for 
that prescription order.
    (3) Documentation of the fact that the refill information entered 
into the computer each time a pharmacist refills an original 
prescription order for a Schedule III or IV controlled substance is 
correct must be provided by the individual pharmacist who makes use of 
such a system. If such a system provides a hard-copy printout of each 
day's controlled substance prescription order refill data, that printout 
shall be verified, dated, and signed by the individual pharmacist who 
refilled such a prescription order. The individual pharmacist must 
verify that the data indicated is correct and then sign this document in 
the same manner as he would sign a check or legal document (e.g., J. H. 
Smith, or John H. Smith). This document shall be maintained in a 
separate file at that pharmacy for a period of two years from the 
dispensing date. This printout of the day's controlled substance 
prescription order refill data must be provided to each pharmacy using 
such a computerized system within 72 hours of the date on which the 
refill was dispensed. It must be verified and signed by each pharmacist 
who is involved with such dispensing. In lieu of such a printout, the 
pharmacy shall maintain a bound log book, or separate file, in which 
each individual pharmacist involved in such dispensing shall sign a 
statement (in the manner previously described) each day, attesting to 
the fact that the refill information entered into the computer that day 
has been reviewed by him and is correct as shown. Such a book or file 
must be maintained at the pharmacy employing such a system for a period 
of two years after the date of dispensing the appropriately authorized 
refill.
    (4) Any such computerized system shall have the capability of 
producing a printout of any refill data which the user pharmacy is 
responsible for maintaining under the Act and its implementing 
regulations. For example, this would include a refill-by-refill audit 
trail for any specified strength and dosage form of any controlled 
substance (by either brand or generic name or both). Such a printout 
must include name of the prescribing practitioner, name and address of 
the patient, quantity dispensed on each refill, date of dispensing for 
each refill, name or identification code of the dispensing pharmacist, 
and the number of the original prescription order. In any computerized 
system employed by a

[[Page 76]]

user pharmacy the central recordkeeping location must be capable of 
sending the printout to the pharmacy within 48 hours, and if a DEA 
Special Agent or Compliance Investigator requests a copy of such 
printout from the user pharmacy, it must, if requested to do so by the 
Agent or Investigator, verify the printout transmittal capability of its 
system by documentation (e.g., postmark).
    (5) In the event that a pharmacy which employs such a computerized 
system experiences system down-time, the pharmacy must have an auxiliary 
procedure which will be used for documentation of refills os Schedule 
III and IV controlled substance prescription orders. This auxiliary 
procedure must insure that refills are authorized by the original 
prescription order, that the maximum number of refills has not been 
exceeded, and that all of the appropriate data is retained for on-line 
data entry as soon as the computer system is available for use again.
    (c) When filing refill information for original prescription orders 
for Schedule III or IV controlled substances, a pharmacy may use only 
one of the two systems described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this 
section.

Responsibility for the accuracy of records prior to the date of transfer 
remains with the transferor, but responsibility for custody and 
maintenance shall be upon the transferee.
    (3) In the case of registrants required to make reports pursuant to 
part 1304 of this chapter, a report marked ``Final'' will be prepared 
and submitted by the registrant-transferor showing the disposition of 
all the controlled substances for which a report is required; no 
additional report will be required from him, if no further transactions 
involving controlled substances are consummated by him. The initial 
report of the registrant-transferee shall account for transactions 
beginning with the day next succeeding the date of discontinuance or 
transfer of

                      Exempt Chemical Preparations


<R05>
Sec. 1308.23   Exemption of certain chemical preparations; application.

    (a) The Administrator may, by regulation, exempt from the 
application of all or any part of the Act any chemical preparation or 
mixture containing one or more controlled substances listed in any 
schedule, which preparation or mixture is intended for laboratory, 
industrial, educational, or special research purposes and not for 
general administration to a human being or other animal, if the 
preparation or mixture either:
    (1) Contains no narcotic controlled substance and is packaged in 
such a form or concentration that the packaged quantity does not present 
any significant potential for abuse (the type of packaging and the 
history of abuse of the same or similar preparations may be considered 
in determining the potential for abuse of the preparation or mixture); 
or
    (2) Contains either a narcotic or nonnarcotic controlled substance 
and one or more adulterating or denaturing agents in such a manner, 
combination, quantity, proportion, or concentration, that the 
preparation or mixture does not present any potential for abuse. If the 
preparation or mixture contains a narcotic controlled substance, the 
preparation or mixture must be formulated in such a manner that it 
incorporates methods of denaturing or other means so that the 
preparation or mixture is not liable to be abused or have ill effects, 
if abused, and so that the narcotic substance cannot in practice be 
removed.
    (b) Any person seeking to have any preparation or mixture containing 
a controlled substance and one or more noncontrolled substances exempted 
from the application of all or any part of the Act, pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, may apply to the Administrator, Drug 
Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20537.
    (c) An application for an exemption under this section shall contain 
the following information:
    (1) The name, address, and registration number, if any, of the 
applicant;
    (2) The name, address, and registration number, if any, of the 
manufacturer or importer of the preparation or mixture, if not the 
applicant;

[[Page 93]]

    (3) The exact trade name or other designation of the preparation or 
mixture;
    (4) The complete qualitative and quantitative composition of the 
preparation or mixture (including all active and inactive ingredients 
and all controlled and noncontrolled substances);
    (5) The form of the immediate container in which the preparation or 
mixture will be distributed with sufficient descriptive detail to 
identify the preparation or mixture (e.g., bottle, packet, vial, soft 
plastic pillow, agar gel plate, etc.);
    (6) The dimensions or capacity of the immediate container of the 
preparation or mixture;
    (7) The label and labeling, as defined in Sec. 1302.01 of this 
chapter, of the immediate container and the commercial containers, if 
any, of the preparation or mixture;
    (8) A brief statement of the facts which the applicant believes 
justify the granting of an exemption under this paragraph, including 
information on the use to which the preparation or mixture will be put;
    (9) The date of the application; and
    (10) Which of the information submitted on the application, if any, 
is deemed by the applicant to be a trade secret or otherwise 
confidential and entitled to protection under subsection 402(a)(8) of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 842(a) (8)) or any other law restricting public 
disclosure of information.
    (d) The Administrator may require the applicant to submit such 
documents or written statements of fact relevant to the application as 
he deems necessary to determine whether the application should be 
granted.
    (e) Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of an 
application for an exemption under this section, the Administrator shall 
notify the applicant of his acceptance or nonacceptance of his 
application, and if not accepted, the reason therefor. The Administrator 
need not accept an application for filing if any of the requirements 
prescribed in paragraph (c) or requested pursuant to paragraph (d) is 
lacking or is not set forth as to be readily understood. If the 
applicant desires, he may amend the application to meet the requirements 
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. If the application is 
accepted for filing, the Administrator shall issue and publish in the 
Federal Register his order on the application, which shall include a 
reference to the legal authority under which the order is based. This 
order shall specify the date on which it shall take effect. The 
Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written 
comments on or objections to the order within 60 days of the date of 
publication of his order in the Federal Register. If any such comments 
or objections raise significant issues regarding any finding of fact or 
conclusion of law upon which the order is based, the Administrator shall 
immediately suspend the effectiveness of the order until he may 
reconsider the application in light of the comments and objections 
filed. Thereafter, the Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, or amend 
his original order as he determines appropriate.
    (f) The Administrator may at any time revoje or modify any exemption 
granted pursuant to this section by following the procedures set forth 
in paragraph (e) of this section for handling an application for an 
exemption which has been accepted for filing. The Administrator may also 
modify or revoke the criteria by which exemptions are granted (and 
thereby modify or revoke all preparations and mixtures granted under the 
old criteria) and modify the scope of exemptions at any time.

Sec. 1308.24   Exempt chemical preparations.

    (a) The chemical preparations and mixtures set forth in paragraph 
(i) of this section have been exempted by the Administrator from 
application of sections 302, 303, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 1002, 1003 
and 1004 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 822-3, 825-9, 952-4) and Sec. 1301.74 of 
this chapter, to the extent described in paragraphs (b) to (h) of this 
section. Substances set forth in paragraph (j) shall be exempt from the 
application of sections 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 1002, 1003 and 1004 of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 825-9, 952-4) and Secs. 1301.71-1301.73 and 
1301.74(a), (b),

[[Page 94]]

(d), (e) and (f) of this chapter to the extent as hereinafter may be 
provided.
    (b) Registration and security: Any person who manufactures an exempt 
chemical preparation or mixture must be registered under the Act and 
comply with all relevant security requirements regarding controlled 
substances being used in the manufacturing process until the preparation 
or mixture is in the form described in paragraph (i) of this section. 
Any other person who handles an exempt chemical preparation after it is 
in the form described in paragraph (i) of this section is not required 
to be registered under the Act to handle that preparation, and the 
preparation is not required to be stored in accordance with security 
requirements regarding controlled substances.
    (c) Labeling: In lieu of the requirements set forth in part 1302 of 
this chapter, the label and the labeling of an exempt chemical 
preparation must be prominently marked with its full trade name or other 
description and the name of the manufacturer or supplier as set forth in 
paragraph (i) of this section, in such a way that the product can be 
readily identified as an exempt chemical preparation. The label and 
labeling must also include in a prominent manner the statement ``For 
industrial use only'' or ``For chemical use only'' or ``For in vitro use 
only--not for human or animal use'' or ``Diagnostic reagent--for 
professional use only'' or a comparable statement warning the person 
reading it that human or animal use is not intended. The symbol 
designating the schedule of the controlled substance is not required on 
either the label or the labeling of the exempt chemical preparation, nor 
is it necessary to list all ingredients of the preparation.
    (d) Records and reports: Any person who manufactures an exempt 
chemical preparation or mixture must keep complete and accurate records 
and file all reports required under part 1304 of this chapter regarding 
all controlled substances being used in the manufacturing process until 
the preparation or mixture is in the form described in paragraph (i) of 
this section. In lieu of records and reports required under part 1304 of 
this chapter regarding exempt chemical preparations, the manufacturer 
need only record the name, address, and registration number, if any, of 
each person to whom the manufacturer distributes any exempt chemical 
preparation. Each importer or exporter of an exempt narcotic chemical 
preparation must submit a semiannual report of the total quantity of 
each substance imported or exported in each calendar half-year within 30 
days of the close of the period to the Drug Control Section, Drug 
Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20537. 
Any other person who handles an exempt chemical preparation after it is 
in the form described in paragraph (i) of this section is not required 
to maintain records or file reports.
    (e) Quotas, order forms, prescriptions, import, export, and 
transshipment requirements: Once an exempt chemical preparation is in 
the form described in paragraph (i) of this section, the requirements 
regarding quotas, order forms, prescriptions, import permits and 
declarations, export permit and declarations, and transshipment and 
intransit permits and declarations do not apply. These requirements do 
apply, however, to any controlled substances used in manufacturing the 
exempt chemical preparation before it is in the form described in 
paragraph (i) of this section.
    (f) Criminal penalties: No exemption granted pursuant to 
Sec. 1308.23 affects the criminal liability for illegal manufacture, 
distribution, or possession of controlled substances contained in the 
exempt chemical preparation. Distribution, possession, and use of an 
exempt chemical preparation are lawful for registrants and 
nonregistrants only as long as such distribution, possession, or use is 
intended for laboratory, industrial, or educational purposes and not for 
immediate or subsequent administration to a human being or other animal.
    (g) Bulk materials: For materials exempted in bulk quantities, the 
Administrator may prescribe requirements other than those set forth in 
paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section on a case-by-case basis.
    (h) Changes in chemical preparations: Any change in the quantitative 
or

[[Page 95]]

qualitative composition of the preparation or mixture after the date of 
application, or change in the trade name or other designation of the 
preparation or mixture, set forth in paragraph (i) of this section, 
requires a new application for exemption.
    (i) The following preparations and mixtures, in the form and 
quantity listed in the application submitted (indicated as the ``date of 
application'') are designated as exempt chemical preparations for the 
purposes set forth in this section:

[[Page 176]]

    (b) An application for an exemption under this section shall contain 
the following information:
    (1) The complete quantitative composition of the dosage form.
    (2) Description of the unit dosage form together with complete 
labeling.
    (3) A summary of the pharmacology of the product including animal

    (4) Details of synergisms and antagonisms among ingredients.
    (5) Deterrent effects of the noncontrolled ingredients.
    (6) Complete copies of all literature in support of claims.

notify the applicant of his acceptance or non-acceptance of the 
application, and if not accepted, the reason therefor. The Administrator 
need not accept an application for filing if any of the requirements 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section is lacking or is not set 
forth so as to be readily understood. If the applicant desires, he may 
amend the application to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section. If accepted for filing, the Administrator shall publish in the 
Federal Register general notice of this proposed rulemaking in granting 
or denying the application. Such notice shall include a reference to the

of the Administrator, a summary of the subjects and issues involved. The 
Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written 
comments on or objections to the proposal and shall designate in the 
notice of proposed rule making the time during which such filings may be 
made. After consideration of the application and any comments on or 
objections to his proposed rulemaking, the Administrator shall issue and 
publish in the Federal Register his final order on the application, 
which shall set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon 
which the order is based. This order shall specify the date on which it 
shall take effect, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of 
publication in the Federal Register unless the Administrator finds that 
conditions of public health or safety necessitate an earlier effective 
date, in which event the Administrator shall specify in the order his 
findings as to such conditions.
    (d) The Administrator may revoke any exemption granted pursuant to 
section 201(g)(3)(A) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(g)(3)(A)) by following

                    Exempt Anabolic Steroid Products


<R05>
Sec. 1308.33  Exemption of certain anabolic steroid products; application.

    (a) The Administrator, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, may, by regulation, exempt from the 
application of all or any part of the Act any compound, mixture, or 
preparation containing an anabolic steroid as defined in Sec. 1308.02 
if, because of its concentration, preparation, mixture or delivery 
system, it has no significant potential for abuse (Pub. L. 101-647 
section 1903(a)).
    (b) Any person seeking to have any compound, mixture, or preparation 
containing an anabolic steroid as defined in Sec. 1308.02 exempted from 
the application of all or any part of the Act, pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, may apply to the Administrator, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20537.
    (c) An application for an exemption under this section shall be 
submitted in triplicate and contain the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the applicant;
    (2) The name of the product;
    (3) The chemical structural formula or description for any anabolic 
steroid contained in the product;
    (4) The complete description of dosage and quantitative composition 
of the dosage form;
    (5) A description of the delivery system, if applicable;
    (6) The indications and conditions for use in which species, 
including whether or not this product is a prescription drug;
    (7) Information to facilitate identification of the dosage form, 
such as shape, color, coating, and scoring;
    (8) The label and labeling of the immediate container and the 
commercial containers, if any, of the product;
    (9) The units in which the dosage form is ordinarily available; and
    (10) The facts which the applicant believes justify:
    (i) A determination that the product has no significant potential 
for abuse and
    (ii) a granting of an exemption under this section.
    (d) Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of the 
application for an exemption under this section, the Administrator shall 
notify the applicant of his acceptance or nonacceptance of the 
application, and if not accepted, the reason therefor. The Administrator 
need not accept an application for filing if any of the requirements 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section is lacking or is not set 
forth so as to be readily understood. The applicant may amend the 
application to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. 
If accepted for filing, the Administrator will request from the 
Secretary for Health and Human Services his recommendation, as to 
whether such product which contains an anabolic steroid should be 
considered for exemption from certain portions of the Controlled 
Substances Act. On receipt of the recommendation of the Secretary, the 
Administrator shall make a determination as to whether the evidence 
submitted or otherwise available sufficiently establishes that the 
product possesses no significant potential for abuse. The Administrator 
shall issue and publish in the Federal Register his order on the 
application, which shall include a reference to the legal authority 
under which the order is issued, and the findings of fact and 
conclusions of law upon which the order is based. This order shall 
specify

[[Page 182]]

the date on which it will take effect. The Administrator shall permit 
any interested person to file written comments on or objections to the 
order within 60 days of the date of publication of his order in the 
Federal Register. If any such comments or objections raise significant 
issues regarding any finding of fact or conclusion of law upon which the 
order is based, the Administrator shall immediately suspend the 
effectiveness of the order until he may reconsider the application in 
light of the comments and objections filed. Thereafter, the 
Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, or amend his original order as he 
determines appropriate.
    (e) The Administrator may revoke any exemption granted pursuant to 
section 1903(a) of Public Law 101-647 by following the procedures set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section for handling an application for 
an exemption which has been accepted for filing.

                                Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 1308.41   Hearings generally.

    In any case where the Administrator shall hold a hearing on the 
issuance, amendment, or repeal of rules pursuant to section 201 of the 
Act, the procedures for such hearing and accompanying proceedings shall 
be governed generally by the rulemaking procedures set forth in the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551-559) and specifically by 
section 201 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811), by Secs. 1308.42-1308.51, and by 
Secs. 1316.41-1316.67 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.42   Purpose of hearing.

    If requested by any interested person after proceedings are 
initiated pursuant to Sec. 1308.44, the Administrator shall hold a 
hearing for the purpose of receiving factual evidence and expert opinion 
regarding the issues involved in the issuance, amendment or repeal of a 
rule issuable pursuant to section 201(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(a)). 
Extensive argument should not be offered into evidence but rather 
presented in opening or closing statements of counsel or in memoranda or 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.43   Waiver or modification of Rules.

    The Administrator or the presiding officer (with respect to matters 
pending before him) may modify or waive any rule in this part by notice 
in advance of the hearing, if he determines that no party in the hearing 
will be unduly prejudiced and the ends of justice will thereby be 
served. Such notice of modification or waiver shall be made a part of 
the record of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.44   Initiation of proceedings for rulemaking.

    (a) Any interested person may submit a petition to initiate 
proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any rule or 
regulation issuable pursuant to the provisions of section 201 of the

Administrator in the following form:

_______________________________________________________________________
(Date)
Administrator, Drug Enforcement
    Administration
Department of Justice,
Washington, DC 20537.


[[Page 184]]


    Dear Sir: The undersigned --------------- hereby petitions the 
Administrator to initiate proceedings for the issuance (amendment or 
repeal) of a rule or regulation pursuant to section 201 of the 
Controlled Substances Act.
    Attached hereto and constituting a part of this petition are the 
following:
    (A) The proposed rule in the form proposed by the petitioner. (If 
the petitioner seeks the amendment or repeal of an existing rule, the 
existing rule, together with a reference to the section in the Code of 
Federal Regulations where it appears, should be included.)
    (B) A statement of the grounds which the petitioner relies for the 
issuance (amendment or repeal) of the rule. (Such grounds shall include 
a reasonably concise statement of the facts relied upon by the 
petitioner, including a summary of any relevant medical or scientific 
evidence known to the petitioner.)
    All notices to be sent regarding this petition should be addressed 
to:

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 (Name)

_______________________________________________________________________

                            (Street Address)

_______________________________________________________________________

                            (City and State)

    Respectfully yours,

_______________________________________________________________________

                        (Signature of petitioner)

    (c) Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of a 
petition, the Administrator shall notify the petitioner of his 
acceptance or nonacceptance of the petition, and if not accepted, the 
reason therefor. The Administrator need not accept a petition for filing 
if any of the requirements prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section 
is lacking or is not set forth so as to be readily understood. If the 
petitioner desires, he may amend the petition to meet the requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section. If accepted for filing, a petition may 
be denied by the Administrator within a reasonable period of time 
thereafter if he finds the grounds upon which the petitioner relies are 
not sufficient to justify the initiation of proceedings.
    (d) The Administrator shall, before initiating proceedings for the 
issuance, amendment, or repeal of any rule either to control a drug or 
other substance, or to transfer a drug or other substance from one 
schedule to another, or to remove a drug or other substance entirely 
from the schedules, and after gathering the necessary data, request from 
the Secretary a scientific and medical evaluation and the Secretary's 
recommendations as to whether such drug or other substance should be so 
controlled, transferred, or removed as a controlled substance. The 
recommendations of the Secretary to the Administrator shall be binding 
on the Administrator as to such scientific and medical matters, and if 
the Secretary recommends that a drug or other substance not be 
controlled, the Administrator shall not control that drug or other 
substance.
    (e) If the Administrator determines that the scientific and medical 
evaluation and recommendations of the Secretary and all other relevant 
data constitute substantial evidence of potential for abuse such as to 
warrant control or additional control over the drug or other substance, 
or substantial evidence that the drug or other substances should be 
subjected to lesser control or removed entirely from the schedules, he 
shall initiate proceedings for control, transfer, or removal as the case 
may be.
    (f) If and when the Administrator determines to initiate 
proceedings, he shall publish in the Federal Register general notice of 
any proposed rule making to issue, amend, or repeal any rule pursuant to 
section 201 of the Act. Such published notice shall include a statement 
of the time, place, and nature of any hearings on the proposal in the 
event a hearing is requested pursuant to Sec. 1308.45. Such hearings may 
not be commenced until after the expiration of at least 30 days from the 
date the general notice is published in the Federal Register. Such 
published notice shall also include a reference to the legal authority 
under which the rule is proposed, a statement of the proposed rule, and, 
in the discretion of the Administrator, a summary of the subjects and 
issues involved.
    (g) The Administrator may permit any interested persons to file 
written comments on or objections to the proposal and shall designate in 
the notice of proposed rule making the time during which such filings 
may be made.

<R05>
Sec. 1308.45   Request for hearing or appearance; waiver.

    (a) Any interested person desiring a hearing on a proposed 
rulemaking, shall, within 30 days after the date of publication of 
notice of the proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, file with the 
Administrator a written request for a hearing in the form prescribed in 
Sec. 1316.47 of this chapter.
    (b) Any interested person desiring to participate in a hearing 
pursuant to Sec. 1308.41 shall, within 30 days after the date of 
publication of the notice of hearing in the Federal Register, file with 
the Administrator a written notice of his intention to participate in 
such hearing in the form prescribed in Sec. 1316.48 of this chapter. Any 
person filing a request for a hearing need not also file a notice of 
appearance; the request for a hearing shall be deemed to be a notice of 
appearance.
    (c) Any interested person may, within the period permitted for 
filing a request for a hearing, file with the Administrator a waiver of 
an opportunity for a hearing or to participate in a hearing, together 
with a written statement regarding his position on the matters of fact 
and law involved in such hearing. Such statement, if admissible, shall 
be made a part of the record and shall be considered in light of the 
lack of opportunity for cross-examination in determining the weight to 
be attached to matters of fact asserted therein.
    (d) If any interested person fails to file a request for a hearing; 
or if he so files and fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed 
to have waived his opportunity for the hearing or to participate in the 
hearing, unless he shows good cause for such failure.
    (e) If all interested persons waive or are deemed to waive their 
opportunity for the hearing or to participate in the hearing, the 
Administrator may cancel the hearing, if scheduled, and issue his final 
order pursuant to Sec. 1308.48 without a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.46   Burden of proof.

    At any hearing, the proponent for the issuance, amendment, or repeal 
of any rule or regulation shall have the burden of proof.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.47   Time and place of hearing.

    The hearing will commence at the place and time designated in the 
notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register but 
thereafter it may be moved to a different place and may be continued 
from day to day or recessed to a later day without notice other than 
announcement thereof by the presiding officer at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.48   Final order.

    As soon as practicable after the presiding officer has certified the 
record to the Administrator, the Administrator shall cause to be 
published in the Federal Register his order in the proceeding, which 
shall set forth the final rule and the findings of fact and conclusions 
of law upon which the rule is based. This order shall specify the date 
on which it shall take effect, which shall not be less than 30 days from 
the date of publication in the Federal Register unless the Administrator

effective date, in which event the Administrator shall specify in the 
order his findings as to such conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.49   Control required under international treaty.

    Pursuant to section 201(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(d) ), where 
control of a substance is required by U.S. obligations under 
international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on May 1, 
1971, the Administrator shall issue and publish in the Federal Register 
an order controlling such substance under the schedule he deems most 
appropriate to carry out obligations. Issuance of such an order shall be 
without regard to the findings required by subsections 201(a) or 202(b) 
of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(a) or 812(b)) and without regard to the 
procedures prescribed by Sec. 1308.41 or subsections 201 (a) and (b) of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 811 (a) and (b)). An order controlling a substance 
shall become effective 30 days from the date of publication in the

public health or safety necessitate an earlier effective date, in which 
event the Administrator shall specify in the order his findings as to 
such conditions.

<R05>
Sec. 1308.50   Control of immediate precursors.

    Pursuant to section 201(e) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(e)), the 
Administrator may, without regard to the findings required by subsection 
201(a) or 202 (b) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(a) or 812(b)) and without 
regard to the procedures prescribed by Sec. 1308.41 or subsections 201 
(a) and (b) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(a) and (b)), issue and publish in 
the Federal Register an order controlling an immediate precursor. The 
order shall designate the schedule in which the immediate precursor is 
to be placed, which shall be the same schedule in which the controlled 
substance of which it is an immediate precursor is placed or any other 
schedule with a higher numerical designation. An order controlling an 
immediate precursor shall become effective 30 days from the date of 
publication in the Federal Register, unless the Administrator finds that 
conditions of public health or safety necessitate an earlier effective 
date, in which event the Administrator shall specify in the order his 
findings as to such conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.51   Pending proceedings.

    All administrative proceedings pending before the Administration on 
the effective date of this part, including the matter of listing 
chlordiazepoxide and its salts and diazepam as drugs subject to control 
under the Drtg Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, shall be continued and 
brought to final determination in accord with the laws and regulations 
in effect prior to such effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 1308.52  Emergency Scheduling.

    Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(h) and withott regard to the requirements 
of 21 U.S.C. 811(b) relating to the scientific and medical evaluation of 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator may place 
a substance into Schedule I on a temporary basis, if he determines that 
such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public 
safety. An order issued under this section may not be effective before 
the expiration of 30 days from:
    (a) The date of publication by the Administrator of a notice in the 
Federal Register of his intention to issue such order and the grounds 
upon which such order is to be issued, and
    (b) The date the Administrator has transmitted notification to the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services of his intention to issue such 
order. An order issued under this section shall be vacated upon the 
conclusion of a subsequent rulemaking proceeding initiated under section 
201(a) (21 U.S.C. 811(a)) with respect to such substance or at the end 
of one year from the effective date of the order scheduling the 
substance, except that during the pendency of proceedings under section 
201(a) (21 U.S.C. 811(a)) with respect to the substance, the 
Administrator may extend the temporary scheduling for up to six months.

    (a) Every person who distributes, imports, or exports any List I 
chemical, other than those List I chemicals contained in a product 
exempted under Sec. 1310.01(f)(1)(iv), or who proposes to engage in the 
distribution, importation, or exportation of any List I chemical, shall 
obtain annually a registration specific to the List I chemicals to be 
handled, unless exempted by law or pursuant to Secs. 1309.24 through 
1309.27. Only persons actually engaged in such activities are required 
to obtain a registration; related or affiliated persons who are not 
engaged in such activities are not required to be registered. (For 
example, a stockholder or parent corporation of a corporation 
distributing List I chemicals is not required to obtain a registration.)
    (b) Every person who distributes or exports a List I chemical they 
have manufactured, other than a List I chemical contained in a product 
exempted under Sec. 1310.01(f)(1)(iv), or proposes to distribute or 
export a List I chemical they have manufactured, shall obtain annually a 
registration specific to the List I chemicals to be handled, unless 
exempted by law or pursuant to Secs. 1309.24 through 1309.27.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.22  Separate registration for independent activities.

    (a) The following groups of activities are deemed to be independent 
of each other:
    (1) Retail distributing of List I chemicals;
    (2) Non-Retail distributing of List I chemicals;
    (3) Importing List I chemicals; and
    (4) Exporting List I chemicals.
    (b) Every person who engages in more than one group of independent 
activities shall obtain a separate registration for each group of 
activities, unless otherwise exempted by the Act or Secs. 1309.24 
through 1309.26, except that a person registered to import any List I 
chemical shall be authorized to distribute that List I chemical after 
importation, but no other chemical that the person is not registered to 
import.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.23  Separate registration for separate locations.

    (a) A separate registration is required for each principal place of 
business at one general physical location where List I chemicals are 
distributed, imported, or exported by a person.
    (b) The following locations shall be deemed to be places not subject 
to the registration requirement:

[[Page 189]]

    (1) A warehouse where List I chemicals are stored by or on behalf of 
a registered person, unless such chemicals are distributed directly from 
such warehouse to locations other than the registered location from 
which the chemicals were originally delivered; and
    (2) An office used by agents of a registrant where sales of List I 
chemicals are solicited, made, or supervised but which neither contains 
such chemicals (other than chemicals for display purposes) nor serves as 
a distribution point for filling sales orders.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.24  Exemption of agents and employees.

    The requirement of registration is waived for any agent or employee 
of a person who is registered to engage in any group of independent 
activities, if such agent or employee is acting in the usual course of 
his or her business or employment.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.25  Exemption of certain controlled substance registrants.

    (a) The requirement of registration is waived for any person who 
distributes a product containing a List I chemical that is regulated 
pursuant to Sec. 1310.01(f)(1)(iv), if that person is registered with 
the Administration to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled 
substance.
    (b) The requirement of registration is waived for any person who 
imports or exports a product containing a List I chemical that is 
regulated pursuant to Sec. 1310.01(f)(1)(iv), if that person is 
registered with the Administration to engage in the same activity with a 
controlled substance.
    (c) The Administrator may, upon finding that continuation of the 
waiver would not be in the public interest, suspend or revoke a person's 
waiver pursuant to the procedures set forth in Secs. 1309.43 through 
1309.46 and 1309.51 through 1309.57. In considering the revocation or 
suspension of a person's waiver, the Administrator shall also consider 
whether action to revoke or suspend the person's controlled substance 
registration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824 is warranted.
    (d) Any person exempted from the registration requirement under this 
section shall comply with the security requirements set forth in 
Sections 1309.71-1309.73 and the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements set forth under Parts 1310 and 1313 of this chapter.

section and acting in the course of official duties.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.27  Exemption of certain manufacturers.

    The requirement of registration is waived for any manufacturer of a 
List I chemical, if that chemical is produced solely for internal 
consumption by the manufacturer and there is no subsequent distribution 
or exportation of the List I chemical.

Administrator to such person.
    (b) Any person who is registered may apply to be reregistered not 
more than 60 days before the expiration date of his registration.

of the year. The expiration date of the registrations of all registrants 
within any group will be the last day of the month designated for that 
group. In assigning any of the above persons to a group, the 
Administration may select a group the expiration date of which is less 
than one year from the date such business activity was registered. If 
the person is assigned to a group which has an expiration date less than 
eleven months from the date of which the person is registered, the 
registration shall not expire until one year from that expiration date; 
in all other cases, the registration shall expire on the expiration date 
following the date on which the person is registered.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.32  Application forms; contents; signature.

    (a) Any person who is required to be registered pursuant to Section 
1309.21 and is not so registered, shall apply on DEA Form 510.
    (b) Any person who is registered pursuant to Section 1309.21, shall 
apply for reregistration on DEA Form 510a.
    (c) DEA Form 510 may be obtained at any divisional office of the 
Administration or by writing to the Registration Unit, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Department of Justice, Post Office Box 28083, Central 
Station, Washington, DC 20005. DEA Form 510a will be mailed to each List 
I chemical registrant approximately 60 days before the expiration date 
of his or her registration; if any registered person does not receive 
such forms within 45 days before the expiration date of the 
registration, notice must be promptly given of such fact and DEA Form 
510a must be requested by writing to the Registration Unit of the 
Administration at the foregoing address.
    (d) Each application for registration shall include the 
Administration Chemical Code Number, as set forth in Section 1310.02 of 
this chapter, for each List I chemical to be distributed, imported, or

form, unless the item is not applicable, in which case this fact shall 
be indicated.
    (g) Each application, attachment, or other document filed as part of 
an application, shall be signed by the applicant, if an individual; by a 
partner of the applicant, if a partnership; or by an officer of the 
applicant, if a corporation, corporate division, association, trust or 
other entity. An applicant may authorize one or more individuals, who 
would not otherwise be authorized to do so, to sign applications for the 
applicant by filing with the application or other document a power of 
attorney for each such individual. The power of attorney shall be signed 
by a person who is authorized to sign applications under this paragraph

The appropriate registration fee and any required attachments must 
accompany the application.
    (b) Any person required to obtain more than one registration may 
submit all applications in one package. Each application must be 
complete and must not refer to any accompanying application for required 
information.

[[Page 191]]


<R05>
Sec. 1309.34  Acceptance for filing; defective applications.

    (a) Applications submitted for filing are dated upon receipt. If 
found to be complete, the application will be accepted for filing. 
Applications failing to comply with the requirements of this part will 
not generally be accepted for filing. In the case of minor defects as to 
completeness, the Administrator may accept the application for filing 
with a request to the applicant for additional information. A defective 
application will be returned to the applicant within 10 days of receipt 
with a statement of the reason for not accepting the application for 
filing. A defective application may be corrected and resubmitted for 
filing at any time.
    (b) Accepting an application for filing does not preclude any 
subsequent request for additional information pursuant to Section 
1309.35 and has no bearing on whether the application will be granted.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.35  Additional information.

    The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such documents 
or written statements of fact relevant to the application as he deems 
necessary to determine whether the application should be granted. The 
failure of the applicant to provide such documents or statements within 
a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall be deemed to be a 
waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present such documents or 
facts for consideration by the Administrator in granting or denying the 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.36  Amendments to and withdrawals of applications.

    (a) An application may be amended or withdrawn without permission of 
the Administration at any time before the date on which the applicant 
receives an order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1309.46. An application 
may be amended or withdrawn with permission of the Administrator at any 
time where good cause is shown by the applicant or where the amendment 
or withdrawal is in the public interest.
    (b) After an application has been accepted for filing, the request 
by the applicant that it be returned or the failure of the applicant to 
respond to official correspondence regarding the application, including 
a request that the applicant submit the required fee, when sent by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be deemed 
to be a withdrawal of the application.

  Action on Applications for Registration: Revocation or Suspension of 
                              Registration


<R05>
Sec. 1309.41  Administrative review generally.

    The Administrator may inspect, or cause to be inspected, the 
establishment of an applicant or registrant, pursuant to subpart A of 
Part 1316 of this chapter. The Administrator shall review the 
application for registration and other information gathered by the 
Administrator regarding an applicant in order to determine whether the 
applicable standards of Section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) have been 
met by the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.42  Certificate of registration; denial of registration.

    (a) The Administrator shall issue a Certificate of Registration (DEA 
Form 511) to an applicant if the issuance of registration or 
reregistration is required under the applicable provisions of section 
303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823). In the event that the issuance of 
registration or reregistration is not required, the Administrator shall 
deny the application. Before denying any application, the Administrator 
shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to Section 1309.46 and, if 
requested by the applicant, shall hold a hearing on the application 
pursuant to Sec. 1309.51.
    (b) The Certificate of Registration (DEA Form 511) shall contain the 
name, address, and registration number of the registrant, the activity 
authorized by the registration, the amount of fee paid, and the 
expiration date of the registration. The registrant shall maintain the 
certificate of registration at the registered location in a readily 
retrievable manner and shall permit inspection of the certificate by any 
official, agent or employee of the Administration or of any Federal,

[[Page 192]]

State, or local agency engaged in enforcement of laws relating to List I 
chemicals or controlled substances.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.43  Suspension or revocation of registration.

    (a) The Administrator may suspend any registration pursuant to 
section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)) for any period of time he 
determines.
    (b) The Administrator may revoke any registration pursuant to 
section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)).
    (c) Before revoking or suspending any registration, the 
Administrator shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to Section 
1309.46 and, if requested by the registrant, shall hold a hearing 
pursuant to Section 1309.51. Notwithstanding the requirements of this 
Section, however, the Administrator may suspend any registration pending 
a final order pursuant to Sec. 1309.44.
    (d) Upon service of the order of the Administrator suspending or 
revoking registration, the registrant shall immediately deliver his or 
her Certificate of Registration to the nearest office of the 
Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.44  Suspension of registration pending final order.

    (a) The Administrator may suspend any registration simultaneously 
with or at any time subsequent to the service upon the registrant of an 
order to show cause why such registration should not be revoked or 
suspended, in any case where he finds that there is an imminent danger 
to the public health or safety. If the Administrator so suspends, he 
shall serve with the order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1309.46 an 
order of immediate suspension that shall contain a statement of his 
findings regarding the danger to public health or safety.
    (b) Upon service of the order of immediate suspension, the 
registrant shall promptly return his Certificate of Registration to the 
nearest office of the Administration.
    (c) Any suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of 
all proceedings upon the revocation or suspension, including any 
judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Administrator or 
dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any registrant whose 
registration is suspended under this section may request a hearing on

Sec. 1309.45  Extension of registration pending final order.

    In the event that an applicant for reregistration (who is doing 
business under a registration previously granted and not revoked or 
suspended) has applied for reregistration at least 45 days before the 
date on which the existing registration is due to expire, and the 
Administrator has issued no order on the application on the date on 
which the existing registration is due to expire, the existing 
registration of the applicant shall automatically be extended and 
continue in effect until the date on which the Administrator so issues 
his order. The Administrator may extend any other existing registration 
under the circumstances contemplated in this section even though the 
registrant failed to apply for reregistration at least 45 days before 
expiration of the existing registration, with or without request by the 
registrant, if the Administrator finds that such extension is not 
inconsistent with the public health and safety.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.46  Order to show cause.

    (a) If, upon examination of the application for registration from 
any applicant and other information gathered by the Administration 
regarding the applicant, the Administrator is unable to make the 
determinations required by the applicable provisions of section 303 of 
the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) to register the applicant, the Administrator 
shall serve upon the applicant an order to show cause why the 
application for registration should not be denied.
    (b) If, upon information gathered by the Administration regarding 
any registrant, the Administrator determines that the registration of 
such registrant is subject to suspension or revocation pursuant to 
section 304 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824), the Administrator shall

[[Page 193]]

serve upon the registrant an order to show cause why the registration 
should not be revoked or suspended.
    (c) The order to show cause shall call upon the applicant or 
registrant to appear before the Administrator at a time and place stated 
in the order, which shall not be less than 30 days after the date of 
receipt of the order. The order to show cause shall also contain a 
statement of the legal basis for such hearing and for the denial, 
revocation, or suspension of registration and a summary of the matters 
of fact and law asserted.
    (d) Upon Receipt of an order to show cause, the applicant or 
registrant must, if he desires a hearing, file a request for a hearing 
pursuant to Sec. 1309.54. If a hearing is requested, the Administrator 
shall hold a hearing at the time and place stated in the order, pursuant 
to Sec. 1309.51.
    (e) When authorized by the Administrator, any agent of the 
Administration may serve the order to show cause.

counsel or in memoranda or proposed findings of fact and conclusions of 
law.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.53  Waiver or modification of rules.

    The Administrator or the presiding officer (with respect to matters

the weight to be attached to matters of fact asserted therein.
    (c) If any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to Secs. 1309.42 
and 1309.43 fails to file a request for a hearing, or if he so files and 
fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have waived his 
opportunity for the hearing, unless he shows good cause for such 
failure.
    (d) If any person entitled to a hearing waives or is deemed to waive 
his or her opportunity for the hearing, the Administrator may cancel the

announcement thereof by the presiding officer at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.57  Final order.

    As soon as practicable after the presiding officer has certified the 
record to the Administrator, the Administrator shall cause to be 
published in the Federal Register his final order in the proceeding, 
which shall set forth the final rule and the findings of fact and 
conclusions of law upon which the rule is based. This order shall 
specify the date on which it shall take effect, which date shall not be 
less than 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register 
unless the Administrator finds that the public interest in the matter 
necessitates an earlier effective date, in which case the Administrator

him to conclude that an earlier effective date was required.

         Modification, Transfer and Termination of Registration


<R05>
Sec. 1309.61  Modification in registration.

    Any registrant may apply to modify his or her registration to 
authorize the handling of additional List I chemicals or to change his 
or her name or address, by submitting a letter of request to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, Chemical Registration/ODC, Post Office Box 
2427, Arlington, Virginia 22202-2427. The letter shall contain the 
registrant's name, address, and registration number as printed on the 
certificate of registration, and the List I chemicals to be added to his 
registration or the new name or address and shall be signed in 
accordance with Sec. 1309.32(g). No fee shall be required to be paid for 
the modification. The request for modification shall be handled in the 
same manner as an application for registration. If the modification in 
registration is approved, the Administrator shall issue a new 
certificate of registration (DEA Form 511) to the registrant, who shall 
maintain it with the old certificate of registration until expiration.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.62  Termination of registration.

    The registration of any person shall terminate if and when such 
person dies, ceases legal existence, or discontinues business or 
professional practice. Any registrant who ceases legal existence or 
discontinues business or professional practice shall notify the 
Administrator promptly of such fact.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.63  Transfer of registration.

    No registration or any authority conferred thereby shall be assigned

written consent.

                          Security Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1309.71  General security requirements.

    (a) All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls 
and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of List I chemicals. 
Specific attention shall be paid to storage of and controlling access to 
List I chemicals as follows:
    (1) Chemicals shall be stored in containers sealed in such a manner 
as to indicate any attempts at tampering with the container. Where 
chemicals cannot be stored in sealed containers, access to the chemicals 
should be controlled through physical means or through human or 
electronic monitoring.
    (2) In retail settings open to the public where drugs containing 
List I

[[Page 195]]

chemicals that are regulated pursuant to Sec. 1310.01(f)(1)(iv) are 
distributed, such drugs will be stocked behind a counter where only 
employees have access.
    (b) In evaluating the effectiveness of security controls and 
procedures, the Administrator shall consider the following factors:
    (1) The type, form, and quantity of List I chemicals handled;
    (2) The location of the premises and the relationship such location 
bears on the security needs;
    (3) The type of building construction comprising the facility and 
the general characteristics of the building or buildings;
    (4) The availability of electronic detection and alarm systems;
    (5) the extent of unsupervised public access to the facility;
    (6) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to List 
I chemicals;
    (7) The procedures for handling business guests, visitors, 
maintenance personnel, and nonemployee service personnel in areas where 
List I chemicals are processed or stored;
    (8) The adequacy of the registrant's or applicant's systems for 
monitoring the receipt, distribution, and disposition of List I 
chemicals in its operations.
    (c) Any registrant or applicant desiring to determine whether a 
proposed system of security controls and procedures is adequate may 
submit materials and plans regarding the proposed security controls and 
procedures either to the Special Agent in Charge in the region in which 
the security controls and procedures will be used, or to the Chemical 
Operations Section Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Washington, D.C. 20537.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.72  Felony conviction; employer responsibilities.

    (a) The registrant shall exercise caution in the consideration of 
employment of persons who will have access to listed chemicals, who have 
been convicted of a felony offense relating to controlled substances or 
listed chemicals, or who have, at any time, had an application for 
registration with the DEA denied, had a DEA registration revoked, or 
surrendered a DEA registration for cause. (For purposes of this 
subsection, the term ``for cause'' means a surrender in lieu of, or as a 
consequence of, any Federal or State administrative, civil or criminal 
action resulting from an investigation of the individual's handling of 
controlled substances or listed chemicals.) The registrant should be 
aware of the circumstances regarding the action against the potential 
employee and the rehabilitative efforts following the action. The 
registrant shall assess the risks involved in employing such persons, 
including the potential for action against the registrant pursuant to 
Sec. 1309.43, If such person is found to have diverted listed chemicals, 
and, in the event of employment, shall institute procedures to limit the 
potential for diversion of List I chemicals.
    (b) It is the position of DEA that employees who possess, sell, use 
or divert listed chemicals or controlled substances will subject 
themselves not only to State or Federal prosecution for any illicit 
activity, but shall also immediately become the subject of independent 
action regarding their continued employment. The employer will assess 
the seriousness of the employee's violation, the position of 
responsibility held by the employee, past record of employment, etc., in 
determining whether to suspend, transfer, terminate or take other action 
against the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 1309.73  Employee responsibility to report diversion.

    Reports of listed chemical diversion by fellow employees is not only 
a necessary part of an overall employee security program but also serves 
the public interest at large. It is, therefore, the position of DEA that 
an employee who has knowledge of diversion from his employer by a fellow 
employee has an obligation to report such information to a responsible 
security official of the employer. The employer shall treat such 
information as confidential and shall take all reasonable steps to 
protect the confidentiality of the information and the identity of the 
employee furnishing information. A failure to report information of 
chemical diversion will be considered in determining the

[[Page 196]]

feasibility of continuing to allow an employee to work in an area with 
access to chemicals. The employer shall inform all employees concerning 
this policy.

Sec. 1310.05  Reports.

    (a) Each regulated person shall report to the Special Agent in 
Charge of the DEA Divisional Office for the area in which the regulated 
person making the report is located, as follows:
    (1) Any regulated transaction involving an extraordinary quantity of 
a listed chemical, an uncommon method of payment or delivery, or any 
other circumstance that the regulated person believes may indicate that 
the listed chemical will be used in violation of this part.
    (2) Any proposed regulated transaction with a person whose 
description or other identifying characteristic the Administration has 
previously furnished to the regulated person.
    (3) Any unusual or excessive loss or disappearance of a listed 
chemical under the control of the regulated person. The regulated person 
responsible for reporting a loss in-transit is the supplier.
    (4) Any domestic regulated transaction in a tableting machine or an 
encapsulating machine.
    (b) Each report submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
shall, whenever possible, be made orally to the DEA Divisional Office 
for the area in which the regulated person making the report is located 
at the earliest practicable opportunity after the regulated person 
becomes aware of the circumstances involved and as much in advance of 
the conclusion of the transaction as possible. Written reports of 
transactions listed in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this 
section will subsequently be filed as set forth in Sec. 1310.06 within 
15 days after the regulated person becomes aware of the circumstances of 
the event. A transaction may not be completed with a person whose 
description or identifying characteristic has previously been furnished 
to the regulated person by the Administration unless the transaction is 
approved by the Administration.
    (c) Each regulated person who imports or exports a tableting 
machine, as defined in Sec. 1310.01(i), or encapsulation machine, as 
defined in Sec. 1310.01(j), shall file a report (not a 486) of such 
importation or exportation with the Administration at the following 
address on or before the date of importation or exportation: Drug 
Enforcement Administration, P.O. Box 28346, Washington, DC 20038. In 
order to facilitate the importation or exportation of any tableting 
machine or encapsulating machine and implement the purpose of the Act, 
regulated persons may wish to report to the Administration as far in 
advance as possible. A copy of the report may be transmitted directly to 
the Drug Enforcement Administration through electronic facsimile media. 
Any tableting machine or encapsulating machine may be imported or 
exported if that machine is needed for medical, commercial, scientific, 
or other legitimate uses. However, an importation or exportation of a 
tableting machine or encapsulating machine may not be completed with a 
person whose description or identifying characteristic has previously 
been furnished to the regulated person by the Administration unless the 
transaction is approved by the Administration.
    (d) Each regulated bulk manufacturer of a listed chemical shall 
submit manufacturing, inventory and use data on an annual basis as set 
forth in Sec. 1310.06(h). This data shall be submitted annually to the 
Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA), Washington, D.C. 20537, on or before the 15th day of March of the 
year immediately following the calendar year for which submitted. A 
business entity which manufactures a listed chemical may elect to report 
separately by individual location or report as an aggregate amount for 
the entire business entity provided that they inform the DEA of which 
method they will use. This reporting requirement does not apply to drug 
or other products which are exempted under Secs. 1310.01(f)(1)(iv) or 
1310.01(f)(1)(v) except as set forth in Sec. 1310.06(h)(5). Bulk 
manufacturers that

[[Page 202]]

produce a listed chemical solely for internal consumption shall not be 
required to report for that listed chemical. For purposes of these 
reporting requirements, internal consumption shall consist of any 
quantity of a listed chemical otherwise not available for further resale 
or distribution. Internal consumption shall include (but not be limited 
to) quantities used for quality control testing, quantities consumed in-
house or production losses. Internal consumption does not include the 
quantities of a listed chemical consumed in the production of exempted 
products. If an existing standard industry report contains the 
information required in Sec. 1310.06(h) and such information is separate 
or readily retrievable from the report, that report may be submitted in 
satisfaction of this requirement. Each report shall be submitted to the 
DEA under company letterhead and signed by an appropriate, responsible 
official. For purposes of this paragraph only, the term regulated bulk 
manufacturer of a listed chemical means a person who manufactures a 
listed chemical by means of chemical synthesis or by extraction from 
other substances. The term bulk manufacturer does not include persons 
whose sole activity consists of the repackaging or relabeling of listed 
chemical products or the manufacture of drug dosage from products which 
contain a listed chemical.

Sec. 1310.07  Proof of identity.

    (a) Each regulated person who engages in a regulated transaction 
must identify the other party to the transaction. For domestic 
transaction, this shall be accomplished by having the other party 
present documents which would verify the identity, or registration 
status if a registrant, of the other party to the regulated person at 
the time the order is placed. For export transactions, this shall be 
accomplished by good faith inquiry through reasonably available research 
documents or publicly available information which would indicate the 
existence of the foreign customer. No proof of identity is required for 
foreign suppliers.
    (b) The regulated person must verify the existence and apparent 
validity of a business entity ordering a listed chemical, tableting 
machine or encapsulating machine. For domestic transactions, this may be 
accomplished by such methods as checking the telephone directory, the 
local credit bureau, the local Chamber of Commerce or the local Better 
Business Bureau, or, if the business entity is a registrant, by 
verification of the registration. For export transactions, a good faith 
inquiry to verify the existence and apparent validity of a foreign 
business entity may be accomplished by such methods as verifying the 
business telephone listing through international telephone information, 
the firm's listing in international or foreign national chemical 
directories or other commerce directories or trade publications, 
confirmation through foreign subsidiaries of the U.S. regulated person, 
verification through the country of destination's embassy Commercial 
Attache, or official documents provided by the purchaser which confirm 
the existence and apparent validity of the business entity.
    (c) When transacting business with a new representative of a firm, 
the regulated person must verify the claimed agency status of the 
representative.
    (d) For sales to individuals or cash purchasers, the type of 
documents and other evidence of proof must consist of at least a 
signature of the purchaser, a driver's license and one other form of 
identification. Any exports to individuals or exports paid in cash are 
suspect and should be handled as such. For such exports, the regulated 
person shall diligently obtain from the purchaser or independently seek 
to confirm clear documentation which proves the person is properly 
identified such as through foreign identity documents, driver's license, 
passport information and photograph, etc. Any regulated person who fails 
to adequately prove the identity of the other party to the transaction 
may be subject to the specific penalties provided for violations of law 
related to regulated transactions in listed chemicals.
    (e) For a new customer who is not an individual or cash customer, 
the regulated person shall establish the identity of the authorized 
purchasing agent or agents and have on file that person's signature, 
electronic password, or other identification. Once the authorized 
purchasing agent has been established, the agent list may be updated 
annually rather than on each order. The regulated person must ensure 
that shipments are not made unless the order is placed by an authorized 
agent of record.

[[Page 205]]

    (f) With respect to electronic orders, the identity of the purchaser 
shall consist of a computer password, identification number or some 
other means of identification consistent with electronic orders and with 
Sec. 1310.07(e).

that the application is submitted on or before November 13, 1995. This 
exemption applies only to registration; all other chemical control

<R05>
Sec. 1310.10  Removal of the exemption of drugs distributed under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

    (a) The Administrator may remove from exemption under 
1310.01(f)(1)(iv) any drug or group of drugs that the Administrator 
finds is being diverted to obtain a listed chemical for use in the 
illicit production of a controlled substance. In removing a drug or 
group of drugs from the exemption the Administrator shall consider:
    (1) the scope, duration, and significance of the diversion;
    (2) whether the drug or group of drugs is formulated in such a way 
that it cannot be easily used in the illicit production of a controlled 
substance; and
    (3) whether the listed chemical can be readily recovered from the 
drug or group of drugs.
    (b) Upon determining that a drug or group of drugs should be removed 
from the exemption under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Administrator shall issue and publish in the Federal Register his 
proposal to remove the drug or group of drugs from the exemption, which 
shall include a reference to the legal authority under which the 
proposal is based. The Administrator shall permit any interested person 
to file

[[Page 206]]

written comments on or objections to the proposal. After considering any 
comments or objections filed, the Administrator shall publish in the 
Federal Register his final order.
    (c) The Administrator shall limit the removal of a drug or group of 
drugs from exemption under paragraph (a) of this section to the most 
identifiable type of the drug or group of drugs for which evidence of 
diversion exists unless there is evidence, based on the pattern of 
diversion and other relevant factors, that the diversion will not be 
limited to that particular drug or group of drugs.
    (d) Any manufacturer seeking reinstatement of a particular drug 
product that has been removed from an exemption under paragraph (a) of 
this section, may apply to the Administrator for reinstatement of the 
exemption for that particular drug product on the grounds that the 
particular drug product is manufactured and distributed in a manner that 
prevents diversion. In determining whether the exemption should be 
reinstated the Administrator shall consider:
    (1) the package sizes and manner of packaging of the drug product;
    (2) the manner of distribution and advertising of the drug product;
    (3) evidence of diversion of the drug product;
    (4) any actions taken by the manufacturer to prevent diversion of 
the drug product; and
    (5) such other factors as are relevant to and consistent with the 
public health and safety, including the factors described in paragraph 
(a) of this section as applied to the drug product.
    (e) Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the 
application for reinstatement of the exemption, the Administrator shall 
notify the applicant of his acceptance or non-acceptance of his 
application, and if not accepted, the reason therefor. If the 
application is accepted for filing, the Administrator shall issue and 
publish in the Federal Register his order on the reinstatement of the 
exemption for the particular drug product, which shall include a 
reference to the legal authority under which the order is based. This 
order shall specify the date on which it shall take effect. The 
Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written 
comments on or objections to the order. If any such comments raise 
significant issues regarding any finding of fact or conclusion of law 
upon which the order is based, the Administrator shall immediately 
suspend the effectiveness of the order until he may reconsider the 
application in light of the comments and objections filed. Thereafter, 
the Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, or amend his original order 
as he determines appropriate.
    (f) Unless the Administrator has evidence that the drug product is 
being diverted, as determined by applying the factors set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, and the Administrator so notifies the 
applicant, transactions involving a specific drug product will not be 
considered regulated transactions during the following periods:
    (1) while a bonafide application for reinstatement of exemption 
under paragraph (d) of this section for the specific drug product is 
pending resolution, provided that the application for reinstatement is 
filed not later than 60 days after the publication of the final order 
removing the exemption; and
    (2) for a period of 60 days following the Administrator's denial of 
an application for reinstatement.
    (g) An order published by the Administrator in the Federal Register, 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, to reinstate an exemption may 
be modified or revoked with respect to a particular drug product upon a 
finding that:
    (1) applying the factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section 
to the particular drug product, the drug product is being diverted; or
    (2) there is a significant change in the data that led to the 
issuance of the final rule.

described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
    (b) No reinstated exemption granted pursuant to 1310.10 affects the 
criminal liability for illegal possession or distribution of listed 
chemicals contained in the exempt drug product.
    (c) Changes in exempt drug product compositions: Any change in the 
quantitative or qualitative composition, trade name or other designation 
of an exempt drug product listed in paragraph (d) requires a new 
application for reinstatement of the exemption.
    (d) The following drug products, in the form and quantity listed in 
the application submitted (indicated as the ``date'') are designated as 
reinstated exempt drug products for the purposes set forth in this

marketed or distributed under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    (6) The identification of any information on the application which 
is considered by the applicant to be a trade secret or confidential and

of such information by government employees.
    (c) The Administrator may require the applicant to submit such 
additional documents or written statements of fact relevant to the

should be granted.
    (d) Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of a 
completed application for an exemption under this section, the 
Administrator shall notify the applicant of acceptance or non-acceptance 
of the application. If the application is not accepted, an explanation 
will be provided. The Administrator is not required to accept an 
application if any of the information required in paragraph (b) of this 
section or requested pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section is 
lacking or not readily understood. The applicant may, however, amend the 
application to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section. If the application is accepted for filing, the Administrator 
shall issue and publish in the Federal Register an order on the 
application, which shall include a reference to the legal authority 
under which the order is based. This order shall specify the date on 
which it shall take effect. The Administrator shall permit any 
interested person to file written comments on or objections to the 
order. If any comments or objections raise significant issues regarding 
any findings of fact or law upon which the order is based, the 
Administrator shall immediately suspend the effectiveness of the order 
until he may reconsider the application in light of the comments and 
objections filed. Thereafter, the Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, 
or amend the original order as deemed appropriate.

  Action on Applications for Registration: Revocation or Suspension of 
                              Registration


<R05>
Sec. 1311.41   Administrative review generally.

    The Administrator may inspect, or cause to be inspected, the 
establishment of an applicant or registrant, pursuant to subpart A of 
part 1316 of this chapter. The Administrator shall review the 
application for registration and other information gathered by the 
Administrator regarding an applicant in order to determine whether the 
applicable standards of section 1008 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 958) have 
been met by the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 1311.42   Application for importation of Schedule I and II substances.

    (a) In the case of an application for registration or reregistration 
to import a controlled substance lhsted in Schedule I or II, under the 
authority of section 1002(a)(2)(B) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a)(2)(B)), 
the Administrator shall, upon the filing of such application, publish in 
the Federal Register a notice naming the applicant and stating that such 
applicant has applied to be registered as an importer of a Schedule I or 
II controlled substance, which substance shall be identified. A copy of 
said notice shall be mailed simultaneously to each person registered as 
a bulk manufacturer of that controlled substance and to any other 
applicant therefor. Any such person may, within 30 days from the date of 
publication of the notice in the Federal Register, file written comments 
on or objections to the issuance of the proposed registration, and may, 
at the same time, file a written request for a hearing on the 
application pursuant to Sec. 1301.54. If a hearing is requested, the 
Administrator shall hold a hearing on the application in accordance with 
Sec. 1301.54. Notice of the hearing shall be published in the Federal 
Register, and shall be mailed simultaneously to the applicant and to all 
persons to whom notice of the application was mailed. Any such person 
may participate in the hearing by filing a notice of appearance in 
accordance with Sec. 1301.54 of this chapter. Notice of the hearing 
shall contain a summary of all comments and objections filed regarding 
the application and shall state the time and place for the hearing, 
which shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of 
such notice in the Federal Register. A hearing pursuant to this section 
may be consolidated with a hearing held pursuant to Secs. 1311.43 or 
1311.44 of this part.
    (b) The Administrator shall register an applicant to import a 
controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II if he determines that 
such registration is consistent with the public interest and with U.S. 
obligations under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in 
effect on May 1, 1971. In determining the public interest, the following 
factors shall be considered:
    (1) Maintenance of effective controls against diversion of 
particular controlled substances and any controlled substance in 
Schedule I or II compounded therefrom into other than legitimate 
medical, scientific research, or industrial channels, by limiting the 
importation and bulk manufacture of such controlled substances to a 
number of establishments which can produce

[[Page 213]]

an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances under 
adequately competitive conditions for legitimate medical, scientific, 
research, and industrial purposes;
    (2) Compliance with applicable State and local law;
    (3) Promotion of technical advances in the art of manufacturing 
these substances and the development of new substances;
    (4) Prior conviction record of applicant under Federal and State 
laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of such 
substances;
    (5) Past experience in the manufacture of controlled substances, and 
the existence in the establishment of effective control against 
diversion;
    (6) That the applicant will be permitted to import only:
    (i) Such amounts of crude opium, poppy straw, concentrate of poppy 
straw, and coca leaves as the Administrator finds to be necessary to 
provide for medical, scientific, or other legitimate purposes; or
    (ii) Such amounts of any controlled substances listed in Schedule I 
or II as the Administrator shall find to be necessary to provide for the 
medical, scientific, or other legitimate needs of the United States 
during an emergency in which domestic supplies of such substances are 
found by the Administrator to be inadequate; or
    (iii) Such amounts of any controlled substance listed in Schedule I 
or II as the Administrator shall find to be necessary to provide for the 
medical, scientific, or other legitimate needs of the United States in 
any case in which the Administrator finds that competition among 
domestic manufacturers of the controlled substance is inadequate and 
will not be rendered adequate by the registration of additional 
manufacturers under section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823); or
    (iv) Such limited quantities of any controlled substance listed in 
Schedule I or II as the Administrator shall find to be necessary for 
scientific, analytical or research uses; and
    (7) Such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the 
public health and safety.
    (c) In determining whether the applicant can and will maintain 
effective controls against diversion within the meaning of paragraph 
(b), the Administrator shall consider among other factors:
    (1) Compliance with the security requirements set forth in 
Secs. 1301.71-1301.76 of this chapter; and
    (2) Employment of security procedures to guard against in-transit 
losses within and without of the jurisdiction of the United States.
    (d) In determining whether competition among the domestic 
manufacturers of a controlled substance is adequate within the meaning 
of paragraphs (b)(1) and (6)(iii) of this section, as well as section 
1002(a)(2)(B) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a)(2)(B)), the Administrator 
shall consider:
    (1) The extent of price rigidity in the light of changes in (i) raw 
materials and other costs and (ii) conditions of supply and demand;
    (2) The extent of service and quality competition among the domestic 
manufacturers for shares of the domestic market including (i) shifts in 
market shares and (ii) shifts in individual customers among domestic 
manufacturers;
    (3) The existence of substantial differentials between (i) domestic 
prices and (ii) the higher of prices generally prevailing in foreign 
markets or the prices at which the applicant for registration to import 
is committed to undertake to provide such products in the domestic 
market in conformity with the Act. In determining the existence of 
substantial differentials hereunder, appropriate consideration should be 
given to any additional costs imposed on domestic manufacturers by the 
requirements of the Act and such other cost-related and other factors as 
the Administrator may deem relevant. In no event shall an importer's 
offering prices in the United States be considered if they are lower 
than those prevailing in the foreign market or markets from which the 
importer is obtaining his supply;
    (4) The existence of competitive restraints imposed upon domestic 
manufacturers by governmental regulations; and
    (5) Such other factors as may be relevant to the determinations 
required under this paragraph.

[[Page 214]]

    (e) In considering the scope of the domestic market, consideration 
shall be given to substitute products which are reasonably 
interchangeable in terms of price, quality and use.
    (f) The fact that the number of existing manufacturers is small 
shall not demonstrate, in and of itself, that adequate competition among 
them does not exist.

reregistration is required under the applicable provisions of section 
1008 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 958). In the event the issuance of 
registration or reregistration is not required, the Administrator shall 
deny the application. Before denying any application, the Administrator 
shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1311.47 and, if 
requested by the applicant, shall hold a hearing on the application 
pursuant to Sec. 1311.51.

defined in that section or with the United States obligations under 
international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on October 
12, 1984.
    (d) The Administrator may limit the revocation or suspension of a 
registration to the particular controlled substance, or substances, with 
respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.
    (e) Before revoking or suspending any registration, the 
Administrator shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to 
Sec. 1311.47, and if requested by the registrant, shall hold a hearing

section, however, the Administrator may suspend any registration pending 
a final order pursuant to Sec. 1311.45.

necessary to provide for medical, scientific, or other legitimate 
purposes;
    (2) That the substance is necessary to provide for medical and 
scientific needs or other legitimate needs of the United States during 
an emergency where domestic supplies of such substance or drug are found 
to be inadequate, or in any case in which the Administrator finds that 
competition among domestic manufacturers of the controlled substance is 
inadequate and will not be rendered adequate by the registration of 
additional manufacturers under section 303 of the Controlled Substances 
Act (21 U.S.C. 823); or
    (3) That the domestic supply of any controlled substance is 
inadequate for scientific studies, and that the importation of that 
substance for scientific purposes is only for delivery to officials of 
the United Nations, of the United States, or of any State, or to any 
person registered or exempted from registration under sections 1007 and 
1008 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 957 and 958).
    (4) That the importation of the controlled substance is for

    (b) The Administrator may require that such non-narcotic controlled 
substances in Schedule III as he shall designate by regulation in 
Sec. 1312.30 of this part be imported only pursuant to the issuance of

medical, scientific or other legitimate uses.
    (d) The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such 
documents or written statements of fact relevant to the application as 
he deems necessary to determine whether the application should be 
granted. The failure of the applicant to provide such documents or

be deemed to be a waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present 
such documents or facts for consideration by the Administrator in 
granting or denying the application.

in the case of shipments transported under immediate transportation 
entries, in order that the District Director may compare it with the 
original copy (Copy 1) and the bill of lading upon arrival of the 
merchandise. If a discrepancy is noted between corresponding items upon 
different copies of a permit bearing the same serial number when 
compared by the District Director, he shall refuse to permit entry of

such difference shall be seized subject to forfeiture, pending an 
explanation; except that shipments of substances exceeding the maximum

Government.
    (b) If the shipment made under the permit is less than the maximum

recredits will remain available to the importer to whom made (unless 
previously revoked in whole or in part), for importations pursuant to

exported only pursuant to the issuance of an export permit. The 
Administrator may authorize the exportation of such substances if he 
finds that such exportation is permitted by section 1003(e) of the Act 
(21 U.S.C. 953(e)).
    (d) The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such 
documents or written statements of fact relevant to the application as 
he deems necessary to determine whether the application should be 
granted. The failure of the applicant to provide such documents or 
statements within a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall 
be deemed to be a waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present 
such documents or facts for consideration by the Administrator in 
granting or denying the application.
    (e) Each export permit shall be issued in septuplet and serially 
numbered, with all seven copies bearing the same serial number and being 
designated ``original'' (Copy 1), ``duplicate'' (Copy 2), etc., 
respectively. Each export permit shall be predicated upon an import 
certificate or other documentary evidence. Export permits are not 
transferable.
    (f) No export permit shall be issued for the exportation of any 
narcotic drug to any country when the Administrator has information to 
show that the estimates submitted with respect to that country for the 
current period, under the Narcotic Limitation Convention of 1931, or the 
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, have been, or, considering 
the quantity proposed to be imported, will be exceeded. If it shall 
appear through subsequent advice received from the International 
Narcotic Control Board of the United Nations that the estimates of the 
country of destination have been adjusted to permit further importation 
of the narcotic drug, an export permit may then be issued if otherwise 
permissible.

is satisfied that the witness is properly qualified.
    (c) The authenticity of all documents submitted in advance shall be

such authenticity at a later time upon a showing of good cause for 
failure to have filed such written objection.
    (d) Samples, if otherwise admissible into evidence, may be displayed 
at the hearing and may be described for purposes of the record, or may 
be admitted in evidence as exhibits.
    (e) Where official notice is taken or is to be taken of a material 
fact not appearing in the evidence of record, any party, on timely 
request, shall be afforded opportunity to controvert such fact.
    (f) The presiding officer shall file as exhibits copies of the 
folloving documents:

without extended argument or debate thereon except as permitted by the 
presiding officer. A ruling of the presiding officer on any such 
objection shall be a part of the transcript together with such offer of 
proof as has been made if a proper foundation has been laid for its

clearly necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense, or prejudice to 
any party or substantial detriment to the public interest. If an appeal 
is allowed, any party in the hearing may file a brief in quintuplicate 
with the Administrator within such period that the presiding officer 
directs. No oral argument will be heard unless the Administrator directs 
otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.63   Official transcript; index; corrections.

    (a) Testimony given at a hearing shall be reported verbatim. The

the parties and witnesses time (not longer than 30 days, except in 
unusual cases) in which to submit written proposed corrections of the 
transcript, pointing out errors that may have been made in transcribing 
the testimony. The presiding officer shall promptly thereafter order 
such corrections made as in his judgment are required to make the 
transcript conform to the testimony.

Sec. 1316.90  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The following definitions, regulations, and criteria are 
designed to establish and implement procedures required by sections 6079 
and 6080 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-690 (102 
Stat. 4181). They are intended to supplement existing law and procedures 
relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified statutory 
authority. The provisions of these regulations do not affect the 
existing legal and equitable rights and remedies of those with an 
interest in property seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions 
relieve interested parties from their existing obligations and 
responsibilities in pursuing their interests through such courses of 
action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intent of Congress 
to minimize the adverse impact on those entitled to legal or equitable 
relief occasioned by the prolonged detention of property subject to 
forfeiture due to violations of law involving personal use quantities of 
controlled substances, and conveyances seized for drug-related offenses. 
The definition of personal use

[[Page 256]]

quantities of a controlled substance as contained herein is intended to 
distinguish between those quantities small in amount which are generally 
considered to be possessed for personal consumption and not for further 
distribution, and those larger quantities generally considered to be 
subject to further distribution.
    (b) In this regard, for violations involving the porsession of 
personal use quantities of a controlled substance, section 6079(b)(2) 
requires either that administrative forfditure be completed within 21 
days of the seizure of the property, or alternatively, that procedures 
are established that provide a means by which an individual entitled to 
relief may initiate an expedited administrative review of the legal and 
factual basis of the seizure for forfeiture. Should an individual 
request relief pursuant to these regulations and be entitled to the 
return of the seized property, such property shall be returned 
immediately following that determination, and the administrative 
forfeiture process shall cease. Should the individual not be entitled to 
the return of the seized property, however, the administrative 
forfeiture of that property shall proceed. The owner may, in any event, 
obtain release of property pending the administrative forfeiture by 
submitting to the agency making the determination, property sufficient 
to preserve the government's vested interest for purposes of the 
administrative forfeiture.
    (c) Section 6080 requires a similar expedited review by the Attorney 
General or his representative in those instances where a conveyance is 
being forfeited in a civil judicial proceeding following its seizure for 
a drug-related offense.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.91  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meanings 
specified:
    (a) The term Appraised Value means the estimated domestic price at 
the time of seizure at which such or similar property is freely offered 
for sale.
    (b) The term Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel means a vessel that:
    (1) Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of 
fish or an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the 
catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;
    (2) Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by 
gutting, decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or 
brine chilling; or
    (3) Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports fish, 
fish products, or materials directly related to fishing or the 
preparation of fish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish 
tender vessel or fish processing facility.
    (c) The term Controlled Substance has the meaning given in section 
802 of title 21, United States Code (U.S.C.).
    (d) The term Drug-Related Offense means any proscribed offense which 
involves the possession, distribution, manufacture, cultivation, sale, 
transfer, or the attempt or conspiracy to possess, distribute, 
manufacture, cultivate, sell or transfer any substance the possession of 
which is prohibited by Title 21, U.S.C.
    (e) The term Immediately means within 20 days of the filing of a 
petition for expedited release by an owner.
    (f) The term Interested Party means one who was in legal possession 
of the property at the time of seizure and is entitled to legal 
possdssion at the time of the granting of the petition for expedited 
release. This includes a lienholder (to the extent of his interest in 
the property) whose claim is in writing (except for a maritime lien 
which need not be in writing), unless the collateral is in the 
porsession of the secured party. The agreement securing such lien must 
create or provide for a security interest in the collateral, describe 
the collateral, and be signed by the debtor.
    (g) The term Legal and Factual Basis of the Seizure means a 
statement of the applicable law under which the property is seized, and 
a statement of the circumstances of the seizure sufficiently precise to 
enable an owner or other interested party to identify the date, place, 
and use or acquisition which makes the property subject to forfeiture.
    (h) The term Normal and Customary Manner means that inquiry 
suggested by particular facts and circumstances

[[Page 257]]

which would customarily be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual 
in a like or similar situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and 
circumstances is unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive 
knowledge is sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is 
persuasive but not conclusive or controlling in determining whether an 
owner acted in a normal and customary manner to ascertain how property 
would be used by another legally in possession of the property. The 
failure to act in a normal and customary manner as defined herein will 
result in the denial of a petition for expedited release of the property 
and is intended to have the desirable effect of inducing owners of the 
property to exercise greater care in transferring possession of their 
property.
    (i) The term Owner means one having a legal and possessory interest 
in the property seized for forfeiture. Even though one may hold primary 
and direct title to the property seized, such person may not have 
sufficient actual beneficial interest in the property to support a 
petition as owner if the facts indicate that another person had dominion 
and control over the property.
    (j) The term Personal Use Quantities means possession of controlled 
substances in circumstances where there is no other evidence of an 
intent to distribute, of to facilitate the manufacturing, compounding, 
processing, delivering, importing or exporting of any controlled 
substance. Evidence of personal use quantities shall not include 
sweepings or other evidence of possession of quantities of a controlled 
substance for other than personal use.
    (1) Such other evidence shall include:
    (i) Evidence, such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia, 
drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug 
``cutting'' agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to 
process, package or distribute a controlled substance;
    (ii) Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a 
controlled substance with intent to distribute;
    (iii) The arrest and/or conviction record of the person or persons 
in actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for 
offenses under Federal, State or local law that indicates an intent to 
distribute a controlled substance;
    (iv) The controlled substance is related to large amounts of cash or 
any amount of prerecorded government funds;
    (v) The controlled substance is possessed under circumstances that 
indicate such a controlled substance is a sample intended for 
distribution in anticipation of a transaction involving large 
quantities, or is part of a larger delivery; or
    (vi) Statements by the possessor, or otherwise attributable to the 
possessor, including statements of conspirators, that indicate 
possession with intent to distribute.
    (2) Possession of a controlled substance shall be presumed to be for 
personal use when there are no indicia of illicit drug trafficking or 
distribution such as, but not limited to, the factors listed above and 
the amounts do not exceed the following quantities:
    (i) One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of heroin;
    (ii) One gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable 
amount of--
    (A) Coca leaves, except coba leaves and extracts of coca leaves frol 
which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivations of ecgonine or their salts have 
been removed;
    (B) Cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of 
isomers;
    (C) Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of 
isomers; or
    (D) Any compound, mixture or preparation which contains any quantity 
of any of the substances referred to in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(A) through 
(j)(2)(ii)(C) of this section;
    (iii) \1/10\th gram of a mixture or substance described in paragraph 
(j)(2)(ii) of this section which contains cocaine base;
    (iv) \1/10\th gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable 
amount of phencyclidine (PCP);
    (v) 500 micrograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable 
amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);

[[Page 258]]

    (vi) One ounce of a mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of marihuana;
    (vii) One gram of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of 
its isomers, or one gram of a mixture or substance containing a 
detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of 
its isomers.
    (3) The possession of a narcotic, a depressant, a stimulant, a 
hallucinogen or cannabis-controlled substance will be considered in 
excess of personal use quantities if the dosage unit amount possessed 
provides the same or greater equivalent efficacy as described in 
paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
    (k) The term Property means property subject to forfeiture under 
title 21, U.S.C., sections 881(a) (4), (6), and (7); title 19, U.S.C., 
section 1595a, and; title 49, U.S.C. App., section 782.
    (l) The term Seizing Agency means the Federal agency which has 
seized the property or adopted the seizure of another agency, and has 
the responsibility for administratively forfeiting the property;
    (m) The term Statutory Rights or Defenses to the Forfeiture means 
all legal and equitable rights and remedies available to a claimant of 
property seized for forfeiture.
    (n) The term Sworn to as used in Secs. 1316.92(e) and 1316.95(c) 
refers to the oath as provided by Title 28, U.S.C., section 1746.


<R05>

violation of law involving controlled substances in personal use 
quantities, a summons to appear shall be isrued in lieu of a physical 
seizure. The vessel shall report to the port designated in the summons. 
The seizing agency shall be authorized to effect administrative 
forfeiture as if the vessel had been physically seized. Upon answering 
the summons to appear on or prior to the last reporting date specified 
in the summons, the owner of the vessel may file a petition for 
expedited release pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section and other provishons in this 
subpart pertaining to a petition for expedited release shall apply as if 
the vessel had been physically seized.
    (c) The owner filing the petition for expedited release shall 
establish the following:
    (1) The owner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized 
property as owner or otherwise;
    (2) The owner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the 
property in a normal and customary manner; and
    (3) The owner did not know or consent to the illegal use of the 
property, or in the event that the owner knew or should have known of 
the illegal use, the owner did what reasonably could be expected to 
prevent the violation.
    (d) In addition to those factors listed in paragraph (c) of this 
section, if an owner can demonstrate that the owner has other statutnry 
rights or defenses that would cause the owner to prevail on the issue of 
forfeiture, such factors shall also be considered in ruling on the 
petition for expedited release.
    (e) A petition for expedited release must be filed in a timely 
manner to be considered by the seizing agency. In order to be filed in a 
timely manner, the petition must be received by the appropriate seizing 
agency within 20 days from the date of the first publication of the 
notice of seizure. The petition must be executed and sworn to by the 
owner and both the envelope and the request must be clearly marked 
``PETITION FOR EXPEDITED RELEASE.'' Such petition shall be filed in 
triplicate with the Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field 
office in the judicial district in which the property was seized, 
depending upon which agency seized the property. The petition shall be

numbers, if any, and the date and place of seizure;
    (2) The petitioner's interest in the property, which shall be

Sec. 1316.93  Ruling on petition for expedited release in an administrative forfeiture action.

    (a) Upon receipt of a petition for expedited release filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1316.92(a), the seizing agency shall determine first whether a 
final administrative determination of the case, without regard to the 
provisions of this subpart, can be made within 21 days of the seizure. 
If such a final administrative determination is made within 21 days, no 
further action need be taken under this subpart.
    (b) If no such final administrative determination is made within 21 
days of the seizure, the following procedure shall apply. The seizing 
agency shall, within 20 days after the receipt of the petition for 
expedited release, determine whether the petition filed by the owner has 
established the factors listed in Sec. 1316.92(c) and:
    (1) If the seizing agency determines that those factors have been 
established, it shall terminate the administrative proceedings and 
return the property to the owner (or in the case of a commercial fishing 
industry vessel for which a summons has been issued shall dismiss the 
summons), except where it is evidence of a violation of law; or
    (2) If the seizing agency determines that those factors have not 
been established, the agency shall proceed with the administrative 
forfeiture.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.94  Posting of substitute res in an administrative forfeiture action.

    (a) Where property is seized for administrative forfeiture involving 
controlled substances in personal use quantities, the owner may obtain 
release of the property by posting a substitute res with the seizing 
agency. The property will be released to the owner upon the payment of 
an amount equal to the appraised value of the property if it is not 
evidence of a violation of law or has design or other characteristics 
that particularly suit it for use in illegal activities. This payment 
must be in the form of a traveler's check, a money order, a cashier's 
check or an irrevocable letter of credit made payable to the seizing 
agency. A bond in the form of a cashier's check will be considered as 
paid once the check has been accepted for payment by the financial 
institution which issued the check.
    (b) If a substitute res is posted and the property is 
administratively forfeited, the seizing agency will forfeit the 
substitute res in lieu of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.95  Petition for expedited release of a conveyance in a judicial forfeiture action.

    (a) Where a conveyance has been seized and is being forfeited in a 
judicial proceeding for a drug-related offense, the owner may petition 
the United States Attorney for an expedited release of the conveyance.

establish the following:
    (1) The owner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized

manner in order to be considered by the United States Attorney. To be 
considered as filed in a timely manner, the petition must be received by 
the appropriate United States Attorney within 20 days from the date of 
the first publication of the notice of the action and arrest of the 
property, or within 30 days after filing of the claim, whichever occurs 
later. The petition must be executed and sworn to by the owner, and both 
the envelope and the request must be clearly marked ``PETITION FOR 
EXPEDITED RELEASE.'' Such petition shall be filed in triplicate and 
addressed to and filed with the United States Attorney prosecuting the 
conveyance for forfeiture with a copy to the seizing agency.
    (d) The petition shall include the following:
    (1) A complete description of the conveyance, including the

<R05>
Sec. 1316.96  Ruling on a petition for expedited release of a conveyance in a judicial forfeiture action.

    (a) Upon receipt of a petition for expedited release filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1316.95, the United States Attorney shall rule on the petition

it is received by the United States Attorney.
    (b) If the United States Attorney does not rule on the petition for 
expedited release within 20 days after the date on which it is filed, 
the conveyance shall be returned to the owner or interested party 
pending further forfeiture proceedings, except where it is evidence of a 
violation of law. Release of conveyance under provisions of this 
paragraph shall not affect the forfeiture action with respect to that 
conveyance.
    (c) Upon a favorable ruling on the petition for expedited release, 
the United States Attorney shall, where necessary, move to terminate the 
judicial proceedings against the conveyance and immediately direct the 
return of the conveyance except where it is evidence of a violation of 
law.
    (d) If, within 20 days, the United States Attorney denies the

bond.


<R05>
Sec. 1316.98  Substitute res bond in a judicial forfeiture action against a conveyance.

    (a) Where a conveyance is being forfeited in a judicial proceeding 
for a drug-related offense, the owner may obtain release of the property 
by filing a substitute res bond with the seizing agency. The conveyance 
will be released to the owner upon the payment of a bond in the amount 
of the appraised value of the conveyance if it is not evidence of a 
violation of law or has design or other characteristics that 
particularly suit it for use in illegal activities. This bond must be in 
the form of a traveler's check, a money order, a cashier's check or an 
irrevocable letter of credit made payable to the Department of Justice 
or to the United States Customs Service depending on which agency seized 
the conveyance. A bond in the form of a cashier's check will be 
considered as paid once the check has

[[Page 261]]

been accepted for payment by the financial institution which issued the 
check.
    (b) If a substitute res bond is filed and the conveyance is 
judicially forfeited, the court will forfeit the bond in lieu of the 
property.

Sec. 1401.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to prescribe rules, guidelines and 
procedures to implement the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 
552, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.2  The Office of National Drug Control Policy--Organization and functions.

    (a) The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was created 
by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. The mission 
of ONDCP is to coordinate the anti-drug efforts of the various agencies 
and departments of the Federal government, to consult with States and 
localities and assist their anti-drug efforts, and to annually 
promulgate the National Drug Control Strategy. ONDCP is headed by the 
Director of National Drug Control Policy. The Director is assisted by a 
Deputy Director for Supply Reduction, a Deputy Director for Demand 
Reduction, and an Associate Director for State and Local Affairs.
    (b) ONDCP has an Office of Public Affairs that is responsible for 
providing information to the press and to the general public. If members 
of the public have general questions about ONDCP that can be answered by 
telephone, they may call the Office of Public Affairs at (202) 467-9890. 
This number should not be used to make FOIA requests. All oral requests 
for information under FOIA will be rejected.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following definitions shall apply:
    (a) Commercial-use request means a request from or on behalf of one 
who seeks information for a cause or purpose that furthers the 
commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person or 
institution on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether 
a requester properly belongs in this category, ONDCP will consider how 
the requester intends to use the documents.
    (b) Direct costs means those expenditures that ONDCP actually incurs 
in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial 
requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct 
costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work 
(the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to 
cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not 
included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, 
and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.
    (c) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document in 
response to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, 
microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation. 
ONDCP will provide a copy of the material in a form that is usable by 
the requester unless it is administratively burdensome to do so.
    (d) Educational institution means preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher 
education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (e) Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that

[[Page 265]]

term is referenced above, and that is operated solely for the purpose of 
conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to 
promote any particular product or industry.
    (f) Records and/or information means all books, papers, manuals, 
maps, photographs, or other documentary materials, regardless of 
physical form or characteristics, made or received by ONDCP and 
preserved or appropriate for preservation by ONDCP as evidence of the 
organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or 
other activities of the Government or because of the information value 
of the data in them, but does not include books, magazines or other 
material acquired solely for library purposes and through other sources, 
and does not include analyses, computations, or compilations of 
information not extant at the time of the request. The term ``records'' 
does not include objects or articles such as structures, furniture, 
paintings, sculptures, three-dimensional models, vehicles, and 
equipment.
    (g) Representative of the news media means any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media include television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of 
``news'') that make their products available for purchase or 
subscription by the general public. Freelance journalists may be 
regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a 
reasonable basis for expecting publication through that organization, 
even though not actually employed by it.
    (h) Request means a letter or other written communication seeking 
records or information under FOIA.
    (i) Review means the process of examining documents located in 
response to a commercial-use request to determine if that document or 
any portion of that document is permitted to be withheld. It also 
includes processing any document for disclosure (i.e., doing all that is 
necessary to excise those portions of the document not subject to 
disclosure under FOIA and otherwise preparing them for release). Review 
does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues 
regarding the application of exemptions.
    (j) Search means all time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. Searches should be 
performed in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to 
minimize costs for both ONDCP and the requester; for example, line-by-
line searches should not be undertaken when it would be more efficient 
to duplicate the entire document. Searches should be distinguished from 
``review'' of material in order to determine whether the material is 
exempt from disclosure. Searches may be done manually or by computer 
using existing programming.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.4  Records of other agencies.

    Requests for records that originated in another agency and are in 
the custody of ONDCP shall be referred to the originating agency for 
processing, and the person submitting the request shall be so notified. 
Any decision made by the originating agency with respect to such records 
will be honored by ONDCP.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.5  How to request records--form and content.

    (a) Requests for records under FOIA must be submitted in writing, 
addressed to: Office of the General Counsel, Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, Executive Office of the President, Washington, DC 20500. 
The words ``FOIA REQUEST'' or ``REQUEST FOR RECORDS'' must be clearly 
marked on both the letter and the envelope. If the request is not so 
marked and addressed, the 10-day time limit imposed by Sec. 1401.7 of 
this part shall not begin to run until the request has been received by 
the Office of the General Counsel and identified as a FOIA request. Due 
to security requirements, FOIA requests may not be delivered in person.
    (b) Any ONDCP employee who receives a request shall promptly forward 
it to the Office of the General Counsel. Any ONDCP employee who receives 
an

[[Page 266]]

oral request made under the FOIA shall inform the person making the 
request of the provisions of this part requiring a written request.
    (c) Each request must reasonably describe the record(s) sought, 
including when known: The specific event or action to which the request 
refers, if any; the name of the agency, office, organization or person 
that originated the record; the date or time period to which the request 
refers; the subject matter of the records requested; the type of 
document requested; the location of the record(s) requested; and any 
other pertinent information that would assist in promptly locating the 
record(s).
    (d) When a request is not considered reasonably descriptive, or 
requires the production of voluminous records, or places an 
extraordinary burden on ONDCP, seriously interfering with its normal 
functioning to the detriment of the business of the Government, ONDCP 
may require the person or agent making the FOIA request to confer with 
an ONDCP representative in order to attempt to verify, and, if possible, 
narrow the scope of the request.
    (e) Upon initial receipt of a request, the Office of the General 
Counsel shall determine which official or officials within ONDCP shall 
have the primary responsibility for collecting and reviewing the 
requested information and drafting a proposed response.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.6  Initial determination.

    The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority 
to approve or deny requests received pursuant to these regulations. The 
decision of the General Counsel shall be final, subject only to 
administrative review as provided in Sec. 1401.9.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.7  Prompt response.

    (a) The General Counsel or his or her designee shall either approve 
or deny a request for records within 10 working days (excluding 
Saturday, Sunday and Federal holidays) after receipt of the request 
unless additional time is required for one of the following reasons:
    (1) It is necessary to search for, collect, and appropriately 
examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are 
demanded in a single request; or
    (2) It is necessary to consult with another agency having a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or 
more components of ONDCP that have a substantial interest in the subject 
matter of the request.
    (b) When additional time is required for one of the reasons stated 
in paragraph (a) of this section, the General Counsel or his or her 
designee shall acknowledge receipt of the request within the 10 working 
day period and include a brief explanation of the reason for delay, 
indicating the date by which a determination will be forthcoming. An 
extended deadline adopted for one of the reasons set forth above may not 
exceed 10 additional working days.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.8  Responses--form and content.

    (a) When a requested record has been identified and is available, 
the General Counsel or his or her designee shall notify the person 
making the request as to where and when the record will be available for 
inspection or the copies will be available. The notification shall also 
advise the person making the request of any fees assessed under 
Sec. 1401.10 of this part.
    (b) A denial or partial denial of a request for a record shall be in 
writing signed by the General Counsel or his or her designee and shall 
include:
    (1) The name and title of the person making the determination;
    (2) Either a reference to the specific exemption under FOIA 
authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how 
the exemption applies to the record withheld, or a statement that, after 
diligent effort, the requested records have not been found or have not 
been adequately examined during the time allowed by Sec. 1401.7, and 
that the denial will be reconsidered as soon as the search or 
examination is complete; and
    (3) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Director 
within 30 days of its receipt by the requester.
    (c) If a requested record cannot be located from the information 
supplied, or is known to have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of, 
the person making the request shall be so notified and

[[Page 267]]

the legal authority for disposition shall be cited.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.9  Appeal procedures.

    (a) When the General Counsel or his or her designee denies a request 
for records in whole or in part, the person making the request may, 
within 30 days of receipt of the notice of denial, appeal the denial to 
the Director of ONDCP. The appeal must be in writing, addressed to the 
Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy, Executive Office of 
the President, Washington, DC 20500. The envelope should be clearly 
labeled as a ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal.''
    (b) The Director will act upon the appeal within 20 working days of 
its receipt. The Director may extend the 20-day period of time by any 
number of working days which could have been used by the General Counsel 
or his or her designee under Sec. 1401.7 but which were not used in 
making the initial determination. The Director's action on an appeal 
shall be in writing and signed.
    (c) If the decision is in favor of the requester, the Director shall 
order records promptly made available to the requester.
    (d) A denial in whole or in part of a request on appeal shall set 
forth a brief explanation of the reasons for the decision, and shall 
inform the requester of his or her right to seek judicial review of the 
denial and ruling on appeal as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
    (e) No personal appearance, oral argument or hearing will ordinarily 
be permitted in connection with an appeal to the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.10  Fee schedule.

    (a) There are four categories of requesters: Commercial use 
requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; 
representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. FOIA 
prescribes different levels of fees for each of these categories.
    (1) Commercial use requesters. When a request for records is made 
for commercial use, charges will be assessed to cover all the costs of 
searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records 
sought.
    (2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institutions. When a 
request for records is made by an educational or a non-commercial 
scientific institution in furtherance of scholarly or scientific 
research, charges will be assessed to cover the cost of duplication 
alone, excluding charges for duplication of the first 100 pages.
    (3) Requests by representatives of the news media. When a request 
for records is made by a representative of the news media for the 
purpose of news dissemination, charges will be assessed to cover the 
cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for duplication of the 
first 100 pages.
    (4) All other requests. When a request for records is made by a 
requester who does not fit into any of the preceding categories, charges 
will be assessed to cover the costs of searching for and duplicating the 
records sought, excluding charges for the first two hours of search time 
and the duplication of the first 100 pages. Moreover, requests from 
individuals for records about themselves will be treated under the 
Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, which permits the assessment of fees 
for duplication costs only, regardless of the requester's 
characterization of the search.
    (b) Fees for searches, review of records and duplication of records 
are charged as follows:
    (1) Search for records. The charge for a manual search is calculated 
by determining the search time to the nearest quarter hour and 
multiplying that figure by the sum of the basic rate of pay per hour of 
the employee conducting the search plus 16 percent of that rate. The 
charge for a computer search is calculated by determining the search 
time to the nearest quarter hour and multiplying that figure by the sum 
of the basic rate of pay per hour of the employee conducting the search, 
plus 16 percent of that rate, plus the direct cost of the operation of 
the computer for that portion of time attributable to the search.
    (2) Review of records. Only requesters who are seeking documents for 
commercial use will be charged for time spent reviewing records to 
determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges 
will be

[[Page 268]]

assessed only for the initial review; i.e., the review undertaken the 
first time ONDCP analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a 
particular record or portion of a record. Charges will not be assessed 
for review at the administrative appeal level of the exemption(s) 
already applied. The cost for review will be calculated based on the 
salary of the category of the employee who actually performed the review 
plus 16 percent of that rate.
    (3) Duplication of records. Copies made by routine photostatic 
copying shall be charged at the rate of $0.15 per page. If copies need 
to be made by other methods, the direct costs of such copies will be 
charged to the requester, as determined by the General Counsel.
    (4) Unsuccessful searches. Requesters may be charged for 
unsuccessful or unproductive searches or for searches when records 
located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.
    (5) Other charges. ONDCP will recover the direct costs of providing 
special services such as certifying that records are true copies, and 
sending records by special methods such as express mail.
    (c) No fee will be charged by ONDCP when the routine costs of 
collecting and processing the fee equal to or exceed the amount of the 
fee. For purposes of this section, the routine costs of collecting and 
processing a fee chargeable under FOIA are estimated to be $15.00 for 
each FOIA request.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.11  Payment of Fees.

    (a) The requester must agree to pay all fees that are chargeable 
under this section prior to issuance of the requested copies.
    (b) Payment of fees shall be in the form either of a personal check 
or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money 
order. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Treasurer 
of the United States and mailed to the General Counsel, Office of 
National Drug Control Policy, Executive Office of the President, 
Washington, DC 20500.
    (c) If it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this section 
will amount to more than $25.00, and the requester has not indicated in 
advance his willingness to pay such fees, the requester shall be 
promptly notified of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion 
thereof as can readily be estimated. In instances where the estimated 
fees will exceed $250.00, an advance deposit may be required. The notice 
or request for an advance deposit shall extend to the requester an offer 
to consult with ONDCP personnel in order to reformulate the request in a 
manner which will reduce the fees. A reformulated request shall be 
considered a new request, thus beginning a new 10 workday period for 
responding to the request.
    (d) When a requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely 
fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), ONDCP may 
require the requester to demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid 
any outstanding fees from past requests, and to make an advance payment 
of the full amount of the estimated fee for the present request before 
ONDCP responds to that request.
    (e) Interest charges on an unpaid bill may be assessed starting on 
the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest 
shall be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717, and shall 
accrue from the date of the billing. The fact that a fee has been 
received by ONDCP, even if not processed, will suffice to stay the 
accrual of interest.
    (f) To encourage the repayment of delinquent fees, ONDCP shall use 
the procedures described in the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 
3716-3719, including the use of collection agencies and disclosure to 
consumer reporting agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.12  Waiver of fees.

    (a) Records shall be furnished without charge, or at a reduced 
charge, upon a determination by the General Counsel of ONDCP that:
    (1) Waiver or reduction of the fees is in the public interest 
because release of the requested information is likely to contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of 
ONDCP and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; 
or
    (2) Assessment of fees is not feasible.
    (b) Upon written request, a written explanation will be provided as 
to why

[[Page 269]]

a request for waiver or reduction of FOIA fees was not granted.
    (c) There is no right to an administrative appeal from a decision 
not to waive or reduce fees.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.13  Aggregation of requests.

    (a) When the General Counsel reasonably believes that a requester, 
or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break down 
a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the 
assessment of fees, such requests may be aggregated and fees may be 
charged accordingly.
    (b) In determining whether a series of requests shall be aggregated, 
the General Counsel will consider two factors: whether the requests 
concern a single subject or two or more closely related subjects; and 
whether the requests were all made within a 30-day period. If a series 
of requests is made by multiple requesters, the General Counsel will 
also consider whether there is substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion that the requesters are acting in concert.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.14  Records that are exempt from disclosure.

    (a) Records described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) are exempt from disclosure 
under FOIA. These include the following categories of records:
    (1) Records that are specifically authorized under criteria 
established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of 
national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified 
pursuant to such Executive order;
    (2) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and 
practices of an agency;
    (3) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other 
than 5 U.S.C. 552b), provided that such statute:
    (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or
    (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Records of trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than in litigation with the 
agency;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy; and
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings,
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication,
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source including a state, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal 
law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or 
by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence 
investigation, information furnished by a confidential source,
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.


<R05>
Sec. 1401.15  Deletion of exempted information.

    When requested records contain matters that are exempted under 5 
U.S.C. 552(b), but such exempted matters are reasonably segregable from 
the remainder of the records, the records shall be disclosed by ONDCP 
with the necessary deletions. ONDCP shall attach to each such record a 
written

[[Page 270]]

justification for making the deletion or deletions. A single such 
justification shall suffice for deletions made in a group of similar or 
related records.

<R05>
Sec. 1402.1  Purpose.

    Other government agencies, U.S. citizens or permanent resident 
aliens may request that classified information in files of the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) be reviewed for possible 
declassification and release. This part prescribes the procedures for 
such review and subsequent release or denial.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.2  Responsibility.

    All requests for the mandatory declassification review of classified 
information in ONDCP files should be addressed to the Security Officer, 
Office of National Drug Control Policy, Executive Office of the 
President, Washington, DC 20500, who will acknowledge receipt of the 
request. When a request does not reasonably describe the information 
sought, the requester shall be notified that unless additional 
information is provided, or the scope of the request is narrowed, no 
further action will be taken.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.3  Information in the custody of ONDCP.

    Information contained in ONDCP files and under the exclusive 
declassification jurisdiction of ONDCP will be reviewed by the Director 
of the Office of Planning, Budget, and Administration of ONDCP and/or 
the office of primary interest to determine whether, under the 
declassification provisions of section 3.1 of Executive Order 12356 (3 
CFR, 1982 Comp., p. 166), the requested information may be declassified. 
If the information may not be released, in whole or in part, the 
requester shall be given a brief statement as to the reasons for denial, 
a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the Director of 
ONDCP, and a notice that such an appeal must be filed within 60 days in 
order to be considered.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.4  Information classified by another agency.

    When a request is received for information that was classified by 
another agency, the Director of the Office of Planning, Budget, and 
Administration of ONDCP will forward the request and a copy of the 
document(s) along with any other related materials, to the appropriate 
agency for review and determination as to release. Recommendations as to 
release or denial may be made if appropriate. The requester will be 
notified of the referral, unless the receiving agency objects on the 
grounds that its association with the information requires protection.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.5  Appeal procedure.

    Appeals reviewed as a result of a denial will be routed to the 
Director of ONDCP, who will take action as necessary to determine 
whether any part of the information may be declassified. If so, the 
Director shall notify the requester of this determination and shall make 
any information available that is declassified and is otherwise 
releasable. If continued classification is required, the requester shall 
be notified by the Director of ONDCP of the reasons therefore.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.6  Fees.

    There will normally be no fees charged for the mandatory review of 
classified material for declassification under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1402.7  Suggestions and complaints.

    Suggestions and complaints regarding the information security 
program of ONDCP should be submitted, in writing, to the Security

Sec. 1403.2  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains general rules pertaining to this part and 
procedures for control of exceptions from this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for:
    (1) Goods and other tangible property received;
    (2) Services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees; and
    (3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current 
services or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance 
claims, and other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of:
    (1) Earnings during a given period from services performed by the 
grantee and goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers, 
and
    (2) Amounts becoming owed to the grantee for which no current 
services or performance is required by the grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation,

[[Page 272]]

taxes, duty or protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or 
excluded from the unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's 
regular accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from ``programmatic'' 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means:
    (1) With respect to a grant, the Federal agency, and
    (2) With respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash contributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for ``grant'' and 
``subgrant'' in this section and except where qualified by ``Federal'') 
a procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a 
procurement subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means:
    (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269 ``Financial Status 
Report'' (or other equivalent report);
    (2) For construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 
Stat. 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for 
the special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received,

[[Page 273]]

and similar transactions during a given period that will require payment 
by the grantee during the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) means charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and service, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of in-kind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
     Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of ``grant'' in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than 
``equipment'' as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either
    (1) Temporary withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds 
pending corrective action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to 
terminate the grant, or
    (2) In action taken by a suspending official in accordance with 
agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. ``Termination'' does not include:
    (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's 
underestimate of the unobligated balance in a prior period;
    (2) Withdrawal of the unobligated balance as of the expiration of a 
grant;
    (3) Refusal to extend a grant or award additional funds, to make a 
competing or noncompeting continuation,

[[Page 274]]

renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or
    (4) Voiding of a grant upon determination that the award was 
obtained fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from 
inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

<R04>
                    Subpart B--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1403.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive Order.

[[Page 276]]

    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the States will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its 
effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of 
the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grantee or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals;
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions; and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 1403.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expend and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.

[[Page 277]]

    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information 
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as canceled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time 
and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible the 
grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the

[[Page 278]]

awarding agency may provide cash or a working capital advance basis. 
Under this procedure the awarding agency shall advance cash to the 
grantee to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period 
generally geared to the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the 
awarding agency shall reimburse the grantee for its actual cash 
disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not 
be used by grantees or subgrantees if the reason for using such method 
is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide timely 
advances to the subgrantee to meet the subgrantee's actual cash 
disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash 
payments for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless----
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 1403.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 1403.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.
    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal cost-sharing 
requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind 
contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of another 
Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any other 
award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 1403.25, shall not count towards satisfying a 
cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted 
in the terms of the assistant agreement. (This use of general program 
income is described in Sec. 1403.25(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay

[[Page 280]]

for them, the payments would be allowable costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:
    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind

[[Page 281]]

contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs incurred by the 
grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and allocated (usually as 
indirect costs) in accordance with the cost principles specified in 
Sec. 1403.22, in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for 
purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation or use 
allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based on the 
property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donates real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal 
funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement 
will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use of rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc., and interest earned 
on any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments levies, fines, 
and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 1403.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1403.31 and 
Sec. 1403.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal

[[Page 282]]

agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, 
see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or 
the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 (31 
U.S.C. 7501-7) and Federal agency implementing regulations. The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial and compliance 
audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act, that receive Federal 
financial assistance and provide $25,000 or more of it in a fiscal year 
to a subgrantee shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Requirements for Grants and Other Agreements with 
Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Nonprofit 
Organizations'' have met the audit requirement. Commercial contractors 
(private for profit and private and governmental organizations) 
providing goods and services to State and local governments are not 
required to have a single audit performed. State and local governments 
should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has 
complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal 
funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 1403.36 
shall be followed.

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 1403.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 1403.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types 
of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants 
and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:

[[Page 283]]

    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from 
nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 1403.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, 
supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget format the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1403.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for those purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the

[[Page 284]]

awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the 
original purchase to the fair market value of the property. However, in 
those situations were a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real 
property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement real 
property under the same program, the net proceeds from the disposition 
may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 1403.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the

[[Page 285]]

property. Any loss, damage, or theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 1403.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive

[[Page 286]]

Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension.''


<R05>
Sec. 1403.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) of this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail

[[Page 287]]

the significant history of a procurement. These records will include, 
but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for the 
method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection 
or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 1403.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be

[[Page 288]]

avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed. (1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 1403.36(d)(2)(i) 
apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and

[[Page 289]]

    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though 
A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of

[[Page 290]]

the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and 
in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and 
reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the complexity of the 
work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's 
investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of 
past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding 
geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1403.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
constructing cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:

[[Page 291]]

    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)

    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or 
requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.

Sec. 1403.37  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow state law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 1403.42 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part 
do not apply to the award and administration of subgrants:
    (1) Section 1403.10;
    (2) Section 1403.11;

    (4) Section 1403.50.

              Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 1403.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output

[[Page 293]]

may be required if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decision making purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or

[[Page 294]]

269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds for all 
nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required in 
accordance with paragraph Sec. 1403.41(e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through an analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter of credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 1403.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs--(1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method. (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction 
grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, 
however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, 
specified in Sec. 1403.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 1403.41(b)(3).

[[Page 295]]

    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance. (i) When a 
construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays 
to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will 
provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and due 
date shall be governed by Sec. 1403.41(b) (3) and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 1403.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 1403.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 1403.41(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1403.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this Part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 1403.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantees.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any

[[Page 296]]

similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group 
of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or 
composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records. Unless 
required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are 
not required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to Debarment and Suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from

[[Page 297]]

being subject to ``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see 
Sec. 1403.35).


<R05>
Sec. 1403.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 1403.43 awards may be terminated in whole 
or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 1403.43 
or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                 Subpart D--After-The-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1403.50  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this time frame. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report: In accordance with 
Sec. 1403.32(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of all federally 
owned property (as distinct from property acquired with grant funds) for 
which it is accountable and request disposition instructions from the 
Federal agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.51  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 1403.42;
    (d) Property management requirements in Sec. 1403.31 and 
Sec. 1403.32; and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 1403.26.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.52  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursement,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal

[[Page 298]]

agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date from which 
interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any 
form of appeal.

                   Subpart E--Entitlement  [Reserved]

Appendix A to Part 1403--OMB Circular A-128, ``Audits of State and Local 
                              Governments''

Circular No. A-128
April 12, 1985.

To the Heads of Executive Departments and Establishments
Subject: Audits of State and Local Governments.

    1. Purpose. This Circular is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act 
of 1984, Pub. L. 98-502. It establishes audit requirements for State and 
local governments that receive Federal aid, and defines Federal 
responsibilities for implementing and monitoring those requirements.
    2. Supersession. The Circular supersedes Attachment P, ``Audit 
Requirements,'' of Circular A-102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to 
State and local governments.''
    3. Background. The Single Audit Act builds upon earlier efforts to 
improve audits of Federal aid programs. The Act requires State or local 
governments that receive $100,000 or more a year in Federal funds to 
have an audit made for that year. Section 7505 of the Act requires the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prescribe policies, 
procedures and guidelines to implement the Act. It specifies that the 
Director shall designate ``cognizant'' Federal agencies, determine 
criteria for making appropriate charges to federal programs for the cost 
of audits, and provide procedures to assure that small firms or firms 
owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals have the opportunity 
to participate in contracts for single audits.
    4. Policy. The Single Audit Act requires the following:
    a. State or local governments that receive $100,000 or more a year 
in Federal financial assistance shall have an audit made in accordance 
with this Circular.
    b. State or local governments that receive between $25,000 and 
$100,000 a year shall have an audit made in accordance with this 
Circular, or in accordance with Federal laws and regulations governing 
the programs they participate in.
    c. State or local governments that receive less than $25,000 a year 
shall be exempt from compliance with the Act and other Federal audit 
requirements. These State and local governments shall be governed by 
audit requirements prescribed by State or local law or regulation.
    d. Nothing in this paragraph exempts State or local governments from 
maintaining records of Federal financial assistance or from providing 
access to such records to Federal agencies, as provided for in Federal 
law or in Circular A-102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to state or 
local governments.''
    5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Circular the following 
definitions from the Single Audit Act apply:
    a. Cognizant agency means the Federal agency assigned by the Office 
of Management and Budget to carry out the responsibilities described in 
paragraph 11 of this Circular.
    b. Federal financial assistance means assistance provided by a 
Federal agency in the form of grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, 
loans, loan guarantees, property, interest subsidies, insurance, or 
direct appropriations, but does not include direct Federal cash 
assistance to individuals. It includes awards received directly from 
Federal agencies, or indirectly through other units of States and local 
governments.
    c. Federal agency has the same meaning as the term ``agency'' in 
section 551(1) of Title 5, United States Code.
    d. Generally accepted accounting principles has the meaning 
specified in the generally accepted government auditing standards.
    e. Generally accepted government auditing standards means the 
Standards For Audit of Government Organizations, Programs, Activities, 
and Functions, developed by the Comptroller General, dated February 27, 
1981.
    f. Independent auditor means:
    (1) A State or local government auditor who meets the independence 
standards specified in generally accepted government auditing standards; 
or
    (2) A public accountant who meets such independence standards.
    g. Internal controls means the plan of organization and methods and 
procedures adopted by management to ensure that:
    (1) Resource use is consistent with laws, regulations, and policies;
    (2) Resources are safeguarded against waste, loss, and misuse; and
    (3) Reliable data are obtained, maintained, and fairly disclosed in 
reports.
    h. Indian tribe means any Indian tribe, band, nations, or other 
organized group or community, including any Alaskan Native village or 
regional or village corporations (as defined in, or established under, 
the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act) that is recognized by the 
United States as eligible for the special programs and services provided 
by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.

[[Page 299]]

    i. Local government means any unit of local government within a 
State, including a county, a borough, municipality, city, town, 
township, parish, local public authority, special district, school 
district, intrastate district, council of government, and any other 
instrumentality of local government.
    j. Major Federal Assistance Program, as defined by Pub. L. 98-502, 
is described in the Attachment to this Circular.
    k. Public accountants means those individuals who meet the 
qualification standards included in generally accepted government 
auditing standards for personnel performing government audits.
    l. State means any State of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, 
American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and 
the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, any instrumentality thereof, 
and any multi-State, regional, or interstate entity that has 
governmental functions and any Indian tribe.
    m. Subrecipient means any person or government department, agency, 
or establishment that receives Federal financial assistance to carry out 
a program through a State or local government, but does not include an 
individual that is a beneficiary of such a program. A subrecipient may 
also be a direct recipient of Federal financial assistance.
    6. Scope of audit. The Single Act provides that:
    a. The audit shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance 
with generally accepted government auditing standards covering financial 
and compliance audits.
    b. The audit shall cover the entire operations of a State or local 
government or, at the option of that government, it may cover 
departments, agencies or establishments that received, expended, or 
otherwise administered Federal financial assistance during the year. 
However, if a State or local government receives $25,000 or more in 
General Revenue Sharing Funds in a fiscal year, it shall have an audit 
of its entire operations. A series of audits of individual departments, 
agencies, and establishments for the same fiscal year may be considered 
a single audit.
    c. Public hospitals and public colleges and universities may be 
excluded from State and local audits and the requirements of this 
Circular. However, if such entities are excluded, audits of these 
entities shall be made in accordance with statutory requirements and the 
provisions of Circular A-110, ``Uniform requirements for grants to 
universities, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations.''
    d. The auditor shall determine whether:
    (1) The financial statements of the government, department, agency 
or establishment present fairly its financial position and the results 
of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles;
    (2) The organization has internal accounting and other control 
systems to provide reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal 
financial assistance programs in compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations; and
    (3) The organization has complied with laws and regulations that may 
have material effect on its financial statements and on each major 
Federal assistance program.
    7. Frequency of audit. Audits shall be made annually unless the 
State or local government has, by January 1, 1987, a constitutional or 
statutory requirement for less frequent audits. For those governments, 
the cognizant agency shall permit biennial audits, covering both years, 
if the government so requests. It shall also honor requests for biennial 
audits by governments that have an administrative policy calling for 
audits less frequent than annual, but only for fiscal years beginning 
before January 1, 1987.
    8. Internal control and compliance reviews. The Single Audit Act 
requires that the independent auditor determine and report on whether 
the organization has internal control systems to provide reasonable 
assurance that it is managing Federal assistance programs in compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations.
    a. Internal control review. In order to provide this assurance the 
auditor must make a study and evaluation of internal control systems 
used in administering Federal assistance programs. The study and 
evaluation must be made whether or not the auditor intends to place 
reliance on such systems. As part of this review, the auditor shall:
    (1) Test whether these internal control systems are functioning in 
accordance with prescribed procedures.
    (2) Examine the recipient's system for monitoring subrecipients and 
obtaining and acting on subrecipient audit reports.
    b. Compliance review. The law also requires the auditor to determine 
whether the organization has complied with laws and regulations that may 
have a material effect on each major Federal assistance program.
    (1) In order to determine which major programs are to be tested for 
compliance, State and local governments shall identify in their accounts 
all Federal funds received and expended and the programs under which 
they were received. This shall include funds received directly from 
Federal agencies and through other State and local governments.
    (2) The review must include the selection and testing of a 
representative number of charges from each major Federal assistance 
program. The selection and testing of transactions shall be based on the 
auditor's professional judgment considering such factors as the amount 
of expenditures for the program and the individual awards; the newness

[[Page 300]]

of the program or changes in its conditions; prior experience with the 
program, particularly as revealed in audits and other evaluations (e.g., 
inspections program reviews); the extent to which the program is carried 
out through subrecipients; the extent to which the program contracts for 
goods or services; the level to which the program is already subject to 
program reviews or other forms of independent oversight; the adequacy of 
the controls for ensuring compliance; the exception of adherence or lack 
of adherence to the applicable laws and regulations; and the potential 
impact of adverse findings.
    (a) In making the test of transactions, the auditor shall determine 
whether:

--The amounts reported as expenditures were for allowable services, and
--The records show that those who received services or benefits were 
eligible to receive them.

    (b) In addition to transaction testing, the auditor shall determine 
whether:

--Matching requirements, levels of effort and earmarking limitations 
were met,
--Federal financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements 
contain information that is supported by the books and records from 
which the basic financial statements have been prepared, and
--Amounts claimed or used for matching were determined in accordance 
with OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost principles for State and local 
governments,'' and Attachment F of Circular A-102, ``Uniform 
requirements for grants to State and local governments.''

    (c) The principal compliance requirements of the largest Federal aid 
programs may be ascertained by referring to the Compliance Supplement 
for Single Audits of State and Local Governments, issued by OMB and 
available from the Government Printing Office. For those programs not 
covered in the Compliance Supplement, the auditor may ascertain 
compliance requirements by researching the statutes, regulations, and 
agreements governing individual programs.
    (3) Transactions related to other Federal assistance programs that 
are selected in connection with examinations of financial statements and 
evaluations of internal controls shall be tested for compliance with 
Federal laws and regulations that apply to such transactions.
    9. Subrecipients. State or local governments that receive Federal 
financial assistance and provide $25,000 or more of it in a fiscal year 
to a subrecipient shall:
    a. Determine whether State or local subrecipients have met the audit 
requirements of this Circular and whether subrecipients covered by 
Circular A-110, ``Uniform requirements for grants to universities, 
hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations,'' have met that 
requirement;
    b. Determine whether the subrecipient spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subrecipient made in 
accordance with this Circular, Circular A-110, or through other means 
(e.g., program reviews) if the subrecipient has not yet had such an 
audit;
    c. Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instances of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    d. Consider whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of 
the recipient's own records; and
    e. Require each subrecipient to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements as necessary to comply 
with this Circular.
    10. Relation to other audit requirements. The Single Audit Act 
provides that an audit made in accordance with this Circular shall be in 
lieu of any financial or financial compliance audit required under 
individual Federal assistance programs. To the extent that a single 
audit provides Federal agencies with information and assurances they 
need to carry out their overall responsibilities, they shall rely upon 
and use such information. However, a Federal agency shall make any 
additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities 
under Federal law and regulation. Any additional Federal audit effort 
shall be planned and carried out in such a way as to avoid duplication.
    a. The provisions of this Circular do not limit the authority of 
Federal agencies to make, or contract for audits and evaluations of 
Federal financial assistance programs, nor do they limit the authority 
of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal audit official.
    b. The provisions of this Circular do not authorize any State or 
local government or subrecipient thereof to constrain Federal agencies, 
in any manner, from carrying out additional audits.
    c. A Federal agency that makes or contracts for audits in addition 
to the audits made by recipients pursuant to this Circular shall, 
consistent with other applicable laws and regulations, arrange for 
funding the cost of such additional audits. Such additional audits 
include economy and efficiency audits, program results audits, and 
program evaluations.
    11. Cognizant agency responsibilities. The Single Audit Act provides 
for cognizant Federal agencies to oversee the implementation of this 
Circular.
    a. The Office of Management and Budget will assign cognizant 
agencies for States and their subdivisions and larger local governments 
and their subdivisions. Other Federal agencies may participate with an 
assigned

[[Page 301]]

cognizant agency, in order to fulfill the cognizance responsibilities. 
Smaller governments not assigned a cognizant agency will be under the 
general oversight of the Federal agency that provides them the most 
funds whether directly or indirectly.
    b. A cognizant agency shall have the following responsibilities:
    (1) Ensure that audits are made and reports are received in a timely 
manner and in accordance with the requirements of this Circular.
    (2) Provide technical advice and liaison to State and local 
governments and independent auditors.
    (3) Obtain or make quality control reviews of selected audits made 
by non-Federal audit organizations, and provide the results, when 
appropriate, to other interested organizations.
    (4) Promptly inform other affected Federal agencies and appropriate 
Federal law enforcement officials of any reported illegal acts or 
irregularities. They should also inform State or local law enforcement 
and prosecuting authorities, if not advised by the recipient, of any 
violation of law within their jurisdiction.
    (5) Advise the recipient of audits that have been found not to have 
met the requirements set forth in this Circular. In such instances, the 
recipient will be expected to work with the auditor to take corrective 
action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency shall 
notify the recipient and Federal awarding agencies of the facts and make 
recommendations for followup action. Major inadequacies or repetitive 
substandard performance of independent auditors shall be referred to 
appropriate professional bodies for disciplinary action.
    (6) Coordinate, to the extent practicable, audits made by or for 
Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to 
this Circular; so that the additional audits build upon such audits.
    (7) Oversee the resolution of audit findings that affect the 
programs of more than one agency.
    12. Illegal acts or irregularities. If the auditor becomes aware of 
illegal acts or other irregularities, prompt notice shall be given to 
recipient management officials above the level of involvement. (See also 
paragraph 13(a)(3) below for the auditor's reporting responsibilities.) 
The recipient, in turn, shall promptly notify the cognizant agency of 
the illegal acts or irregularities and of proposed and actual actions, 
if any. Illegal acts and irregularities include such matters as 
conflicts of interest, falsification of records or reports, and 
misappropriations of funds or other assets.
    13. Audit reports. Audit reports must be prepared at the completion 
of the audit. Reports serve many needs of State and local governments as 
well as meeting the requirements of the Single Audit Act.
    a. The audit report shall state that the audit was made in 
accordance with the provisions of this Circular. The report shall be 
made up of at least:
    (1) The auditor's report on financial statements and on a schedule 
of Federal assistance; the financial statements; and a schedule of 
Federal assistance, showing the total expenditures for each Federal 
assistance program as identified in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance. Federal programs or grants that have not been assigned a 
catalog number shall be identified under the caption ``other Federal 
assistance.''
    (2) The auditor's report on the study and evaluation of internal 
control systems must identify the organization's significant internal 
accounting controls, and those controls designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that Federal programs are being managed in compliance with 
laws and regulations. It must also identify the controls that were 
evaluated, the controls that were not evaluated, and the material 
weaknesses identified as a result of the evaluation.
    (3) The auditor's report on compliance containing:

--A statement of positive assurance with respect to those items tested 
for compliance, including compliance with law and regulations pertaining 
to financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements;
--Negative assurance on those items not tested;
--A summary of all instances of noncompliance; and
--An identification of total amounts questioned, if any, for each 
Federal assistance award, as a result of noncompliance.

    b. The three parts of the audit report may be bound into a single 
report, or presented at the same time as separate documents.
    c. All fraud abuse, or illegal acts or indications of such acts, 
including all questioned costs found as the result of these acts that 
auditors become aware of, should normally be covered in a separate 
written report submitted in accordance with paragraph 13f.
    d. In addition to the audit report, the recipient shall provide 
comments on the findings and recommendations in the report, including a 
plan for corrective action taken or planned and comments on the status 
of corrective action taken on prior findings. If corrective action is 
not necessary, a statement describing the reason it is not should 
accompany the audit report.
    e. The reports shall be made available by the State or local 
government for public inspection within 30 days after the completion of 
the audit.
    f. In accordance with generally accepted government audit standards, 
reports shall be submitted by the auditor to the organization audited 
and to those requiring or arranging

[[Page 302]]

for the audit. In addition, the recipient shall submit copies of the 
reports to each Federal department or agency that provided Federal 
assistance funds to the recipient. Subrecipients shall submit copies to 
recipients that provided them Federal assistance funds. The reports 
shall be sent within 30 days after the completion of the audit, but no 
later than one year after the end of the audit period unless a longer 
period is agreed to with the cognizant agency.
    g. Recipients of more than $100,000 in Federal funds shall submit 
one copy of the audit report within 30 days after issuance to a central 
clearinghouse to be designated by the Office of Management and Budget. 
The clearinghouse will keep completed audits on file and follow up with 
State and local governments that have not submitted required audit 
reports.
    h. Recipients shall keep audit reports on file for three years from 
their issuance.
    14. Audit Resolution. As provided in paragraph 11, the cognizant 
agency shall be responsible for monitoring the resolution of audit 
findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency. 
Resolution of findings that relate to the programs of a single Federal 
agency will be the responsibility of the recipient and that agency. 
Alternate arrangements may be made on a case-by-case basis by agreement 
among the agencies concerned.
    Resolution shall be made within six months after receipt of the 
report by the Federal departments and agencies. Corrective action should 
proceed as rapidly as possible.
    15. Audit workpapers and reports. Workpapers and reports shall be 
retained for a minimum of three years from the date of the audit report, 
unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency to 
extend the retention period. Audit workpapers shall be made available 
upon request to the cognizant agency or its designee or the General 
Accounting Office, at the completion of the audit.
    16. Audit Costs. The cost of audits made in accordance with the 
provisions of this Circular are allowable charges to Federal assistance 
programs.
    a. The charges may be considered a direct cost or an allocated 
indirect cost, determined in accordance with the provision of Circular 
A-87, ``Cost principles for State and local governments.''
    b. Generally, the percentage of costs charged to Federal assistance 
programs for a single audit shall not exceed the percentage that Federal 
funds expended represent of total funds expended by the recipient during 
the fiscal year. The percentage may be exceeded, however, if appropriate 
documentation demonstrates higher actual cost.
    17. Sanctions. The Single Audit Act provides that no cost may be 
charged to Federal assistance programs for audits required by the Act 
that are not made in accordance with this Circular. In cases of 
continued inability or unwillingness to have a proper audit, Federal 
agencies must consider other appropriate sanctions including:

--Withhodling a percentage of assistance payments until the audit is 
completed satisfactorily,
--Withholding or disallowing overhead costs, and
--Suspending the Federal assistance agreement until the audit is made.

    18. Auditor Selection. In arranging for audit services State and 
local governments shall follow the procurement standards prescribed by 
Attachment O of Circular A-102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to 
State and local governments.'' The standards provide that while 
recipients are encouraged to enter into intergovernmental agreements for 
audit and other services, analysis should be made to determine whether 
it would be more economical to purchase the services from private firms. 
In instances where use of such intergovernmental agreements are required 
by State statutes (e.g., audit services) these statutes will take 
precedence.
    19. Small and Minority Audit Firms. Small audit firms and audit 
firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals shall have the maximum practicable opportunity to 
participate in contracts awarded to fulfill the requirements of this 
Circular. Recipients of Federal assistance shall take the following 
steps to further this goal:
    a. Assure that small audit firms and audit firms owned and 
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals are 
used to the fullest extent practicable.
    b. Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and 
arrange time frames for the audit so as to encourage and facilitate 
participation by small audit firms and audit firms owned and controlled 
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
    c. Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for 
larger audits intend to subcontract with small audit firms and audit 
firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals.
    d. Encourage contracting with small audit firms or audit firms owned 
and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals 
which have traditionally audited government programs and, in such cases 
where this is not possible, assure that these firms are given 
consideration for audit subcontracting opportunities.
    e. Encourage contracting with consortiums of small audit firms as 
described in paragraph (a) above when a contract is too large for an 
individual small audit firm or audit firm owned and controlled by 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

[[Page 303]]

    f. Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such 
organizations as the Small Business Administration in the solicitation 
and utilization of small audit firms or audit firms owned and controlled 
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
    20. Reporting. Each Federal agency will report to the Director of 
OMB on or before March 1, 1987, and annually thereafter on the 
effectiveness of State and local governments in carrying out the 
provisions of this Circular. The report must identify each State or 
local government or Indian tribe that, in the opinion of the agency, is 
failing to comply with Circular.
    21. Regulations. Each Federal agency shall include the provisions of 
this Circular in its regulations implementing the Single Audit Act.
    22. Effective date. This Circular is effective upon publication and 
shall apply to fiscal years of State and local governments that begin 
after December 31, 1984. Earlier implementation is encouraged. However, 
until it is implemented, the audit provisions of Attachment P to 
Circular A-102 shall continue to be observed.
    23. Inquiries. All questions or inquiries should be addressed to 
Financial Management Division, Office of Management and Budget, 
telephone number (202) 395-3993.
    24. Sunset review date. This Circular shall have an independent 
policy review to ascertain its effectiveness three years from the date 
of issuance.

    Director.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 1404.100  Purpose.

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal 
financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal 
programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a 
program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:
    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;
    (2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide 
minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;
    (3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended 
participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of 
``ineligible'' in Sec. 1404.105), and participants who have voluntarily 
excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which 
governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe 
policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

[60 FR 33040, 33045, June 26, 1995]

<R05>
Sec. 1404.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered 
transactions.''
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: Grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or 
exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 
U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary 
covered transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.

[[Page 307]]

    (2) Providers of federally-required audit services.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 1404.200, ``Debarment 
or suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or 
suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to 
participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities 
described in Sec. 1404.110(a). Sections Sec. 1404.325, ``Scope of 
debarment,'' and Sec. 1404.420, ``Scope of suspension,'' govern the 
extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a 
participant would be automatically included within a debarment or 
suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons 
associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of 
the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.

[57 FR 56263, Nov. 27, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 33041, 33045, June 26, 
1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1404.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or 
suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in these regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.


<R04>
                       Subpart B--Effect of Action


<R05>
Sec. 1404.200  Debarment or suspension.

    (a) Primary covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited by 
law, persons who are debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
primary covered transactions as either participants or principals 
throughout the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for the period 
of their debarment, suspension, or the period they are proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9,

[[Page 308]]

subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall enter into primary covered 
transactions with such excluded persons during such period, except as 
permitted pursuant to Sec. 1404.215.
    (b) Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited 
by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 
9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier 
covered transactions (see Sec. 1404.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of 
their exclusion.
    (c) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's 
eligibility for--
    (1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and 
entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or 
foreign governmental entities;
    (3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (4) Federal employment;
    (5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (7) Other transactions where the application of these regulations

contact the original action agency to ascertain the extent of the 
exclusion.

Sec. 1404.215  Exception provision.

    [Agency] may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an 
authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the 
Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549 and 
Sec. 1404.200. However, in accordance with the President's stated 
intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only 
infrequently. Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with 
Sec. 1404.505(a).

<R05>
Sec. 1404.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or 
voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and 
participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time 
the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A 
decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken 
should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the 
proposed action.
    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in 
Sec. 1404.215.

Sec. 1404.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 1404.215 or Sec. 1404.220, a 
participant

[[Page 309]]

shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction with a 
person who is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.
    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction (See appendix B of these regulations), unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of 
proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that 
filed an erroneous certification.

                          Subpart C--Debarment


<R05>
Sec. 1404.300  General.

    The debarring official may debar a person for any of the causes in 
Sec. 1404.305, using procedures established in Sec. 1404.310 through 
Sec. 1404.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not 
necessarily require that the person be debarred; the seriousness of the 
person's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors shall be 
considered in making any debarment decision.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.305  Causes for debarment.

    Debarment may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1404.300 through Sec. 1404.314 for:

integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the 
present responsibility of a person.

serious as to affect the integrity of an agency program, such as:
    (1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one

    (2) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance 
of one or more public agreements or transactions; or
    (3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or

    (c) Any of the following causes:
    (1) A nonprocurement debarment by any Federal agency taken before 
October 1, 1988, or a procurement debarment by any Federal agency taken 
pursuant to 48 CFR subpart 9.4;
    (2) Knowingly doing business with a debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
or voluntarily excluded person, in connection with a covered 
transaction, except as permitted in Sec. 1404.215 or Sec. 1404.220;
    (3) Failure to pay a single substantial debt, or a number of 
outstanding debts (including disallowed costs and overpayments, but not 
including sums owed the Federal Government under the Internal Revenue 
Code) owed to any Federal agency or instrumentality, provided the debt 
is uncontested by the debtor or, if contested, provided that the 
debtor's legal and administrative remedies have been exhausted;
    (4) Violation of a material provision of a voluntary exclusion 
agreement entered into under Sec. 1404.315 or of any settlement of a 
debarment or suspension action; or

to providing a drug-free workplace, as set forth in Sec. 1404.615 of 
this part.
    (d) Any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it 
affects the present responsibility of a person.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.310  Procedures.

    ONDCP shall process debarment actions as informally as practicable, 
consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the 
procedures in Sec. 1404.311 through Sec. 1404.314.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 1404.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Sec. 1404.311 through Sec. 1404.314, and 
any other ONDCP procedures, if applicable, governing debarment decision 
making; and
    (e) Of the potential effect of a debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) In 
actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring 
official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good 
cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c) (1) Standard of proof. In any debarment action, the cause for 
debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where 
the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
standard shall be deemed to have been met.

[[Page 311]]

    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and
    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government 
unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination 
referred to in Sec. 1404.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.315  Settlement and voluntary exclusion.

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, ONDCP may, at any 
time, settle a debarment or suspension action.
    (b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion 
of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the 
Nonprocurement List (see Subpart E of this part).


<R05>
Sec. 1404.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the causes(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the 
suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment 
period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of Subpart F of this part generally should not exceed 
three years. When circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment 
may be imposed.
    (2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirement of 
Subpart F of this part (see Sec. 1404.305.(c)(5)), the period of 
debarment shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Sec. 1404.311 through Sec. 1404.314 shall be followed to extend the 
debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but 
not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Sec. 1404.311 through 
Sec. 1404.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or

[[Page 312]]

other individual associated with a participant may be imputed to the 
participant when the conduct occurred in connection with the 
individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the participant, 
or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The 
participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall 
be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a 
participant may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant 
who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the participant's 
conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement may be imputed 
to other participants if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the 
joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint application, or similar 
arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these 
participants. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall 
be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.


<R04>
                          Subpart D--Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 1404.400  General.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the 
causes in Sec. 1404.405 using procedures established in Sec. 1404.410 
through Sec. 1404.413.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 1404.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1404.400 through Sec. 1404.413 upon adequate evidence:
    (1) To suspect the commission of an offense listed in 
Sec. 1404.305(a); or
    (2) That a cause for debarment under Sec. 1404.305 may exist.
    (b) Indictment shall constitute adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.410  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information concerning the existence 
of a cause for suspension from any source shall be promptly reported, 
investigated, and referred, when appropriate, to the suspending official 
for consideration. After consideration, the suspending official may 
issue a notice of suspension.
    (b) Decision making process. ONDCP shall process suspension actions 
as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness, using the procedures in Sec. 1404.411 through Sec. 1404.413.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.411  Notice of suspension.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's 
evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 1404.405 for imposing 
suspension;

[[Page 313]]

    (e) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings;
    (f) Of the provisions of Sec. 1404.411 through Sec. 1404.413 and any 
other ONDCP procedures, if applicable, governing suspension decision 
making; and
    (g) Of the effect of the suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.412  Opportunity to contest suspension.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of suspension, the respondent may submit, in person, in writing, 
or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to 
the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) If the 
suspending official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the 
suspension would be prejudiced.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent, upon request, 
unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.413  Suspending official's decision.

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 1404.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or 
scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to 
modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the 
subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by 
any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: based on an 
indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine 
dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to 
determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a 
decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision 
shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additoinal proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.415  Period of suspension.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings, unless terminated sooner by the 
suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 
12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall 
be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States 
Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be 
extended for an additional six

[[Page 314]]

months. In no event may a suspension extend beyond 18 months, unless 
such proceedings have been initiated within that period.
    (c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice 
of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 
12-month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to 
request an extension.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.420  Scope of suspension.

    The scope of a suspension is the same as the scope of a debarment 
(see Sec. 1404.325), except that the procedures of Sec. 1404.410 through 
Sec. 1404.413 shall be used in imposing a suspension.


<R04>
       Subpart E--Responsibilities of GSA, Agency and Participants


<R05>
Sec. 1404.500  GSA responsibilities.

    (a) In accordance with the OMB guidelines, GSA shall compile, 
maintain, and distribute a list of all persons who have been debarred, 
suspended, or voluntarily excluded by agencies under Executive Order 
12549 and these regulations, and those who have been determined to be 
ineligible.
    (b) At a minimum, this list shall indicate:
    (1) The names and addresses of all debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
and voluntarily excluded persons, in alphabetical order, with cross-
references when more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;
    (3) The cause for the action;
    (4) The scope of the action;
    (5) Any termination date for each listing; and
    (6) The agency and name and telephone number of the agency point of 
contact for the action.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.505  ONDCP responsibilities.

    (a) The agency shall provide GSA with current information concerning 
debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary 
exclusions it has taken.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency 
shall advise GSA of the information set forth in Sec. 1404.500(b) and of 
the exceptions granted under Sec. 1404.215 within five working days 
after taking such actions.
    (c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed persons to 
the agency that took the action.
    (d) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
entering covered transactions to determine whether a participant in a 
primary transaction is debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded (Tel. ).
    (e) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
approving principals or lower tier participants where agency approval of 
the principal or lower tier participant is required under the terms of 
the transaction, to determine whether such principals or participants 
are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in Appendix A to this 
Part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its 
principals. Adverse information on the certification will not 
necessarily result in denial of participation. However, the 
certification, and any additional information pertaining to the 
certification submitted by the participant, shall be considered in the 
administration of covered transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in Appendix B to 
this Part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.

[[Page 315]]

    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded from the covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the 
method and frequency by which they determine the eligibility of their 
principals. In addition, a participant may, but is not required to, 
check the Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants.
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to ONDCP if at any time the 
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. Participants 
in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same updated notice 
to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other 
official.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.630  Certification requirements and procedures.

    (a)(1) As a prior condition of being awarded a grant, each grantee 
shall make the appropriate certification to the Federal agency providing 
the grant, as provided in Appendix C to this part.
    (2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to 
continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or 
under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee 
shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-
automatic continuation of such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.
    (b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the 
required certification for each grant. For mandatory formula grants and 
entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a 
one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.
    (c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in 
each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this 
statewide certification in its Governor's office and, prior to grant 
award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect 
to each grant, unless the Federal agency had designated a central 
location for submission.
    (d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies 
from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with 
respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central 
location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, 
the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy 
statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 1404.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an 
employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute 
occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position

[[Page 318]]

title, to every grant officer, or other designee on whose grant activity 
the convicted employee was working, unless a Federal agency has 
designated a central point for the receipt of such notifications. 
Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the 
Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted:
    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar 
days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, 
unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt 
of such notices. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.

     and Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered Transactions

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is 
submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that 
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous 
by reason of changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in 
this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage 
sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may 
contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being 
submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.
    6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this 
proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, 
it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction 
with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the 
department or agency entering into this transaction.
    7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting 
this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification 
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-
Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency 
entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all 
lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier 
covered transactions.
    8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a 
certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered 
transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.

[[Page 319]]

    9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.
    10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this

  Appendix C to Part 1404--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file in its office and make the information available for Federal 
inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a 
violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);
    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal 
or State criminal drug statutes;
    Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal 
statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or 
possession of any controlled substance;
    Employee means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the 
performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All ``direct charge'' 
employees; (ii) all ``indirect charge'' employees unless their impact or 
involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) 
temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged in the 
performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's 
payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of 
the grantee (e.g., volunteers,

[[Page 321]]

even if used to meet a matching requirement; consultants or independent 
contractors not on the grantee's payroll; or employees of subrecipients 
or subcontractors in covered workplaces).

Alternate I. (Grantees Other Than Individuals)
    A. The grantee certifies that it will or will continue to provide a 
drug-free workplace by:

    (c) Making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the 
performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement required by

    (d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph 
(a) that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee 
will--
    (1) Abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later 
than five calendar days after such conviction;
    (e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after 
receiving notice under subparagraph (d)(2) from an employee or otherwise 
receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted 
employees must provide notice, including position title, to every grant

was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point 
for the receipt of such notices. Notice shall include the identification 
number(s) of each affected grant;

_______________________________________________________________________
Check {time}  if there are workplaces on file that are not identified 
here.
Alternate II. (Grantees Who Are Individuals)
    (a) The grantee certifies that, as a condition of the grant, he or 
she will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity with the grant;
    (b) If convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity, he or she 
will report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the 
conviction, to every grant officer or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency designates a central point for the receipt of such notices. When 
notice is made to such a central point, it shall include the 
identification number(s) of each affected grant.
