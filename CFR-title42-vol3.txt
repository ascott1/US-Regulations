                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R04>
               Subpart A--Introduction; General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 430.0  Program description.

    Title XIX of the Social Security Act, enacted in 1965, authorizes 
Federal grants to States for medical assistance to low-income persons 
who are age 65 or over, blind, disabled, or members of families with 
dependent children or qualified pregnant women or children. The program 
is jointly financed by the Federal and State governments and 
administered by States. Within broad Federal rules, each State decides 
eligible groups, types and range of services, payment levels for 
services, and administrative and operating procedures. Payments for 
services are made directly by the State to the individuals or entities 
that furnish the services.


<R05>
Sec. 430.1  Scope of subchapter C.

    The regulations in subchapter C set forth State plan requirements, 
standards, procedures, and conditions for obtaining Federal financial 
participation (FFP). Each part (or subpart of section) in the subchapter 
describes the specific statutory basis for the regulation. However, 
where the basis is the Secretary's general authority to issue 
regulations for any program under the Act (section 1102 of the Act), or 
his general authority to prescribe State plan requirements needed for 
proper and efficient administration of the plan (section 1902(a)(4)), 
those statutory provisions are simply cited without further description.

[[Page 6]]


<R05>
Sec. 430.2  Other applicable Federal regulations.

    Other regulations applicable to State Medicaid programs include the 
following:
    (a) 5 CFR part 900, subpart F, Administration of the Standards for a 
Merit System of Personnel Administration.
    (b) The following HHS Regulations in 45 CFR subtitle A:

Part 16--Procedures of the Departmental Appeals Board.
Part 74--Administration of Grants.
Part 80--Nondiscrimination Under Programs Receiving Federal Assistance 
Through the Department of Health and Human Services: Effectuation of 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Part 81--Practice and Procedure for Hearings Under 45 CFR part 80.
Part 84--Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in Programs and 
Activities Receiving or Benefiting From Federal Financial Assistance.
Part 95--General Administration--grant programs (public assistance and 
medical assistance).

[53 FR 36571, Sept. 21, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 8845, Mar. 1, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 430.3  Appeals under Medicaid.

    Three distinct types of disputes may arise under Medicaid.
    (a) Compliance with Federal requirements. Disputes that pertain to 
whether a State's plan or proposed plan amendments, or its practice 
under the plan meet or continue to meet Federal requirements are subject 
to the hearing provisions of subpart D of this part.
    (b) FFP in Medicaid expenditures. Disputes that pertain to 
disallowances of FFP in Medicaid expenditures (mandatory grants) are 
heard by the Departmental Appeals Board (the Board) in accordance with 
procedures set forth in 45 CFR part 16.
    (c) Discretionary grants disputes. Disputes pertaining to 
discretionary grants, such as grants for special demonstration projects 
under sections 1110 and 1115 of the Act, which may be awarded to a 
Medicaid agency, are also heard by the Board. 45 CFR part 16, appendix 
A, lists all the types of disputes that the Board hears.

[53 FR 36571, Sept. 21, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 8845, Mar. 1, 1991]


<R04>
                         Subpart B--State Plans


<R05>
Sec. 430.10  The State plan.

    The State plan is a comprehensive written statement submitted by the 
agency describing the nature and scope of its Medicaid program and 
giving assurance that it will be administered in conformity with the 
specific requirements of title XIX, the regulations in this Chapter IV, 
and other applicable official issuances of the Department. The State 
plan contains all information necessary for HCFA to determine whether 
the plan can be approved to serve as a basis for Federal financial 
participation (FFP) in the State program.


<R05>
Sec. 430.12  Submittal of State plans and plan amendments.

    (a) Format. A State plan for Medicaid consists of preprinted 
material that covers the basic requirements, and individualized content 
that reflects the characteristics of the particular State's program.
    (b) Governor's review--(1) Basic rules. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section--
    (i) The Medicaid agency must submit the State plan and State plan 
amendments to the State Governor or his designee for review and comment 
before submitting them to the HCFA regional office.
    (ii) The plan must provide that the Governor will be given a 
specific period of time to review State plan amendments, long-range 
program planning projections, and other periodic reports on the Medicaid 
program, excluding periodic statistical, budget and fiscal reports.
    (iii) Any comments from the Governor must be submitted to HCFA with 
the plan or plan amendment.
    (2) Exceptions. (i) Submission is not required if the Governor's 
designee is the head of the Medicaid agency.
    (ii) Governor's review is not required for preprinted plan 
amendments that are developed by HCFA if they provide absolutely no 
options for the State.
    (c) Plan amendments. (1) The plan must provide that it will be 
amended whenever necessary to reflect--

[[Page 7]]

    (i) Changes in Federal law, regulations, policy interpretations, or 
court decisions; or
    (ii) Material changes in State law, organization, or policy, or in 
the State's operation of the Medicaid program. For changes related to 
advance directive requirements, amendments must be submitted as soon as 
possible, but no later than 60 days from the effective date of the 
change to State law concerning advance directives.
    (2) Prompt submittal of amendments is necessary--
    (i) So that HCFA can determine whether the plan continues to meet 
the requirements for approval; and
    (ii) To ensure the availability of FFP in accordance with 
Sec. 430.20.

discusses any issues with the Medicaid agency, and consults with central 
office staff on questions regarding application of Federal policy.


<R05>
Sec. 430.15  Basis and authority for action on State plan material.

    (a) Basis for action. (1) Determinations as to whether State plans

    (c) Disapproval authority. (1) The Administrator retains authority 
for determining that proposed plan material is not approvable or that 
previously approved material no longer meets the requirements for 
approval.
    (2) The Administrator does not make a final determination of 
disapproval without first consulting the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 430.16  Timing and notice of action on State plan material.

    (a) Timing. (1) A State plan or plan amendment will be considered 
approved unless HCFA, within 90 days after receipt of the plan or plan 
amendment in the regional office, sends the State--
    (i) Written notice of disapproval; or
    (ii) Written notice of any additional information it needs in order 
to make a final determination.
    (2) If HCFA requests additional information, the 90-day period for 
HCFA action on the plan or plan amendment begins on the day it receives 
that information.
    (b) Notice of final determination. (1) The Regional Administrator or 
the Administrator notifies the Medicaid agency of the approval of a 
State plan or plan amendment.
    (2) Only the Administrator gives notice of disapproval of a State 
plan or plan amendment.


<R05>
Sec. 430.18  Administrative review of action on State plan material.

    (a) Request for reconsideration. Any State dissatisfied with the 
Administrator's action on plan material under Sec. 430.15 may, within 60 
days after receipt of the notice provided under Sec. 430.16(b), request 
that the Administrator reconsider the issue of whether the plan or plan 
amendment conforms to the requirements for approval.
    (b) Notice and timing of hearing. (1) Within 30 days after receipt 
of the request, the Administrator notifies the State of the time and 
place of the hearing.
    (2) The hearing takes place not less than 30 days nor more than 60 
days after the date of the notice, unless the State and the 
Administrator agree in writing on an earlier or later date.
    (c) Hearing procedures. The hearing procedures are set forth in 
subpart D of this part.
    (d) Decision. A decision affirming, modifying, or reversing the 
Administrator's original determination is made in accordance with 
Sec. 430.102.
    (e) Effect of hearing decision. (1) Denial of Federal funds, if 
required by the Administrator's original determination, will not be 
delayed pending a hearing decision.

original decision was incorrect, HCFA pays the State a lump sum equal to 
any funds incorrectly denied.


<R05>
Sec. 430.20  Effective dates of State plans and plan amendments.

    For purposes of FFP, the following rules apply:
    (a) New plans. The effective date of a new plan--
    (1) May not be earlier than the first day of the quarter in which an 
approvable plan is submitted to the regional office; and
    (2) With respect to expenditures for medical assistance, may not be 
earlier than the first day on which the plan is in operation on a 
statewide basis.
    (b) Plan amendment. (1) For a plan amendment that provides 
additional services to individuals eligible under the approved plan, 
increases the payment amounts for services already included in the plan, 
or makes additional groups eligible for services provided under the 
approved plan, the effective date is determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) For a plan amendment that changes the State's payment method and 
standards, the rules of Sec. 447.256 of this chapter apply.

<R05>
Sec. 430.25  Waivers of State plan requirements.

    (a) Scope of section. This section describes the purpose and effect 
of waivers, identifies the requirements that may be waived and the other 
regulations that apply to waivers, and sets forth the procedures that 
HCFA follows in reviewing and taking action on waiver requests.
    (b) Purpose of waivers. Waivers are intended to provide the 
flexibility needed to enable States to try new or different approaches 
to the efficient and cost-effective delivery of health care services, or 
to adapt their programs to the special needs of particular areas or 
groups of recipients. Waivers allow exceptions to State plan 
requirements and permit a State to implement innovative programs or 
activities on a time-limited basis, and subject to specific safeguards 
for the protection of recipients and the program. Detailed rules for 
waivers are set forth in subpart B of part 431, subpart A of part 440, 
and subpart G of part 441 of this chapter.
    (c) Effect of waivers. (1) Waivers under section 1915(b) allow a 
State to take the following actions:
    (i) Implement a primary care case-management system or a specialty 
physician system.
    (ii) Designate a locality to act as central broker in assisting 
Medicaid recipients to choose among competing health care plans.
    (iii) Share with recipients (through provision of additional 
services) cost-savings made possible through the recipients' use of more 
cost-effective medical care.
    (iv) Limit recipients' choice of providers (except in emergency 
situations and with respect to family planning services) to providers 
that fully meet reimbursement, quality, and utilization standards, which 
are established under the State plan and are consistent with access, 
quality, and efficient and economical furnishing of care.
    (2) A waiver under section 1915(c) of the Act allows a State to 
include as ``medical assistance'' under its plan home and community 
based services furnished to recipients who would otherwise need 
inpatient care that is furnished in a hospital, SNF, ICF, or ICF/MR, and 
is reimbursable under the State plan.
    (3) A waiver under section 1916 (a)(3) or (b)(3) of the Act allows a 
State to impose a deduction, cost-sharing or similar charge of up to 
twice the ``nominal charge'' established under the plan for outpatient 
services, if--
    (i) The outpatient services are received in a hospital emergency 
room but are not emergency services; and
    (ii) The State has shown that Medicaid recipients have actually 
available and accessible to them alternative services of nonemergency 
outpatient services.
    (d) Requirements that are waived. In order to permit the activities 
described in paragraph (c) of this section, one or

[[Page 9]]

more of the title XIX requirements must be waived, in whole or in part.
    (1) Under section 1915(b) of the Act, and subject to certain 
limitations, any of the State plan requirements of section 1902 of the 
Act may be waived to achieve one of the purposes specified in that 
section.
    (2) Under section 1915(c) of the Act, the following requirements may 
be waived:
    (i) Statewideness--section 1902(a)(1).
    (ii) Comparability of services--section 1902(a)(10)(B).
    (iii) Income and resource rules--section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III).
    (3) Under section 1916 of the Act, paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3) 
require that any cost-sharing imposed on recipients be nominal in 
amount, and provide an exception for nonemergency services furnished in 
a hospital emergency room if the conditions of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section are met.
    (e) Submittal of waiver request. The State Governor, the head of the 
Medicaid agency, or an authorized designee may submit the waiver 
request.
    (f) Review of waiver requests. (1) This paragraph applies to initial 
waiver requests and to requests for renewal or amendment of a previously 
approved waiver.
    (2) HCFA regional and central office staff review waiver requests 
and submit a recommendation to the Administrator, who--
    (i) Has the authority to approve or deny waiver requests; and
    (ii) Does not deny a request without first consulting the Secretary.
    (3) A waiver request is considered approved unless, within 90 days 
after the request is received by HCFA, the Administrator denies the 
request, or the Administrator or the Regional Administrator sends the 
State a written request for additional information necessary to reach a 
final decision. If additional information is requested, a new 90-day 
period begins on the day the response to the additional information 
request is received by the addressee.
    (g) Basis for approval--(1) Waivers under section 1915 (b) and (c). 
The Administrator approves waiver requests if the State's proposed 
program or activity meets the requirements of the Act and the 
regulations at Sec. 431.55 or subpart G of part 441 of this chapter.
    (2) Waivers under section 1916. The Administrator approves a waiver 
under section 1916 of the Act if the State shows, to HCFA's 
satisfaction, that the Medicaid recipients have available and accessible 
to them sources, other than a hospital emergency room, where they can 
obtain necessary nonemergency outpatient services.
    (h) Effective date and duration of waivers--(1) Effective date. 
Waivers receive a prospective effective date determined, with State 
input, by the Administrator. The effective date is specified in the 
letter of approval to the State.
    (2) Duration of waivers--(i) Home and community-based services under 
section 1915(c). The initial waiver is for a period of three years and 
may be renewed thereafter for periods of five years.
    (ii) Waivers under sections 1915(b) and 1916. The initial waiver is 
for a period of two years and may be renewed for additional periods of 
up to two years as determined by the Administrator.
    (3) Renewal of waivers. (i) A renewal request must be submitted at 
least 90 days (but not more than 120 days) before a currently approved 
waiver expires, to provide adequate time for HCFA review.
    (ii) If a renewal request for a section 1915(c) waiver proposes a 
change in services provided, eligible population, service area, or 
statutory sections waived, the Administrator may consider it a new 
waiver, and approve it for a period of three years.

<R04>
   Subpart C--Grants; Reviews and Audits; Withholding for Failure To 
   Comply; Deferral and Disallowance of Claims; Reduction of Federal 
                            Medicaid Payments


<R05>
Sec. 430.30  Grants procedures.

    (a) General provisions. (1) Once HCFA has approved a State plan, it 
makes quarterly grant awards to the State to cover the Federal share of 
expenditures for services, training, and administration.

[[Page 10]]

    (2) The amount of the quarterly grant is determined on the basis of 
information submitted by the State agency (in quarterly estimate and 
quarterly expenditure reports) and other pertinent documents.
    (b) Quarterly estimates. The Medicaid agency must submit Form HCFA-
25 (Medicaid Program Budget Report; Quarterly Distribution of Funding 
Requirements) to the central office (with a copy to the regional office) 
45 days before the beginning of each quarter.
    (c) Expenditure reports. (1) The State must submit Form HCFA-64 
(Quarterly Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance 
Program) to the central office (with a copy to the regional office) not 
later than 30 days after the end of each quarter.
    (2) This report is the State's accounting of actual recorded 
expenditures. The disposition of Federal funds may not be reported on 
the basis of estimates.
    (d) Grant award--(1) Computation by HCFA. Regional office staff 
analyzes the State's estimates and sends a recommendation to the central 
office. Central office staff considers the State's estimates, the 
regional office recommendations and any other relevant information, 
including any adjustments to be made under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, and computes the grant.
    (2) Content of award. The grant award computation form shows the 
estimate of expenditures for the ensuring quarter, and the amounts by 
which that estimate is increased or decreased because of an 
underestimate or overestimate for prior quarters, or for any of the 
following reasons:
    (i) Penalty reductions imposed by law.
    (ii) Accounting adjustments.
    (iii) Deferrals or disallowances.
    (iv) Interest assessments.
    (v) Mandated adjustments such as those required by section 1914 of 
the Act.
    (3) Effect of award. The grant award authorizes the State to draw 
Federal funds as needed to pay the Federal share of disbursements.
    (4) Drawing procedure. The draw is through a commercial bank and the 
Federal Reserve system against a continuing letter of credit certified 
to the Secretary of the Treasury in favor of the State payee. (The 
letter of credit payment system was established in accordance with 
Treasury Department regulations--Circular No. 1075.)
    (e) General administrative requirements. With the following 
exceptions, the provisions of 45 CFR part 74, which establish uniform 
administrative requirements and cost principles, apply to all grants 
made to States under this subpart:

45 CFR part 74
Subpart G--Matching and Cost Sharing
Subpart I--Financial Report Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 430.32  Program reviews.

    (a) Review of State and local administration. In order to determine 
whether the State is complying with the Federal requirements and the 
provisions of its plan, HCFA reviews State and local administration 
through analysis of the State's  policies  and  procedures, on-site 
review of selected aspects of agency operation, and examination of 
samples of individual case records.
    (b) Quality control program. The State itself is required to carry 
out a continuing quality control program as set forth in part 431, 
subpart P, of this chapter.
    (c) Action on review findings. If Federal or State reviews reveal 
serious problems with respect to compliance with any Federal 
requirement, the State must correct its practice accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 430.33  Audits.

    (a) Purpose. The Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
periodically audits State operations in order to determine whether--
    (1) The program is being operated in a cost-efficient manner; and
    (2) Funds are being properly expended for the purposes for which 
they were appropriated under Federal and State law and regulations.
    (b) Reports. (1) The OIG releases audit reports simultaneously to 
State officials and the Department's program officials.
    (2) The reports set forth OIG opinion and recommendations regarding 
the practices it reviewed, and the allowability of the costs it audited.

[[Page 11]]

    (3) Cognizant officials of the Department make final determinations 
on all audit findings.
    (c) Action on audit exceptions--(1) Concurrence or clearance. The 
State agency has the opportunity of concurring in the exceptions or 
submitting additional facts that support clearance of the exceptions.
    (2) Appeal. Any exceptions that are not disposed of under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section are included in a disallowance letter that 
constitutes the Department's final decision unless the State requests 
reconsideration by the Appeals Board. (Specific rules are set forth in 
Sec. 430.42.)
    (3) Adjustment. If the decision by the Board requires an adjustment 
of FFP, either upward or downward, a subsequent grant award promptly 
reflects the amount of increase or decrease.

[53 FR 36571, Sept. 21, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 8846, Mar. 1, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 430.35  Withholding of payment for failure to comply with Federal requirements.

    (a) Basis for withholding. HCFA withholds payments to the State, in 
whole or in part, only if, after giving the agency reasonable notice and 
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subpart D of this part, the 
Administrator finds--
    (1) That the plan no longer complies with the provisions of section 
1902 of the Act; or
    (2) That in the administration of the plan there is failure to 
comply substantially with any of those provisions.

(Hearings under subpart D are generally not called until a reasonable 
effort has been made to resolve the issues through conferences and 
discussions. These may be continued even if a date and place have been 
set for the hearing.)
    (b) Noncompliance of the plan. A question of noncompliance of a 
State plan may arise from an unapprovable change in the approved State 
plan or the failure of the State to change its approved plan to conform 
to a new Federal requirement for approval of State plans.
    (c) Noncompliance in practice. A question of noncompliance in 
practice may arise from the State's failure to actually comply with a 
Federal requirement, regardless of whether the plan itself complies with 
that requirement.
    (d) Notice and implementation of withholding. If the Administrator 
makes a finding of noncompliance under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the following rules apply:
    (1) The Administrator notifies the State:
    (i) That no further payments will be made to the State (or that 
payments will be made only for those portions or aspects of the program 
that are not affected by the noncompliance); and
    (ii) That the total or partial withholding will continue until the 
Administrator is satisfied that the State's plan and practice are, and 
will continue to be, in compliance with Federal requirements.
    (2) HCFA withholds payments, in whole or in part, until the 
Administrator is satisfied regarding the State's compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 430.38  Judicial review.

    (a) Right to judicial review. Any State dissatisfied with the 
Administrator's final determination on approvability of plan material 
(Sec. 430.18) or compliance with Federal requirements (Sec. 430.35) has 
a right to judicial review.
    (b) Petition for review. (1) The State must file a petition for 
review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the State 
is located, within 60 days after it is notified of the determination.
    (2) The clerk of the court will file a copy of the petition with the 
Administrator and the Administrator will file in the court the record of 
the proceedings on which the determination was based.
    (c) Court action. (1) The court is bound by the Administrator's 
findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence.
    (2) The court has jurisdiction to affirm the Administrator's 
decision, to set it aside in whole or in part, or, for good cause, to 
remand the case for additional evidence.
    (d) Response to remand. (1) If the court remands the case, the 
Administrator may make new or modified findings of fact and may modify 
his or her previous determination.

[[Page 12]]

    (2) The Administrator will certify to the court the transcript and 
record of the further proceedings.
    (e) Review by the Supreme Court. The judgment of the appeals court 
is subject to review by the U.S. Supreme Court upon certiorari or 
certification, as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1254.


<R05>
Sec. 430.40  Deferral of claims for FFP.

    (a) Requirements for deferral. Payment of a claim or any portion of 
a claim for FFP is deferred only if--
    (1) The Regional Administrator or the Administrator questions its 
allowability and needs additional information in order to resolve the 
question; and
    (2) HCFA takes action to defer the claim (by excluding the claimed 
amount from the grant award) within 60 days after the receipt of a 
Quarterly Statement of Expenditures (prepared in accordance with HCFA 
instructions) that includes that claim.
    (b) Notice of deferral and State's responsibility. (1) Within 15 
days of the action described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the 
Regional Administrator sends the State a written notice of deferral 
that--
    (i) Identifies the type and amount of the deferred claim and 
specifies the reason for deferral; and
    (ii) Requests the State to make available all the documents and 
materials the regional office then believes are necessary to determine 
the allowability of the claim.
    (2) It is the responsibility of the State to establish the 
allowability of a deferred claim.
    (c) Handling of documents and materials. (1) Within 60 days (or 
within 120 days if the State requests an extension) after receipt of the 
notice of deferral, the State must make available to the regional 
office, in readily reviewable form, all requested documents and 
materials except any that it identifies as not being available.
    (2) Regional office staff usually initiates review within 30 days 
after receipt of the documents and materials.
    (3) If the Regional Administrator finds that the materials are not 
in readily reviewable form or that additional information is needed, he 
or she promptly notifies the State that it has 15 days to submit the 
readily reviewable or additional materials.
    (4) If the State does not provide the necessary materials within 15 
days, the Regional Administrator disallows the claim.
    (5) The Regional Administrator has 90 days, after all documentation 
is available in readily reviewable form, to determine the allowability 
of the claim.
    (6) If the Regional Administrator cannot complete review of the 
material within 90 days, HCFA pays the claim, subject to a later 
determination of allowability.
    (d) Effect of decision to pay a deferred claim. Payment of a 
deferred claim under paragraph (c)(6) of this section does not preclude 
a subsequent disallowance based on the results of an audit or financial 
review. (If there is a subsequent disallowance, the State may request 
reconsideration as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.)
    (e) Notice and effect of decision on allowability. (1) The Regional 
Administrator or the Administrator gives the State written notice of his 
or her decision to pay or disallow a deferred claim.
    (2) If the decision is to disallow, the notice informs the State of 
its right to reconsideration in accordance with 45 CFR part 16.


<R05>
Sec. 430.42  Disallowance of claims for FFP.

    (a) Notice of disallowance and of right to reconsideration. When the 
Regional Administrator or the Administrator determines that a claim or 
portion of claim is not allowable, he or she promptly sends the State a 
disallowance letter that includes the following, as appropriate:
    (1) The date or dates on which the State's claim for FFP was made.
    (2) The time period during which the expenditures in question were 
made or claimed to have been made.
    (3) The date and amount of any payment or notice of deferral.
    (4) A statement of the amount of FFP claimed, allowed, and 
disallowed and the manner in which these amounts were computed.

[[Page 13]]

    (5) Findings of fact on which the disallowance determination is 
based or a reference to other documents previously furnished to the 
State or included with the notice (such as a report of a financial 
review or audit) which contain the findings of fact on which the 
disallowance determination is based.
    (6) Pertinent citations to the law, regulations, guides and 
instructions supporting the action taken.
    (7) A request that the State make appropriate adjustment in a 
subsequent expenditure report.
    (8) Notice of the State's right to request reconsideration of the 
disallowance and the time allowed to make the request.
    (9) A statement indicating that the disallowance letter is the 
Department's final decision unless the State requests reconsideration 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (b) Reconsideration of FFP disallowance. (1) The Departmental 
Appeals Board reviews disallowances of FFP under title XIX.
    (2) A State that wishes to request reconsideration must submit the 
request to the Chair, Departmental Appeals Board, within 30 days after 
receipt of the disallowance letter, and include--
    (i) A copy of the disallowance letter;
    (ii) A statement of the amount in dispute; and
    (iii) A brief statement of why the disallowance is wrong.
    (c) Reconsideration procedures. The reconsideration procedures are 
those set forth in 45 CFR part 16 for Medicaid and for many other 
programs administered by the Department.
    (d) Implementation of decisions. If the reconsideration decision 
requires an adjustment of FFP, either upward or downward, a subsequent 
grant award promptly reflects the amount of increase or decrease.

[53 FR 36571, Sept. 21, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 8846, Mar. 1, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 430.45  Reduction of Federal Medicaid payments.

    (a) Methods of reduction. HCFA may reduce Medicaid payments to a 
State as required under the Act by reducing--
    (1) The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage;
    (2) The amount of State expenditures subject to FFP;
    (3) The rates of FFP; or
    (4) The amount otherwise payable to the State.
    (b) Right to reconsideration. A state that receives written final 
notice of a reduction under paragraph (a) of this section has a right to 
reconsideration. The provisions of Sec. 430.42 (b) and (c) apply.
    (c) Other applicable rules. Other rules regarding reduction of 
Medicaid payments are set forth in parts 433 and 447 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 430.48  Repayment of Federal funds by installments.

    (a) Basic conditions. When Federal payments have been made for 
claims that are later found to be unallowable, the State may repay the 
Federal Funds by installments if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The amount to be repaid exceeds 2\1/2\ percent of the estimated 
or actual annual State share for the Medicaid program; and
    (2) The State has given the Regional Administrator written notice, 
before total repayment was due, of its intent to repay by installments.
    (b) Annual State share determination. HCFA determines whether the 
amount to be repaid exceeds 2\1/2\ percent of the annual State share as 
follows:
    (1) If the Medicaid program is ongoing, HCFA uses the annual 
estimated State share of Medicaid expenditures. This is the sum of the 
estimated State shares for four consecutive quarters, beginning with the 
quarter in which the first installment is to be paid, as shown on the 
State's latest HCFA-25 form.
    (2) If the Medicaid program has been terminated by Federal law or by 
the State, HCFA uses the actual State share. The actual State share is 
that shown on the State's Statement of Expenditures reports for the last 
four quarters before the program was terminated.
    (c) Repayment amounts, schedules, and procedures--(1) Repayment 
amount. The repayment amount may not include

[[Page 14]]

any amount previously approved for installment repayment.
    (2) Repayment schedule. The number of quarters allowed for repayment 
is determined on the basis of the ratio of the repayment amount to the 
annual State share of Medicaid expenditures. The higher the ratio of the 
total repayment amount is to the annual State share, the greater the 
number of quarters allowed, as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Number of
   Total repayment amount as percentage of State share of      quarters
              annual expenditures for Medicaid                  to make
                                                               repayment

Greater than 2.5, but not greater than 5....................           2
Greater than 5, but not greater than 7.5....................           3
Greater than 7.5, but not greater than 10...................           4
Greater than 10, but not greater than 15....................           5
Greater than 15, but not greater than 20....................           6
Greater than 20, but not greater than 25....................           7
Greater than 25, but not greater than 30....................           8
Greater than 30, but not greater than 47.5..................           9
Greater than 47.5, but not greater than 65..................          10
Greater than 65, but not greater than 82.5..................          11
Greater than 82.5, but not greater than 100.................          12
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Quarterly repayment amounts. The quarterly repayment amounts for 
each of the quarters in the repayment schedule may not be less than the 
following percentages of the estimated State share of the annual 
expenditures for Medicaid:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Repayment
                                                             installment
                                                              may not be
             For each of the following quarters               less than
                                                                these
                                                             percentages
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 to 4.....................................................          2.5
5 to 8.....................................................          5.0
9 to 12....................................................         17.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Extended schedule. The repayment schedule may be extended beyond 
12 quarterly installments if the total repayment amount exceeds 100% of 
the estimated State share of annual expenditures. In these 
circumstances, paragraph (c)(2) of this section is followed for 
repayment of the amount equal to 100 percent of the annual State share. 
The remaining amount of the repayment is in quarterly amounts equal to 
not less than 17.5 percent of the estimated State share of annual 
expenditures.
    (5) Repayment process. Repayment is accomplished through adjustment 
in the quarterly grants over the period covered by the repayment 
schedule.

If the State chooses to repay amounts representing higher percentages 
during the early quarters, any corresponding reduction in required 
minimum percentages is applied first to the last scheduled payment, then 
to the next to the last payment, and so forth as neccessary.
    (6) Offsetting of retroactive claims. The amount of a retroactive 
claim to be paid a State will be offset against any amounts to be, or 
already being, repaid by the State in installments. Under this 
provision, the State may choose to:
    (i) Suspend payments until the retroactive claim due the State has, 
in fact, been offset; or
    (ii) Continue payments until the reduced amount of its debt 
(remaining after the offset), has been paid in full.

This second option would result in a shorter payment period.

A retroactive claim for the purpose of this regulation is a claim 
applicable to any period ending 12 months or more before the beginning 
of the quarter in which HCFA would pay that claim.

<R05>
Sec. 430.76  Parties to the hearing.

    (a) HCFA and the State. HCFA and the State are parties to the 
hearing.
    (b) Other individuals--(1) Basis for participation. Other

    (1) Change the date, time, and place of the hearing after due notice 
to the parties. This includes authority to postpone or adjourn the

the entire State plan or only for certain categories under, or parts of, 
the State plan affected by the noncompliance.

Upon written motion, the presiding officer promptly rules upon any 
objection to discovery action initiated under this section. The 
presiding officer also has the power to grant a protective order or 
relief to any party against whom discovery is sought and to restrict or 
control discovery so as to prevent undue delay in the conduct of the 
hearing. Upon the failure of any party to make discovery, the presiding 
officer may issue any order and impose any sanction (other than contempt 
orders) authorized by Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

designed to ensure production of the most credible evidence available

presiding officer when reasonably necessary.
    (2) A witness may be cross-examined on any matter material to the 
proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination.
    (3) The presiding officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or

    (b) Refuses to comply with directions; or
    (c) Uses dilatory tactics.


<R05>
Sec. 430.92  Unsponsored written material.

    Letters expressing views or urging action and other unsponsored

Sec. 430.94  Official transcript.

    (a) Filing. The official transcripts of testimony, together with any 
stipulations, briefs, or memoranda of law, are filed with HCFA.
    (b) Availability of transcripts. HCFA designates an official

    (c) Correction of transcript. Upon notice to all parties, the 
presiding officer may authorize corrections that affect substantive 
matters in the transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 430.96  Record for decision.

    The transcript of testimony, exhibits, and all papers and requests 
filed in the proceedings, except the correspondence section of the 
docket, including rulings and any recommended or initial decision

<R05>
Sec. 430.100  Posthearing briefs.

    The presiding officer fixes the time for filing posthearing briefs, 
which may contain proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The

Sec. 430.102  Decisions following hearing.

Administrator, he or she issues the hearing decision within 60 days 
after expiration of the period for submission of posthearing briefs.
    (b) Administrator's designee presides. If the presiding officer is 
other than the Administrator, the procedure is as follows:
    (1) Upon expiration of the period allowed for submission of 
posthearing briefs, the presiding officer certifies the entire record, 
including his or her recommended findings and proposed decision, to the 
Administrator. The Administrator serves a copy of the recommended 
findings and proposed decision upon all parties and amici, if any.

60 days of its issuance, issues his or her own decision.
    (c) Effect of Administrator's decision. The decision of the 
Administrator under this section is the final decision of the Secretary

704 and a ``final determination'' within the meaning of section 
1116(a)(3) of the Act and Sec. 430.38. The Administrator's decision is 
promptly served on all parties and amici.


<R05>
Sec. 430.104  Decisions that affect FFP.

    (a) Scope of decisions. If the Administrator concludes that 
withholding of FFP is necessary because a State is out of compliance 
with Federal requirements, in accordance with Sec. 430.35, the decision 
also specifies--
    (1) Whether no further payments will be made to the State or whether 
payments will be limited to parts of the program not affected by the 
noncompliance; and
    (2) The effective date of the decision to withhold.
    (b) Consultation. The Administrator may ask the parties for 
recommendations or briefs or may hold conferences of the parties on the 
question of further payments to the State.
    (c) Effective date of decision. The effective date of a decision to 
withhold Federal funds will not be earlier than the date of the 
Administrator's decision and will not be later than the first day of the

provide the services to them.
    (2) Section 1915(a) of the Act provides that a State shall not be

    (3) Section 1915(b) of the Act authorizes waiver of the section 
1902(a)(23) freedom of choice of providers requirement in certain 
specified circumstances, but not with respect to providers of family 
planning services.

enrolled in a primary care case-management system, an HMO, or a similar 
entity, may not be denied freedom of choice of qualified providers of 
family planning services.
    (5) Section 1902(e)(2), as amended by section 4113(c)(2) of OBRA

provider.
    (b) State plan requirements. A State plan, except the plan for 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or Guam, must provide as follows:

recipient may obtain Medicaid services from any institution, agency, 
pharmacy, person, or organization that is--

This includes an organization that furnishes, or arranges for the 
furnishing of, Medicaid services on a prepayment basis.
    (2) A recipient enrolled in a primary care case-management system, 
an HMO, or other similar entity will not be restricted in freedom of 
choice of providers of family planning services.
    (c) Exceptions. Paragraph (b) of this section does not prohibit the 
agency from--
    (1) Establishing the fees it will pay providers for Medicaid 
services;
    (2) Setting reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of 
providers: or
    (3) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, restricting 
recipients' free choice of providers in accordance with one or more of 
the exceptions set forth in Sec. 431.54, or under a waiver as provided 
in Sec. 431.55.
    (d) Certification requirement. (1) Content of certification. If a

safeguards and requirements for an exception under section 1915(a) of 
the Act are met.
    (2) Timing of certification. (i) For an exception under

submit the certificate by the end of the quarter in which it implements 
the project.

Secretary to prescribe State plan requirements for furnishing Medicaid 
to State residents who are absent from the State.
    (b) Payment for services. A State plan must provide that the State 
will pay for services furnished in another State to the same extent that 
it would pay for services furnished within its boundaries if the

and any of the following conditions is met:
    (1) Medical services are needed because of a medical emergency;

[[Page 26]]

    (2) Medical services are needed and the recipient's health would be 
endangered if he were required to travel to his State of residence;
    (3) The State determines, on the basis of medical advice, that the 
needed medical services, or necessary supplementary resources, are more 
readily available in the other State;
    (4) It is general practice for recipients in a particular locality 
to use medical resources in another State.
    (c) Cooperation among States. The plan must provide that the State 
will establish procedures to facilitate the furnishing of medical 
services to individuals who are present in the State and are eligible 
for Medicaid under another State's plan.

    A State plan must--
    (a) Specify that the Medicaid agency will ensure necessary

requirement.


(Sec. 1902(a)(4) of the Act)


<R05>
Sec. 431.54  Exceptions to certain State plan requirements.

    (a) Statutory basis. Section 1915(a) of the Act provides that a 
State shall not be deemed to be out of compliance with the requirements 
of sections 1902(a) (1), (10), or (23) of the Act solely because it has 
elected any of the exceptions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (d) 
through (f) of this section.
    (b) Additional services under a prepayment system. If the Medicaid 
agency contracts on a prepayment basis with an organization that 
provides services additional to those offered under the State plan, the 
agency may restrict the provision of the additional services to 
recipients who live in the area served by the organization and wish to 
obtain services from it.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Special procedures for purchase of medical devices and 
laboratory and X-ray tests. The Medicaid agency may establish special 
procedures for the purchase of medical devices or laboratory and X-ray 
tests (as defined in Sec. 440.30 of this chapter) through a competitive 
bidding process or otherwise, if the State assures, in the certification 
required under Sec. 431.51(d), and HCFA finds, as follows:
    (1) Adequate services or devices are available to recipients under 
the special procedures.
    (2) Laboratory services are furnished through laboratories that meet 
the following requirements:
    (i) They are independent laboratories, or inpatient or outpatient 
hospital laboratories that provide services for individuals who are not 
hospital patients, or physician laboratories that process at least 100 
specimens for other physicians during any calendar year.
    (ii) They meet the requirements of subpart M of part 405 or part 482 
of this chapter.
    (iii) Laboratories that require an interstate license under 42 CFR 
part 74 are licensed by HCFA or receive an exemption from the licensing 
requirement by the College of American Pathologists. (Hospital and 
physician laboratories may participate in competitive bidding only with 
regard to services to non-hospital patients and other physicians' 
patients, respectively.)
    (3) Any laboratory from which a State purchases services under this 
section has no more than 75 percent of its charges based on services to 
Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.
    (e) Lock-in of recipients who over-utilize Medicaid services. If a 
Medicaid agency finds that a recipient has utilized Medicaid services at 
a frequency or amount that is not medically necessary, as determined in 
accordance with utilization guidelines established by the State, the 
agency may restrict that recipient for a reasonable period of time to 
obtain Medicaid services from designated providers only. The agency may 
impose these restrictions only if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The agency gives the recipient notice and opportunity for a 
hearing (in accordance with procedures established by the agency) before 
imposing the restrictions.
    (2) The agency ensures that the recipient has reasonable access 
(taking into

[[Page 27]]

account geographic location and reasonable travel time) to Medicaid 
services of adequate quality.
    (3) The restrictions do not apply to emergency services furnished to 
the recipient.
    (f) Lock-out of providers. If a Medicaid agency finds that a 
Medicaid provider has abused the Medicaid program, the agency may 
restrict the provider, through suspension or otherwise, from 
participating in the program for a reasonable period of time.
    Before imposing any restriction, the agency must meet the following 
conditions:
    (1) Give the provider notice and opportunity for a hearing, in 
accordance with procedures established by the agency.
    (2) Find that in a significant number or proportion of cases, the 
provider has:
    (i) Furnished Medicaid services at a frequency or amount not 
medically necessary, as determined in accordance with utilization 
guidelines established by the agency; or
    (ii) Furnished Medicaid services of a quality that does not meet 
professionally recognized standards of health care.
    (3) Notify HCFA and the general public of the restriction and its 
duration.
    (4) Ensure that the restrictions do not result in denying recipients 
reasonable access (taking into account geographic location: and 
reasonable travel time) to Medicaid services of adequate quality, 
including emergency services.

Sec. 431.55  Waiver of other Medicaid requirements.

    (a) Statutory basis. Section 1915(b) of the Act authorizes the 
Secretary to waive most requirements of section 1902 of the Act to the 
extent he or she finds proposed improvements or specified practices in 
the provision of services under Medicaid to be cost effective, 
efficient, and consistent with the objectives of the Medicaid program. 
Sections 1915 (f) and (h) prescribe how such waivers are to be approved, 
continued, monitored, and terminated. Section 1902(p)(2) of the Act 
conditions FFP in payments to an entity under a section 1915(b)(1) 
waiver on the State's provision for exclusion of certain entities from 
participation.
    (b) General requirements. (1) General requirements for submittal of 
waiver requests, and the procedures that HCFA follows for review and 
action on those requests are set forth in Sec. 430.25 of this chapter.
    (2) In applying for a waiver to implement an approvable project 
under paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, a Medicaid agency 
must document in the waiver request and maintain data regarding:
    (i) The cost-effectiveness of the project;
    (ii) The effect of the project on the accessibility and quality of 
services;
    (iii) The anticipated impact of the project on the State's Medicaid 
program and;
    (iv) Assurances that the restrictions on free choice of providers do 
not apply to family planning services.
    (3) No waiver under this section may be granted for a period longer 
than 2 years, unless the agency requests a continuation of the waiver.
    (4) HCFA monitors the implementation of waivers granted under this 
section to ensure that requirements for such waivers are being met.
    (i) If monitoring demonstrates that the agency is not in compliance 
with the requirements for a waiver under this section, HCFA gives the 
agency notice and opportunity for a hearing.
    (ii) If, after a hearing, HCFA finds an agency to be out of 
compliance with the requirements of a waiver, HCFA terminates the waiver 
and gives the agency a specified date by which it must demonstrate that 
it meets the applicable requirements of section 1902 of the Act.
    (5) The requirements of section 1902(s) of the Act, with regard to 
adjustments in payments for inpatient hospital services furnished to 
infants who have not attained age 1 and to children who have not 
attained age 6 and who receive these services in disproportionate share 
hospitals, may not be waived under a section 1915(b) waiver.
    (c) Case-management system. (1) Waivers of appropriate requirements 
of section 1902 of the Act may be authorized for a State to implement a 
primary

[[Page 28]]

care case-management system or specialty physician services system.
    (i) Under a primary care case-management system the agency assures 
that a specific person or persons or agency will be responsible for 
locating, coordinating, and monitoring all primary care or primary care 
and other medical care and rehabilitative services on behalf of a 
recipient.
    (ii) A specialty physician services system allows States to restrict 
recipients of specialty services to designated providers of such 
services, even in the absence of a primary care case-management system.
    (2) A waiver under this paragraph (c) may not be approved unless the 
State's request assures that the restrictions--
    (i) Do not apply in emergency situations; and
    (ii) Do not substantially impair access to medically necessary 
services of adequate quality.
    (d) Locality as central broker. Waivers of appropriate requirements 
of section 1902 of the Act may be authorized for a State to allow a 
locality to act as a central broker to assist recipients in selecting 
among competing health care plans. States must ensure that access to 
medically necessary services of adequate quality is not substantially 
impaired.
    (1) A locality is any defined jurisdiction, e.g., district, town, 
city, borough, county, parish, or State.
    (2) A locality may use any agency or agent, public or private, 
profit or nonprofit, to act on its behalf in carrying out its central 
broker function.
    (e) Sharing of cost savings. (1) Waivers of appropriate requirements 
of section 1902 of the Act may be authorized for a State to share with 
recipients the cost savings resulting from the recipients' use of more 
cost-effective medical care.
    (2) Sharing is through the provision of additional services, 
including--
    (i) Services furnished by a plan selected by the recipient; and
    (ii) Services expressly offered by the State as an inducement for 
recipients to participate in a primary care case-management system, a 
competing health care plan or other system that furnishes health care 
services in a more cost-effective manner.
    (f) Restriction of freedom of choice--(1) Waiver of appropriate 
requirements of section 1902 of the Act may be authorized for States to 
restrict recipients to obtaining services from (or through) qualified 
providers or practitioners that meet, accept, and comply with the State 
reimbursement, quality and utilization standards specified in the 
State's waiver request.
    (2) An agency may qualify for a waiver under this paragraph (f) only 
if its applicable State standards are consistent with access, quality 
and efficient and economic provision of covered care and services and 
the restrictions it imposes--
    (i) Do not apply to recipients residing at a long-term care facility 
when a restriction is imposed unless the State arranges for reasonable 
and adequate recipient transfer.
    (ii) Do not discriminate among classes of providers on grounds 
unrelated to their demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency in 
providing those services; and
    (iii) Do not apply in emergency circumstances.
    (3) Demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency refers to reducing 
costs or slowing the rate of cost increase and maximizing outputs or 
outcomes per unit of cost.
    (4) The agency must make payments to providers furnishing services 
under a freedom of choice waiver under this paragraph (f) in accordance 
with the timely claims payment standards specified in Sec. 447.45 of 
this chapter for health care practitioners participating in the Medicaid 
program.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) Waivers approved under section 1915(b)(1) of the Act--(1) Basic 
rules. (i) An agency must submit, as part of it's waiver request, 
assurance that the entities described in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section will be excluded from participation under an approved waiver.
    (ii) FFP is available in payments to an entity that furnishes 
services under a section 1915(b)(1) waiver only if the agency excludes 
from participation any entity described in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Entities that must be excluded. The agency must exclude an 
entity

[[Page 29]]

that meets any of the following conditions:
    (i) Could be excluded under section 1128(b)(8) of the Act as being 
controlled by a sanctioned individual.
    (ii) Has a substantial contractual relationship (direct or indirect)

review, medical social services, or administrative services.
    (B) Any entity described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Definitions. As used in this section, substantial contractual 
relationship means any contractual relationship that provides for one or 
more of the following services:

<R05>
Sec. 431.57  Waiver of cost-sharing requirements.

    (a) Sections 1916(a)(3) and 1916(b)(3) of the Act specify the

the nominal copayment amounts in effect when the waiver was approved.
    (f) A waiver approved under this section cannot apply to services 
furnished before the waiver was granted.

<R05>
Sec. 431.108  Effective date of provider agreements.

    (a) Applicability--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, this section applies to Medicaid provider 
agreements with entities that, as a basis for participation in 
Medicaid--
    (i) Are subject to survey and certification by HCFA or the State 
survey agency; or
    (ii) Are deemed to meet Federal requirements on the basis of 
accreditation by an accrediting organization whose program has HCFA 
approval at the time of accreditation survey and accreditation decision.
    (2) Exception. A Medicaid provider agreement with a laboratory is 
effective only while the laboratory has in effect a valid CLIA 
certificate issued under part 493 of this chapter, and only for the 
specialty and subspecialty tests it is authorized to perform.
    (b) All requirements are met on the date of survey. The agreement is 
effective on the date the onsite survey (including the Life Safety Code 
survey if applicable) is completed, if on that date the provider meets--
    (1) All applicable Federal requirements as set forth in this 
chapter; and
    (2) Any other requirements imposed by the State for participation in 
the Medicaid program. (If the provider has a time-limited agreement, the 
new agreement is effective on the day following expiration of the 
current agreement.)
    (c) All requirements are not met on the date of survey. If on the 
date the survey is completed the provider fails to meet any of the 
requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the following 
rules apply:
    (1) An NF provider agreement is effective on the date on which--
    (i) The NF is found to be in substantial compliance as defined in 
Sec. 488.301 of this chapter; and

[[Page 31]]

    (ii) HCFA or the State survey agency receives from the NF, if 
applicable, an approvable waiver request.
    (2) For an agreement with any other provider, the effective date is 
the earlier of the following:
    (i) The date on which the provider meets all requirements.
    (ii) The date on which a provider is found to meet all conditions of 
participation but has lower level deficiencies, and HCFA or the State 
survey agency receives from the provider an acceptable plan of 
correction for the lower level deficiencies, or an approvable waiver 
request, or both. (The date of receipt is the effective date of the 
agreement, regardless of when HCFA approves the plan of correction or 
waiver request, or both.)
    (d) Accredited provider requests participation in the Medicaid 
program--(1) General rule. If a provider is currently accredited by a 
national accrediting organization whose program had HCFA approval at the 
time of accreditation survey and accreditation decision, and on the 
basis of accreditation, HCFA has deemed the provider to meet Federal 
requirements, the effective date depends on whether the provider is 
subject to requirements in addition to those included in the accrediting 
organization's approved program.
    (i) Provider subject to additional requirements. For a provider that 
is subject to additional requirements, Federal or State, or both, the 
effective date is the date on which the provider meets all requirements, 
including the additional requirements.
    (ii) Provider not subject to additional requirements. For a provider 
that is not subject to additional requirements, the effective date is 
the date of the provider's initial request for participation if on that 
date the provider met all Federal requirements.
    (2) Special rule: Retroactive effective date. If the provider meets 
the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the effective date may be retroactive for up to one year, 
to encompass dates on which the provider furnished, to a Medicaid 
recipient, covered services for which it has not been paid.

<R05>
Sec. 431.110  Participation by Indian Health Service facilities.

    (a) Basis. This section is based on section 1902(a)(4) of the Act, 
proper and efficient administration; 1902(a)(23), free choice of 
provider; and 1911, reimbursement of Indian Health Service facilities.
    (b) State plan requirements. A State plan must provide that an 
Indian Health Service facility meeting State requirements for Medicaid 
participation must be accepted as a Medicaid provider on the same basis 
as any other qualified provider. However, when State licensure is 
normally required, the facility need not obtain a license but must meet 
all applicable standards for licensure. In determining whether a 
facility meets these standards, a Medicaid agency or State licensing 
authority may not take into account an absence of licensure of any staff 
member of the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 431.115  Disclosure of survey information and provider or contractor evaluation.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section implements--
    (1) Section 1902(a)(36) of the Act, which requires a State plan to 
provide that the State survey agency will make publicly available the 
findings from surveys of health care facilities, laboratories, agencies, 
clinics, or organizations; and
    (2) Section 1106(d) of the Act, which places certain restrictions on 
the Medicaid agency's disclosure of contractor and provider evaluations.
    (b) Definition of State survey agency. The State survey agency 
referred to in this section means the agency specified under section 
1902(a)(9) of the Act as responsible for establishing and maintaining 
health standards for private or public institutions in which Medicaid 
recipients may receive services.
    (c) State plan requirements. A State plan must provide that the 
requirements of this section and Sec. 488.325 of this chapter are met.
    (d) Disclosure procedure. The Medicaid agency must have a procedure 
for disclosing pertinent findings obtained from surveys made by the 
State survey agency to determine if a health care facility, laboratory, 
agency, clinic or

[[Page 32]]

health care organization meets the requirements for participation in the 
Medicaid program.
    (e) Documents subject to disclosure. Documents subject to disclosure 
include--
    (1) Survey reports, except for Joint Commission on the Accreditation 
of Hospitals reports prohibited from disclosure under Sec. 422.426(b)(2) 
of this chapter;
    (2) Official notifications of findings based on survey reports:
    (3) Pertinent parts of written documents furnished by the health 
care provider to the survey agency that relate to the reports and 
findings; and
    (4) Ownership and contract information as specified in Sec. 455.104 
of this subchapter.
    (f) Availability for inspection and copy of statements listing 
deficiencies. The disclosure procedure must provide that the State 
survey agency will--
    (1) Make statements of deficiencies based on the survey reports 
available for inspection and copying in both the public assistance 
office and the Social Security Administration district office serving 
the area where the provider is located; and
    (2) Submit to the Regional Medicaid Director, through the Medicaid 
agency, a plan for making those findings available in other public 
assistance offices in standard metropolitian statistical areas where 
this information would be helpful to persons likely to use the health 
care provider's services.
    (g) When documents must be made available. The disclosure procedure 
must provide that the State survey agency will--
    (1) Retain in the survey agency office and make available upon 
request survey reports and current and accurate ownership information; 
and
    (2) Make available survey reports, findings, and deficiency 
statements immediately upon determining that a health care provider is 
eligible to begin or continue participation in the Medicaid program, or 
within 90 days after completion of the survey, whichever occurs first.
    (h) Evaluation reports on providers and contractors. (1) If the 
Secretary sends the following reports to the Medicaid agency, the agency 
must meet the requirements of paragraphs (h) (2) and (3) of this section 
in releasing them:
    (i) Individual contractor performance reviews and other formal 
performance evaluations of carriers, intermediaries, and State agencies, 
including the reports of followup reviews;
    (ii) Comparative performance evaluations of those contractors, 
including comparisons of either overall performance or of any particular 
aspect of contractor operations; and
    (iii) Program validation survey reports and other formal performance 
evaluations of providers, including the reports of followup reviews.
    (2) The agency must not make the reports public until--
    (i) The contractor or provider has had a reasonable opportunity, not 
to exceed 30 days, to comment on them; and
    (ii) Those comments have been incorporated in the report.
    (3) The agency must ensure that the reports contain no 
identification of individual patients, individual health care 
practitioners or other individuals.

Sec. 431.153  Evidentiary hearing.

    (a) Right to hearing. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, and subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (j) of 
this section, the State must give the facility a full evidentiary 
hearing for any of the actions specified in Sec. 431.151.
    (b) Limit on grounds for appeal. The following are not subject to 
appeal:
    (1) The choice of sanction or remedy.
    (2) The State monitoring remedy.
    (3) The loss of approval for a nurse-aide training program.
    (4) The level of noncompliance found by a State except when a 
favorable final administrative review decision would affect the range of 
civil money penalty amounts the State could collect.
    (5) A State survey agency's decision as to when to conduct an 
initial survey of a prospective provider.
    (c) Notice of deficiencies and impending remedies. The State must 
give the facility a written notice that includes:
    (1) The basis for the decision; and
    (2) A statement of the deficiencies on which the decision was based.
    (d) Request for hearing. The facility or its legal representative or 
other authorized official must file written request for hearing within 
60 days of receipt of the notice of adverse action.
    (e) Special rules: Denial, termination or nonrenewal of provider 
agreement. (1) Appeal by an ICF/MR. If an ICF/MR requests a hearing on 
denial, termination, or nonrenewal of its provider agreement--
    (i) The evidentiary hearing must be completed either before, or 
within 120 days after, the effective date of the adverse action; and
    (ii) If the hearing is made available only after the effective date 
of the action, the State must, before that date, offer the ICF/MR an 
informal reconsideration that meets the requirements of Sec. 431.154.
    (2) Appeal by an NF. If an NF requests a hearing on the denial or 
termination of its provider agreement, the request does not delay the 
adverse action and the hearing need not be completed before the 
effective date of the action.
    (f) Special rules: Imposition of remedies. If a State imposes a 
civil money penalty or other remedies on an NF, the following rules 
apply:
    (1) Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section (and notwithstanding any provision of State law), the State must 
impose all remedies timely on the NF, even if the NF requests a hearing.

[[Page 34]]

    (2) Exception. The State may not collect a civil money penalty until 
after the 60-day period for request of hearing has elapsed or, if the NF 
requests a hearing, until issuance of a final administrative decision 
that supports imposition of the penalty.
    (g) Special rules: Dually participating facilities. If an NF is also 
participating or seeking to participate in Medicare as an SNF, and the 
basis for the State's denial or termination of participation in Medicaid 
is also a basis for denial or termination of participation in Medicare, 
the State must advise the facility that--
    (1) The appeals procedures specified for Medicare facilities in part 
498 of this chapter apply; and
    (2) A final decision entered under the Medicare appeals procedures 
is binding for both programs.
    (h) Special rules: Adverse action by HCFA. If HCFA finds that an NF 
is not in substantial compliance and either terminates the NF's Medicaid 
provider agreement or imposes alternative remedies on the NF (because 
HCFA's findings and proposed remedies prevail over those of the State in 
accordance with Sec. 488.452 of this chapter), the NF is entitled only 
to the appeals procedures set forth in part 498 of this chapter, instead 
of the procedures specified in this subpart.
    (i) Required elements of hearing. The hearing must include at least 
the following:
    (1) Opportunity for the facility--
    (i) To appear before an impartial decision-maker to refute the 
finding of noncompliance on which the adverse action was based;
    (ii) To be represented by counsel or other representative; and

<R05>
Sec. 431.625  Coordination of Medicaid with Medicare part B.

    (a) Basis and purpose. (1) Section 1843(a) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to have entered into an agreement with any State that 
requested that agreement before January 1, 1970, or during calendar year 
1981, under which the State could enroll certain Medicare-eligible 
recipients under Medicare Part B and agree to pay their premiums.
    (2) Section 1902(a)(10) of the Act (in clause (II) following 
subparagraph (D)), allows the State to pay the premium, deductibles, 
cost sharing, and other

[[Page 45]]

charges for recipients enrolled under Medicare Part B without obligating 
itself to provide the range of Part B benefits to other recipients; and
    (3) Section 1903 (a)(1) and (b) of the Act authorizes FFP for State 
payment of Medicare Part B premiums for certain recipients.
    (4) This section--
    (i) Specifies the exception, relating to Part B coverage, from the 
requirement to provide comparable services to all recipients; and
    (ii) Prescribes FFP rules concerning State payment for Medicare 
premiums and for services that could have been covered under Medicare.
    (5) Section 1902(a)(15) of the Act requires that if a State chooses 
to pay only a portion of deductibles, cost sharing or other charges for 
recipients enrolled under Medicare Part B, the portion that is to be 
paid by a Medicaid recipient must be reasonably related to the 
recipient's income and resources.
    (b) Exception from obligation to provide comparable services; State 
plan requirement. (1) The State's payment of premiums, deductibles, cost 
sharing, or similar charges under Part B does not obligate it to provide 
the full range of Part B services to recipients not covered by Medicare.
    (2) The State plan must specify this exception if it applies.
    (c) Effect of payment of premiums on State liability for cost 
sharing. (1) State payment of Part B premiums on behalf of a Medicaid 
recipient does not obligate it to pay on the recipient's behalf the Part 
B deductible and coinsurance amounts for those Medicare Part B services 
not covered in the Medicaid State plan.
    (2) If a State pays on a recipient's behalf any portion of the 
deductible or cost sharing amounts under Medicare Part B, the portion 
paid by a State must be reasonably related to the recipient's income and 
resources.
    (d) Federal financial participation: Medicare Part B premiums--(1) 
Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, FFP 
is not available in State expenditures for Medicare Part B premiums for 
Medicaid recipients unless the recipients receive money payments under 
title I, IV-A, X, XIV, XVI (AABD or SSI) of the Act, or State 
supplements as permitted under section 1616(a) of the Act, or as 
required by section 212 of Pub. L. 93-66.
    (2) Exception. FFP is available in expenditures for Medicare Part B 
premiums for the following groups:
    (i) AFDC families required to be covered under Secs. 435.112 and 
436.116 of this subchapter, those eligible for continued Medicaid 
coverage despite increased income from employment;
    (ii) Recipients required to be covered under Secs. 435.114, 435.134, 
and 436.112 of this subchapter, those eligible for continued Medicaid 
coverage despite increased income from monthly insurance benefits under 
title II of the Act;
    (iii) Recipients required to be covered under Sec. 435.135 of this 
subchapter, those eligible for continued Medicaid coverage despite 
increased income from cost-of-living increases under title II of the 
Act;
    (iv) Recipients of foster care maintenance payments or adoption 
assistance payments who, under Part E of title IV of the Act are 
considered as receiving AFDC;
    (v) Individuals required to be covered under Sec. 435.120 of this 
chapter, that is, blind or disabled individuals who, under section 
1619(b) of the Act, are considered to be receiving SSI;
    (vi) Individuals who, in accordance with Secs. 435.115 and 436.114 
of this chapter are, for purposes of Medicaid eligibility, considered to 
be receiving AFDC. These are participants in a work supplementation 
program, or individuals denied AFDC because the payment would be less 
than $10;
    (vii) Certain recipients of Veterans Administration pensions during 
the limited time they are, under section 310(b) of Pub. L. 96-272, 
considered as receiving SSI, mandatory State supplements, or AFDC;
    (viii) Disabled children living at home to whom the State provides 
Medicaid under section 1902(e)(3) of the Act;
    (ix) Individuals who become ineligible for AFDC because of the 
collection or increased collection of child or spousal support, but, in 
accordance with section 406(h) of the Act, remain eligible for Medicaid 
for four more months; and
    (x) Individuals who become ineligible for AFDC because they are no 
longer

[[Page 46]]

eligible for the disregard of earnings of $30 or of $30 plus one-third 
of the remainder, but, in accordance with section 402(a)(37) of the Act, 
are considered as receiving AFDC for a period of 9 to 15 months.
    (3) No FFP is available in State Medicaid expenditures that could 
have been paid for under Medicare Part B but were not because the person 
was not enrolled in Part B. This limit applies to all recipients 
eligible for enrollment under Part B, whether individually or through an 
agreement under section 1843(a) of the Act. However, FFP is available in 
expenditures required by Secs. 435.914 and 436.901 of this subchapter 
for retroactive coverage of recipients.

<R05>
Sec. 431.630  Coordination of Medicaid with PROs.

    (a) The State plan may provide for the review of Medicaid services 
through a contract with a PRO designated under Part 462 of this chapter. 
Medicaid requirements for medical and utilization review are deemed to 
be met for those services or providers subject to review under the 
contract.
    (b) The State plan must provide that the contract with the PRO--
    (1) Meets the requirements of Sec. 434.6(a) of this part;
    (2) Includes a monitoring and evaluation plan by which the State 
ensures satisfactory performance by the PRO;
    (3) Identifies the services and providers subject to PRO review;
    (4) Ensures that the review activities performed by the PRO are not 
inconsistent with PRO review activities of Medicare services and 
includes a description of whether and to what extent PRO determinations 
will be considered conclusive for Medicaid payment purposes.

the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC) under section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.

    (1) Coordinating operation of the Medicaid program with the State's 
operation of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants,

determination for Medicaid) or immediately thereafter (e.g., at the time 
of notice of eligibility).
    (2) The agency, no less frequently than annually, must also provide 
written notice of the availability of WIC benefits, including the 
location and telephone number of the local WIC agency or instructions

<R05>
Sec. 431.800  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart--
    (a) Establishes State plan requirements for a Medicaid eligibility 
quality control (MEQC) program designed to reduce erroneous expenditures 
by monitoring eligibility determinations and a claims processing 
assessment system that monitors claims processing operations.
    (b) Establishes rules and procedures for disallowing Federal 
financial participation (FFP) in erroneous Medicaid

[[Page 49]]

payments due to eligibility and recipient liability errors as detected 
through the MEQC program.


<R05>
Sec. 431.802  Basis.

    This subpart implements the following sections of the Act, which 
establish requirements for State plans and for payment of Federal 
financial participation (FFP) to States:

    1902(a)(4) Administrative methods for proper and efficient operation 
of the State plan.
    1903(u) Limitation of FFP for erroneous medical assistance 
expenditures.


<R05>
Sec. 431.804  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Active case means an individual or family determined to be currently 
authorized as eligible for Medicaid by the agency.
    Administrative period means the period of time recognized by the 
MEQC program for State agencies to reflect changes in case 
circumstances, i.e., a change in a common program area, during which no 
case error based on the circumstance change would be cited. This period 
consists of the review month and the month prior to the review month.
    Claims processing error means FFP has been claimed for a Medicaid 
payment that was made--
    (1) For a service not authorized under the State plan;
    (2) To a provider not certified for participation in the Medicaid 
program;
    (3) For a service already paid for by Medicaid; or
    (4) In an amount above the allowable reimbursement level for that 
service.
    Eligibility error means that Medicaid coverage has been authorized 
or payment has been made for a recipient or family under review who--
    (1) Was ineligible when authorized or when he received services; or
    (2) Was eligible for Medicaid but was ineligible for certain 
services he received; or
    (3) Had not met recipient liability requirements when authorized 
eligible for Medicaid; that is, he had not incurred medical expenses 
equal to the amount of his excess income over the State's financial 
eligibility level or he had incurred medical expenses that exceeded the 
amount of excess income over the State's financial eligibility level, or 
was making an incorrect amount of payment toward the cost of services.
    Negative case action means an action that was taken to deny or 
otherwise dispose of a Medicaid application without a determination of 
eligibility (for instance, because the application was withdrawn or 
abandoned) or an action to deny, suspend, or terminate an individual or 
family.
    State agency means either the State Medicaid agency or a State 
agency that is responsible for determining eligibility for Medicaid.


<R05>
Sec. 431.806  State plan requirements.

    (a) MEQC program. A State plan must provide for operating a Medicaid 
eligibility quality control program that meets the requirements of 
Secs. 431.810 through 431.822 of this subpart.
    (b) Claims processing assessment system. Except in a State that has 
an approved Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) under subpart 
C of part 433 of this subchapter, a State plan must provide for 
operating a Medicaid quality control claims processing assessment system 
that meets the requirements of Secs. 431.830 through 431.836 of this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 431.808  Protection of recipient rights.

    Any individual performing activities under the MEQC program or the 
claims processing assessment system specified in this subpart must do so 
in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of Secs. 435.902 and 
436.901 of this subchapter concerning the rights of recipients.

    Source: Sections 431.810 through 431.822 appear at 55 FR 22167, May 
31, 1990, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 431.810  Basic elements of the Medicaid eligibility quality control (MEQC) program.

    (a) General requirements. The agency must operate the MEQC program 
in accordance with this section and Secs. 431.812 through 431.822 and 
other instructions established by HCFA.

[[Page 50]]

    (b) Review requirements. The agency must conduct MEQC reviews in 
accordance with the requirements specified in Sec. 431.812 and other 
instructions established by HCFA.
    (c) Sampling requirements. The agency must conduct MEQC sampling in 
accordance with the requirements specified in Sec. 431.814 and other 
instructions established by HCFA.


<R05>
Sec. 431.812  Review procedures.

    (a) Active case reviews. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, the agency must review all active cases selected from 
the State agency's lists of cases authorized eligible for the review 
month, to determine if the cases were eligible for services during all 
or part of the month under review, and, if appropriate, whether the 
proper amount of recipient liability was computed.
    (2) The agency is not required to conduct reviews of the following 
cases:
    (i) Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipient cases in States 
with contracts under section 1634 of the Act for determining Medicaid 
eligibility;
    (ii) Foster care and adoption assistance cases under title IV-E of 
the Act found eligible for Medicaid; and
    (iii) Cases under programs that are 100 percent federally funded.
    (b) Negative case reviews. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section, the agency must review those negative cases selected from 
the State agency's lists of cases that are denied, suspended, or 
terminated in the review month to determine if the reason for the 
denial, suspension, or termination was correct and if requirements for 
timely notice of negative action were met. A State's negative case 
sample size is determined on the basis of the number of negative case 
actions in the universe.
    (c) Alternate systems of negative case reviews--(1) Basic provision. 
A State may be exempt from the negative case review requirements 
specified in paragraphs (b) and (e)(2) of this section and in 
Sec. 431.814(d) upon HCFA's approval of a plan for the use of a superior 
system.
    (2) Submittal of plan for alternate system. An agency must submit 
its plan for the use of a superior system to HCFA for approval at least 
60 days before the beginning of the review period in which it is to be 
implemented. If a plan is unchanged from a previous period, the agency 
is not required to resubmit it.

The agency must receive approval for a plan before it can be 
implemented.
    (3) Requirement for alternate system. To be approved, the State's 
plan must--
    (i) Clearly define the purpose of the system and demonstrate how the 
system is superior to the current negative case review requirements.
    (ii) Contain a methodology for identifying significant problem areas 
that could result in erroneous denials, suspensions, and terminations of 
applicants and recipients. Problem areas selected for review must 
contain at least as many applicants and recipients as were included in 
the negative case sample size previously required for the State.
    (iii) Provide a detailed methodology describing how the extent of 
the problem area will be measured through sampling and review 
procedures, the findings expected from the review, and planned 
corrective actions to resolve the problem.
    (iv) Include documentation supporting the use of the system 
methodology. Documentation must include the timeframes under which the 
system will be operated.
    (v) Provide a superior means of monitoring denials, terminations, 
and suspensions than that required under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (vi) Provide a statistically valid error rate that can be projected 
to the universe that is being studied.
    (d) Reviews for erroneous payments. The agency must review all 
claims for services furnished during the review month and paid within 4 
months of the review month to all members of each active case related in 
the sample to identify erroneous payments resulting from--
    (1) Ineligibility for Medicaid;
    (2) Ineligibility for certain Medicaid services; and
    (3) Recipient understated or overstated liability.
    (e) Reviews for verification of eligibility status. The agency must 
collect and verify all information necessary to determine the 
eligibility status of each

[[Page 51]]

individual included in an active case selected in the sample as of the 
review month and whether Medicaid payments were for services which the 
individual was eligible to receive.

The agency must apply the administrative period described in 
Sec. 431.804 when considering the case circumstances and the case 
correctness. In order to verify eligibility information, the agency 
must--
    (1) Examine and analyze each case record for all cases under review 
to establish what information is available for use in determining 
eligibility in the review month;
    (2) Conduct field investigations including in-person recipient 
interviews for each case in the active case sample, and conduct in-
person interviews only when the correctness of the agency action cannot 
be determined by review of the case record with recipients for cases in 
the negative case action sample (unless this is otherwise addressed in a 
superior system provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section);
    (3) Verify all appropriate elements of eligibility for active cases 
through at least one primary source of evidence or two secondary sources 
of evidence as defined by HCFA by documentation or by collateral 
contacts as required, or both, and fully record the information on the 
appropriate forms;
    (4) Determine the basis on which eligibility was established and the 
eligibility status of the active case and each case member;
    (5) Collect copies of State paid claims or recipient profiles for 
services delivered during the review month and, if indicated, any months 
prior to the review month in the agency's selected spenddown period, for 
all members of the active case under review;
    (6) Associate dollar values with eligibility status for each active 
case under review; and
    (7) Complete the payment, case, and review information for all 
individuals in the active case under review on the appropriate forms.


<R05>
Sec. 431.814  Sampling plan and procedures.

    (a) Plan approval. The agency must submit a basic MEQC sampling plan 
(or revisions to a current plan) that meets the requirements of this 
section to the appropriate HCFA regional office for approval at least 60 
days before the beginning of the review period in which it is to be 
implemented. If a plan is unchanged from a previous period, the agency 
is not required to resubmit the entire plan. Universe estimates and 
sampling intervals are required 2 weeks before the first monthly sample 
selection for each review period. The agency must receive approval for a 
plan before it can be implemented.
    (b) Plan requirements. The agency must have an approved sampling 
plan in effect for the full 6-month sampling period that includes the 
following:
    (1) The population to be sampled;
    (2) The list(s) from which the sample is selected and the following 
characteristics of the list(s):
    (i) Sources;
    (ii) All types of cases in the selection lists;
    (iii) Accuracy and completeness of sample lists in reference to the 
population(s) of interest;
    (iv) Whether or not the selection list was constructed by combining 
more than one list;
    (v) The form of the selection list (whether the list or part of the 
list is automated);
    (vi) Frequency and length of delays in updating the selection lists 
or their sources;
    (vii) Number of items on the lists and proportion of listed-in-error 
items:
    (viii) Methods of deleting unwanted items from the selection lists; 
and
    (ix) Structure of the selection lists.
    (3) The sample size, including the minimum number of reviews to be 
completed and the expected number of cases to be selected. Minimum 
sample sizes are based on the State's relative level of Medicaid annual 
expenditures for services for active cases, and on the total number of 
negative case actions in the universe for negative cases. When the 
sample is substratified, there can be no fewer than 75 cases in each 
substratum, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or as 
provided in an exception documented in an approved sampling plan which 
contains a statement accepting the precision and reliability of the 
reduced sample.

[[Page 52]]

    (4) The sample selection procedure. Systematic random sampling is 
recommended. Alternative procedures must provide a representative 
sample, conform to principles of probability sampling, and yield 
estimates with the same or better precision than achieved in systematic 
random sampling.
    (5) Procedures used to identify amounts paid for services received 
in the review month.
    (6) Specification as to whether the agency chooses to--
    (i) Use billed amounts to offset recipient liability toward cost of 
care (No indication will be interpreted to mean that the agency will use 
paid claims); and
    (ii) Use denied claims to offset recipient liability toward cost of 
care in the payment review. (No indication will be interpreted to mean 
denied claims will not be used.)
    (7) Indication of whether the agency opts to drop or complete cases 
selected more than once in a sample period. (No indication will be 
interpreted to mean that the agency will complete cases selected more 
than once.)
    (c) Eligibility universe--active cases. The MEQC universe for active 
cases must be divided into two strata, the Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children (AFDC) stratum and the Medical Assistance Only (MAO) 
stratum.
    (1) All States must use the AFDC quality control sample for the AFDC 
stratum.
    (2) States must include in the MAO stratum all cases certified as 
eligible for Medicaid that are not in the AFDC stratum, excluding 
individuals specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (3) States that do not have an agreement with the Social Security 
Administration under section 1634 of the Act and do not have more 
restrictive eligibility criteria under section 1902(f) of the Act but 
require a separate Medicaid application for recipients of SSI and 
determine Medicaid eligibility using SSI criteria must divide the MAO 
stratum into two substrata: MAO cases and SSI cash cases for the first 
review period beginning after July 1, 1990 and for review periods 
thereafter. The SSI substratum sample size must be 75 cases or one-half 
of the total MAO sample, whichever is smaller. The non-SSI MAO 
substratum sample will be the remainder of the MAO stratum cases.

States may be exempt from this requirement when implementing an approved 
sampling option that does not accommodate this stratification method.
    (4) States must exclude from the MEQC universe SSI beneficiaries 
whose eligibility determinations were made exclusively by the Social 
Security Administration under an agreement under section 1634 of the 
Act, individuals in foster care or receiving adoption assistance whose 
eligibility is determined under title IV-E of the Act, and individuals 
receiving Medicaid under programs that are 100 percent federally funded.
    (d) Eligibility universe--negative cases. Unless the agency has an 
approved superior system under Sec. 431.812(c) that provides otherwise, 
the universe for negative Medicaid eligibility cases must consist of all 
denied applications, suspensions, and terminations occurring during the 
review month except transfers between counties without any break in 
eligibility, cases in which eligibility is exclusively determined by SSA 
under a section 1634 contract, cases determined eligible for foster care 
and adoption assistance under title IV-E of the Act, and cases under 
programs that are 100 percent federally funded.
    (e) Sampling procedures. The agency must document all sampling 
procedures used by the State agency, including 98 percent accuracy of 
program identifier codes used in the sampling frame to separate listed-
in-error cases from those in the population of interest, must make them 
available for review by HCFA, and must be able to demonstrate the 
integrity of its sampling procedures in accordance with this section.
    (f) Sampling periods. The agency must use 6-month sampling periods, 
from April through September and from October through March.
    (g) Statistical samples. The agency must select statistically valid 
samples of both active and negative case actions.
    (h) Sample selection lists. The agency must submit to HCFA monthly a 
list of

[[Page 53]]

cases selected in the sample to be reviewed, after the State's sample 
selection and before commencing MEQC reviews on the cases in the sample.
    (i) Universe estimates and sampling intervals. The agency must 
submit detailed universe estimates and sampling intervals to HCFA for 
approval at least 2 weeks before the first sample selection of the 
review period if the estimates differ from the previous period. The 
sampling intervals must be used continuously throughout the sampling 
period unless otherwise specified in an approved sampling plan. Final 
universe counts based on the actual sampling universe must be determined 
and reported to HCFA for each stratum/substratum designated in the 
sampling plan.

The agency also must submit universe counts for cases eligible for 
foster care and adoption assistance under title IV-E of the Act, and, 
for States with an agreement under section 1634 of the Act, for cases 
found eligible by the Social Security Administration.
    (j) Sample size and methodology options. The agency may select a 
sample size in accordance with the minimum established under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section or use one of the methodologies specified in 
paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) Increase in size. The agency may, at its option, increase its 
sample size for a sampling period above the federally prescribed minimum 
sample size provided for under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and 
receive FFP for any increased administrative costs the agency incurs by 
exercising this option.
    (2) Retrospective sampling. The agency may, at its option, implement 
retrospective sampling in which cases are stratified by dollar value of 
claims paid. If the agency selects retrospective sampling, it must--
    (i) Draw an initial case sample size each month that is no less than 
5 times the required sample size. The sample will be selected from the 
universe of cases that were certified eligible in the fourth month prior 
to the month of case selection;
    (ii) Identify claims paid for services furnished to all individuals 
during the review month (and, if indicated, any months prior to the 
review month in the agency's selected spenddown period) for these cases;
    (iii) Stratify the cases by dollar value of the claims into three 
strata; and
    (iv) Select a second statistically valid sample within each group 
subject to the sample size requirements specified in paragraph (b)(3) or 
(j)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 431.816  Case review completion deadlines and submittal of reports.

    (a) The agency must complete case reviews and submit reports of 
findings to HCFA as specified in paragraph (b) of this section in the 
form and at the time specified by HCFA.
    (b) In addition to the reporting requirements specified in 
Sec. 431.814 relating to sampling, the agency must complete case reviews 
and submit reports of findings to HCFA in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (6) of this section for review periods beginning after 
July 1, 1990.The agency must not combine or otherwise integrate case 
findings from the MAO and AFDC strata to meet the case percentage 
deadlines as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.
    (1) Active case eligibility reviews--MAO stratum. (i) The agency 
must complete case eligibility reviews and report the findings 
electronically through the system prescribed by HCFA for 90 percent of 
all active MAO cases within 105 days of the end of the review month for 
which those cases were reviewed, within 125 days for 95 percent of all 
active MAO cases, and within 150 days for 100 percent of all MAO active 
cases.
    (ii) The agency must submit a report on cases selected for the 
review month.
    (2) Active case eligibility reviews--AFDC stratum. (i) The agency 
must complete case eligibility reviews for AFDC ineligible and overpaid 
error cases caused by ineligible individuals and report the findings 
electronically through the system prescribed by HCFA within 105 days of 
the end of the review month for which those cases were reviewed for 90 
percent of the total reviews; within 125 days of the end of the review 
month for which those cases were reviewed for 95 percent of the total 
reviews; and within

[[Page 54]]

150 days of the end of the review month for which those cases were 
reviewed for 100 percent of the total reviews.
    (ii) The agency must report findings electronically through the 
system prescribed by HCFA for 100 percent of the State agency-reported 
eligible individuals within 30 days after the final timeframe required 
by the AFDC program as specified in program regulations at 45 CFR 
205.40(b)(2)(ii).
    (3) Negative case eligibility reviews. The agency must submit a 
monthly progress report on negative case reviews completed during the 
month unless the agency has an approved superior system in effect. The 
agency must submit a report on its findings by June 30 of each year for 
the previous April-September sampling period and by December 31, for the 
October-March sampling period.
    (4) Payment reviews. (i) The agency must submit payment review 
findings electronically through the system prescribed by HCFA.
    (ii) The agency must complete payment review findings for 100 
percent of the active case reviews in its sample and report the findings 
within 60 days after the first day of the month in which the claims 
collection process begins. The agency must wait 5 months after the end 
of each review month before associating the amount of claims paid for 
each case for services furnished during the review month unless 
retrospective sampling is elected.
    (iii) The agency must make any necessary corrections to claims 
payments during the month the claim is paid and the following month. 
HCFA will take necessary action to reject any State adjustment adversely 
affecting the error rate, for example, by not paying claims on error 
cases.
    (5) Summary of reviews and findings. The agency must submit summary 
reports of the findings for all active cases in the 6-month sample by 
July 31 of each year for the previous April-September sampling period 
and by January 31 for the October-March sampling period. These summary 
reports must include findings changed in the Federal re-review process.
    (6) Other data and reports. The agency must report other requested 
data and reports in a manner prescribed by HCFA.


<R05>
Sec. 431.818  Access to records: MEQC program.

    (a) The agency, upon written request, must mail to the HHS staff all 
records, including complete local agency eligibility case files or 
legible copies and all other documents pertaining to its MEQC reviews to 
which the State has access, including information available under part 
435, subpart I, of this chapter.
    (b) The agency must mail requested records within 10 working days of 
receipt of a request, unless the State has an alternate method of 
submitting these records that is approved by HCFA or has received, on an 
as-needed basis, approval from HCFA to extend this timeframe by 3 
additional working days to allow for exceptional circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 431.820  Corrective action under the MEQC program.

    The agency must--
    (a) Take action to correct any active or negative case action errors 
found in the sample cases;
    (b) Take administrative action to prevent or reduce the incidence of 
those errors; and
    (c) By September 15 each year, submit to HCFA a report on its error 
rate analysis and a corrective action plan based on that analysis. The 
agency must submit revisions to the plan within 60 days of 
identification of additional error-prone areas, other significant 
changes in the error rate (that is, changes that the State experiences 
that increase or decrease its error rate and necessitate immediate 
corrective action or discontinuance of corrective actions that 
effectively control the cause of the error rate change), or changes in 
planned corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 431.822  Resolution of differences in State and Federal case eligibility or payment findings.

    (a) When a difference exists between State and Federal case 
eligibility or payment findings, the Regional Office will notify the 
agency by a difference letter.

[[Page 55]]

    (b) The agency must return the difference letter to the Regional 
Office within 28 calendar days of the date of the letter indicating 
either agreement with the Federal finding or reasons for disagreement 
and if the agency desires a conference to resolve the difference. This 
period may be shortened if the Regional Office finds that it is 
necessary to do so in order to meet a case completion deadline, and the 
State still has a reasonable period of time in which to respond to the 
letter. If the agency fails to submit the difference letter indicating 
its agreement or disagreement with the Federal findings within the 28 
calendar days (or the shorter period designated as described above), the 
Federal findings will be sustained.
    (c) If the Regional Office disagrees with the agency's response, a 
difference conference will be scheduled within 20 days of the request of 
the agency. If a difference cannot be resolved, the State may request a 
direct presentation of its position to the Regional Administrator. The 
Regional Administrator has final authority for resolving the difference.

                     Federal Financial Participation


<R05>
 431.861-431.864  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 431.865  Disallowance of Federal financial participation for erroneous State payments (for annual assessment periods ending after July 1, 1990).

    (a) Purpose and applicability--
    (1) Purpose. This section establishes rules and procedures for 
disallowing Federal financial participation (FFP) in erroneous medical 
assistance payments due to eligibility and beneficiary liability errors, 
as detected through the Medicaid eligibility quality control (MEQC) 
program required under Sec. 431.806 in effect on and after July 1, 1990.
    (2) Applicability. This section applies to all States except Puerto 
Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and 
American Samoa beginning July 1, 1990.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    Administrator means the Administrator, Health Care Financing 
Administration or his or her designee.
    Annual assessment period means the 12-month period October 1 through 
September 30 and includes two 6-month sample periods (October-March and 
April-September).
    Beneficiary liability means--
    (1) The amount of excess income that must be offset with incurred 
medical expenses to gain eligibility; or
    (2) The amount of payment a recipient must make toward the cost of 
services.
    Erroneous payments means the Medicaid payment that was made for an 
individual or family under review who--
    (1) Was ineligible for the review month or, in full month coverage 
is not provided, at the time services were received;
    (2) Was ineligible to receive a service provided during the review 
month; or
    (3) Had not properly met beneficiary liability prior to receiving 
Medicaid services.
    National mean error rate means the payment weighted average of the 
eligibility payment error rates for all States.
    National standard means a 3-percent eligibility payment error rate.
    State payment error rate means the ratio of erroneous payments for 
medical assistance to total expenditures for medical assistance (less 
payments to Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries in section 1634 
contract States and payments for children eligible for foster care and 
adoption assistance under title IV-E of the Act) for cases under review 
under the MEQC system for each assessment period.
    Technical error means an error in an eligibility condition that, if 
corrected, would not result in a difference in the amount of medical 
assistance paid. These errors include work incentive program 
requirements, assignment of social security numbers, the requirement for 
a separate Medicaid application, monthly reporting requirements, 
assignment of rights to third party benefits, and failure to apply for 
benefits for which the family or individual is not eligible. Errors 
other than those listed in this definition, identified by HCFA in 
subsequent instructions, or approved by HCFA are not technical errors.
    (c) Setting of State's payment error rate. (1) Each State must, for 
each annual assessment period, have a payment error rate no greater than 
3 percent or be subject to a disallowance of FFP.
    (2) A payment error rate for each State is determined by HCFA for 
each annual assessment period by computing the statistical estimate of 
the ratio of erroneous payments for medical assistance made on behalf of 
individuals or cases in the sample for services received during the 
review month to total expenditures for medical assistance for that State 
made on behalf of individuals or cases in the sample for services 
received during the review month. This ratio incorporates the findings 
of a federally re-reviewed subsample of the State's review findings and 
is projected to the universe of total medical assistance payments for 
calculating the amount of disallowance under paragraph (d)6) of this 
section.
    (3) The State's payment error rate does not include payments made on 
behalf of individuals whose eligibility determinations were made 
exclusively by the Social Security Administration under an agreement 
under section 1634 of the Act or children found eligible for

[[Page 57]]

foster care and adoption assistance under title IV-E of the Act.
    (4) The amount of erroneous payments is determined as follows:
    (i) For ineligible cases resulting from excess resources, the amount 
of error is the lesser of--
    (A) The amount of the payment made on behalf of the family or 
individual for the review month; or
    (B) The difference between the actual amount of countable resources 
of the family or individual for the review month and the State's 
applicable resources standard.
    (ii) For ineligible cases resulting from other than excess 
resources, the amount of error is the total amount of medical assistance 
payments made for the individual or family under review for the review 
month.
    (iii) For erroneous payments resulting from failure to properly meet 
beneficiary liability, the amount of error is the lesser of--
    (A) The amount of payments made on behalf of the family or 
individual for the review month; or
    (B) The difference between the correct amount of beneficiary 
liability and the amount of beneficiary liability met by the individual 
or family for the review month.
    (iv) The amount of payments made for services provided during the 
review month for which the individual or family was not eligible.
    (5) In determining the amount of erroneous payments, errors caused 
by technical errors are not included.
    (6) If a State fails to cooperate in completing a valid MEQC sample 
or individual reviews in a timely and appropriate fashion as required, 
HCFA will establish the State's payment error rate based on either--
    (i) A special sample or audit;
    (ii) The Federal subsample; or
    (iii) Other arrangements as the Administrator may prescribe.
    (7) When it is necessary for HCFA to exercise the authority in 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the amount that would otherwise be 
payable to the State under title XIX of the Act is reduced by the full 
costs incurred by HCFA in making these determinations. HCFA may make 
these determinations either directly or under contractual or other 
arrangements.
    (d) Computation of anticipated error rate. (1) Before the beginning 
of each quarter, HCFA will project the anticipated medical assistance 
payment error rate for each State for that quarter. The anticipated 
error rate is the lower of the weighted average error rate of the two 
most recent 6-month review periods or the error rate of the most recent 
6-month review period. In either case, cases in the review periods must 
have been completed by the State and HCFA. If a State fails to provide 
HCFA with information needed to project anticipated excess erroneous 
expenditures, HCFA will assign the State an error rate as prescribed in 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
    (2) If the State believes that the anticipated error rate 
established in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section is based 
on erroneous data, the State may submit evidence that demonstrates the 
data were erroneous. If the State satisfactorily demonstrates that 
HCFA's data were erroneous, the State's anticipated error rate will be 
adjusted accordingly. Submittal of evidence is subject to the following 
conditions:
    (i) The State must inform HCFA of its intent to submit evidence at 
least 70 days prior to the beginning of the quarter.
    (ii) The State may request copies of data that HCFA used to compute 
its anticipated error rate within 7 days of receiving notification of 
its projected error rate.
    (iii) The State has up to 40 days before the quarter begins to 
present the evidence.
    (iv) The evidence is restricted to documentation of suspected HCFA 
data entry errors, processing errors, and resolutions of Federal 
subsample difference cases subsequent to calculation of the error rate 
projection as contained in the original notice to the State.
    (v) The State may not submit other evidence, such as that consisting 
of revisions to State errors as a result of changes to the original 
State review findings submitted to HCFA.

[[Page 58]]

    (vi) The State may not submit evidence challenging the error rate 
computational methodology.
    (3) Based on the anticipated error rate established in paragraph 
(d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, HCFA reduces its estimate of the 
State's requirements for FFP for medical assistance for the quarter by 
the percentage by which the anticipated payment error rate exceeds the 
3-percent national standard. This reduction is applied against HCFA's 
total estimate of FFP for medical assistance expenditures (less payments 
to Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries in 1634 contract States 
and payments to children found eligible for foster care and adoption 
assistance under title IV-E of the Act) prior to any other required 
reductions. The reduction is noted on the State's grant award for the 
quarter and does not constitute a disallowance, and, therefore, is not 
appealable.
    (4) After the end of each quarter, an adjustment to the reduction 
will be made based on the State's actual expenditures.
    (5) After the actual payment error rate has been established for 
each annual assessment period, HCFA will compute the actual amount of 
the disallowance and adjust the FFP payable to each State based on the 
difference between the amounts previously withheld for each of the 
quarters during the appropriate assessment period and the amount that 
should have been withheld based on the State's actual final error rate. 
If HCFA determines that the amount withheld for the period exceeds the 
amount of the actual disallowance, the excess amount withheld will be 
returned to the States through the normal grant awards process within 30 
days of the date the actual disallowance is calculated.
    (6) HCFA will compute the amount to be withheld or disallowed as 
follows:
    (i) Subtract the 3-percent national standard from the State's 
anticipated or actual payment error rate percentage.
    (ii) If the difference is greater than zero, the Federal medical 
assistance funds for the period, excluding payments for those 
individuals whose eligibility for Medicaid was determined exclusively by 
the Social Security Administration under a section 1634 agreement and 
children found eligible for foster care and adoption assistance under 
title IV-E of the Act, are multiplied by that percentage. This product 
is the amount of the disallowance or withholding.
    (7) A State's payment error rate for an annual assessment period is 
the weighted average of the payment error rates in the two 6-month 
review periods comprising the annual assessment period.
    (8) The weights are established as the percent of the total annual 
payments, excluding payments for those individuals whose eligibility for 
Medicaid was determined exclusively by the Social Security 
Administration under a section 1634 agreement and children found 
eligible for foster care and adoption assistance under title IV-E of the 
Act, that occur in each of the 6-month periods.
    (e) Notice to States and showing of good faith. (1) When the actual 
payment error rate data are finalized for each annual assessment period 
ending after July 1, 1990, HCFA will establish each State's error rate 
and the amount of any disallowance. States that have error rates above 
the national standard will be notified by letter of their error rates 
and the amount of the disallowance.
    (i) The State has 65 days from the date of receipt of this 
notification to show that this disallowance should not be made because 
it failed to meet the national standard despite a good faith effort to 
do so.
    (ii) If HCFA is satisfied that the State did not meet the national 
standard despite a good faith effort, HCFA may reduce the funds being 
disallowed in whole or in part as it finds appropriate under the 
circumstances shown by the State.
    (iii) A finding that a State did not meet the national standard 
despite a good faith effort will be limited to extraordinary 
circumstances.
    (iv) The burden of establishing that a good faith effort was made 
rests entirely with the State.
    (2) Some examples of circumstances under which HCFA may find that a 
State did not meet the national standard despite a good faith effort 
are--

[[Page 59]]

    (i) Disasters such as fire, flood, or civil disorders that--
    (A) Require the diversion of significant personnel normally assigned 
to Medicaid eligibility administration; or
    (B) Destroyed or delayed access to significant records needed to 
make or maintain accurate eligibility determinations;
    (ii) Strikes of State staff or other government or private personnel 
necessary to the determination of eligibility or processing of case 
changes;
    (iii) Sudden and unanticipated workload changes that result from 
changes in Federal law and regulation, or rapid, unpredictable caseload 
growth in excess of, for example, 15 percent for a 6-month period;
    (iv) State actions resulting from incorrect written policy 
interpretations to the State by a Federal official reasonably assumed to 
be in a position to provide that interpretation; and
    (v) The State has taken the action it believed was needed to meet 
the national standard, but the national standard was not met. HCFA will 
consider request for a waiver under this criterion only if a State has 
achieved an error rate for the sample period that (after reducing the 
error rate by taking into account the cases determined by HCFA to be in 
error as a result of conditions listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(iv) of this section) is less than its error rate for the preceding 
sample year and does not exceed the national mean error rate for the 
sample period under review (unless that national mean error rate is at 
or below the 3-percent national standard). If the agency has met this 
error reduction requirement or had error rates of 3 percent or below for 
the prior two review periods, and its error rate for the review period 
under consideration is less than one-third above the national standard, 
HCFA will evaluate a request for a good faith waiver based on the 
following factors:
    (A) The State has fully met the performance standards in the 
operation of a quality control system in accordance with Federal 
regulations and HCFA guidelines (e.g., adherence to Federal case 
completion timeliness requirements and verification standards).
    (B) The State has achieved substantial performance in the 
formulation of error reduction initiatives based on the following 
processes:
    (1) Performance of an accurate and thorough statistical and program 
analysis for error reduction which utilized quality control and other 
data:
    (2) The translation of such analysis into specific and appropriate 
error reduction practices for major error elements; and
    (3) The use of monitoring systems to verify that the error reduction 
initiatives were implemented at the local office level.
    (C) The State has achieved substantial performance in the operation 
of the following systems supported by evidence of the timely utilization 
of their outputs in the determination of case eligibility:
    (1) The operation of the Income and Eligibility Verification System 
in accordance with the requirements of parts 431 and 435 of this 
chapter, and
    (2) The operation of systems that interface with Social Security 
data and, where State laws do not restrict agency access, records from 
agencies responsible for motor vehicles, vital statistics, and State or 
local income and property taxes (where these taxes exist).
    (D) The State has achieved substantial performance in the use of the 
following accountability mechanisms to ensure that agency staff adhere 
to error reduction initiatives. The following are minimum requirements:
    (1) Accuracy of eligibility and liability determinations and timely 
processing of case actions are used as quantitative measures of employee 
performance and reflected in performance standards and appraisal forms:
    (2) Selective second-party case reviews are conducted. The second-
party review results are periodically reported to higher level 
management, as well as supervisors and workers and are used in 
performance standards and appraisal forms; and
    (3) Regular operational reviews of local offices are performed by 
the State to evaluate the offices' effectiveness in meeting error 
reduction goals with

[[Page 60]]

periodic monitoring to ensure that review recommendations have been 
implemented.
    (vi) A State that meets the performance standards specified in 
paragraphs (e)(2)(v) (A) through (D) of this section will be considered 
for a full or partial waiver of its disallowance amount. The State must 
submit only specific documentation that verifies that the necessary 
actions were accomplished. For example, a State could submit worker 
performance standards reflecting timeliness and case accuracy as 
quantitative measures of performance.
    (3) The failure of a State to act upon necessary legislative changes 
or to obtain budget authorization for needed resources is not a basis 
for finding that a State failed to meet the national standard despite a 
good faith effort.
    (f) Disallowance subject to appeal. (1) If a State does not agree 
with a disallowance imposed under paragraph (e) of this section, it may 
appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board within 30 days from the date of 
the final disallowance notice from HCFA. The regular procedures for an 
appeal of a disallowance will apply, including review by the Appeals 
Board under 45 CFR part 16.
    (2) This appeal provision, as it applies to MEQC disallowances, is 
not applicable to the Administrator's decision on a State's waiver 
request provided for under paragraph (e) of this section.

agencies providing services to the Medicaid agency, and for training and 
other expenses of volunteers, the rate is 50 percent.
    (c) Application of rates. (1) FFP is prorated for staff time that is 
split among functions reimbursed at different rates.
    (2) Rates of FFP in excess of 50 percent apply only to those 
portions of the individual's working time that are spent carrying out 
duties in the specified areas for which the higher rate is authorized.
    (3) The allocation of personnel and staff costs must be based on 
either the actual percentages of time spent carrying out duties in the 
specified areas, or another methodology approved by HCFA.
    (d) Other limitations for FFP rate for skilled professional medical 
personnel and directly supporting staff--(1) Medicaid agency personnel 
and staff. The rate of 75 percent FFP is available for skilled 
professional medical personnel and directly supporting staff of the 
Medicaid agency if the following criteria, as applicable, are met:
    (i) The expenditures are for activities that are directly related to 
the administration of the Medicaid program, and as such do not include 
expenditures for medical assistance;
    (ii) The skilled professional medical personnel have professional 
education and training in the field of medical care or appropriate 
medical practice. ``Professional education and training'' means the 
completion of a 2-year or longer program leading to an academic degree 
or certificate in a medically related profession. This is demonstrated 
by possession of a medical license, certificate, or other document 
issued by a recognized National or State medical licensure or certifying 
organization or a degree in a medical field issued by a college or 
university certified by a professional medical organization. Experience 
in the administration, direction, or implementation of the Medicaid 
program is not considered the equivalent of professional training in a 
field of medical care.
    (iii) The skilled professional medical personnel are in positions 
that have duties and responsibilities that require those professional 
medical knowledge and skills.
    (iv) A State-documented employer-employee relationship exists 
between the Medicaid agency and the skilled

[[Page 64]]

professional medical personnel and directly supporting staff; and
    (v) The directly supporting staff are secretarial, stenographic, and 
copying personnel and file and records clerks who provide clerical 
services that are directly necessary for the completion of the 
professional medical responsibilities and functions of the skilled 
professional medical staff. The skilled professional medical staff must 
directly supervise the supporting staff and the performance of the 
supporting staff's work.
    (2) Staff of other public agencies. The rate of 75 percent FFP is 
available for staff of other public agencies if the requirements 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are met and the public 
agency has a written agreement with the Medicaid agency to verify that 
these requirements are met.
    (e) Limitations on FFP rates for staff in mechanized claims 
processing and information retrieval systems. The special matching rates 
for persons working on mechanized claims processing and information 
retrieval systems (paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section) are 
applicable only if the design, development and installation, or the 
operation, have been approved by the Administrator in accordance with 
part 433, subchapter C, of this chapter.

    (a) Scope. This section identifies activities and costs to be 
reported as training or administrative costs on quarterly estimate and 
expenditure reports to HCFA.
    (b) Activities and costs to be reported on training expenditures.

educational supplies.
    (3) For State and local Medicaid agency staff development personnel 
(including supporting staff) assigned fulltime training functions:

spending less than full time on training for the Medicaid program must 
be allocated between training and administration in accordance with 
Sec. 433.34 of this subchapter.
    (4) For experts engaged to develop or conduct special programs: 
Salary, fringe benefits, travel, and per diem.
    (5) For agency training activities directly related to the program: 
Use of space, postage, teaching supplies, and purchase or development of 
teaching materials and equipment, for example, books and audiovisual 
aids.
    (6) For field instruction in Medicaid: Instructors' salaries and 
fringe benefits, rental of space, travel, clerical assistance, teaching 
materials and equipment such as books and audiovisual aids.
    (c) Activities and costs not to be reported as training 
expenditures. The following activities are to be reported as 
administrative costs:
    (1) Salaries of supervisors (day-to-day supervision of staff is not 
a training activity); and
    (2) Cost of employing students on a temporary basis, for instance,

Sec. 433.1  Purpose.

    This part specifies the rates of FFP for services and 
administration, and prescribes requirements, prohibitions, and FFP 
conditions relating to State fiscal activities.

[[Page 66]]


<R04>
    Subpart A--Federal Matching and General Administration Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 433.8  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 433.10  Rates of FFP for program services.

    (a) Basis. Sections 1903(a)(1), 1903(g), and 1905(b) provide for 
payments to States, on the basis of a Federal medical assistance 
percentage, for part of their expenditures for services under an 
approved State plan.
    (b) Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP)--Computations. The 
FMAP is determined by the formula described in section 1905(b) of the 
Act. Under the formula, if a State's per capita income is equal to the 
national average per capita income, the Federal share is 55 percent. If 
a State's per capita income exceeds the national average, the Federal 
share is lower, with a statutory minimum of 50 percent. If a State's per 
capita income is lower than the national average, the Federal share is 
increased, with a statutory maximum of 83 percent. The formula used in 
determining the State and Federal share is as follows:

State Share = [(State per capita income) \2\/(National per capita 
income) \2\]  x  45 percent
Federal share=100 percent minus the State share (with a minimum of 50 
percent and a maximum of 83 percent)

The formula provides for squaring both the State and national average 
per capita incomes; this procedure magnifies any difference between the 
State's income and the national average. Consequently, Federal matching 
to lower income States is increased, and Federal matching to higher 
income States is decreased, within the statutory 50-83 percent limits. 
The FMAP for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana 
Islands, and American Samoa is set by statute at 50 percent and is 
subject to dollar limitations specified in section 1108 of the Act.
    (c) Special provisions. (1) Under section 1903(a)(5) of the Act, the 
Federal share of State expenditures for family planning services is 90 
percent.
    (2) Under section 1905(b), the Federal share of State expenditures 
for services provided through Indian Health Service facilities is 100 
percent.
    (3) Under section 1903(g), the FMAP is reduced if the State does not 
have an effective program to control use of institutional services.

processing and information retrieval systems: 90 percent. (Section 
1903(a)(3)(A)(i); 42 CFR part 433, subpart C, and Sec. 432.50 (b)(3).)

retrieval systems: 75 percent. (Section 1903(a) (3)(B); 42 CFR part 433, 
subpart C and Sec. 432.50(b)(2).)
    (5) Compensation and training of skilled professional medical 
personnel and staff directly supporting those personnel if the criteria 
specified in Sec. 432.50 (c) and (d) are met: 75 percent. (Section 
1903(a)(2); 42 CFR 432.50(b)(1).)
    (6)(i) Funds expended for the performance of medical and utilization 
review by a PRO under a contract entered into under section 1902(d) of 
the Act: 75 percent (section 1903(a)(3)(C) of the Act).
    (ii) If a State contracts for medical and utilization review with 
any individual or organization not designated under Part B of Title XI 
of the Act, funds expended for such review will be reimbursed as 
provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
    (7) All other activities the Secretary finds necessary for proper 
and efficient administration of the State plan: 50 percent. (Section 
1903(a)(7).) (See also Sec. 455.300 of this subchapter for FFP at

activities conducted by the State: 75 percent. (Sections 1903(a)(2)(C) 
and 1919(e)(7); 42 CFR part 483, subparts C and E.)

assure that claims for Federal funds are in accord with applicable 
Federal requirements;
    (b) Retain records for 3 years from date of submission of a final 
expenditure report;

Federal grant for 3 years from the date of final disposition of that 
property.

[44 FR 17935, Mar. 23, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 433.34  Cost allocation.

    A State plan under Title XIX of the Social Security Act must provide 
that the single or appropriate Agency will have an approved cost

requirements contained in subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. Subpart E also 
sets forth the effect on FFP if the requirements contained in that 
subpart are not met.

[47 FR 17490, Apr. 23, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 433.35  Equipment--Federal financial participation.

    Claims for Federal financial participation in the cost of equipment

[47 FR 41564, Sept. 21, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 433.36  Liens and recoveries.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section implements sections 1902(a)(18) 
and 1917(a) and (b) of the Act, which describe the conditions under 
which an agency may impose a lien against a recipient's property, and 
when an agency may make an adjustment or recover funds in satisfaction 
of the claim against the individual's estate or real property.
    (b) Definition of property. For purposes of this section, 
``property'' includes the homestead and all other personal and real 
property in which the recipient has a legal interest.
    (c) State plan requirement. If a State chooses to impose a lien 
against an individual's real property (or as provided in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section, personal property), the State plan must provide 
that the provisions of paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section are 
met.
    (d) Procedures. The State plan must specify the process by which the 
State will determine that an institutionalized individual cannot 
reasonably be expected to be discharged from the medical institution and 
return home as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. The 
description of the process must include the type of notice to be given 
the individual, the process by which the individual will be given the 
opportunity for a hearing, the hearing procedures, and by whom and on 
what basis the determination that the individual cannot reasonably be 
expected to be discharged from the institution

[[Page 68]]

will be made. The notice to the individual must explain what is meant by 
the term lien, and that imposing a lien does not mean that the 
individual will lose ownership of the home.
    (e) Definitions. The State plan must define the following terms used 
in this section:
    (1) Individual's home.
    (2) Equity interest in home.
    (3) Residing in the home for at least 1 (or 2) year(s).
    (4) On a continuing basis.
    (5) Discharge from the medical institution and return home.
    (6) Lawfully residing.
    (f) Exception. The State plan must specify the criteria by which a 
son or daughter can establish to the agency's satisfaction that he or 
she has been providing care which permitted the individual to reside at 
home rather than in an institution, as provided in paragraph 
(h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (g) Lien provisions--(1) Incorrect payments. The agency may place a 
lien against an individual's property, both personal and real, before 
his or her death because of Medicaid claims paid or to be paid on behalf 
of that individual following a court judgement which determined that 
benefits were incorrectly paid for that individual.
    (2) Correct payments. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section, the agency may place a lien against the real property of an 
individual at any age before his or her death because of Medicaid claims 
paid or to be paid for that individual when--
    (i) An individual is an inpatient of a medical institution and must, 
as a condition of receiving services in the institution under the State 
plan, apply his or her income to the cost of care as provided in 
Secs. 435.725, 435.832 and 436.832; and
    (ii) The agency determines that he or she cannot reasonably be 
expected to be discharged and return home. The agency must notify the 
individual of its intention to make that determination and provide an 
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with State established 
procedures before the determination is made. The notice to an individual 
must include an explanation of liens and the effect on an individual's 
ownership of property.
    (3) Restrictions on placing liens. The agency may not place a lien 
on an individual's home under paragraph (g)(2) of this section if any of 
the following individuals is lawfully residing in the home:
    (i) The spouse;
    (ii) The individual's child who is under age 21 or blind or disabled 
as defined in the State plan; or
    (iii) The individual's sibling (who has an equity interest in the 
home, and who was residing in the individual's home for at least one 
year immediately before the date the individual was admitted to the 
medical institution).
    (4) Termination of lien. Any lien imposed on an individual's real 
property under paragraph (g)(2) of this section will dissolve when that 
individual is discharged from the medical institution and returns home.
    (h) Adjustments and recoveries. (1) The agency may make an 
adjustment or recover funds for Medicaid claims correctly paid for an 
individual as follows:
    (i) From the estate of any individual who was 65 years of age or 
older when he or she received Medicaid; and
    (ii) From the estate or upon sale of the property subject to a lien 
when the individual is institutionalized as described in paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section.
    (2) The agency may make an adjustment or recovery under paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section only:
    (i) After the death of the individual's surviving spouse; and
    (ii) When the individual has no surviving child under age 21 or 
blind or disabled as defined in the State plan; and
    (iii) In the case of liens placed on an individual's home under 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, when there is no--
    (A) Sibling of the individual residing in the home, who has resided 
there for at least one year immediately before the date of the 
individual's admission to the institution, and has resided there on a 
continuous basis since that time; or
    (B) Son or daughter of the individual residing in the home, who has 
resided there for at least two years immediately before the date of the 
individual's admission to the institution, has resided there on a 
continuous basis

[[Page 69]]

since that time, and can establish to the agency's satisfaction that he 
or she has been providing care which permitted the individual to reside 
at home rather than in an institution.
    (i) Prohibition of reduction of money payments. No money payment 
under another program may be reduced as a means of recovering Medicaid 
claims incorrectly paid.

47 FR 49847, Nov. 3, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 433.37  Reporting provider payments to Internal Revenue Service.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section, based on section 1902(a)(4) of 
the Act, prescribes requirements concerning--
    (1) Identification of providers; and
    (2) Compliance with the information reporting requirements of the 
Internal Revenue Code.
    (b) Identification of providers. A State plan must provide for the 
identification of providers by--
    (1) Social security number if--
    (i) The provider is in solo practice; or
    (ii) The provider is not in solo practice but billing is by the 
individual practitioner; or
    (2) Employer identification number for all other providers.
    (c) Compliance with section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code. The 
plan must provide that the Medicaid agency complies with the information 
reporting requirements of section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 
U.S.C. 6041). Section 6041 requires the filing of annual information 
returns showing amounts paid to providers, who are identified by name, 
address, and social security number or employer identification number.


<R05>
Sec. 433.38  Interest charge on disallowed claims for FFP.

    (a) Basis and scope. This section is based on section 1903(d)(5) of 
the Act, which requires that the Secretary charge a State interest on 
the Federal share of claims that have been disallowed but have been 
retained by the State during the administrative appeals process under 
section 1116(d) of the Act and the Secretary later recovers after the 
administrative appeals process has been completed. This section does not 
apply to--
    (1) Claims that have been deferred by the Secretary and disallowed 
within the time limits of Sec. 430.40 of this chapter. Deferral of 
claims for FFP; or
    (2) Claims for expenditures that have never been paid on a grant 
award; or
    (3) Disallowances of any claims for services furnished before 
October 1, 1980, regardless of the date of the claim submitted to HCFA.
    (b) General principles. (1) HCFA will charge a State interest on FFP 
when--
    (i) HCFA has notified the Medicaid agency under 45 CFR 74.304 that a 
State claim for FFP is not allowable;
    (ii) The agency has appealed the disallowance to the Grant Appeals 
Board under 45 CFR Part 16 and has chosen to retain the FFP during the 
administrative appeals process in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section; and
    (iii)(A) The Board has made a final determination upholding part or 
all of the disallowance; (B) the agency has withdrawn its appeal on all 
or part of the disallowance; or (C) the agency has reversed its decision 
to retain the funds without withdrawing its appeal and the Board upholds 
all or part of the disallowance.
    (2) If the courts overturn, in whole or in part, a Board decision 
that has sustained a disallowance, HCFA will return the principal and 
the interest collected on the funds that were disallowed, upon the 
completion of all judicial appeals.
    (3) Unless an agency decides to withdraw its appeal on part of the 
disallowance and therefore returns only that part of the funds on which 
it has withdrawn its appeal, any decision to retain or return disallowed 
funds must apply to the entire amount in dispute.
    (4) If the agency elects to have HCFA recover the disputed amount, 
it may not reverse that election.
    (c) State procedures. (1) If the Medicaid agency has appealed a 
disallowance to the Board and wishes to retain the disallowed funds 
until the Board issues a final determination, the agency must notify the 
HCFA Regional Administrator in writing of its decision to do so.
    (2) The agency must mail its notice to the HCFA Regional 
Administrator

[[Page 70]]

within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice of the disallowance, 
as established by the certified mail receipt accompanying the notices.
    (3) If the agency withdraws either its decision to retain the FFP or 
its appeal on all or part of the FFP or both, the agency must notify 
HCFA in writing.
    (4) If the agency does not notify the HCFA Regional Administrator 
within the time limit set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
HCFA will recover the amount of the disallowed funds from the next 
possible Medicaid grant award to the State.
    (d) Amount of interest charged. (1) If the agency retains funds that 
later become subject to an interest charge under paragraph (b) of this 
section, HCFA will offset from the next Medicaid grant award to the 
State the amount of the funds subject to the interest charge, plus 
interest on that amount.
    (2) The interest charge is at the rate HCFA determines to be the 
average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day Treasury bill 
auction rates during the period for which interest will be charged.
    (e) Duration of interest. (1) The interest charge on the amount of 
disallowed FFP retained by the agency will begin on the date of the 
disallowance notice and end--
    (i) On the date of the final determination by the Board;
    (ii) On the date HCFA receives written notice from the State that it 
is withdrawing its appeal on all of the disallowed funds; or
    (iii) If the agency withdraws its appeal on part of the funds, on 
(A) the date HCFA receives written notice from the agency that it is 
withdrawing its appeal on a specified part of the disallowed funds for 
the part on which the agency withdraws its appeal; and (B) the date of 
the final determination by the Board on the part for which the agency 
pursues its appeal; or
    (iv) The date HCFA receives written notice from the agency that it 
no longer chooses to retain the funds.
    (2) HCFA will not charge interest on FFP retained by an agency for 
more than 12 months for disallowances of FFP made between October 1, 
1980 and August 13, 1981.

Sec. 433.40  Treatment of uncashed or cancelled (voided) Medicaid checks.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides the rules to ensure that States 
refund the Federal portion of uncashed or cancelled (voided) checks 
under title XIX.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section--
    Cancelled (voided) check means a Medicaid check issued by a State or 
fiscal agent which prior to its being cashed is cancelled (voided) by 
the State or fiscal agent, thus preventing disbursement of funds.
    Check means a check or warrant that a State or local agency uses to 
make a payment.
    Fiscal agent means an entity that processes or pays vendor claims 
for the Medicaid State agency.
    Uncashed check means a Medicaid check issued by a State or fiscal 
agent which has not been cashed by the payee.
    Warrant means an order by which the State agency or local agency 
without the authority to issue checks recognizes a claim. Presentation 
of a warrant by the payee to a State officer with authority to issue 
checks will result in release of funds due.
    (c) Refund of Federal financial participation (FFP) for uncashed 
checks--(1) General provisions. If a check remains uncashed beyond a 
period of 180 days from the date it was issued; i.e., the date of the 
check, it will no longer be regarded as an allowable program 
expenditure. If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of 
the uncashed check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.
    (2) Report of refund. At the end of each calendar quarter, the State 
must identify those checks which remain uncashed beyond a period of 180 
days after issuance. The State agency must refund all FFP that it 
received for uncashed checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of 
Expenditures for that quarter. If an uncashed check is cashed after the 
refund is made, the State may file a claim. The claim will be considered 
to be an adjustment to the costs for the quarter in which the

[[Page 71]]

check was originally claimed. This claim will be paid if otherwise 
allowed by the Act and the regulations issued pursuant to the Act.
    (3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.
    (d) Refund of FFP for cancelled (voided) checks--(1) General 
provision. If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of a 
cancelled (voided) check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.
    (2) Report of refund. At the end of each calendar quarter, the State 
agency must identify those checks which were cancelled (voided). The 
State must refund all FFP that it received for cancelled (voided) checks 
by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter.
    (3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.

     Subpart B--General Administrative Requirements State Financial 
                              Participation

    Source: 57 FR 55138, Nov. 24, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 433.50  Basis, scope, and applicability.

    (a) Basis. This subpart interprets and implements--
    (1) Section 1902(a)(2) of the Act, which requires States to share in 
the cost of medical assistance expenditures and permits both State and 
local governments to participate in the financing of the non-Federal 
portion of medical assistance expenditures.
    (2) Section 1903(a) of the Act, which requires the Secretary to pay 
each State an amount equal to the Federal medical assistance percentage 
of the total amount expended as medical assistance under the State's 
plan.
    (3) Section 1903(w) of the Act, which specifies the treatment of 
revenues from provider-related donations and health care-related taxes 
in determining a State's medical assistance expenditures for which 
Federal financial participation (FFP) is available under the Medicaid 
program.
    (b) Scope. This subpart--
    (1) Specifies State plan requirements for State financial 
participation in expenditures for medical assistance.
    (2) Defines provider-related donations and health care-related taxes 
that may be received without a reduction in FFP.
    (3) Specifies rules for revenues received from provider-related 
donations and health care-related taxes during a transition period.
    (4) Establishes limitations on FFP when States receive funds from 
provider-related donations and revenues generated by health care-related 
taxes.
    (c) Applicability. The provisions of this subpart apply to the 50 
States and the District of Columbia, but not to any State whose entire 
Medicaid program is operated under a waiver granted under section 1115 
of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 433.51  Public funds as the State share of financial participation.

    (a) Public funds may be considered as the State's share in claiming 
FFP if they meet the conditions specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section.
    (b) The public funds are appropriated directly to the State or local 
Medicaid agency, or transferred from other public agencies (including 
Indian tribes) to the State or local agency and under its administrative 
control, or certified by the contributing public agency as representing 
expenditures eligible for FFP under this section.
    (c) The public funds are not Federal funds, or are Federal funds 
authorized by Federal law to be used to match other Federal funds.

<R05>
Sec. 433.52  General definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Entity related to a health care provider means--
    (1) An organization, association, corporation, or partnership formed 
by or on behalf of a health care provider;
    (2) An individual with an ownership or control interest in the 
provider, as defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act;

[[Page 72]]

    (3) An employee, spouse, parent, child, or sibling of the provider, 
or of a person with an ownership or control interest in the provider, as 
defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act; or
    (4) A supplier of health care items or services or a supplier to 
providers of health care items or services.
    Health care provider means the individual or entity that receives 
any payment or payments for health care items or services provided.
    Provider-related donation means a donation or other voluntary 
payment (in cash or in kind) made directly or indirectly to a State or 
unit of local government by or on behalf of a health care provider, an 
entity related to such a health care provider, or an entity providing 
goods or services to the State for administration of the State's 
Medicaid plan.
    (1) Donations made by a health care provider to an organization, 
which in turn donates money to the State, may be considered to be a 
donation made indirectly to the State by a health care provider.
    (2) When an organization receives less than 25 percent of its 
revenues from providers and/or provider-related entities, its donations 
will not generally be presumed to be provider-related donations. Under 
these circumstances, a provider-related donation to an organization will 
not be considered a donation made indirectly to the State. However, if 
the donations from providers to an organization are subsequently 
determined to be indirect donations to the State or unit of local 
government for administration of the State's Medicaid program, then such 
donations will be considered to be health care related.
    (3) When the organization receives more than 25 percent of its 
revenue from donations from providers or provider-related entities, the 
organization always will be considered as acting on behalf of health 
care providers if it makes a donation to the State. The amount of the 
organization's donation to the State, in a State fiscal year, that will 
be considered health care related, will be based on the percentage of 
donations the organization received from the providers during that 
period.


<R05>
Sec. 433.53  State plan requirements.

    A State plan must provide that--
    (a) State (as distinguished from local) funds will be used both for 
medical assistance and administration;
    (b) State funds will be used to pay at least 40 percent of the non-
Federal share of total expenditures under the plan; and
    (c) State and Federal funds will be apportioned among the political 
subdivisions of the State on a basis that assures that--
    (1) Individuals in similar circumstances will be treated similarly 
throughout the State; and
    (2) If there is local financial participation, lack of funds from 
local sources will not result in lowering the amount, duration, scope, 
or quality of services or level of administration under the plan in any 
part of the State.

<R05>
Sec. 433.54  Bona fide donations.

    (a) A bona fide donation means a provider-related donation, as 
defined in Sec. 433.52, made to the State or unit of local government, 
that has no direct or indirect relationship, as described in paragraph 
(b) of this section, to Medicaid payments made to--
    (1) The health care provider;
    (2) Any related entity providing health care items and services; or
    (3) Other providers furnishing the same class of items or services 
as the provider or entity.
    (b) Provider-related donations will be determined to have no direct 
or indirect relationship to Medicaid payments if those donations are not 
returned to the individual provider, the provider class, or related 
entity under a hold harmless provision or practice, as described in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) A hold harmless practice exists if any of the following applies:
    (1) The amount of the payment received (other than under title XIX 
of the Act) is positively correlated either to the amount of the 
donation or to the difference between the amount of the donation and the 
amount of the payment received under the State plan;
    (2) All or any portion of the payment made under Medicaid to the 
donor, the

[[Page 73]]

provider class, or any related entity, varies based only on the amount 
of the total donation received; or
    (3) The State or other unit of local government receiving the 
donation provides for any payment, offset, or waiver that guarantees to 
return any portion of the donation to the provider.
    (d) HCFA will presume provider-related donations to be bona fide if 
the voluntary payments, including, but not limited to, gifts, 
contributions, presentations or awards, made by or on behalf of 
individual health care providers to the State, county, or any other unit 
of local government does not exceed--
    (1) $5,000 per year in the case of an individual provider donation; 
or
    (2) $50,000 per year in the case of a donation from any health care 
organizational entity.
    (e) To the extent that a donation presumed to be bona fide contains 
a hold harmless provision, as described in paragraph (c) of this 
section, it will not be considered a bona fide donation. When provider-
related donations are not bona fide, HCFA will deduct this amount from 
the State's medical assistance expenditures before calculating FFP. This 
offset will apply to all years the State received such donations and any 
subsequent fiscal year in which a similar donation is received.


<R05>
Sec. 433.55  Health care-related taxes defined.

    (a) A health care-related tax is a licensing fee, assessment, or 
other mandatory payment that is related to--
    (1) Health care items or services;
    (2) The provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care 
items or services; or
    (3) The payment for the health care items or services.
    (b) A tax will be considered to be related to health care items or 
services under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if at least 85 percent 
of the burden of the tax revenue falls on health care providers.
    (c) A tax is considered to be health care related if the tax is not 
limited to health care items or services, but the treatment of 
individuals or entities providing or paying for those health care items 
or services is different than the tax treatment provided to other 
individuals or entities.
    (d) A health care-related tax does not include payment of a criminal 
or civil fine or penalty, unless the fine or penalty was imposed instead 
of a tax.
    (e) Health care insurance premiums and health maintenance 
organization premiums paid by an individual or group to ensure coverage 
or enrollment are not considered to be payments for health care items 
and services for purposes of determining whether a health care-related 
tax exists.


<R05>
Sec. 433.56  Classes of health care services and providers defined.

    (a) For purposes of this subpart, each of the following will be 
considered as a separate class of health care items or services:

    (3) Nursing facility services (other than services of intermediate 
care facilities for the mentally retarded);
    (4) Intermediate care facility services for the mentally retarded, 
and similar services furnished by community-based residences for the

    (11) Podiatric services;
    (12) Chiropractic services;
    (13) Optometric/optician services;

[[Page 74]]

    (16) Nursing services, defined to include all nursing services, 
including services of nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, and private 
duty nurses;
    (17) Laboratory and x-ray services, defined as services provided in 
a licensed, free-standing laboratory or x-ray facility. This definition 
does not include laboratory or x-ray services provided in a physician's 
office, hospital inpatient department, or hospital outpatient 
department;
    (18) Emergency ambulance services; and
    (19) Other health care items or services not listed above on which

Sec. 433.57  General rules regarding revenues from provider-related donations and health care-related taxes.

    Effective January 1, 1992, HCFA will deduct from a State's 
expenditures for medical assistance, before calculating FFP, funds from 
provider-related donations and revenues generated by health care-related 
taxes received by a State or unit of local government, in accordance 
with the requirements, conditions, and limitations of this subpart, if 
the donations and taxes are not--
    (a) Donations and taxes that meet the requirements specified in 
Sec. 433.58, except for certain revenue received during a specified 
transition period;
    (b) Permissible provider-related donations, as specified in 
Sec. 433.66(b); or
    (c) Health care-related taxes, as specified in Sec. 433.68(b).


<R05>
Sec. 433.58  Provider-related donations and health care-related taxes during a State's transition period.

    (a) General rule. During the State's transition period specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section, a State may receive certain provider-
related donations and health care-related taxes without a reduction in 
FFP. These provider-related donations and health care-related taxes must 
meet the conditions specified in this section and are subject to 
limitations specified in Sec. 433.60.
    (b) Transition periods for States. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the provisions of this section apply 
for the period beginning January 1, 1992 and ending--
    (i) September 30, 1992, for States whose State fiscal year begins on 
or before July 1, 1992; or
    (ii) December 31, 1992, for States whose State fiscal year begins 
after July 1, 1992.
    (2) The provisions of this section apply for the period beginning 
January 1, 1992 and ending June 30, 1993 for States that--
    (i) Are not scheduled to have a regular legislative session in 
calendar year 1992;
    (ii) Are not scheduled to have a regular legislative session in 
calendar year 1993; or
    (iii) Had enacted a health care-related tax program on November 4, 
1991.
    (c) Provider-related donations during the transition period. Subject 
to the limitations specified in Sec. 433.60, a State may receive, 
without a reduction in FFP, provider-related donations described in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section during the applicable transition 
period.
    (d) Permissible donations. To be permissible donations, the 
donations must be--
    (1) Bona fide donations, as defined in Sec. 433.54;
    (2) Donations made by a hospital, clinic, or similar entity (such as 
a Federally-qualified health center) for the direct costs of State or 
local agency personnel who are stationed at that facility to determine 
the eligibility (including eligibility redeterminations) of individuals 
for Medicaid and/or to provide outreach services to eligible (or

[[Page 75]]

potentially eligible) Medicaid individuals. Direct costs of outstationed 
eligibility workers refers to the costs of training, salaries and fringe 
benefits associated with each outstationed worker and similar allocated 
costs of State or local agency support staff, and a prorated cost of 
outreach activities applicable to the outstationed workers at these 
sites. The prorated costs of outreach activities will be calculated 
taking the percent of State outstationed eligibility workers at a 
facility to total outstationed eligibility workers in the State, and 
multiplying the percent by the total cost of outreach activities in the 
State. Costs for such items as State agency overhead and provider office 
space are not allowable for this purpose; or
    (3) Provider-related donations, even if the donations do not qualify 
under the provisions of paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section, that 
meet the following conditions:
    (i) The donation program was in effect on September 30, 1991, 
described in State plan amendments or related documents submitted to 
HCFA by that date, or substantiated by written documentary evidence (as 
described in paragraph (e) of this section) that was in existence as of 
that date; and
    (ii) The donation program is applicable to the State's fiscal year 
1992, as demonstrated by written documentary evidence as described in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Written documentary evidence. The State must have written 
documentation, which was in existence on September 30, 1991, of a 
donation program described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section that 
includes the dollar amounts it received in State fiscal year 1992 and 
the amounts it intended to receive, as evidenced by one or more of the 
following:
    (1) Reference to a donation program in a State plan amendment or 
related documents, including a satisfactory response, as determined by 
HCFA, to a HCFA request for additional information;
    (2) State budget documents identifying the amounts States expected 
to be received in donations;
    (3) Written agreements with the parties donating the funds; and/or
    (4) Other written documents that identify amounts that the States 
planned to receive in donations from specified organizations during that 
period.
    (f) Application of rules to State fiscal year 1993. For any portion 
of a State's fiscal year 1993 that occurs during the transition period, 
the State may receive, without a reduction in FFP, the amount of 
provider-related donations that it received in the corresponding period 
in State fiscal year 1992, including the 5 days after the end of that 
period, subject to the limitations specified in Sec. 433.60(a).
    (g) Health care-related taxes during the transition period. (1) 
Subject to the limitations specified in Sec. 433.60, States may receive, 
without a reduction in FFP, health care-related taxes during the State's 
transition period if:
    (i) The health care-related taxes are broad-based and uniformly 
imposed, and the taxpayer will not be held harmless, as specified in 
Sec. 433.68; or
    (ii) The health care-related taxes are imposed under--
    (A) A tax program that was in effect as of November 22, 1991; or
    (B) Legislation or regulations that were enacted or adopted as of 
November 22, 1991.
    (2) A State may not modify health care-related taxes in existence as 
of November 22, 1991, without a reduction of FFP, unless the 
modification only--
    (i) Extends a tax program that was scheduled to expire before the 
end of the State's transition period;
    (ii) Makes technical changes that do not alter the rate of the tax 
or the base of the tax (for example, the providers on which the tax is 
imposed) and do not otherwise increase the proceeds of the tax;
    (iii) Decreases the rate of the tax, without altering the base of 
the tax; or
    (iv) Modifies the tax program to bring it into compliance with 
Sec. 433.68(f).

<R05>
Sec. 433.60  Limitations on level of FFP in State expenditures from provider-related donations and health care-related taxes during the transition period.

    (a) Maximum amounts. The maximum amount of total provider-related 
donations, as specified in Sec. 433.58(d)(3), and health care-related 
taxes that a State may receive without a reduction in FFP during a State 
fiscal year in the State's transition period specified in Sec. 433.58(b) 
is calculated by multiplying--
    (1) The State's total medical assistance expenditures for the fiscal 
year; by
    (2) The greater of:
    (i) 25 percent; or
    (ii) The ``State base percentage'' (as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section).
    (b) State base percentage.
    (1) The State's base percentage is calculated by dividing the amount 
of the provider-related donations and health care-related taxes 
identified in Sec. 433.58 and estimated by HCFA to be received in the 
State's fiscal year 1992 by the total non-Federal share of medical 
assistance expenditures (including administrative costs) in that fiscal 
year based on the best available HCFA data.
    (2) In calculating the amount of taxes specified in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, taxes (including the tax rate or base) that were not in 
effect for the entire State fiscal year, but for which legislation or 
regulations imposing such taxes were enacted or adopted as of November 
22, 1991, will be estimated as if they were in effect for the entire 
fiscal year.
    (c) Deductions before calculating FFP. Before calculating FFP, HCFA 
will deduct from a State's medical assistance expenditures the total 
amount of any provider-related donations described in Sec. 433.58(d)(3), 
and health care-related taxes in excess of the limit calculated under 
paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 433.66  Permissible provider-related donations after the transition period.

    (a) General rule. (1) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, subsequent to the end of a State's transition period, as 
defined in Sec. 433.58(b), a State may receive revenues from provider-
related donations without a reduction in FFP, only in accordance with 
the requirements of this section.
    (2) The provisions of this section relating to provider-related 
donations for outstationed eligibility workers are effective on October 
1, 1992, whether or not the State's transition period continues beyond 
that date.
    (b) Permissible donations. Subject to the limitations specified in 
Sec. 433.67, a State may receive, without a reduction in FFP, provider-
related donations that meet at least one of the following requirements:
    (1) The donations must be bona fide donations, as defined in 
Sec. 433.54; or
    (2) The donations are made by a hospital, clinic, or similar entity 
(such as a Federally-qualified health center) for the direct costs of 
State or local agency personnel who are stationed at the facility to 
determine the eligibility (including eligibility redeterminations) of 
individuals for Medicaid or to provide outreach services to eligible (or 
potentially eligible) Medicaid individuals. Direct costs of outstationed 
eligibility workers refers to the costs of training, salaries and fringe 
benefits associated with each outstationed worker and similar allocated 
costs of State or local agency support staff, and a prorated cost of 
outreach activities applicable to the outstationed workers at these 
sites. The prorated costs of outreach activities will be calculated 
taking the percent of State outstationed eligibility workers at a 
facility to total outstationed eligibility workers in the State, and 
multiplying the percent by the total cost of outreach activities in the 
State. Costs for such items as State agency overhead and provider office 
space are not allowable for this purpose.

Sec. 433.67  Limitations on level of FFP for permissible provider-related donations.

    (a)(1) Limitations on bona fide donations. There are no limitations 
on the amount of bona fide provider-related donations that a State may 
receive

[[Page 77]]

without a reduction in FFP, as long as the bona fide donations meet the 
requirements of Sec. 433.66(b)(1).
    (2) Limitations on donations for outstationed eligibility workers. 
Effective October 1, 1992, regardless of when a State's transition 
period ends, the maximum amount of provider-related donations for 
oustationed eligibility workers, as described in Sec. 433.66(b)(2), that 
a State may receive without a reduction in FFP may not exceed 10 percent 
of a State's medical assistance administrative costs (both the Federal 
and State share), excluding the costs of family planning activities. The 
10 percent limit for provider-related donations for outstationed 
eligibility workers is not included in the limit in effect through 
September 30, 1995, for health care-related taxes as described in 
Sec. 433.70.
    (b) Calculation of FFP. HCFA will deduct from a State's quarterly 
medical assistance expenditures, before calculating FFP, any provider-
related donations received in that quarter that do not meet the 
requirements of Sec. 433.66(b)(1) and provider donations for 
outstationed eligibility workers in excess of the limits specified under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 433.68  Permissible health care-related taxes after the transition period.

    (a) General rule. Beginning on the day after a State's transition 
period, as defined in Sec. 433.58(b), ends, a State may receive health 
care-related taxes, without a reduction in FFP, only in accordance with 
the requirements of this section.
    (b) Permissible health care-related taxes. Subject to the 
limitations specified in Sec. 433.70, a State may receive, without a 
reduction in FFP, health care-related taxes if all of the following are 
met:
    (1) The taxes are broad based, as specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section;
    (2) The taxes are uniformly imposed throughout a jurisdiction, as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (3) The tax program does not violate the hold harmless provisions 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (c) Broad based health care-related taxes. (1) A health care-related 
tax will be considered to be broad based if the tax is imposed on at 
least all health care items or services in the class or providers of 
such items or services furnished by all non-Federal, non-public 
providers in the State, and is imposed uniformly, as specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) If a health care-related tax is imposed by a unit of local 
government, the tax must extend to all items or services or providers 
(or to all providers in a class) in the area over which the unit of 
government has jurisdiction.
    (3) A State may request a waiver from HCFA of the requirement that a 
tax program be broad based, in accordance with the procedures specified 
in Sec. 433.72. Waivers from the uniform and broad-based requirements 
will automatically be granted in cases of variations in licensing and 
certification fees for providers if the amount of such fees is not more 
than $1,000 annually per provider and the total amount raised by the 
State from the fees is used in the administration of the licensing or 
certification program.
    (d) Uniformly imposed health care-related taxes. A health care-
related tax will be considered to be imposed uniformly even if it 
excludes Medicaid or Medicare payments (in whole or in part), or both; 
or, in the case of a health care-related tax based on revenues or 
receipts with respect to a class of items or services (or providers of 
items or services), if it excludes either Medicaid or Medicare revenues 
with respect to a class of items or services, or both. The exclusion of 
Medicaid revenues must be applied uniformly to all providers being 
taxed.
    (1) A health care-related tax will be considered to be imposed 
uniformly if it meets any one of the following criteria:
    (i) If the tax is a licensing fee or similar tax imposed on a class 
of health care services (or providers of those health care items or 
services), the tax is the same amount for every provider furnishing 
those items or services within the class.
    (ii) If the tax is a licensing fee or similar tax imposed on a class 
of

[[Page 78]]

health care items or services (or providers of those items or services) 
on the basis of the number of beds (licensed or otherwise) of the 
provider, the amount of the tax is the same for each bed of each 
provider of those items or services in the class.
    (iii) If the tax is imposed on provider revenue or receipts with 
respect to a class of items or services (or providers of those health 
care items or services), the tax is imposed at a uniform rate for all 
services (or providers of those items or services) in the class on all 
the gross revenues or receipts, or on net operating revenues relating to 
the provision of all items or services in the State, unit, or 
jurisdiction. Net operating revenue means gross charges of facilities 
less any deducted amounts for bad debts, charity care, and payer 
discounts.
    (iv) The tax is imposed on items or services on a basis other than 
those specified in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section, 
e.g., an admission tax, and the State establishes to the satisfaction of 
the Secretary that the amount of the tax is the same for each provider 
of such items or services in the class.
    (2) A tax imposed with respect to a class of health care items or 
services will not be considered to be imposed uniformly if it meets 
either one of the following two criteria:
    (i) The tax provides for credits, exclusions, or deductions which 
have as its purpose, or results in, the return to providers of all, or a 
portion, of the tax paid, and it results, directly or indirectly, in a 
tax program in which--
    (A) The net impact of the tax and payments is not generally 
redistributive, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (B) The amount of the tax is directly correlated to payments under 
the Medicaid program.
    (ii) The tax holds taxpayers harmless for the cost of the tax, as 
described in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) If a tax does not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, but the State establishes that 
the tax is imposed uniformly in accordance with the procedures for a 
waiver specified in Sec. 433.72, the tax will be treated as a uniform 
tax.
    (e) Generally redistributive. A tax will be considered to be 
generally redistributive if it meets the requirements of this paragraph. 
If the State desires waiver of only the broad-based tax requirement, it 
must demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If 
the State desires waiver of the uniform tax requirement, whether or not 
the tax is broad-based, it must demonstrate compliance with paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section.
    (1) Waiver of broad-based requirement only. This test is applied on 
a per class basis to a tax that is imposed on all revenues but excludes 
certain providers. For example, a tax that is imposed on all revenues 
(including Medicare and Medicaid) but excludes teaching hospitals would 
have to meet this test. This test cannot be used when a State excludes 
any or all Medicaid revenue from its tax in addition to the exclusion of 
providers, since the test compares the proportion of Medicaid revenue 
being taxed under the proposed tax with the proportion of Medicaid 
revenue being taxed under a broad-based tax.
    (i) A State seeking waiver of the broad-based tax requirement only 
must demonstrate that its proposed tax plan meets the requirement that 
its plan is generally redistributive by:
    (A) Calculating the proportion of the tax revenue applicable to 
Medicaid if the tax were broad based and applied to all providers or 
activities within the class (called P1);
    (B) Calculating the proportion of the tax revenue applicable to 
Medicaid under the tax program for which the State seeks a waiver 
(called P2); and
    (C) Calculating the value of P1/P2.
    (ii) If the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that 
the value of P1/P2 is at least 1, HCFA will automatically approve the 
waiver request.
    (iii) If a tax is enacted and in effect prior to August 13, 1993, 
and the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the 
value of P1/P2 is at least 0.90, HCFA will review the waiver request. 
Such a waiver will be approved only if the following two criteria are 
met:

[[Page 79]]

    (A) The value of P1/P2 is at least 0.90; and
    (B) The tax excludes or provides credits or deductions only to one 
or more of the following providers of items and services within the 
class to be taxed:
    (1) Providers that furnish no services within the class in the 
State;
    (2) Providers that do not charge for services within the class;
    (3) Rural hospitals (defined as any hospital located outside of an 
urban area as defined in Sec. 412.62(f)(1)(ii) of this chapter);
    (4) Sole community hospitals as defined in Sec. 412.92(a) of this 
chapter;
    (5) Physicians practicing primarily in medically underserved areas 
as defined in section 1302(7) of the Public Health Service Act;
    (6) Financially distressed hospitals if:
    (i) A financially distressed hospital is defined by the State law;
    (ii) The State law specifies reasonable standards for determining 
financially distressed hospitals, and these standards are applied 
uniformly to all hospitals in the State; and
    (iii) No more than 10 percent of nonpublic hospitals in the State 
are exempt from the tax;
    (7) Psychiatric hospitals; or
    (8) Hospitals owned and operated by HMOs.
    (iv) If a tax is enacted and in effect after August 13, 1993, and 
the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the value of 
P1/P2 is at least 0.95, HCFA will review the waiver request. Such a 
waiver request will be approved only if the following two criteria are 
met:
    (A) The value of P1/P2 is at least 0.95; and
    (B) The tax complies with the provisions of 
Sec. 433.68(e)(1)(iii)(B).
    (2) Waiver of uniform tax requirement. This test is applied on a per 
class basis to all taxes that are not uniform. This includes those taxes 
that are neither broad based (as specified in Sec. 433.68(c)) nor 
uniform (as specified in Sec. 433.68(d)).
    (i) A State seeking waiver of the uniform tax requirement (whether 
or not the tax is broad based) must demonstrate that its proposed tax 
plan meets the requirement that its plan is generally redistributive by:
    (A) Calculating, using ordinary least squares, the slope (designated 
as (B) (that is. the value of the x coefficient) of two linear 
regressions, in which the dependent variable is each provider's 
percentage share of the total tax paid by all taxpayers during a 12-
month period, and the independent variable is the taxpayer's ``Medicaid 
Statistic''. The term ``Medicaid Statistic'' means the number of the 
provider's taxable units applicable to the Medicaid program during a 12-
month period. If, for example, the State imposed a tax based on provider 
charges, the amount of a provider's Medicaid charges paid during a 12-
month period would be its ``Medicaid Statistic''. If the tax were based 
on provider inpatient days, the number of the provider's Medicaid days 
during a 12-month period would be its ``Medicaid Statistic''. For the 
purpose of this test, it is not relevant that a tax program exempts 
Medicaid from the tax.
    (B) Calculating the slope (designated as B1) of the linear 
regression, as described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, for the 
State's tax program, if it were broad based and uniform.
    (C) Calculating the slope (designated as B2) of the linear 
regression, as described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, for the 
State's tax program, as proposed.
    (ii) If the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that 
the value of B1/B2 is at least 1, HCFA will automatically approve the 
waiver request.
    (iii) If the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that 
the value of B1/B2 is at least 0.95, HCFA will review the waiver 
request. Such a waiver will be approved only if the following two 
criteria are met:
    (A) The value of B1/B2 is at least 0.95; and
    (B) The tax excludes or provides credits or deductions only to one 
or more of the following providers of items and services within the 
class to be taxes:
    (1) Providers that furnish no services within the class in the 
State;
    (2) Providers that do not charge for services within the class;
    (3) Rural hospitals (defined as any hospital located outside of an 
urban area as defined in Sec. 412.62(f)(1)(ii) of this chapter;

[[Page 80]]

    (4) Sole community hospitals as defined in Sec. 412.92(a) of this 
chapter;
    (5) Physicians practicing primarily in medically underserved areas 
as defined in section 1302(7) of the Public Health Service Act;
    (6) Financially distressed hospitals if:
    (i) A financially distressed hospital is defined by the State law;
    (ii) The State law specifies reasonable standards for determining 
financially distressed hospitals, and these standards are applied 
uniformly to all hospitals in the State; and
    (iii) No more than 10 percent of nonpublic hospitals in the State 
are exempt from the tax;
    (7) Psychiatric hospitals; or
    (8) Providers or payers with tax rates that vary based exclusively 
on regions, but only if the regional variations are coterminous with 
preexisting political (and not special purpose) boundaries. Taxes within 
each regional boundary must meet the broad-based and uniformity 
requirements as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (iv) A B1/B2 value of 0.70 will be applied to taxes that vary based 
exclusively on regional variations, and enacted and in effect prior to 
November 24, 1992, to permit such variations.
    (f) Hold harmless. A taxpayer will be considered to be held harmless 
under a tax program if any of the following conditions applies:
    (1) The State (or other unit of government) imposing the tax 
provides directly or indirectly for a non-Medicaid payment to those 
providers or others paying the tax and the amount of the payment is 
positively correlated to either the amount of the tax or to the 
difference between the Medicaid payment and the total tax cost.
    (2) All or any portion of the Medicaid payment to the taxpayer 
varies based only on the amount of the total tax payment.
    (3) The State (or other unit of local government) imposing the tax 
provides, directly or indirectly, for any payment, offset, or waiver 
that guarantees to hold taxpayers harmless for all or a portion of the 
tax.
    (i) An indirect guarantee will be determined to exist under a two 
prong ``guarantee'' test. This specific hold harmless test is effective 
September 13, 1993. In this instance, if the health care-related tax or 
taxes on each health care class are applied at a rate that produces 
revenues less than or equal to 6 percent of the revenues received by the 
taxpayer, the tax or taxes are permissible under this test. When the tax 
or taxes are applied at a rate that produces revenues in excess of 6 
percent of the revenue received by the taxpayer, HCFA will consider a 
hold harmless provision to exist if 75 percent or more of the taxpayers 
in the class receive 75 percent or more of their total tax costs back in 
enhanced Medicaid payments or other State payments. The second prong of 
the hold harmless test is applied in the aggregate to all health care 
taxes applied to each class. If this standard is violated, the amount of 
tax revenue to be offset from medical assistance expenditures is the 
total amount of the taxpayers' revenues received by the State.
    (ii) If, as of August 13, 1993, a State has enacted a tax in excess 
of 6 percent that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (f)(3)(i) 
of this section, HCFA will not disallow funds received by the State 
resulting from the tax if the State modifies the tax to comply with this 
requirement by September 13, 1993. If, by September 13, 1993, the tax is 
not modified, funds received by States on or after September 13, 1993 
will be disallowed.

Sec. 433.70  Limitations on level of FFP for revenues from health care-related taxes after the transition period.

    (a) Limitations. (1) Subsequent to the end of a State's transition 
period (as defined in Sec. 433.58(b)), and extending through September 
30, 1995, the maximum amount of health care-related taxes specified in 
Sec. 433.68 that a State may receive during a State fiscal year (or 
portion thereof), without a reduction in FFP, is limited to--
    (i) The greater of 25 percent or the State base percentage as 
described in Sec. 433.60(b); multiplied by
    (ii) The State's share of total medical assistance expenditures for 
the State fiscal year, less all health care-related taxes other than 
those described in

[[Page 81]]

Sec. 433.68 that are deducted separately pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (2) Beginning October 1, 1995, there is no limitation on the amount 
of health care-related taxes that a State may receive without a 
reduction in FFP, as long as the health care-related taxes meet the 
requirements specified in Sec. 433.68.
    (b) Calculation of FFP. HCFA will deduct from a State's medical 
assistance expenditures, before calculating FFP, revenues from health 
care-related taxes that do not meet the requirements of Sec. 433.68 and 
any health care-related taxes in excess of the limits specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 433.72  Waiver provisions applicable to health care-related taxes.

    (a) Bases for requesting waiver. (1) A State may submit to HCFA a 
request for a waiver if a health care-related tax does not meet any or 
all of the following:
    (i) The tax does not meet the broad based criteria specified in 
Sec. 433.68c); and/or
    (ii) The tax is not imposed uniformly but meets the criteria 
specified in Sec. 433.68(d)(2) or (d)(3).
    (2) When a tax that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section is imposed on more than one class of health care items 
or services, a separate waiver must be obtained for each class of health 
care items and services subject to the tax.
    (b) Waiver conditions. In order for HCFA to approve a waiver request 
that would permit a State to receive tax revenue (within specified 
limitations) without a reduction in FFP, the State must demonstrate, to 
HCFA's satisfaction, that its tax program meets all of the following 
requirements:
    (1) The net impact of the tax and any payments made to the provider 
by the State under the Medicaid program is generally redistributive, as 
described in Sec. 433.68(e);
    (2) The amount of the tax is not directly correlated to Medicaid 
payments; and
    (3) The tax program does not fall within the hold harmless 
provisions specified in Sec. 433.68(f).
    (c) Effective date. A waiver will be effective:
    (1) The date of enactment of the tax for programs in existence prior 
to August 13, 1993 or;
    (2) For tax programs commencing on or after August 13, 1993, on the 
first day in the quarter in which the waiver is received by HCFA.

<R05>
Sec. 433.74  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Beginning with the first quarter of Federal fiscal year 1993, 
each State must submit to HCFA quarterly summary information on the 
source and use of all provider-related donations (including all bona 
fide and presumed-to-be bona fide donations) received by the State or 
unit of local government, and health care-related taxes collected. Each 
State must also provide any additional information requested by the 
Secretary related to any other donations made by, or any taxes imposed 
on, health care providers. States' reports must present a complete, 
accurate, and full disclosure of all of their donation and tax programs 
and expenditures.
    (b) Each State must provide the summary information specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section on a quarterly basis in accordance with 
procedures established by HCFA.
    (c) Each State must maintain, in readily reviewable form, supporting 
documentation that provides a detailed description and legal basis for 
each donation and tax program being reported, as well as the source and 
use of all donations received and taxes collected. This information must 
be made available to Federal reviewers upon request.
    (d) If a State fails to comply with the reporting requirements 
contained in this section, future grant awards will be reduced by the 
amount of FFP HCFA estimates is attributable to the sums raised by tax 
and donation programs as to which the State has not reported properly, 
until such time as the State complies with the reporting requirements. 
Deferrals and/or disallowances of equivalent amounts may also be imposed 
with respect to quarters for which the State has failed to report 
properly. Unless otherwise prohibited

[[Page 82]]

by law, FFP for those expenditures will be released when the State 
complies with all reporting requirements.

Sec. 433.112  FFP for design, development, installation or enhancement of mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems.

    (a) FFP is available at the 90 percent rate in State expenditures 
for the design, development, installation, or enhancement of a 
mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system only if 
the APD is approved by HCFA prior to the State's expenditure of funds 
for these purposes.
    (b) HCFA will approve the system described in the APD if the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) HCFA determines the system is likely to provide more efficient, 
economical, and effective administration of the State plan.
    (2) The system meets the system requirements and performance 
standards in Part 11 of the State Medicaid Manual, as periodically 
amended.
    (3) The system is compatible with the claims processing and 
information retrieval systems used in the administration of Medicare for 
prompt eligibility verification and for processing claims for persons 
eligible for both programs.

[[Page 83]]

    (4) The system supports the data requirements of peer review 
organizations established under Part B of title XI of the Act.
    (5) The State owns any software that is designed, developed, 
installed or improved with 90 percent FFP.

modifications to software, and documentation that is designed, 
developed, installed or enhanced with 90 percent FFP.
    (7) The costs of the system are determined in accordance with 45 CFR 
74.171.
    (8) The Medicaid agency agrees in writing to use the system for the 
period of time specified in the advance planning document approved by 
HCFA or for any shorter period of time that HCFA determines justifies 
the Federal funds invested.
    (9) The agency agrees in writing that the information in the system 
will be safeguarded in accordance with subpart F, part 431 of this 
subchapter.
    (c) Eligibility determination systems are not part of mechanized

for 75 percent FFP under this subpart. These systems are also not 
eligible for 90 percent FFP for any APD approved after November 13, 
1989.

Sec. 433.113  Reduction of FFP for failure to operate a system and obtain initial approval.

    (a) Except as waived under Sec. 433.130 or 433.131, FFP will be 
reduced as specified in paragraph (b) of this section unless the 
Medicaid agency has in continuous operation a mechanized claims 
processing and information retrieval system that meets the following 
conditions:
    (1) The APD for the system was approved by HCFA;
    (2) The system is operational by September 30, 1985; and
    (3) The system is initially approved by the last day of the fourth 
quarter that begins after the date the system became operational as 
determined by HCFA.
    (b) HCFA will reduce FFP in expenditures for compensation and 
training of skilled professional medical personnel and support staff 
under section 1903(a)(2) of the Act, and for general administration 
under section 1903(a)(7) of the Act, by the following increments applied 
separately to those two categories of expenditures:
    (1) Five percentage points for the first two quarters beginning 
after a deadline in paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) An additional five percentage points during each additional two-
quarter period, through the quarter in which the State achieves 
compliance with the conditions for initial operation or initial approval 
of an operating system. FFP reductions will not exceed 25 percentage 
points for each type of reduction.
    (c) The amount of FFP (determined under section 1903(a)(3)(B)) that 
would be available retroactively for operating a system that later 
receives initial approval will be reduced by HCFA by the same percentage 
points for the identical periods of time described in subparagraph 
(b)(1) of this section, until the system is initially approved. No 
reduction will be made after the first quarter during which the system 
is initially approved.

Sec. 433.116  FFP for operation of mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems.

    (a) Subject to 42 CFR 433.113(c), FFP is available at 75 percent of 
expenditures for operation of a mechanized claims processing and 
information retrieval system approved by HCFA, from the first day of the 
calendar quarter after the date the system met the conditions of initial 
approval, as established by HCFA (including a retroactive adjustment of 
FFP if necessary to provide the 75 percent rate beginning on the first 
day of that calendar quarter). Subject to 45 CFR 95.611(a), the State 
shall obtain prior written approval from HCFA when it plans to acquire 
ADP equipment or services, when it anticipates the total acquisition 
costs will exceed thresholds, and meets other conditions of the subpart.
    (b) HCFA will approve the system operation if the conditions 
specified in paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section are met.
    (c) The conditions of Sec. 433.112(b) (1) through (4) and (7) 
through (9), as periodically modified under Sec. 433.112(b)(2), must be

    (f) The notice required by paragraph (e) of this section--
    (1) Must specify--
    (i) The service furnished;
    (ii) The name of the provider furnishing the service;
    (iii) The date on which the service was furnished; and
    (iv) The amount of the payment made under the plan for the service; 
and
    (2) Must not specify confidential services (as defined by the State) 
and must not be sent if the only service furnished was confidential.
    (g) The system must provide both patient and provider profiles for 
program management and utilization review purposes.
    (h) If the State has a Medicaid fraud control unit certified under 
section 1903(q) of the Act and Sec. 455.300 of this chapter, the 
Medicaid agency must have procedures to assure that information on 
probable fraud or abuse that is obtained from, or developed by, the 
system is made available to that unit. (See Sec. 455.21 of this chapter 
for State plan requirements.)

system.
    (b) The agency must submit a APD that includes--
    (1) The date the replacement system will be in operation; and
    (2) A plan for orderly transition from the system being replaced to 
the replacement system.
    (c) FFP is available at--
    (1) 90 percent in expenditures for design, development, and 
installation in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 433.112; and
    (2) 75 percent in expenditures for operation of an approved 
replacement system in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 433.116(b) 
through (h), from the date that the system met the conditions of initial 
approval, as established by HCFA.
    (d) FFP is available at 75 percent in expenditures for the operation 
of an approved system that is being replaced (or at a reduced rate 
determined under Sec. 433.120 of this subpart for a system that has been

Sec. 433.119  Conditions for reapproval; notice of decision.

    (a) HCFA will review at least once every three years each system 
operation initially approved under Sec. 433.114 and reapprove it for FFP 
at 75 percent of expenditures if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The system meets the conditions of Sec. 433.112(b) (1), (3), 
(4), and (7) through (9).
    (2) The system meets the conditions of Sec. 433.116 (d) through (h).
    (3) The system meets the performance standards for reapproval and 
the system requirements in part 11 of the State Medicaid Manual as 
periodically amended.
    (4) Automated eligibility determination systems approved or 
operating on or before November 13, 1989, will not qualify for FFP at 75 
percent of expenditures after November 13, 1989.
    (b) HCFA may review an entire system operation or focus its review 
on parts of the operation. However, at a minimum, HCFA will review 
standards, system requirements and other conditions of reapproval that 
have demonstrated weakness in a previous review or reviews.
    (c) HCFA will issue to each Medicaid agency, by the end of the first 
quarter after the review period, a written notice informing the agency 
whether its system is reapproved or disapproved. If the system is 
disapproved, the notice will also include--
    (1) HCFA's decision to reduce FFP for system operations, and the 
percentage to which it is reduced, beginning with the next calender 
quarter;
    (2) The findings of fact upon which the determination was made; and
    (3) A statement that State claims in excess of the reduced FFP rate 
will be disallowed and that any such disallowance will be appealable to 
the Departmental Appeals Board.

Sec. 433.120  Procedures for reduction of FFP after reapproval review.

    (a) If HCFA determines after the reapproval review that the system 
no longer meets the conditions of reapproval in Sec. 433.119, HCFA will 
reduce FFP for system operations for at least four quarters. However, no 
system will be subject to reduction of FFP for at least the first four 
quarters after the quarter in which the system is initially approved as 
eligible for 75 percent FFP.
    (b) HCFA will reduce FFP in expenditures for system operations from 
75 percent to no more than 70 percent and no less than 50 percent; 
however, HCFA will not reduce FFP by more than 10 percentage points in 
any four-quarter period. The percentage to which the FFP is reduced will 
depend primarily on the following criteria:
    (1) The number of conditions judged unsatisfactory;
    (2) The extent to which conditions were not met;
    (3) The significance of the unsatisfactory conditions in overall 
mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system 
operations; and
    (4) The actual and potential program impact attributable to the 
unsatisfactory conditions.

<R05>
Sec. 433.121  Reconsideration of the decision to reduce FFP after reapproval review.

    (a) The agency may appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board under 45 
CFR part 16, a disallowance concerning a reduction in FFP claimed for 
system operation caused by a disapproval of the State's system. If the 
Board finds such a disallowance to be appropriate, the discretionary 
determination to reduce FFP by a particular percentage amount (instead 
of by a lesser percentage) is not subject to review by the Board unless 
the percentage reduction exceeds the range authorized by section 
1903(r)(4)(B) of the Act.
    (b) The decisions concerning whether to restore any FFP 
retroactively and the actual number of quarters for which FFP will be 
restored under Sec. 433.122 of this subpart are not subject to 
administrative appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board under 45 CFR 
part 16.
    (c) An agency's request for a reconsideration before the Board under 
paragraph (a) of this section does not delay implementation of the 
reduction in FFP. However, any reduction is subject to retroactive 
adjustment if required

[[Page 86]]

by the Board's determination on reconsideration.

    When FFP has been reduced under Sec. 433.120(a), and HCFA determines 
upon subsequent review that the system meets all current performance 
standards, system requirements and other conditions of reapproval, the 
following provisions apply:
    (a) HCFA will resume FFP in expenditures for system operations at 
the 75 percent level beginning with the quarter following the review 
determination that the system again meets conditions of reapproval.
    (b) HCFA may retroactively waive a reduction of FFP in expenditures 
for system operations if HCFA determines that the waiver could improve 
the administration of the State Medicaid plan. However, HCFA cannot 
waive this reduction for any quarter before the fourth quarter 
immediately preceding the quarter in which HCFA issues the determination 
(as part of the review process) stating that the system is reapproved.

    (1) Publish a notice in the Federal Register making available the 
proposed changes for public comment;
    (2) Respond in a subsequent Federal Register notice to comments 
received; and
    (3) Issue the new or modified requirements or conditions in the 
State Medicaid Manual.
    (b) For changes in system requirements or other conditions for 
approval, HCFA will allow an appropriate period for Medicaid agencies to 
meet the requirement determining this period on the basis of the 
requirement's complexity and other relevant factors.
    (c) Whenever HCFA modifies performance standards and other 
conditions for reapproval under Sec. 433.119, HCFA will notify Medicaid 
agencies at least one calendar quarter before the review period to which 
the new or modified standards or conditions apply.

system, including on-site inspection. HCFA may request such access at 
any time to determine whether the conditions in this subpart are being 
met.

Sec. 433.130  Waiver of conditions of initial operation and approval.

    (a) HCFA will waive requirements for initial operation and approval 
of systems under Sec. 433.113 for a State meeting the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section and that had a 1976 population of less 
than one million and made total Federal and State Medicaid expenditures 
of less than $100 million in fiscal year 1976. Population figures are 
those reported by the Bureau of the Census. Expenditures for fiscal year 
1976 are those reported by the State for that year.
    (b) To be eligible for this waiver, the agency must submit its 
reasons to HCFA in writing and demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that a 
system will not significantly improve the efficiency of the 
administration of the State plan.
    (c) If HCFA denies the waiver request, the notice of denial will 
include--
    (1) The findings of fact upon which the denial was made; and
    (2) The procedures for appeal of the denial.
    (d) If HCFA determines, after granting a waiver, that a system would 
significantly improve the administration of the State Medicaid program, 
HCFA

may withdraw the waiver and require that a State obtain initial approval 
of a system within two years of the date of waiver withdrawal.

    If a State is unable to comply with the conditions of approval or of 
reapproval and the noncompliance will cause a percentum reduction in 
FFP, HCFA will waive the FFP reduction in the following circumstances:
    (a) Good cause. If HCFA determines that good cause existed, HCFA 
will waive the FFP reduction attributable to those items for which the 
good cause existed. A waiver of FFP consequences of the failure to meet 
the conditions of approval or reapproval based upon good cause will not 
extend beyond two consecutive quarters.
    (b) Circumstances beyond the control of a State. The State must 
satisfactorily explain the circumstances that are beyond its control. 
When HCFA grants the waiver, HCFA will also defer all other system 
deadlines for the same length of time that the waiver applies.

Sec. 433.138  Identifying liable third parties.

    (a) Basic provisions. The agency must take reasonable measures to 
determine the legal liability of the third parties who are liable to pay 
for services furnished under the plan. At a minimum, such measures must 
include the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) through (k) of this 
section, unless waived under paragraph (l) of this section.
    (b) Obtaining health insurance information: Initial application and 
redetermination processes for Medicaid eligibility. (1) If the Medicaid 
agency determines eligibility for Medicaid, it must, during the initial 
application and each redetermination process, obtain from the applicant 
or recipient such health insurance information as would be useful in 
identifying legally liable third party resources so that the agency may 
process claims under the third party liability payment procedures 
specified in Sec. 433.139 (b) through (f). Health insurance information 
may include, but is not limited to, the name of the policy holder, his 
or her relationship to the applicant or recipient, the social security 
number (SSN) of the policy holder, and the name and address of insurance 
company and policy number.
    (2) If Medicaid eligibility is determined by the Federal agency 
administering the supplemental security income program under title XVI 
in accordance with a written agreement under section 1634 of the Act, 
the Medicaid agency must take the following action. It must enter into 
an agreement with HCFA or must have, prior to February 1, 1985, executed 
a modified section 1634 agreement that is still in effect to provide 
for--
    (i) Collection, from the applicant or recipient during the initial 
application and each redetermination process, of health insurance 
information in the form and manner specified by the Secretary; and
    (ii) Transmittal of the information to the Medicaid agency.
    (3) If Medicaid eligibility is determined by any other agency in 
accordance with a written agreement, the Medicaid agency must modify the 
agreement to provide for--
    (i) Collection, from the applicant or recipient during the initial 
application and each redetermination process, of such health insurance 
information as would be useful in identifying legally liable third party 
resources so that the Medicaid agency may process claims under the third 
party liability payment procedures specified in Sec. 433.139 (b) through 
(f). Health insurance information may include, but is not limited to, 
those elements described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (ii) Transmittal of the information to the Medicaid agency.
    (c) Obtaining other information. Except as provided in paragraph (l) 
of this section, the agency must, for the purpose of implementing the 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(4)(i) of this section, 
incorporate into the eligibility case file the names and SSNs of absent 
or custodial parents of Medicaid recipients to the extent such 
information is available.
    (d) Exchange of data. Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this 
section, to obtain and use information for the purpose of determining 
the legal liability of the third parties so that the agency may process 
claims under the third party liability payment procedures specified in 
Sec. 433.139(b) through (f), the agency must take the following actions:
    (1) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as part 
of the data exchange requirements under Sec. 435.945 of this chapter, 
from the State wage information collection agency (SWICA) defined in 
Sec. 435.4 of this chapter and from the SSA wage and earnings files data 
as specified in Sec. 435.948(a)(2) of this chapter, the agency must--

[[Page 89]]

    (i) Use the information that identifies Medicaid recipients that are 
employed and their employer(s); and
    (ii) Obtain and use, if their names and SSNs are available to the 
agency under paragraph (c) of this section, information that identifies 
employed absent or custodial parents of recipients and their 
employer(s).
    (2) If the agency can demonstrate to HCFA that it has an alternate 
source of information that furnishes information as timely, complete and 
useful as the SWICA and SSA wage and earnings files in determining the 
legal liability of third parties, the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section are deemed to be met.
    (3) The agency must request, as required under 
Sec. 435.948(a)(6)(i), from the State title IV-A agency, information not 
previously reported that identifies those Medicaid recipients that are 
employed and their employer(s).
    (4) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the 
agency must attempt to secure agreements (to the extent permitted by 
State law) to provide for obtaining--
    (i) From State Workers' Compensation or Industrial Accident 
Commission files, information that identifies Medicaid recipients and, 
(if their names and SSNs were available to the agency under paragraph 
(c) of this section) absent or custodial parents of Medicaid recipients 
with employment-related injuries or illnesses; and
    (ii) From State Motor Vehicle accident report files, information 
that identifies those Medicaid recipients injured in motor vehicle 
accidents, whether injured as pedestrians, drivers, passengers, or 
bicyclists.
    (5) If unable to secure agreements as specified in paragraph (d)(4) 
of this section, the agency must submit documentation to the regional 
office that demonstrates the agency made a reasonable attempt to secure 
these agreements. If HCFA determines that a reasonable attempt was made, 
the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section are deemed to be 
met.
    (e) Diagnosis and trauma code edits. (1) Except as specified under 
paragraph (e)(2) or (l) of this section, or both, the agency must take 
action to identify those paid claims for Medicaid recipients that 
contain diagnosis codes 800 through 999 International Classification of 
Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, Volume 1 (ICD-9-CM) 
inclusive, for the purpose of determining the legal liability of third 
parties so that the agency may process claims under the third party 
liability payment procedures specified in Sec. 433.139(b) through (f).
    (2) The agency may exclude code 994.6, Motion Sickness, from the 
edits required under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Data exchanges and trauma code edits: Frequency. Except as 
provided in paragraph (l) of this section, the agency must conduct the 
data exchanges required in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(3) of this section 
in accordance with the intervals specified in Sec. 435.948 of this 
chapter, and diagnosis and trauma edits required in paragraphs (d)(4) 
and (e) of this section on a routine and timely basis. The State plan 
must specify the frequency of these activities.
    (g) Followup procedures for identifying legally liable third party 
resources. Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, the 
State must meet the requirements of this paragraph.

    (k) Integration with the State mechanized claims processing and 
information

[[Page 91]]

retrieval system. Basic requirement--Development of an action plan. (1) 
If a State has a mechanized claims processing and information retrieval 
system approved by HCFA under subpart C of this part, the agency must 
have an action plan for pursuing third party liability claims and the 
action plan must be integrated with the mechanized claims processing and 
information retrieval system.
    (2) The action plan must describe the actions and methodologies the 
State will follow to--
    (i) Identify third parties;
    (ii) Determine the liability of third parties;
    (iii) Avoid payment of third party claims as required in 
Sec. 433.139;
    (iv) Recover reimbursement from third parties after Medicaid claims 
payment as required in Sec. 433.139; and,
    (v) Record information and actions relating to the action plan.
    (3) The action plan must be consistent with the conditions for 
reapproval set forth in Sec. 433.119. The portion of the plan which is 
integrated with MMIS is monitored in accordance with those conditions 
and if the conditions are not met; it is subject to FFP reduction in 
accordance with procedures set forth in Sec. 433.120. The State is not 
subject to any other penalty as a result of other monitoring, quality 
control, or auditing requirements for those items in the action plan.
    (4) The agency must submit its action plan to the HCFA Regional 
Office within 120 days from the date HCFA issues implementing 
instructions for the State Medicaid Manual. If a State does not have an 
approved MMIS on the date of issuance of the State Medicaid Manual but 
subsequently implements an MMIS, the State must submit its action plan 
within 90 days from the date the system is operational. The HCFA 
Regional Office approves or disapproves the action plan.
    (l) Waiver of requirements. (1) The agency may request initial and 
continuing waiver of the requirements to determine third party liability 
found in paragraphs (c), (d)(4), (d)(5), (e), (f), (g)(1), (g)(2), 
(g)(3), and (g)(4) of this section if the State determines the activity 
to be not cost-effective. An activity would not be cost-effective if the 
cost of the required activity exceeds the third party liability 
recoupment and the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a 
higher cost, the same objective as another activity that is being 
performed by the State.
    (i) The agency must submit a request for waiver of the requirement 
in writing to the HCFA regional office.
    (ii) The request must contain adequate documentation to establish 
that to meet a requirement specified by the agency is not cost-
effective. Examples of documentation are claims recovery data and a 
State analysis documenting a cost-effective alternative that 
accomplished the same task.
    (iii) The agency must agree, if a waiver is granted, to notify HCFA 
of any event that occurs that changes the conditions upon which the 
waiver was approved.
    (2) HCFA will review a State's request to have a requirement 
specified under paragraph (l)(1) of this section waived and will request 
additional information from the State, if necessary. HCFA will notify 
the State of its approval or disapproval determination within 30 days of 
receipt of a properly documented request.
    (3) HCFA may rescind a waiver at any time that it determines that 
the agency no longer meets the criteria for approving the waiver. If the 
waiver is rescinded, the agency has 6 months from the date of the 
rescission notice to meet the requirement that had been waived.

<R05>
Sec. 433.139  Payment of claims.

    (a) Basic provisions. (1) For claims involving third party liability 
that are processed on or after May 12, 1986, the agency must use the 
procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
    (2) The agency must submit documentation of the methods (e.g., cost 
avoidance, pay and recover later) it uses for payment of claims 
involving third party liability to the HCFA Regional Office.

[[Page 92]]

    (b) Probable liability is established at the time claim is filed. 
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section--
    (1) If the agency has established the probable existence of third 
party liability at the time the claim is filed, the agency must reject 
the claim and return it to the provider for a determination of the 
amount of liability. The establishment of third party liability takes 
place when the agency receives confirmation from the provider or a third 
party resource indicating the extent of third party liability. When the 
amount of liability is determined, the agency must then pay the claim to 
the extent that payment allowed under the agency's payment schedule 
exceeds the amount of the third party's payment.
    (2) The agency may pay the full amount allowed under the agency's 
payment schedule for the claim and then seek reimbursement from any 
liable third party to the limit of legal liability if the claim is for 
labor and delivery and postpartum care. (Costs associated with the 
inpatient hospital stay for labor and delivery and postpartum care must 
be cost-avoided.)
    (3) The agency must pay the full amount allowed under the agency's 
payment schedule for the claim and seek reimbursement from any liable 
third party to the limit of legal liability (and for purposes of 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, from a third party, if the third 
party liability is derived from an absent parent whose obligation to pay 
support is being enforced by the State title IV-D agency), consistent 
with paragraph (f) of this section if--
    (i) The claim is prenatal care for pregnant women, or preventive 
pediatric services (including early and periodic screening, diagnosis 
and treatment services provided for under part 441, subpart B of this 
chapter), that is covered under the State plan; or
    (ii) The claim is for a service covered under the State plan that is 
provided to an individual on whose behalf child support enforcement is 
being carried out by the State title IV-D agency. The agency prior to 
making any payment under this section must assure that the following 
requirements are met:
    (A) The State plan specifies whether or not providers are required 
to bill the third party.
    (B) The provider certifies that before billing Medicaid, if the 
provider has billed a third party, the provider has waited 30 days from 
the date of the service and has not received payment from the third 
party.
    (C) The State plan specifies the method used in determining the 
provider's compliance with the billing requirements.
    (c) Probable liability is not established or benefits are not 
available at the time claim is filed. If the probable existence of third 
party liability cannot be established or third party benefits are not 
available to pay the recipient's medical expenses at the time the claim 
is filed, the agency must pay the full amount allowed under the agency's 
payment schedule.
    (d) Recovery of reimbursement. (1) If the agency has an approved 
waiver under paragraph (e) of this section to pay a claim in which the 
probable existence of third party liability has been established and 
then seek reimbursement, the agency must seek recovery of reimbursement 
from the third party to the limit of legal liability within 60 days 
after the end of the month in which payment is made unless the agency 
has a waiver of the 60-day requirement under paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if the 
agency learns of the existence of a liable third party after a claim is 
paid, or benefits become available from a third party after a claim is 
paid, the agency must seek recovery of reimbursement within 60 days 
after the end of the month it learns of the existence of the liable 
third party or benefits become available.
    (3) Reimbursement must be sought unless the agency determines that 
recovery would not be cost effective in accordance with paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    (e) Waiver of requirements. (1) The agency may request initial and 
continuing waiver of the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (d)(1), and 
(d)(2) of this section, if it determines that the requirement is not 
cost-effective. An

[[Page 93]]

activity would not be cost-effective if the cost of the required 
activity exceeds the third party liability recoupment and the required 
activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher cost, the same 
objective as another activity that is being performed by the State.
    (i) The agency must submit a request for waiver of the requirement 
in writing to the HCFA regional office.
    (ii) The request must contain adequate documentation to establish 
that to meet a requirement specified by the agency is not cost-
effective. Examples of documentation are costs associated with billing, 
claims recovery data, and a State analysis documenting a cost-effective 
alternative that accomplishes the same task.
    (iii) The agency must agree, if a waiver is granted, to notify HCFA 
of any event that occurs that changes the conditions upon which the 
waiver was approved.
    (2) HCFA will review a State's request to have a requirement 
specified under paragraph (e)(1) of this section waived and will request 
additional information from the State, if necessary. HCFA will notify 
the State of its approval or disapproval determination within 30 days of 
receipt of a properly documented request.
    (3) HCFA may rescind the waiver at any time that it determines that 
the State no longer meets the criteria for approving the waiver. If the 
waiver is rescinded, the agency has 6 months from the date of the 
rescission notice to meet the requirement that had been waived.
    (4) An agency requesting a waiver of the requirements specifically 
concerning either the 60-day limit in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this 
section must submit documentation of written agreement between the 
agency and the third party, including Medicare fiscal intermediaries and 
carriers, that extension of the billing requirement is agreeable to all 
parties.
    (f) Suspension or termination of recovery of reimbursement. (1) An 
agency must seek reimbursement from a liable third party on all claims 
for which it determines that the amount it reasonably expects to recover 
will be greater than the cost of recovery. Recovery efforts may be 
suspended or terminated only if they are not cost effective.
    (2) The State plan must specify the threshold amount or other 
guideline that the agency uses in determining whether to seek recovery 
of reimbursement from a liable third party, or describe the process by 
which the agency determines that seeking recovery of reimbursement would 
not be cost effective.
    (3) The State plan must also specify the dollar amount or period of 
time for which it will accumulate billings with respect to a particular 
liable third party in making the decision whether to seek recovery of 
reimbursement.

Sec. 433.140  FFP and repayment of Federal share.

    (a) FFP is not available in Medicaid payments if--
    (1) The agency failed to fulfill the requirements of Secs. 433.138 
and 433.139 with regard to establishing liability and seeking 
reimbursement from a third party;
    (2) The agency received reimbursement from a liable third party; or
    (3) A private insurer would have been obligated to pay for the 
service except that its insurance contract limits or excludes payments 
if the individual is eligible for Medicaid.
    (b) FFP is available at the 50 percent rate for the agency's 
expenditures in carrying out the requirements of this subpart.
    (c) If the State receives FFP in Medicaid payments for which it 
receives third party reimbursement, the State must pay the Federal 
government a portion of the reimbursement determined in accordance with 
the FMAP for the State. This payment may be reduced by the total amount 
needed to meet the incentive payment in Sec. 433.153.

                    Assignment of Rights to Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 433.145  Assignment of rights to benefits--State plan requirements.

    (a) A State plan must provide that, as a condition of eligibility, 
each legally able applicant or recipient is required to:

[[Page 94]]

    (1) Assign to the Medicaid agency his or her rights, or the rights 
of any other individual eligible under the plan for whom he or she can 
legally make an assignment, to medical support and to payment for 
medical care from any third party;
    (2) Cooperate with the agency in establishing paternity and in 
obtaining medical support and payments, unless the individual 
establishes good cause for not cooperating, and except for individuals 
described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the Act (poverty level pregnant 
women), who are exempt from cooperating in establishing paternity and 
obtaining medical support and payments from, or derived from, the father 
of the child born out of wedlock; and
    (3) Cooperate in identifying and providing information to assist the 
Medicaid agency in pursuing third parties who may be liable to pay for 
care and services under the plan, unless the individual establishes good 
cause for not cooperating.
    (b) A State plan must provide that the requirements for assignments, 
cooperation in establishing paternity and obtaining support, and 
cooperation in identifying and providing information to assist the State 
in pursuing any liable third party under Secs. 433.146 through 433.148 
are met.
    (c) A State plan must provide that the assignment of rights to 
benefits obtained from an applicant or recipient is effective only for 
services that are reimbursed by Medicaid.

<R05>
Sec. 433.146  Rights assigned; assignment method.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the agency 
must require the individual to assign to the State--
    (1) His own rights to any medical care support available under an 
order of a court or an administrative agency, and any third party 
payments for medical care; and
    (2) The rights of any other individual eligible under the plan, for 
whom he can legally make an assignment.
    (b) Assignment of rights to benefits may not include assignment of 
rights to Medicare benefits.
    (c) If assignment of rights to benefits is automatic because of 
State law, the agency may substitute such an assignment for an 
individual executed assignment, as long as the agency informs the 
individual of the terms and consequences of the State law.


<R05>
Sec. 433.147  Cooperation in establishing paternity and in obtaining medical support and payments and in identifying and providing information to assist in 
          pursuing third parties who may be liable to pay.

    (a) Scope of requirement. The agency must require the individual who 
assigns his or her rights to cooperate in--
    (1) Establishing paternity of a child born out of wedlock and 
obtaining medical support and payments for himself or herself and any 
other person for whom the individual can legally assign rights, except 
that individuals described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the Act (poverty 
level pregnant women) are exempt from these requirements involving 
paternity and obtaining medical support and payments from, or derived 
from, the father of the child born out of wedlock; and
    (2) Identifying and providing information to assist the Medicaid 
agency in pursuing third parties who may be liable to pay for care and 
services under the plan.
    (b) Essentials of cooperation. As part of a cooperation, the agency 
may require an individual to--
    (1) Appear at a State or local office designated by the agency to 
provide information or evidence relevant to the case;
    (2) Appear as a witness at a court or other proceeding;
    (3) Provide information, or attest to lack of information, under 
penalty of perjury;
    (4) Pay to the agency any support or medical care funds received 
that are covered by the assignment of rights; and
    (5) Take any other reasonable steps to assist in establishing 
paternity and securing medical support and payments, and in identifying 
and providing information to assist the State in pursuing any liable 
third party.
    (c) Waiver of cooperation for good cause. The agency must waive the 
requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of

[[Page 95]]

this section if it determines that the individual has good cause for 
refusing to cooperate.
    (1) With respect to establishing paternity of a child born out of 
wedlock or obtaining medical care support and payments, or identifying 
or providing information to assist the State in pursuing any liable 
third party for a child for whom the individual can legally assign 
rights, the agency must find the cooperation is against the best 
interests of the child, in accordance with factors specified for the 
Child Support Enforcement Program at 45 CFR part 232. If the State title 
IV-A agency has made a finding that good cause for refusal to cooperate 
does or does not exist, the Medicaid agency must adopt that finding as 
its own for this purpose.
    (2) With respect to obtaining medical care support and payments for 
an individual and identifying and providing information to assist in 
pursuing liable third parties in any case not covered by paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, the agency must find that cooperation is against 
the best interests of the individual or the person to whom Medicaid is 
being furnished because it is anticipated that cooperation will result 
in reprisal against, and cause physical or emotional harm to, the 
individual or other person.
    (d) Procedures for waiving cooperation. With respect to establishing 
paternity, obtaining medical care support and payments, or identifying 
and providing information to assist the State in pursuing liable third 
parties for a child for whom the individual can legally assign rights, 
the agency must use the procedures specified for the Child Support 
Enforcement Program at 45 CFR part 232. With respect to obtaining 
medical care support and payments or to identifying and providing 
information to assist the State in pursuing liable third parties for any 
other individual, the agency must adopt procedures similar to those 
specified in 45 CFR part 232, excluding those procedures applicable only 
to children.

cooperation has been waived;
    (b) Provide Medicaid to any individual who--
    (1) Cannot legally assign his own rights; and
    (2) Would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid but for the refusal, by 
a person legally able to assign his rights, to assign his rights or to 
cooperate as required by this subpart; and
    (c) In denying or terminating eligibility, comply with the notice 
and hearing requirements of part 431, subpart E of this subchapter.

political subdivision, legal entity of the subdivision, or another State 
that collected medical support and payments at the request of the 
agency.
    (2) The political subdivision, legal entity or other State that 
receives the incentive payment must then divide the incentive payment 
equally with any other political subdivisions, legal entities, or other 
States that assisted in the collection, unless an alternative allocation 
is agreed upon by all jurisdictions involved.


<R05>
Sec. 433.154  Distribution of collections.

    The agency must distribute collections as follows--
    (a) To itself, an amount equal to State Medicaid expenditures for

State has 60 days from discovery of an overpayment for Medicaid services 
to recover or attempt to recover the overpayment from the provider 
before adjustment in the Federal Medicaid payment to the State is made; 
and that adjustment will be made at the end of the 60 days, whether or 
not recovery is made, unless the State is unable to recover from a 
provider because the overpayment is a debt that has been discharged in 
bankruptcy or is otherwise uncollectable.

overpayments to HCFA, with certain exceptions.


<R05>
Sec. 433.304  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Abuse (in accordance with Sec. 455.2) means provider practices that 
are inconsistent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices, and 
result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, or in 
reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or that fail 
to meet professionally recognized standards for health care.
    Discovery (or discovered) means identification by any State Medicaid 
agency official or other State official, the Federal Government, or the 
provider of an overpayment, and the communication of that overpayment 
finding or the initiation of a formal recoupment action without notice 
as described in Sec. 433.316.
    Fraud (in accordance with Sec. 455.2) means an intentional deception 
or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the 
deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some 
other person. It includes any act that constitutes fraud under 
applicable Federal or State law.
    Overpayment means the amount paid by a Medicaid agency to a provider 
which is in excess of the amount that is allowable for services 
furnished under section 1902 of the Act and which is required to be 
refunded under section 1903 of the Act.
    Provider (in accordance with Sec. 400.203) means any individual or 
entity furnishing Medicaid services under a provider agreement with the 
Medicaid agency.
    Recoupment means any formal action by the State or its fiscal agent 
to initiate recovery of an overpayment without advance official notice 
by reducing future payments to a provider.
    Third party (in accordance with Sec. 433.136) means an individual, 
entity, or program that is or may be liable to pay for all or part of 
the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a State plan.

<R05>
Sec. 433.310  Applicability of requirements.

    (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section, the provisions of this subpart apply to--
    (1) Overpayments made to providers that are discovered by the State;
    (2) Overpayments made to providers that are initially discovered by 
the provider and made known to the State agency; and
    (3) Overpayments that are discovered through Federal reviews.
    (b) Third party payments and probate collections. The requirements 
of this subpart do not apply to--
    (1) Cases involving third party liability because, in these 
situations, recovery is sought for a Medicaid payment that would have 
been made had another party not been legally responsible for payment; 
and
    (2) Probate collections from the estates of deceased Medicaid 
recipients, as they represent the recovery of payments properly made 
from resources later determined to be available to the State.
    (c) Unallowable costs paid under rate-setting systems. (1) 
Unallowable costs for a prior year paid to an institutional provider 
under a rate-setting system that a State recovers through an adjustment 
to the per diem rate for a subsequent period do not constitute 
overpayments that are subject to the requirements of this subpart.
    In such cases, the State is not required to refund the Federal share 
explicitly related to the original overpayment in accordance with the 
regulations in this subpart. Refund of the Federal share occurs when the 
State claims future expenditures made to the provider at a reduced rate.
    (2) Unallowable costs for a prior year paid to an institutional 
provider under a rate-setting system that a State seeks to recover in a 
lump sum, by an installment repayment plan, or through reduction of 
future payments to which the provider would otherwise be entitled 
constitute overpayments that are subject to the requirements of this 
subpart.
    (d) Recapture of depreciation upon gain on the sale of assets. 
Depreciation payments are considered overpayments for

[[Page 98]]

purposes of this subpart if a State requires their recapture in a 
discrete amount(s) upon gain on the sale of assets.


<R05>
Sec. 433.312  Basic requirements for refunds.

    (a) Basic rules. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the Medicaid agency has 60 days from the date of discovery of 
an overpayment to a provider to recover or seek to recover the 
overpayment before the Federal share must be refunded to HCFA.
    (2) The agency must refund the Federal share of overpayments at the 
end of the 60-day period following discovery in accordance with the 
requirements of this subpart, whether or not the State has recovered the 
overpayment from the provider.
    (b) Exception. The agency is not required to refund the Federal 
share of an overpayment made to a provider when the State is unable to 
recover the overpayment amount because the provider has been determined 
bankrupt or out of business in accordance with Sec. 433.318.
    (c) Applicability. (1) The requirements of this subpart apply to 
overpayments made to Medicaid providers that occur and are discovered in 
any quarter that begins on or after October 1, 1985.
    (2) The date upon which an overpayment occurs is the date upon which 
a State, using its normal method of reimbursement for a particular class 
of provider (e.g., check, interfund transfer), makes the payment 
involving unallowable costs to a provider.


<R05>
Sec. 433.316  When discovery of overpayment occurs and its significance.

    (a) General rule. The date on which an overpayment is discovered is 
the beginning date of the 60-calendar day period allowed a State to 
recover or seek to recover an overpayment before a refund of the Federal 
share of an overpayment must be made to HCFA.
    (b) Requirements for notification. Unless a State official or fiscal 
agent of the State chooses to initiate a formal recoupment action 
against a provider without first giving written notification of its 
intent, a State Medicaid agency official or other State official must 
notify the provider in writing of any overpayment it discovers in 
accordance with State agency policies and procedures and must take 
reasonable actions to attempt to recover the overpayment in accordance 
with State law and procedures.
    (c) Overpayments resulting from situations other than fraud or 
abuse. An overpayment resulting from a situation other than fraud or 
abuse is discovered on the earliest of--
    (1) The date on which any Medicaid agency official or other State 
official first notifies a provider in writing of an overpayment and 
specifies a dollar amount that is subject to recovery;
    (2) The date on which a provider initially acknowledges a specific 
overpaid amount in writing to the medicaid agency; or
    (3) The date on which any State official or fiscal agent of the 
State initiates a formal action to recoup a specific overpaid amount 
from a provider without having first notified the provider in writing.
    (d) Overpayments resulting from fraud or abuse. An overpayment that 
results from fraud or abuse is discovered on the date of the final 
written notice of the State's overpayment determination that a Medicaid 
agency official or other State official sends to the provider.
    (e) Overpayments identified through Federal reviews. If a Federal 
review at any time indicates that a State has failed to identify an 
overpayment or a State has identified an overpayment but has failed to 
either send written notice of the overpayment to the provider that 
specified a dollar amount subject to recovery or initiate a formal 
recoupment from the provider without having first notified the provider 
in writing, HCFA will consider the overpayment as discovered on the date 
that the Federal official first notifies the State in writing of the 
overpayment and specifies a dollar amount subject to recovery.
    (f) Effect of changes in overpayment amount. Any adjustment in the 
amount of an overpayment during the 60-day period following discovery 
(made in accordance with the approved State plan, Federal law and 
regulations governing Medicaid, and the appeals resolution

[[Page 99]]

process specified in State administrative policies and procedures) has 
the following effect on the 60-day recovery period:
    (1) A downward adjustment in the amount of an overpayment subject to 
recovery that occurs after discovery does not change the original 60-day 
recovery period for the outstanding balance.
    (2) An upward adjustment in the amount of an overpayment subject to 
recovery that occurs during the 60-day period following discovery does 
not change the 60-day recovery period for the original overpayment 
amount. A new 60-day period begins for the incremental amount only, 
beginning with the date of the State's written notification to the 
provider regarding the upward adjustment.
    (g) Effect of partial collection by State. A partial collection of 
an overpayment amount by the State from a provider during the 60-day 
period following discovery does not change the 60-day recovery period 
for the original overpayment amount due to HCFA.
    (h) Effect of administrative or judicial appeals. Any appeal rights 
extended to a provider do not extend the date of discovery.

[54 FR 5460, Feb. 3, 1989; 54 FR 8435, Feb. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 433.318  Overpayments involving providers who are bankrupt or out of business.

    (a) Basic rules. (1) The agency is not required to refund the 
Federal share of an overpayment made to a provider as required by 
Sec. 433.312(a) to the extent that the State is unable to recover the 
overpayment because the provider has been determined bankrupt or out of 
business in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (2) The agency must notify the provider that an overpayment exists 
in any case involving a bankrupt or out-of-business provider and, if the 
debt has not been determined uncollectable, take reasonable actions to 
recover the overpayment during the 60-day recovery period in accordance 
with policies prescribed by applicable State law and administrative 
procedures.
    (b) Overpayment debts that the State need not refund. Overpayments 
are considered debts that the State is unable to recover within the 60-
day period following discovery if the following criteria are met:
    (1) The provider has filed for bankruptcy, as specified in paragraph 
(c) of this section; or
    (2) The provider has gone out of business and the State is unable to 
locate the provider and its assets, as specified in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (c) Bankruptcy. The agency is not required to refund to HCFA the 
Federal share of an overpayment at the end of the 60-day period 
following discovery, if--
    (1) The provider has filed for bankruptcy in Federal court at the 
time of discovery of the overpayment or the provider files a bankruptcy 
petition in Federal court before the end of the 60-day period following 
discovery; and
    (2) The State is on record with the court as a creditor of the 
petitioner in the amount of the Medicaid overpayment.
    (d) Out of business. (1) The agency is not required to refund to 
HCFA the Federal share of an overpayment at the end of the 60-day period 
following discovery if the provider is out of business on the date of 
discovery of the overpayment or if the provider goes out of business 
before the end of the 60-day period following discovery.
    (2) A provider is considered to be out of business on the effective 
date of a determination to that effect under State law. The agency 
must--
    (i) Document its efforts to locate the party and its assets. These 
efforts must be consistent with applicable State policies and 
procedures; and
    (ii) Make available an affidavit or certification from the 
appropriate State legal authority establishing that the provider is out 
of business and that the overpayment cannot be collected under State law 
and procedures and citing the effective date of that determination under 
State law.
    (3) A provider is not out of business when ownershp is transferred 
within the State unless State law and procedures deem a provider that 
has transferred ownership to be out of business and preclude collection 
of the overpayment from the provider.

[[Page 100]]

    (e) Circumstances requiring refunds. If the 60-day recovery period 
has expired before an overpayment is found to be uncollectable under the 
provisions of this section, if the State recovers an overpayment amount 
under a court-approved discharge of bankruptcy, or if a bankruptcy 
petition is denied, the agency must refund the Federal share of the 
overpayment in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 433.320.

[54 FR 5460, Feb. 3, 1989; 54 FR 8435, Feb. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 433.320  Procedures for refunds to HCFA.

    (a) Basic requirements. (1) The agency must refund the Federal share 
of overpayments that are subject to recovery to HCFA through a credit on 
its Quarterly Statement of Expenditures (Form HCFA-64).
    (2) The Federal share of overpayments subject to recovery must be 
credited on the Form HCFA-64 report submitted for the quarter in which 
the 60-day period following discovery, established in accordance with 
Sec. 433.316, ends.
    (3) A credit on the Form HCFA-64 must be made whether or not the 
overpayment has been recovered by the State from the provider.
    (b) Effect of reporting collections and submitting reduced 
expenditure claims. (1) The State is not required to refund the Federal 
share of an overpayment when the State reports a collection or submits 
an expenditure claim reduced by a discrete amount to recover an 
overpayment prior to the end of the 60-day period following discovery.
    (2) The State is not required to report on the Form HCFA-64 any 
collections made on overpayment amounts for which the Federal share has 
been refunded previously.
    (3) If a State has refunded the Federal share of an overpayment as 
required under this subpart and the State subsequently makes recovery by 
reducing future provider payments by a discrete amount, the State need 
not reflect that reduction in its claim for Federal financial 
participation.
    (c) Reclaiming overpayment amounts previously refunded to HCFA. If 
the amount of an overpayment is adjusted downward after the agency has 
credited HCFA with the Federal share, the agency may reclaim the amount 
of the downward adjustment on the Form HCFA-64. Under this provision--
    (1) Downward adjustment to an overpayment amount previously credited 
to HCFA is allowed only if it is properly based on the approved State 
plan, Federal law and regulations governing Medicaid, and the appeals 
resolution processes specified in State administrative policies and 
procedures.
    (2) The 2-year filing limit for retroactive claims for Medicaid 
expenditures does not apply. A downward adjustment is not considered a 
retroactive claim but rather a reclaiming of costs previously claimed.
    (d) Expiration of 60-day recovery period. If an overpayment has not 
been determined uncollectable in accordance with the requirements of 
Sec. 433.318 at the end of the 60-day period following discovery of the 
overpayment, the agency must refund the Federal share of the overpayment 
to HCFA in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (e) Court-approved discharge of bankruptcy. If the State recovers 
any portion of an overpayment under a court-approved discharge of 
bankruptcy, the agency must refund to HCFA the Federal share of the 
overpayment amount collected on the next quarterly expenditure report 
that is due to HCFA for the period that includes the date on which the 
collection occurs.
    (f) Bankruptcy petition denied. If a provider's petition for 
bankruptcy is denied in Federal court, the agency must credit HCFA with 
the Federal share of the overpayment on the later of--
    (1) The Form HCFA-64 submission due to HCFA immediately following 
the date of the decision of the court; or
    (2) The Form HCFA-64 submission for the quarter in which the 60-day 
period following discovery of the overpayment ends.
    (g) Reclaim of refunds. (1) If a provider is determined bankrupt or 
out of business under this section after the 60-day period following 
discovery of the overpayment ends and the State has not been able to 
make complete recovery, the agency may reclaim the amount of the Federal 
share of any unrecovered

[[Page 101]]

overpayment amount previously refunded to HCFA. HCFA allows the reclaim 
of a refund by the agency if the agency submits to HCFA documentation 
that it has made reasonable efforts to obtain recovery.
    (2) If the agency reclaims a refund of the Federal share of an 
overpayment--
    (i) In bankruptcy cases, the agency must submit to HCFA a statement 
of its efforts to recover the overpayment during the period before the 
petition for bankruptcy was filed; and
    (ii) In out-of-business cases, the agency must submit to HCFA a 
statement of its efforts to locate the provider and its assets and to 
recover the overpayment during any period before the provider is found 
to be out of business in accordance with Sec. 433.318.
    (h) Supporting reports. The agency must report the following 
information to support each Quarterly Statement of Expenditures Form 
HCFA-64:
    (1) Amounts of overpayments not collected during the quarter but 
refunded because of the expiration of the 60-day period following 
discovery;
    (2) Upward and downward adjustments to amounts credited in previous 
quarters;
    (3) Amounts of overpayments collected under court-approved 
discharges of bankruptcy;
    (4) Amounts of previously reported overpayments to providers 
certified as bankrupt or out of business during the quarter; and
    (5) Amounts of overpayments previously credited and reclaimed by the 
State.


<R05>
Sec. 433.322  Maintenance of records.

    The Medicaid agency must maintain a separate record of all 
overpayment activities for each provider in a manner that satisfies the 
retention and access requirements of 45 CFR part 74, subpart D.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 434.1  Basis and scope.

    (a) Basis. This part is based on sections 1902(a)(4) and 1903(m) of 
the Act. Section 1902(a)(4) requires that the State plan provide for 
methods of administration that the Secretary finds necessary for proper 
and efficient operation of the plan. Section 1903(m)(1)(A) of the Act 
defines an HMO as an entity that meets the requirements of the Public 
Health Service (PHS) Act to be a Federally qualified HMO, or meets two 
specified requirements pertaining to accessibility of services and 
fiscal solvency. Section 1903(m)(2)(A) limits risk-basis contracts for 
specified health services to entities that meet the HMO definition of 
section 1903(m)(1)(A) and sets forth certain enrollment and other 
requirements that these contracts must meet as a condition for FFP. 
Section 1903(m)(2)(B) exempts, from the limitations of section 
1903(m)(2)(A), certain specified prepayment plans that are not HMOs.
    (b) Scope. This part sets forth the requirements for contracts with 
certain organizations for furnishing Medicaid services or processing or 
paying Medicaid claims, or enchancing the agency's capability for 
effective administration of the program.

or the contract with the Medicaid agency is terminated, whichever occurs 
first.
    Risk or underwriting risk means the possibility that a contractor 
may incur a loss because the cost of providing services may exceed the 
payments made by the agency to the contractor for services covered under 
the contract.

the basis of their health status or requirements for health care 
services, including expulsion or refusal to reenroll an individual, or 
any practice that could

[[Page 111]]

reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying or discouraging 
enrollment (except as permitted by section 1903(m) of the Act) by 
eligible individuals whose medical conditions or histories indicate a 
need for substantial future medical services.
    (4) Misrepresents or falsifies information that it furnishes, under 
section 1903(m) of the Act to HCFA, the State agency, an individual, or 
any other entity.
    (5) Fails to comply with the requirements of Secs. 417.479(d) 
through (g) of this chapter relating to physician incentive plans, or 
fails to submit to the State Medicaid agency its physician incentive 
plans as required or requested in Sec. 434.70.
    (b) Effect of an agency determination. (1) When the agency 
determines that an HMO with a risk comprehensive contract has committed 
one of the violations identified in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
agency must forward this determination to HCFA. This determination 
becomes HCFA's determination for purposes of section 1903(m)(5)(A) of 
the Act, unless HCFA reverses or modifies the determination within 15 
days.
    (2) When the agency decides to recommend imposition of the sanction 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section, this recommendation becomes 
HCFA's decision, for purposes of section 1903(m)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act, 
unless HCFA rejects this recommendation within 15 days.
    (c) Notice of sanction. If a determination to impose a sanction 
becomes HCFA's determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
agency must send a written notice to the HMO stating the nature and 
basis of the proposed sanction. A copy of the notice is forwarded to the 
OIG at the same time it is sent to the HMO. The agency allows the HMO 15 
days from the date it receives the notice to provide evidence that it 
has not committed an act or failed to comply with a requirement 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable. The agency 
may allow a 15-day addition to the original 15 days upon receipt of a 
written request from the organization. To be approved, the request must 
provide a credible explanation of why additional time is necessary and 
be received by HCFA before the end of the 15-day period following the 
date the organization received the sanction notice. An extension is not 
granted if HCFA determines that the organization's conduct poses a 
threat to an enrollee's health and safety.
    (d) Informal reconsideration. (1) If the HMO submits a timely 
response to the agency's notice of sanction, the agency conducts an 
informal reconsideration that includes--
    (i) Review of the evidence by an agency official who did not 
participate in the initial recommendation to impose the sanction; and
    (ii) A concise written decision setting forth the factual and legal 
basis for the decision.
    (2) The agency decision under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section 
is forwarded to HCFA and becomes HCFA's decision unless HCFA reverses or 
modifies the decision within 15 days from the date of HCFA's receipt of 
the agency determination. In the event HCFA modifies or reverses the 
agency decision, the agency sends the HMO a copy of HCFA's decision 
under this paragraph.
    (e) Denial of payment. If a HCFA determination that a HMO has 
committed a violation described in paragraph (a) of this section is 
affirmed on review under paragraph (d) of this section, or is not timely 
contested by the HMO under paragraph (c) of this section, HCFA, based 
upon the recommendation of the agency, may deny payment for new 
enrollees of the HMO under section 1903(m)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act. Under 
Secs. 434.22 and 434.42, HCFA's denial of payment for new enrollees 
automatically results in a denial of agency payments to the HMO for the 
same enrollees. A new enrollee is an enrollee that applies for 
enrollment after the effective date in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
    (f) Effective date and duration of sanction. (1) Except as specified 
in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, a sanction is effective 
15 days after the date the HMO is notified of the decision to impose the 
sanction under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If the HMO seeks reconsideration under paragraph (d) of this 
section, the

[[Page 112]]

sanction is effective on the date specified in HCFA's reconsideration 
notice.
    (3) If HCFA, in consultation with the agency, determines that the 
HMO's conduct poses a serious threat to an enrollee's health and safety, 
the sanction may be made effective on a date prior to issuance of the 
decision under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (g) Civil money penalties. If a determination that an organization 
has committed a violation under paragraph (a) of this section becomes 
HCFA's determination under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, HCFA 
conveys the determination to the OIG. In accordance with the provisions 
of 42 CFR part 1003, the OIG may impose civil money penalties on the 
organization in addition to or in place of the sanctions that may be 
imposed under this section.
    (h) HCFA's role. HCFA retains the right to independently perform the 
functions assigned to the agency in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this 
section.
    (i) State Plan requirements. The State Plan must include a plan to 
monitor for violations specified in paragraph (a) of this section and 
for implementing the provisions of this section.

disabled individuals, and pregnant women listed under subpart D of this 
part who are not listed in subparts B and C of this part as 
categorically needy but who may be eligible for Medicaid under this part 
because their income and resources are within limits set by the State

fall within these limits after their incurred expenses for medical or 
remedial care are deducted) (Specific financial requirements for 
determining eligibility of the medically needy appear in subpart I of 
this part.);
    OAA means old age assistance under title I of the Act;
    OASDI means old age, survivors, and disability insurance under title 
II of the Act;

    A State plan must--
    (a) Provide that the requirements of this part are met; and
    (b) Specify the groups to whom Medicaid is provided, as specified in 
subparts B, C, and D of this part, and the conditions of eligibility for

        Subpart B--Mandatory Coverage of the Categorically Needy


<R05>
Sec. 435.100  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes requirements for coverage of categorically 
needy individuals.

               Mandatory Coverage of Families and Children


<R05>
Sec. 435.110  Individuals receiving aid to families with dependent children.

    (a) A Medicaid agency must provide Medicaid to individuals receiving 
AFDC.
    (b) For purposes of this section, an individual is receiving AFDC if 
his needs are included in determining the amount of the AFDC payment. 
This includes an individual whose presence in the home is considered 
essential to the well-being of a recipient (see 45 CFR 233.20(a)(2)(vi)) 
and who could be a recipient under the State's AFDC plan if that plan 
were as broad as allowed under the Act for FFP.


<R05>
Sec. 435.112  Families terminated from AFDC because of increased earnings or hours of employment.

    (a) If a family loses AFDC solely because of increased income from 
employment or increased hours of employment, the agency must continue to 
provide Medicaid for 4 months to all members of the family if--
    (1) The family received AFDC in any 3 or more months during the 6-
month period immediately before the month in which it became ineligible 
for AFDC; and
    (2) At least one member of the family is employed throughout the 4-
month period, although this need not be the same member for the whole 
period.
    (b) The 4 calendar month period begins on the date AFDC is 
terminated. If AFDC benefits are terminated retroactively, the 4 
calendar month period also begins retroactively with the first month in 
which AFDC was erroneously paid.

    The agency must provide Medicaid to:
    (a) Individuals denied AFDC solely because of policies requiring the 
deeming of income and resources of the following individuals who are not 
included as financially responsible relatives under section 
1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act;
    (1) Stepparents who are not legally liable for support of 
stepchildren under a State law of general applicability;
    (2) Grandparents;
    (3) Legal guardians;
    (4) Alien sponsors who are not organizations; and
    (5) Siblings.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 435.114  Individuals who would be eligible for AFDC except for increased OASDI income under Pub. L. 92-336 (July 1, 1972).

    The agency must provide Medicaid to individuals who meet the 
following conditions:
    (a) In August 1972, the individual was entitled to OASDI and--
    (1) He was receiving AFDC; or
    (2) He would have been eligible for AFDC if he had applied, and the 
Medicaid plan covered this optional group; or

[[Page 120]]

    (3) He would have been eligible for AFDC if he were not in a medical 
institution or intermediate care facility, and the Medicaid plan covered 
this optional group.
    (b) The individual would currently be eligible for AFDC except that 
the increase in OASDI under Pub. L. 92-336 raised his income over the 
limit allowed under AFDC. This includes an individual who--
    (1) Meets all current AFDC requirements except for the requirement 
to file an application; or
    (2) Would meet all current AFDC requirements if he were not in a 
medical institution or intermediate care facility, and the current 
Medicaid plan covers this optional group.


<R05>
Sec. 435.115  Individuals deemed to be receiving AFDC.

    (a) The Medicaid agency must provide Medicaid to individuals deemed 
to be receiving AFDC, as specified in this section.
    (b) The State must deem individuals to be receiving AFDC who are 
denied a cash payment from the title IV-A State agency solely because 
the amount of the AFDC payment would be less than $10.
    (c) The State may deem participants in a work supplementation 
program to be receiving AFDC under section 414(g) of the Act. This 
section permits States, for purposes of title XIX, to deem an individual 
and any child or relative of the individual (or other individual living 
in the same household) to be receiving AFDC, if the individual--
    (1) Participates in a State-operated work supplementation program 
under section 414 of the Act; and
    (2) Would be eligible for an AFDC cash payment if the individual 
were not participating in the work supplementation program.
    (d) The State must deem to be receiving AFDC those individuals who 
are denied AFDC payments from the title IV-A State agency solely because 
that agency is recovering an overpayment.
    (e) The State must deem to be receiving AFDC individuals described 
in section 473(a)(1) of the Act--
    (1) For whom an adoption assistance agreement is in effect under 
title IV-E of the Act, whether or not adoption assistance is being 
provided or an interlocutory or other judicial decree of adoption has 
been issued; or
    (2) For whom foster care maintenance payments are made under title 
IV-E of the Act.
    (f) The State must deem an individual to be receiving AFDC if a new 
collection or increased collection of child or spousal support under 
title IV-D of the Social Security Act results in the termination of AFDC 
eligibility in accordance with section 406(h) of the Social Security 
Act. States must continue to provide Medicaid for four consecutive 
calendar months, beginning with the first month of AFDC ineligibility, 
to each dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is 
living (including the eligible spouse of such relative as described in 
section 406(b) of the Social Security Act) who:
    (1) Becomes ineligible for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984; and
    (2) Has received AFDC for at least three of the six months 
immediately preceding the month in which the individual becomes 
ineligible for AFDC; and
    (3) Becomes ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly as a result of the 
initiation of or an increase in the amount of the child or spousal 
support collection under title IV-D.
    (g)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, 
individuals who are eligible for extended Medicaid lose this coverage if 
they move to another State during the 4-month period. However, if they 
move back to and reestablish residence in the State in which they have 
extended coverage, they are eligible for any of the months remaining in 
the 4-month period in which they are residents of the State.
    (2) If a State has chosen in its State plan to provide Medicaid to 
non-residents, the State may continue to provide the 4-month extended 
benefits to individuals who have moved to another State.
    (h) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section:
    (1) The new collection or increased collection of child or spousal 
support results in the termination of AFDC eligibility when it actively 
causes or contributes to the termination. This occurs when:

[[Page 121]]

    (i) The change in support collection in and of itself is sufficient 
to cause ineligibility. This rule applies even if the support collection 
must be added to other, stable income. It also applies even if other 
independent factors, alone or in combination with each other, might 
simultaneously cause ineligibility; or
    (ii) The change in support contributes to ineligibility but does not 
by itself cause ineligibility. Ineligibility must result when the change 
in support is combined with other changes in income or changes in other 
circumstances and the other changes in income or circumstances cannot 
alone or in combination result in termination without the change in 
support.
    (2) In cases of increases in the amounts of both support collections 
and earned income, eligibility under this section does not preclude 
eligibility under 45 CFR 233.20(a)(14) or section 1925 of the Social 
Security Act (which was added by section 303(a) of the Family Support 
Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 1396r-6)). Extended periods resulting from both 
an increase in the amount of the support collection and from an increase 
in earned income must run concurrently.

<R05>
Sec. 435.116  Qualified pregnant women and children who are not qualified family members.

    (a) The agency must provide Medicaid to a pregnant woman whose 
pregnancy has been medically verified and who--
    (1) Would be eligible for an AFDC cash payment (or would be eligible 
for an AFDC cash payment if coverage under the State's AFDC plan 
included an AFDC-unemployed parents program) if her child had been born 
and was living with her in the month of payment;
    (2) Is a member of a family that would be eligible for an AFDC cash 
payment if the State's AFDC plan included an AFDC-unemployed parents 
program; or
    (3) Meets the income and resource requirements of the State's 
approved AFDC plan. In determining whether the woman meets the AFDC 
income and resource requirements, the unborn child or children are 
considered members of the household, and the woman's family is treated 
as though deprivation exists.
    (b) The provisions of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section are 
effective October 1, 1984. The provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section are effective July 1, 1986.
    (c) The agency must provide Medicaid to children who meet all of the 
following criteria:
    (1) They are born after September 30, 1983;
    (2) Effective October 1, 1988, they are under age 6 (or if 
designated by the State, any age that exceeds age 6 but does not exceed 
age 8), and effective October 1, 1989, they are under age 7 (or if 
designated by the State, any age that exceeds age 7 but does not exceed 
age 8); and
    (3) They meet the income and resource requirements of the State's 
approved AFDC plan.

Sec. 435.117  Newborn children.

    (a) The agency must provide categorically needy Medicaid eligibility 
to a child born to a woman who is eligible as categorically needy and is 
receiving Medicaid on the date of the child's birth. The child is deemed 
to have applied and been found eligible for Medicaid on the date of 
birth and remains eligible as categorically needy for one year so long 
as the woman remains eligible as categorically needy and the child is a 
member of the woman's household. If the mother's basis of eligibility 
changes to medically needy, the child is eligible as medically needy 
under Sec. 435.301(b)(1)(iii).
    (b) The requirements under paragraph (a) of this section apply to 
children born on or after October 1, 1984.

    (a) Definition. A qualified family member is any member of a family, 
including pregnant women and children eligible for Medicaid under 
Sec. 435.116 of this subpart, who would be receiving AFDC cash benefits

    Except as allowed under Sec. 435.121, the agency must provide

receiving or are deemed to be receiving SSI. This includes individuals 
who are--
    (a) Receiving SSI pending a final determination of blindness or 
disability;
    (b) Receiving SSI under an agreement with the Social Security 
Administration to dispose of resources that exceed the SSI dollar limits 
on resources; or
    (c) Receiving benefits under section 1619(a) of the Act or in 
section 1619(b) status (blind individuals or those with disabling 
impairments whose income equals or exceeds a specific Supplemental 
Security Income limit). (Regulations at 20 CFR 416.260 through 416.269 
contain requirements governing determinations of eligibility under this 
provision.) For purposes of this paragraph (c), this mandatory 
categorically needy group of individuals includes those qualified 
severely impaired individuals defined in section 1905(q) of the Act.

[55 FR 33705, Aug. 17, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 435.121  Individuals in States using more restrictive requirements for Medicaid than the SSI requirements.

    (a) Basic eligibility group requirements. (1) If the agency does not 
provide Medicaid under Sec. 435.120 to aged, blind, and disabled 
individuals who are SSI recipients, the agency must provide Medicaid to 
aged, blind, and disabled individuals who meet eligibility requirements 
that are specified in this section.
    (2) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the agency may elect to apply more restrictive eligibility 
requirements to the aged, blind, and disabled that are more restrictive 
than those of the SSI program. The more restrictive requirements may be 
no more restrictive than those requirements contained in the State's 
Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972. If any of the State's 1972 
Medicaid plan requirements were more liberal than of the SSI program, 
the State must use the SSI requirement instead of the more liberal 
requirements, except to the extent the State elects to use more liberal 
criteria under Sec. 435.601.
    (3) The agency must not apply a more restrictive requirement under 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if:
    (i) The requirement conflicts with the requirements of section 1924 
of the Act, which governs the eligibility and post-eligibility treatment 
of income and resources of institutionalized individuals with community 
spouses;
    (ii) The requirement conflicts with a more liberal requirement which 
the agency has elected to use under Sec. 435.601; or
    (iii) The more restrictive requirement conflicts with a more liberal 
requirement the State has elected to use under Sec. 435.234(c) in 
determining eligibility for State supplementary payments.
    (b) Mandatory coverage. If the agency chooses to apply more 
restrictive requirements than SSI to aged, blind, or disabled 
individuals, it must provide Medicaid to:

[[Page 123]]

    (1) Individuals who meet the requirements of section 1619(b)(3) of 
the Act even though they may not continue to meet the requirements of 
this section; and
    (2) Qualified Medicare beneficiaries described in section 1905(p) of 
the Act and qualified working disabled individuals described in section 
1905(s) of the Act without consideration of the more restrictive 
eligibility requirements specified in this section.
    (3) Individuals who:
    (i) Qualify for benefits under section 1619(a) or are in eligibility 
status under section 1619(b)(1) of the Act as determined by SSA; and
    (ii) Were eligible for Medicaid under the more restrictive criteria 
in the State's approved Medicaid plan in the reference month--the month 
immediately preceding the first month in which they became eligible 
under section 1619(a) or (b)(1) of the Act. ``Were eligible for 
Medicaid'' means that individuals were issued Medicaid cards by the 
State for the reference month. Under this provision, the reference month 
for determining Medicaid eligibility for all individuals under section 
1619 of the Act is the month immediately preceding the first month of 
the most recent period of eligibility under section 1619 of the Act.
    (c) Group composition. The agency may apply more restrictive 
requirements only to the aged, to the blind, to the disabled, or to any 
combination of these groups. For example, the agency may apply more 
restrictive requirements to the aged and disabled under this provision 
and provide Medicaid to all blind individuals who are SSI recipients.
    (d) Nonfinancial conditions. The agency may apply more restrictive 
requirements that are nonfinancial conditions of eligibility. For 
example, the agency may use a more restrictive definition of disability 
or may limit eligibility of the disabled to individuals age 18 and 
older, or both. If the agency limits eligibility of disabled individuals 
to individuals age 18 or older, it must provide Medicaid to individuals 
under age 18 who receive SSI benefits and who would be eligible to 
receive AFDC under the State's approved plan if they did not receive 
SSI. If the agency imposed an age limit for disabled individuals under 
its 1972 approved State plan but does not use that limit, it must apply 
the same nonfinancial requirement to individuals under age 18 that it 
applies to disabled individuals age 18 and older.
    (e) Financial conditions. (1) The agency may apply more restrictive 
requirements that are financial conditions of eligibility.
    (2) Any income eligibility standards that the agency applies must:
    (i) Equal the income standard (or Federal Benefit Rate (FBR)) that 
would be used under SSI based on an individual's living arrangement; or
    (ii) Be a more restrictive standard which is no more restrictive 
than that under the approved State's January 1, 1972 Medicaid plan.
    (3) If the categorically needy income standard established under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section is less than the optional categorically 
needy standard established under Sec. 435.230, the agency must provide 
Medicaid to all aged, blind, and disabled individuals who have income 
equal to or below the higher standard.
    (4) In a State that does not have a medically needy program that 
covers aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the agency must allow 
individuals to deduct from income incurred medical and remedial expenses 
(that is, spend down) to become eligible under this section. However, 
individuals with income above the categorically needy standards may only 
spend down to the standard selected by the State under paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section which applies to the individual's living arrangement.
    (5) In a State that elects to provide medically needy coverage to 
aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the agency must allow individuals 
to deduct from income incurred medical and remedial care expenses (spend 
down) to become categorically needy when they are SSI recipients 
(including individuals deemed to be SSI recipients under Secs. 435.135, 
435.137, and 435.138), eligible spouses of SSI recipients, State 
supplement recipients, and individuals who are eligible for a supplement 
but who do not receive supplementary payments. Such persons may only 
spend

[[Page 124]]

down to the standard selected by the State under paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section. Individuals who are not SSI recipients, eligible spouses 
of SSI recipients, State supplement recipients, or individuals who are 
eligible for a supplement must spend down to the State's medically needy 
income standards for aged, blind, and disabled individuals in order to 
become Medicaid eligible.
    (f) Deductions from income. (1) In addition to any income disregards 
specified in the approved State plan in accordance with Sec. 435.601(b), 
the agency must deduct from income:
    (i) SSI payments;
    (ii) State supplementary payments that meet the conditions specified 
in Secs. 435.232 and 435.234; and
    (iii) Expenses incurred by the individual or financially responsible 
relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that are 
recognized under State law and are not subject to payment by a third 
party, unless the third party is a public program of a State or 
political subdivision of a State. These expenses include Medicare and 
other health insurance premiums, deductions and coinsurance charges, and 
copayments or deductibles imposed under Sec. 447.51 or Sec. 447.53 of 
this chapter. The agency may set reasonable limits on the amounts of 
incurred medical expenses that are deducted.
    (2) For purposes of counting income with respect to individuals who 
are receiving benefits under section 1619(a) of the Act or are in 
section 1619(b)(1) of the Act status but who do not meet the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the agency may 
disregard some or all of the amount of the individual's income that is 
in excess of the SSI Federal benefit rate under section 1611(b) of the 
Act.

    (a) For each consecutive month after December 1973--
    (1) Continue to meet the requirements for Medicaid eligibility that

<R05>
Sec. 435.134  Individuals who would be eligible except for the increase in OASDI benefits under Pub. L. 92-336 (July 1, 1972).

following conditions:
    (a) In August 1972, the individual was entitled to OASDI and--
    (1) He was receiving OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD; or
    (2) He would have been eligible for one of those programs except 
that he had not applied, and the Medicaid plan covered this optional 
group; or
    (3) He would have been eligible for one of those programs if he were 
not in a medical institution or intermediate care facility, and the 
Medicaid plan covered this optional group.
    (b) The individual would currently be eligible for SSI or a State 
supplement except that the increase in OASDI under Pub. L. 92-336 raised 
his income over the limit allowed under SSI. This includes an individual 
who--
    (1) Meets all current SSI requirements except for the requirement to 
file an application; or
    (2) Would meet all current SSI requirements if he were not in a 
medical institution or intermediate care facility, and the State's 
Medicaid plan covers this optional group.

<R05>
Sec. 435.135  Individuals who become ineligible for cash assistance as a result of OASDI cost-of-living increases received after April 1977.

    (a) If an agency provides Medicaid to aged, blind, or disabled 
individuals receiving SSI or State supplements, it must provide Medicaid 
to individuals who--
    (1) Are receiving OASDI;
    (2) Were eligible for and receiving SSI or State supplements but 
became ineligible for those payments after April 1977; and
    (3) Would still be eligible for SSI or State supplements if the 
amount of OASDI cost-of-living increases paid under section 215(i) of 
the Act, after the last month after April 1977 for which those 
individuals were both eligible for and received SSI or a State 
supplement and were entitled to OASDI, were deducted from current OASDI 
benefits.
    (b) Cost-of-living increases include the increases received by the 
individual or his or her financially responsible spouse or other family 
member (e.g., a parent).
    (c) If the agency adopts more restrictive eligibility requirements 
than those under SSI, it must provide Medicaid to individuals specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section on the same basis as Medicaid is 
provided to individuals continuing to receive SSI or State supplements. 
If the individual incurs enough medical expenses to reduce his or her 
income to the financial eligibility standard for the categorically 
needy, the agency must cover that individual as categorically needy. In 
determining the amount of his or her income, the agency may deduct the 
cost-of-living increases paid under section 215(i) after the last month 
after April 1977 for which that individual was both eligible for and 
received SSI or a State supplement and was entitled to OASDI, up to the 
amount that made him or her ineligible for SSI.

Sec. 435.137  Disabled widows and widowers who would be eligible for SSI except for the increase in disability benefits resulting from elimination of the 
          reduction factor under Pub. L. 98-21.

    (a) If the agency provides Medicaid to aged, blind, or disabled 
individuals receiving SSI or State supplements, the agency much provide 
Medicaid to disabled widows and widowers who--
    (1) Became ineligible for SSI or a mandatory or optional State 
supplement as a result of the elimination of the additional reduction 
factor for disabled widows and widowers under age 60 required by section 
134 of Pub. L. 98-21, and for purposes of title XIX, are deemed to be 
title XVI payment recipients under section 1634(b) of the Social 
Security Act; and
    (2) Meet the conditions of paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section.
    (b) The individuals must meet the following conditions:
    (1) They were entitled to monthly OASDI benefits under title II of 
the Act for December 1983:
    (2) They were entitled to and received widow's or widower's 
disability benefits under section 202(e) or (f) of the Act for January 
1984;
    (3) They became ineligible for SSI or a mandatory or optional State 
supplement in the first month in which the increase under Pub. L. 98-21 
was paid (and in which a retroactive payment for that increase for prior 
months was not made);
    (4) They have been continously entitled to widow's or widower's 
disability benefits under section 202(e) or (f) from the first month 
that the increase under Pub. L. 98-21 was received; and
    (5) They would be eligible for SSI benefits or a mandatory or 
optional State supplement if the amount of the increase under Pub. L. 
98-21 and subsequent cost-of-living adjustments in widow's or widower's 
benefits under section 215(i) of the Act were deducted from their 
income.
    (c) If the agency adopts more restrictive requirements than those 
under SSI, it must provide Medicaid to individuals specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section on the same basis as Medicaid is provided 
to individuals continuing to receive SSI or a mandatory or optional 
State supplement. The State must consider the individuals specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section to have no more income than the SSI

was paid (and in which retroactive payments for that increase for prior 
months was not being made), and the individual would be eligible for SSI 
except for the amount of the increase under Public Law 98-21 and 
subsequent cost-of-living adjustments in his or her widow's or widower's 
benefits under section 215(i) of the Act. The State must consider 
individuals who qualify under paragraph (a) of this section on the basis 
of loss of a mandatory or optional State supplementary payment, rather 
than the loss of SSI, to have no more income than the relevant SSP rate. 
If the State's income eligibility level is lower than the SSP or SSI 
Federal benefit rates, individuals qualifying under paragraph (a) of 
this section who are deemed to have income at either the SSP rate or the 
SSI Federal benefit rate may further reduce their countable income by 
incurring medical expenses in the amount by which their income exceeds 
the State's income eligibility standard. When the individual has reduced 
his or her income by this

[[Page 127]]

amount, he or she will be eligible for Medicaid as categorically needy.
    (d) The agency must notify each individual who may be eligible for 
Medicaid under this section of his or her potential eligibility, in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Secretary.
    (e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the 
provisions of this section apply only to those individuals who filed a 
written application for Medicaid on or before June 30, 1988, to obtain 
protected Medicaid coverage.
    (2) Individuals who may be eligible under this section residing in 
States that use a more restrictive income standard than that of the SSI 
program, under section 1902(f) of the Act, have up to six months after 
the State sends notice pursuant to the District Court's order in Darling 
v. Bowen (685 F. Supp. 1125 (W.D.Mo. 1988) to file a written application 
to obtain protected Medicaid coverage.

    For purposes of title XIX, individuals who meet these requirements 
are deemed to be title XVI payment recipients under section 1634(d) of

needs for medical or rehabilitative care that made the child difficult 
to place; and
    (ii) There is in effect an adoption assistance agreement between the 
State and the adoptive parent(s).

of the month in which a 60-day period, beginning on the last day of 
pregnancy, ends. Eligibility must be provided, regardless of changes in 
the woman's financial circumstances that may occur within this extended 
period. These women are eligible for the extended period for all 
services under the plan that are pregnancy-related (as defined in 
Sec. 440.210(c)(1) of this subchapter).

<R05>
Sec. 435.400  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes general requirements for determining the 
eligibility of both categorically and medically needy individuals 
specified in subparts B, C, and D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 435.401  General rules.

    (a) A Medicaid agency may not impose any eligibility requirement 
that is prohibited under Title XIX of the Act.
    (b) The agency must base any optional group covered under subparts B 
and C of this part on reasonable classifications that do not result in 
arbitrary or inequitable treatment of individuals and groups and that 
are consistent with the objectives of Title XIX.
    (c) The agency must not use requirements for determining eligibility 
for optional coverage groups that are--
    (1) For families and children, more restrictive than those used 
under the State's AFDC plan; and
    (2) For aged, blind, and disabled individuals, more restrictive than 
those used under SSI, except for individuals receiving an optional State 
supplement as specified in Sec. 435.230 or individuals in categories 
specified by the agency under Sec. 435.121.


<R05>
Sec. 435.402  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 435.403  State residence.

    (a) Requirement. The agency must provide Medicaid to eligible 
residents of the State, including residents who are absent from the 
State. The conditions under which payment for services is provided to 
out-of-State residents are set forth in Sec. 431.52 of this chapter.

[[Page 136]]

    (b) Definition. For purposes of this section--Institution has the 
same meaning as Institution and Medical institution, as defined in 
Sec. 435.1009 of this chapter. For purposes of State placement, the term 
also includes foster care homes, licensed as set forth in 45 CFR 
1355.20, and providing food, shelter and supportive services to one or 
more persons unrelated to the proprietor.
    (c) Incapability of indicating intent. For purposes of this section, 
an individual is considered incapable of indicating intent if the 
individual--
    (1) Has an I.Q. of 49 or less or has a mental age of 7 or less, 
based on tests acceptable to the mental retardation agency in the State:
    (2) Is judged legally incompetent; or
    (3) Is found incapable of indicating intent based on medical 
documentation obtained from a physician, psychologist, or other person 
licensed by the State in the field of mental retardation.
    (d) Who is a State resident. A resident of a State is any individual 
who:
    (1) Meets the conditions in paragraphs (e) through (i) of this 
section; or
    (2) Meets the criteria specified in an interstate agreement under 
paragraph (k) of this section.
    (e) Placement by a State in an out-of-State institution--(1) General 
rule. Any agency of the State, including an entity recognized under 
State law as being under contract with the State for such purposes, that 
arranges for an individual to be placed in an institution located in 
another State, is recognized as acting on behalf of the State in making 
a placement. The State arranging or actually making the placement is 
considered as the individual's State of residence.
    (2) Any action beyond providing information to the individual and 
the individual's family would constitute arranging or making a State 
placement. However, the following actions do not constitute State 
placement:
    (i) Providing basic information to individuals about another State's 
Medicaid program, and information about the availability of health care 
services and facilities in another State.
    (ii) Assisting an individual in locating an institution in another 
State, provided the individual is capable of indicating intent and 
independently decides to move.
    (3) When a competent individual leaves the facility in which the 
individual is placed by a State, that individual's State of residence 
for Medicaid purposes is the State where the individual is physically 
located.
    (4) Where a placement is initiated by a State because the State 
lacks a sufficient number of appropriate facilities to provide services 
to its residents, the State making the placement is the individual's 
State of residence for Medicaid purposes.
    (f) Individuals receiving a State supplementary payment (SSP). For 
individuals of any age who are receiving an SSP, the State of residence 
is the State paying the SSP.
    (g) Individuals receiving Title IV-E payments. For individuals of 
any age who are receiving Federal payments for foster care and adoption 
assistance under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, the State of 
residence is the State where the child lives.

emancipated from his or her parents or who is married and capable of 
indicating intent, the State of residence is the State where the 
individual is living with the intention to remain there permanently or 
for an indefinite period.
    (2) For any individual not residing in an institution as defined in 
paragraph (b) whose Medicaid eligibility is based on blindness or 
disability, the State of residence is the State in which the individual 
is living.
    (3) For any other non-institutionalized individual not subject to 
paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, the State of residence is 
determined in accordance with 45 CFR 233.40, the rules governing 
residence under the AFDC program.
    (4) For any institutionalized individual who is neither married nor 
emancipated, the State of residence is--
    (i) The parent's or legal guardian's State of residence at the time 
of placement (if a legal guardian has been appointed and parental rights 
are terminated, the State of residence of the guardian is used instead 
of the parent's); or

[[Page 137]]

    (ii) The current State of residence of the parent or legal guardian 
who files the application if the individual is institutionalized in that 
State (if a legal guardian has been appointed and parental rights are 
terminated, the State or residence of the guardian is used instead of 
the parent's).
    (iii) The State of residence of the individual or party who files an 
application is used if the individual has been abandoned by his or her 
parent(s), does not have a legal guardian and is institutionalized in 
that State.
    (i) Individuals Age 21 and over. (1) For any individual not residing 
in an institution as defined in paragraph (b), the State of residence is 
the State where the individual is--
    (i) Living with the intention to remain there permanently or for an 
indefinite period (or if incapable of stating intent, where the 
individual is living); or
    (ii) Living and which the individual entered with a job commitment 
or seeking employment (whether or not currently employed).
    (2) For any institutionalized individual who became incapable of 
indicating intent before age 21, the State of residence is--

has been appointed and parental rights are terminated, the State of 
residence of the guardian is used instead of the parent's);
    (ii) The parent's or legal guardian's State of residence at the time 
of placement (if a legal guardian has been appointed and parental rights 
are terminated, the State of residence of the guardian is used instead 
of the parent's); or
    (iii) The current State of residence of the parent or legal guardian 
who files the application if the individual is institutionalized in that 
State (if a legal guardian has been appointed and parental rights are 
terminated, the State of residence of the guardian is used instead of 
the parent's).
    (iv) The State of residence of the individual or party who files an 
application is used if the individual has been abandoned by his or her 
parent(s), does not have a legal guardian and is institutionalized in 
that State.
    (3) For any institutionalized individual who became incapable of 
indicating intent at or after age 21, the State of residence is the 
State in which the individual is physically present, except where 
another State makes a placement.
    (4) For any other institutionalized individual, the State of 
residence is the State where the individual is living with the intention 
to remain there permanently or for an indefinite period.
    (j) Specific prohibitions. (1) The agency may not deny Medicaid 
eligibility because an individual has not resided in the State for a 
specified period.
    (2) The agency may not deny Medicaid eligibility to an individual in 
an institution, who satisfies the residency rules set forth in this 
section, on the grounds that the individual did not establish residence 
in the State before entering the institution.
    (3) The agency may not deny or terminate a resident's Medicaid 
eligibility because of that person's temporary absence from the State if 
the person intends to return when the purpose of the absence has been 
accomplished, unless another State has determined that the person is a 
resident there for purposes of Medicaid.
    (k) Interstate agreements. A State may have a written agreement with 
another State setting forth rules and procedures resolving cases of 
disputed residency. These agreements may establish criteria other than 
those specified in paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section, but must 
not include criteria that result in loss of residency in both States or 
that are prohibited by paragraph (j) of this section. The agreements 
must contain a procedure for providing Medicaid to individuals pending 
resolution of the case. States may use interstate agreeements for 
purposes other than cases of disputed residency to facilitate 
administration of the program, and to facilitate the placement and 
adoption of title IV-E individuals when the child and his or her 
adoptive parent(s) move into another State.
    (l) Continued Medicaid for institutionalized recipients. If an 
agency is providing Medicaid to an institutionalized

[[Page 138]]

recipient who, as a result of this section, would be considered a 
resident of a different State--
    (1) The agency must continue to provide Medicaid to that recipient 
from June 24, 1983 until July 5, 1984, unless it makes arrangements with 
another State of residence to provide Medicaid at an earlier date: and
    (2) Those arrangements must not include provisions prohibited by 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (m) Cases of disputed residency. Where two or more States cannot 
resolve which State is the State of residence, the State where the 
individual is physically located is the State of residence.

an alien residing in the United States with the knowledge and permission 
of the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) and the INS does 
not contemplate enforcing the alien's departure. The INS does not 
contemplate enforcing an alien's departure if it is the policy or 
practice of INS not to enforce the departure of aliens in the same

case it appears that INS is otherwise permitting the alien to reside in 
the United States indefinitely, as determined by verifying the alien's 
status with INS.
    (b) Aliens who are permanently residing in the United States under 
color of law are listed below. None of the categories includes 
applicants for an Immigration and Naturalization Service status other 
than those applicants listed in paragraph (b)(6) of this section or

from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, or a copy of a court 
order establishing the alien's status;
    (8) Aliens granted asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1158). Ask for a copy of INS Form I-94 and 
a letter establishing this status;

Sec. 435.530  Definition of blindness.

    (a) Definition. The agency must use the same definition of blindness 
as used under SSI, except that--
    (1) In determining the eligibility of individuals whose Medicaid 
eligibility is protected under Secs. 435.130 through 435.134, the agency 
must use the definition of blindness that was used under the Medicaid

    (2) The agency may use a more restrictive definition to determine 
eligibility under Sec. 435.121, if the definition is no more restrictive 
than that used

                               Disability


<R05>
Sec. 435.540  Definition of disability.

    (a) Definition. The agency must use the same definition of 
disability as used under SSI, except that--
    (1) In determining the eligibility of individuals whose Medicaid 
eligibility is protected under Secs. 435.130 through 435.134, the agency 
must use the definition of disability that was used under the Medicaid 
plan in December 1973; and

than that used under the Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972.
    (b) State plan requirements. The State plan must contain the 
definition of disability.


<R05>
Sec. 435.541  Determinations of disability.

    (a) Determinations made by SSA. The following rules and those under 
paragraph (b) of this section apply where an individual has applied for 
Medicaid on the basis of disability.
    (1) If the agency has an agreement with the Social Security 
Administration (SSA) under section 1634 of the Act, the agency may not 
make a determination of disability when the only application is filed 
with SSA.
    (2) The agency may not make an independent determination of 
disability if SSA has made a disability determination within the time 
limits set forth in Sec. 435.911 on the same issues presented in the 
Medicaid application. A determination of eligibility for SSI payments 
based on disability that is made by SSA automatically confers Medicaid 
eligibility, as provided for under Sec. 435.909.
    (b) Effect of SSA determinations. (1) Except in the circumstances 
specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section--
    (i) An SSA disability determination is binding on an agency until 
the determination is changed by SSA.
    (ii) If the SSA determination is changed, the new determination is 
also binding on the agency.
    (2) The agency must refer to SSA all applicants who allege new 
information or evidence affecting previous SSA determinations of 
ineligibility based upon disability for reconsideration or reopening of 
the determination, except in cases specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section.
    (c) Determinations made by the Medicaid agency. The agency must make 
a determination of disability in accordance with the requirements of 
this section if any of the following circumstances exist:
    (1) The individual applies for Medicaid as a non-cash recipient and 
has not applied to SSA for SSI cash benefits, whether or not a State has 
a section 1634 agreement with SSA; or an individual applies for Medicaid 
and has applied to SSA for SSI benefits and is found ineligible for SSI 
for a reason other than disability.
    (2) The individual applies both to SSA for SSI and to the State 
Medicaid agency for Medicaid, the State agency has a section 1634 
agreement with SSA,

[[Page 142]]

and SSA has not made an SSI disability determination within 90 days from 
the date of the individual's application for Medicaid.
    (3) The individual applies to SSA for SSI and to the State Medicaid 
agency for Medicaid, the State does not have a section 1634 agreement 
with SSA, and either the State uses more restrictive criteria than SSI 
for determining Medicaid eligibility under its section 1902(f) option 
or, in the case of a State that uses SSI criteria, SSA has not made an 
SSI disability determination in time for the State to comply with the 
Medicaid time limit for making a prompt determination on an individual's 
application for Medicaid.
    (4) The individual applies for Medicaid as a non-cash recipient, 
whether or not the State has a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and--
    (i) Alleges a disabling condition different from, or in addition to, 
that considered by SSA in making its determination; or
    (ii) Alleges more than 12 months after the most recent SSA 
determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed 
or deteriorated since that SSA determination and alleges a new period of 
disability which meets the durational requirements of the Act, and has 
not applied to SSA for a determination with respect to these 
allegations.
    (iii) Alleges less than 12 months after the most recent SSA 
determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed 
or deteriorated since that SSA determination, alleges a new period of 
disability which meets the durational requirements of the Act, and--
    (A) Has applied to SSA for reconsideration or reopening of its 
disability decision and SSA refused to consider the new allegations; 
and/or
    (B) He or she no longer meets the nondisability requirements for SSI 
but may meet the State's nondisability requirements for Medicaid 
eligibility.
    (d) Basis for determinations. The agency must make a determination 
of disability as provided in paragraph (c) of this section--
    (1) On the basis of the evidence required under paragraph (e) of 
this section; and
    (2) In accordance with the requirements for evaluating that evidence 
under the SSI program specified in 20 CFR 416.901 through 416.998.
    (e) Medical and nonmedical evidence. The agency must obtain a 
medical report and other nonmedical evidence for individuals applying 
for Medicaid on the basis of disability. The medical report and 
nonmedical evidence must include diagnosis and other information in 
accordance with the requirements for evidence applicable to disability 
determinations under the SSI program specified in 20 CFR part 416, 
subpart I.
    (f) Disability review teams--(1) Function. A review team must review 
the medical report and other evidence required under paragraph (e) of 
this section and determine on behalf of the agency whether the 
individual's condition meets the definition of disability.
    (2) Composition. The review team must be composed of a medical or 
psychological consultant and another individual who is qualified to 
interpret and evaluate medical reports and other evidence relating to 
the individual's physical or mental impairments and, as necessary, to 
determine the capacities of the individual to perform substantial 
gainful activity, as specified in 20 CFR part 416, subpart J.
    (3) Periodic reexaminations. The review team must determine whether 
and when reexaminations will be necessary for periodic redeterminations 
of eligibility as required under Sec. 435.916 of this part, using the 
principles set forth in 20 CFR 416.989 and 416.990. If a State uses the 
same definition of disability as SSA, as provided for under 
Sec. 435.540, and a recipient is Medicaid eligible because he or she 
receives SSI, this paragraph (f)(3) does not apply. The reexamination 
will be conducted by SSA.

requirements for financial responsibility of relatives specified in 
Sec. 435.602.
    (d) Use of less restrictive methodologies than those under cash 
assistance programs. (1) At State option, and subject to the conditions 
of paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(5) of this section, the agency may 
apply income and resource methodologies that are less restrictive than 
the cash assistance methodologies in determining eligibility of the 
following groups:
    (i) Qualified pregnant women and children under the mandatory 
categorically needy group under Sec. 435.116;
    (ii) Low-income pregnant women, infants, and children specified in 
section 1902(a)(10)(i)(IV), 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), and 
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) of the Act;
    (iii) Qualified Medicare beneficiaries specified in sections 
1902(a)(10)(E) and 1905(p) of the Act;
    (iv) Optional categorically needy individuals under groups 
established under subpart C of this part and section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii) 
of the Act;
    (v) Medically needy individuals under groups established under 
subpart D of this part and section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act; 
and
    (vi) Aged, blind, and disabled individuals in States using more 
restrictive eligibility requirements than SSI under groups established 
under Secs. 435.121 and 435.230.
    (2) The income and resource methodologies that an agency elects to 
apply to groups of individuals described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section may be less restrictive, but no more restrictive (except in 
States using more restrictive requirements than SSI), than:
    (i) For groups of aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the SSI 
methodologies; or
    (ii) For all other groups, the methodologies under the State plan 
most closely categorically related to the individual's status.
    (3) A financial methodology is considered to be no more restrictive 
if, by using the methodology, additional individuals may be eligible for 
Medicaid and no individuals who are otherwise eligible are by use of 
that methodology made ineligible for Medicaid.
    (4) The less restrictive methodology applied under this section must 
be comparable for all persons within each category of assistance (aged, 
or blind, or disabled, or AFDC related) within an eligibility group. For 
example, if the agency chooses to apply less restrictive income or 
resource methodology to an eligibility group of aged individuals, it 
must apply that methodology to all aged individuals within the selected 
group.
    (5) The application of the less restrictive income and resource 
methodologies permitted under this section must be consistent with the 
limitations and conditions on FFP specified in subpart K of this part.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) State plan requirements. (1) The State plan must specify that, 
except to the extent precluded in Sec. 435.602, in determining financial 
eligibility of individuals, the agency will apply the cash assistance 
financial methodologies and requirements, unless the agency chooses to 
apply less restrictive income and resource methodologies in accordance 
with paragraph (d) of this section.

[[Page 144]]

    (2) If the agency chooses to apply less restrictive income and 
resource methodologies, the State plan must specify:
    (i) The less restrictive methodologies that will be used; and
    (ii) The eligibility group or groups to which the less restrictive 
methodologies will be applied.

Sec. 435.602  Financial responsibility of relatives and other individuals.

    (a) Basic requirements. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section, in determining financial responsibility of 
relatives and other persons for individuals under Medicaid, the agency 
must apply the following requirements and methodologies:
    (1) Except for a spouse of an individual or a parent for a child who 
is under age 21 or blind or disabled, the agency must not consider 
income and resources of any relative as available to an individual.
    (2) In relation to individuals under age 21 (as described in section 
1905(a)(i) of the Act), the financial responsibility requirements and 
methodologies that apply include considering the income and resources of 
parents or spouses whose income and resources would be considered if the 
individual under age 21 were dependent under the State's approved AFDC 
plan, whether or not they are actually contributed, except as specified 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. These requirements and 
methodologies must be applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
State's approved AFDC plan.
    (3) When a couple ceases to live together, the agency must count 
only the income of the individual spouse in determining his or her 
eligibility, beginning the first month following the month the couple 
ceases to live together.
    (4) In the case of eligible institutionalized spouses who are aged, 
blind, and disabled and who have shared the same room in a title XIX 
Medicaid institution, the agency has the option of considering these 
couples as eligible couples for purposes of counting income and 
resources or as eligible individuals, whichever is more advantageous to 
the couple.
    (b) Requirements for States using more restrictive requirements. 
Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, in 
determining financial eligibility of aged, blind, or disabled 
individuals in States that apply eligibility requirements more 
restrictive than those used under SSI, the agency must apply:
    (1) The requirements and methodologies for financial responsibility 
of relatives used under the SSI program; or
    (2) More extensive requirements for relative responsibility than 
specified in Sec. 435.602(a) but no more extensive than the requirements 
under the Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972.
    (c) Use of less restrictive methodologies. The agency may apply 
income and resources methodologies that are less restrictive than those 
used under the cash assistance programs as specified in the State 
Medicaid plan in accordance with Sec. 435.601(d).

Sec. 435.622  Individuals in institutions who are eligible under a special income level.

    (a) If an agency, under Sec. 435.231, provides Medicaid to 
individuals in medical institutions, nursing facilities, and 
intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded who would not be 
eligible for SSI or State supplements if they were not 
institutionalized, the agency must use income standards based on the 
greater need for financial assistance that the individuals would have if 
they were not in the institution. The standards may vary by the level of 
institutional care needed by the individual (hospital, nursing facility, 
or intermediate level care for the mentally retarded), or by other 
factors related to individual needs. (See Sec. 435.1005 for FFP limits 
on income standards established under this section.)
    (b) In determining the eligibility of individuals under the income 
standards established under this section, the agency must not take into 
account income that would be disregarded in determining eligibility for 
SSI or for an optional State supplement.
    (c) The agency must apply the income standards established under 
this section effective with the first day of a period of not less than

treating income elected under Secs. 435.121 and 435.230, under 
Sec. 435.601. The methods used must be comparable for all individuals 
within each category of individuals under Sec. 435.121 and each category 
of individuals within each optional categorically needy group included 
under Sec. 435.230 and for each category of individuals under the 
medically needy option described under Sec. 435.800.
    (b) Categorically needy versus medically needy eligibility. (1) 
Individuals who have income equal to, or below, the categorically needy 
income standards described in Secs. 435.121 and 435.230 are 
categorically needy in States that include the medically needy under 
their plans.
    (2) Categorically needy eligibility in States that do not include 
the medically needy is determined in accordance with the provisions of

likely to return to the home within that period.
    (3) For single individuals and couples, an amount (in addition to 
the personal needs allowance) for maintenance of the individual's or

    (3) Adjustments. At the end of the prospective period specified in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, or when any significant change occurs, 
the agency must reconcile estimates with incurred medical expenses.

     Subpart I--Specific Eligibility and Post-Eligibility Financial 
                  Requirements for the Medically Needy


<R05>
Sec. 435.800  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes specific financial requirements for 
determining the eligibility of medically needy individuals under subpart 
D of this part.

[58 FR 4932, Jan. 19, 1993]

                     Medically Needy Income Standard


<R05>
Sec. 435.811  Medically needy income standard: General requirements.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to 
determine eligibility of medically needy individuals, a Medicaid agency 
must use a single income standard under this subpart that meets the 
requirements of this section.
    (b) The income standard must take into account the number of persons 
in the assistance unit. Subject to the limitations specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The standard may not diminish by an 
increase in the number of persons in the assistance unit. For example, 
if the income level in the standard for an assistance unit of two is set 
at $400, the income level in the standard for an assistance unit of 
three may not be less than $400.
    (c) In States that do not use more restrictive requirements than 
SSI, the income standard must be set at an amount that is no lower than 
the lowest income standards used under the cash assistance programs that 
are related to the State's covered medically needy eligibility group or 
groups of individuals under Sec. 435.301. The amount of the income 
standard is subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (d) In States that use more restrictive requirements for aged, 
blind, and disabled individuals than SSI:
    (1) For all individuals except aged, blind, and disabled 
individuals, the income standard must be set in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (2) For all aged, blind, and disabled individuals or any combination 
of these groups of individuals, the agency may establish a separate 
single medically needy income standard that is more restrictive than the 
single income standard set under paragraph (c) of this section. However, 
the amount of the more restrictive separate standard for aged, blind, or 
disabled individuals must be no lower than the higher of the lowest 
categorically needy income standard currently applied under the State's 
more restrictive criteria under Sec. 435.121 or the medically needy 
income standard in effect under the State's Medicaid plan on January 1, 
1972. The amount of the income standard is subject to the limitations 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) The income standards specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section must not exceed the maximum dollar amount of income allowed for 
purposes of FFP under Sec. 435.1007.
    (f) The income standard may vary based on the variations between 
shelter costs in urban areas and rural areas.

[58 FR 4932, Jan. 19, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 435.814  Medically needy income standard: State plan requirements.

    The State plan must specify the income standard for the covered 
medically needy groups.

[58 FR 4933, Jan. 19, 1993]

                   Medically Needy Income Eligibility


<R05>
Sec. 435.831  Income eligibility.

    The agency must determine income eligibility of medically needy 
individuals in accordance with this section.
    (a) Budget periods. (1) The agency must use budget periods of not 
more than 6 months to compute income. The agency may use more than one 
budget period.
    (2) The agency may include in the budget period in which income is 
computed all or part of the 3-month retroactive period specified in 
Sec. 435.914. The budget period can begin no earlier than the first 
month in the retroactive period in which the individual received covered 
services. This provision applies to all medically needy individuals 
except in groups for whom criteria more restrictive than that used in 
the SSI program apply.
    (3) If the agency elects to begin the first budget period for the 
medically

[[Page 152]]

needy in any month of the 3-month period prior to the date of the 
application in which the applicant received covered services, this 
election applies to all medically needy groups.
    (b) Determining countable income. The agency must deduct the 
following amounts from income to determine the individual's countable 
income.
    (1) For individuals under age 21 and caretaker relatives, the agency 
must deduct amounts that would be deducted in determining eligibility 
under the State's AFDC plan.
    (2) For aged, blind, or disabled individuals in States covering all 
SSI recipients, the agency must deduct amounts that would be deducted in 
determining eligibility under SSI. However, the agency must also deduct 
the highest amounts from income that would be deducted in determining 
eligibility for optional State supplements if these supplements are paid 
to all individuals who are receiving SSI or would be eligible for SSI 
except for their income.
    (3) For aged, blind, or disabled individuals in States using income 
requirements more restrictive than SSI, the agency must deduct amounts 
that are no more restrictive than those used under the Medicaid plan on 
January 1, 1972 and no more liberal than those used in determining 
eligibility under SSI or an optional State supplement. However, the 
amounts must be at least the same as those that would be deducted in 
determining eligibility, under Sec. 435.121, of the categorically needy.
    (c) Eligibility based on countable income. If countable income 
determined under paragraph (b) of this section is equal to or less than 
the applicable income standard under Sec. 435.814, the individual or 
family is eligible for Medicaid.
    (d) Deduction of incurred medical expenses. If countable income 
exceeds the income standard, the agency must deduct from income medical 
expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially responsible 
relatives that are not subject to payment by a third party. An expense 
is incurred on the date liability for the expense arises. The agency 
must determine deductible incurred expenses in accordance with 
paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section and deduct those expenses 
in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (e) Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required 
deductions based on kinds of services. Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (g), in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted 
from income, the agency must include the following:
    (1) Expenses for Medicare and other health insurance premiums, and 
deductibles or coinsurance charges, including enrollment fees, 
copayments, or deductibles imposed under Sec. 447.51 or Sec. 447.53 of 
this subchapter;
    (2) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially 
responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that 
are recognized under State law but not included in the plan;
    (3) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or by financially 
responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that 
are included in the plan, including those that exceed agency limitations 
on amount, duration, or scope of services.
    (f) Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required 
deductions based on the age of bills. Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (g), in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted 
from income, the agency must include the following:
    (1) For the first budget period or periods that include only months 
before the month of application for medical assistance, expenses 
incurred during such period or periods, whether paid or unpaid, to the 
extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in 
establishing eligibility;
    (2) For the first prospective budget period that also includes any 
of the 3 months before the month of application for medical assistance, 
expenses incurred during such budget period, whether paid or unpaid, to 
the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in 
establishing eligibility;
    (3) For the first prospective budget period that includes none of 
the months preceding the month of application, expenses incurred during 
such

[[Page 153]]

budget period and any of the 3 preceding months, whether paid or unpaid, 
to the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in 
establishing eligibility;
    (4) For any of the 3 months preceding the month of application that 
are not includable under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, expenses 
incurred in the 3-month period that were a current liability of the 
individual in any such month for which a spenddown calculation is made 
and that had not been previously deducted from income in establishing 
eligibility for medical assistance;
    (5) Current payments (that is, payments made in the current budget 
period) on other expenses incurred before the current budget period and 
not previously deducted from income in any budget period in establishing 
eligibility for such period; and
    (6) If the individual's eligibility for medical assistance was 
established in each such preceding period, expenses incurred before the 
current budget period but not previously deducted from income in 
establishing eligibility, to the extent that such expenses are unpaid 
and are:
    (i) Described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section; 
and
    (ii) Carried over from the preceding budget period or periods 
because the individual had a spenddown liability in each such preceding 
period that was met without deducting all such incurred, unpaid 
expenses.
    (g) Determination of deductible incurred medical expenses: Optional 
deductions. In determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from 
income, the agency--
    (1) May include medical institutional expenses (other than expenses 
in acute care facilities) projected to the end of the budget period at 
the Medicaid reimbursement rate;
    (2) May, to the extent determined by the State and specified in its 
approved plan, include expenses incurred earlier than the third month 
before the month of application (except States using more restrictive 
eligibility criteria under the option in section 1902(f) of the Act must 
deduct incurred expenses regardless of when the expenses were incurred); 
and
    (3) May set reasonable limits on the amount to be deducted for 
expenses specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (g)(2) of this 
section.
    (h) Order of deduction. The agency must deduct incurred medical 
expenses that are deductible under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this 
section in the order prescribed under one of the following three 
options:
    (1) Type of service. Under this option, the agency deducts expenses 
in the following order based on type of expense or service:
    (i) Cost-sharing expenses as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.
    (ii) Services not included in the State plan as specified in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section but that exceed limitations on amounts, duration, 
or scope of services.
    (iv) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section but that are within agency limitations on amount, 
duration, or scope of services.
    (2) Chronological order by service date. Under this option, the 
agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each service 
is furnished, or in the case of insurance premiums, coinsurance or 
deductible charges, the date such amounts are due. Expenses for services 
furnished on the same day may be deducted in any reasonable order 
established by the State.
    (3) Chronological order by bill submission date. Under this option, 
the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each bill 
is submitted to the agency by the individual. If more than one bill is 
submitted at one time, the agency must deduct the bills from income in 
the order prescribed in either paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this 
section.
    (i) Eligibility based on incurred medical expenses.
    (1) Whether a State elects partial or full month coverage, an 
individual who is expected to contribute a portion of his or her income 
toward the costs of institutional care or home and community-based 
services under Secs. 435.725,

[[Page 154]]

435.726, 435.733, 435.735 or 435.832 is eligible on the first day of the 
applicable budget (spenddown) period--
    (i) If his or her spenddown liability is met after the first day of 
the budget period; and
    (ii) If beginning eligibility after the first day of the budget 
period makes the individual's share of health care expenses under 
Secs. 435.725, 435.726, 435.733, 435.735 or 435.832 greater than the 
individual's contributable income determined under these sections.
    (2) At the end of the prospective period specified in paragraphs 
(f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, and any subsequent prospective period 
or, if earlier, when any significant change occurs, the agency must 
reconcile the projected amounts with the actual amounts incurred, or 
with changes in circumstances, to determine if the adjusted deduction of 
incurred expenses reduces income to the income standard.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, in 
States that elect partial month coverage, an individual is eligible for 
Medicaid on the day that the deduction of incurred health care expenses 
(and of projected institutional expenses if the agency elects the option 
under paragraph (g)(1) of this section) reduces income to the income 
standard.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, in 
States that elect full month coverage, an individual is eligible on the 
first day of the month in which spenddown liability is met.
    (5) Expenses used to meet spenddown liability are not reimbursable 
under Medicaid. To the extent necessary to prevent the transfer of an 
individual's spenddown liability to the Medicaid program, States must 
reduce the amount of provider charges that would otherwise be 
reimbursable under Medicaid.

<R05>
Sec. 435.832  Post-eligibility treatment of income of institutionalized individuals: Application of patient income to the cost of care.

    (a) Basic rules. (1) The agency must reduce its payment to an 
institution, for services provided to an individual specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section, by the amount that remains after 
deducting the amounts specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, from the individual's total income.
    (2) The individual's income must be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Medical expenses must be determined in accordance with paragraph

    (c) Required deductions. The agency must deduct the following 
amounts, in the following order, from the individual's total income, as 
determined under paragraph (e) of this section. Income that was 
disregarded in determining eligibility must be considered in this 
process.
    (1) Personal needs allowance. A personal needs allowance that is 
reasonable in amount for clothing and other personal needs of the 
individual while in the institution. This protected personal needs 
allowance must be at least--
    (i) $30 a month for an aged, blind, or disabled individual, 
including a child applying for Medicaid on the basis of blindness or 
diability.
    (ii) $60 a month for an institutionalized couple if both spouses are 
aged, blind, or disabled and their income is considered available to 
each other in determining eligibility; and
    (iii) For other individuals, a reasonable amount set by the agency, 
based on a reasonable difference in their personal needs from those of 
the aged, blind, and disabled.
    (2) Maintenance needs of spouse. For an individual with only a 
spouse at home, an additional amount for the maintenance needs of the 
spouse. This amount must be based on a reasonable assessment of need but 
must not exceed the highest of--
    (i) The amount of the income standard used to determine eligibility 
for SSI for an individual living in his own home;
    (ii) The amount of the highest income standard, in the appropriate 
category of age, blindness, or disability,

[[Page 155]]

used to determine eligibility for an optional State supplement for an 
individual in his own home, if the agency provides Medicaid to optional 
State supplement recipients under Sec. 435.230; or
    (iii) The amount of the medically needy income standard for one 
person established under Sec. 435.811.
    (3) Maintenance needs of family. For an individual with a family at 
home, an additional amount for the maintenance needs of the family. This 
amount must--
    (i) Be based on a reasonable assessment of their financial need;
    (ii) Be adjusted for the number of family members living in the 
home; and
    (iii) Not exceed the highest of the following need standards for a 
family of the same size:
    (A) The standard used to determine eligibility under the State's 
approved AFDC plan.
    (B) The medically needy income standard established under 
Sec. 435.811.
    (4) Expenses not subject to third party payment. Amounts for 
incurred expenses for medical or remedial care that are not subject to 
payment by a third party, including--
    (i) Medicare and other health insurance permiums, deductibles, or 
coinsurance charges; and
    (ii) Necessary medical or remedial care recognized under State law 
but not covered under the State's Medicaid plan, subject to reasonable 
limits the agency may establish on amounts of these expenses.
    (d) Optional deduction: Allowance for home maintenance. For single 
individuals and couples, an amount (in addition to the personal needs 
allowance) for maintenance of the individual's or couple's home if--
    (1) The amount is deducted for not more than a 6-month period; and
    (2) A physician has certified that either of the individuals is 
likely to return to the home within that period.
    (e) Determination of income--(1) Option. In determining the amount 
of an individual's income to be used to reduce the agency's payment to 
the institution, the agency may use total income received or it may 
project total monthly income for a prospective period not to exceed 6 
months.
    (2) Basis for projection. The agency must base the projection on 
income received in the preceding period, not to exceed 6 months, and on 
income expected to be received.
    (3) Adjustments. At the end of the prospective period specified in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or when any significant change occurs, 
the agency must reconcile estimates with income received.
    (f) Determination of medical expenses--(1) Option. In determining 
the amount of medical expenses to be deducted from an individual's 
income, the agency may deduct incurred medical expenses, or it may 
project medical expenses for a prospective period not to exceed 6 
months.
    (2) Basis for projection. The agency must base the estimate on 
medical expenses incurred in the preceding period, not to exceed 6 
months, and medical expenses expected to be incurred.
    (3) Adjustments. At the end of the prospective period specified in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, or when any significant change occurs, 
the agency must reconcile estimates with incurred medical expenses.

Sec. 435.840  Medically needy resource standard: General requirements.

    (a) To determine eligibility of medically needy individuals, a 
Medicaid agency must use a single resource standard that meets the 
requirements of this section.
    (b) In States that do not use more restrictive criteria than SSI for 
aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the resource standard must be 
established at an amount that is no lower than the lowest resource 
standard used under the cash assistance programs that relate to the 
State's covered medically needy eligibility group or groups of 
individuals under Sec. 435.301.
    (c) In States using more restrictive requirements than SSI:

[[Page 156]]

    (1) For all individuals except aged, blind, and disabled 
individuals, the resource standard must be set in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) For all aged, blind, and disabled individuals or any combination 
of these groups of individuals, the agency may establish a separate 
single medically needy resource standard that is more restrictive than 
the single resource standard set under paragraph (b) of this section. 
However, the amount of the more restrictive separate standard for aged, 
blind, or disabled individuals must be no lower than the higher of the 
lowest categorically needy resource standard currently applied under the 
State's more restrictive criteria under Sec. 435.121 or the medically 
needy resource standard in effect under the State's Medicaid plan on 
January 1, 1972.
    (d) The resource standard established under paragraph (a) of this 
section may not diminish by an increase in the number of persons in the 
assistance unit. For example, the resource standard for an assistance 
unit of three may not be less than that set for a unit of two.

<R05>
Sec. 435.845  Medically needy resource eligibility.

    To determine eligibility on the basis of resources for medically 
needy individuals, the agency must:
    (a) Consider only the individual's resources and those that are 
considered available to him under the financial responsibility 
requirements for relatives in Sec. 435.602.
    (b) Deduct the amounts that would be deducted in determining 
resource eligibility for the medically needy group as provided for in 
Sec. 435.601 or under the criteria of States using more restrictive 
criteria than SSI as provided for in Sec. 435.121. In determining the 
amount of an individual's resources for Medicaid eligibility, States 
must count amounts of resources that otherwise would not be counted 
under the conditional eligibility provisions of the SSI or AFDC 
programs.
    (c) Apply the resource standard specified under Sec. 435.840.

participating in the Medicaid program and providing services to 
Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and children; or
    (ii) Other outstation locations, which include at least some, 
disproportionate share hospitals and federally-qualified health centers, 
as specified under an alternative State plan that is submitted to and 
approved by HCFA if the following conditions are met:
    (A) The State must demonstrate that the alternative plan for

Medicaid eligibility under Sec. 431.10 of this subchapter.
    (e) Staffing. (1) Except for outstation locations that are 
infrequently used by the low-income eligibility groups, the State agency 
must have staff available at each outstation location during the regular 
office operating hours of the State Medicaid agency to accept

F, of this subchapter, to the prohibition against reassignment of 
provider claims specified in Sec. 447.10 of this subchapter, and to all 
other State or Federal laws concerning conflicts of interest.
    (5) At locations that are infrequently used by the designated low-
income eligibility groups, the State agency may use volunteers, provider 
or contractor employees, or its own eligibility staff, or telephone 
assistance.
    (i) The agency must display a notice in a prominent place at the 
outstation location advising potential applicants of when outstation 
intake workers will be available.
    (ii) The notice must include a telephone number that applicants may

45 days of receipt of an item of information, request verification (if 
appropriate), determine whether the information affects eligibility or 
the amount of medical assistance payment, and either initiate a notice 
of case action to advise the recipient of any adverse action the agency 
intends to take or make an entry in the casefile that no further action 
is necessary.
    (d) Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, if the agency does not 
receive requested third party verification within the 45-day period 
after receipt of information, the agency may determine whether the 
information affects eligibility or correct amount of medical assistance 
payment after the 45-day period. However, the agency must make any 
delayed determinations permitted under this paragraph--
    (1) Promptly, as required by Sec. 435.916, if the verification is 
received before the next redetermination; or
    (2) In conjunction with the next redetermination if no verification 
is received before that redetermination.
    (e) The number of determinations delayed beyond 45 days from receipt 
of an item of information (as permitted by paragraph (d) of this 
section) must not exceed twenty percent of the number of items of 
information for which verification was requested.
    (f) The agency must use appropriate procedures to monitor the 
timeliness requirements of this section.
    (g) The requirements of this section do not relieve the agency of 
its responsibility for determinations of erroneous payments or the 
agency's liability for those erroneous payments, as defined in subpart P 
of part 431 of this chapter.

Sec. 435.953  Identifying items of information to use.

    (a) With respect to information received on recipients under 
Secs. 435.940 through 435.960, the agency may either review and compare 
against the case file all items of information received or it may 
identify (target) separately for each data source the information items 
that are most likely to be most productive in identifying and preventing 
ineligibility and incorrect payments.
    (b) An agency that wishes to exclude categories of information items 
must submit for the Secretary's approval a follow-up plan describing the 
categories that it proposes to exclude. For each category, the agency 
must provide a reasonable justification that follow-up is not cost-
effective; a formal cost/benefit analysis is not required.
    (c) If an agency receives an item of unemployment compensation 
information from the Internal Revenue Service or earnings information 
from SSA that duplicates an item of information previously received from 
another source and followed up, the agency may exclude that information 
item without justification.
    (d) An agency may submit a follow-up plan or alter its plan at any 
time by notifying the Secretary and submitting the necessary 
justification. The Secretary approves or disapproves categories of items 
to be excluded under the plan within 60 days of its submission. The 
categories approved by the

[[Page 165]]

Secretary constitute an approved agency follow-up plan for IEVS.

<R05>
Sec. 435.955  Additional requirements regarding information released by a Federal agency.

    (a) Unless waived under paragraph (d) of this section, based on 
information received from a computerized data match in which information 
on an individual is provided to the agency by a Federal agency, the 
agency may not terminate, deny, suspend, or reduce medical assistance to 
that individual until it has taken appropriate steps to verify the 
information independently. The agency must independently verify 
information relating to--
    (1) The amount of the income and resource that generated the income 
involved;
    (2) Whether the applicant or recipient actually has (or had) access 
to the resource or income (or both) for his or her own use;
    (3) The period or periods when the individual actually has (or had) 
access to the resource or income or both.
    (b) The agency must verify the information by either
    (1) Requesting the entity from which the information originally came 
to verify the fact and amount of income or resource; or
    (2) Sending the applicant or recipient a letter informing that 
individual of the information received and asking him or her to respond 
within a specified period. The letter must clearly explain the 
information the agency has and its possible relevance to the 
individual's past or future eligibility, and be as neutral in tone as 
possible.
    (c)(1) If the original source of the income or resource or the 
applicant or recipient verifies the information, and the agency intends 
to reduce, suspend, terminate or deny medical assistance based on the 
information, the agency must send the applicant or recipient a notice of 
the action to be taken and include information on the right to appeal 
and opportunity for a hearing under Secs. 431.200 through 431.246 of 
this chapter (see also Sec. 435.912 and Sec. 435.919).
    (2) If the applicant or recipient fails to respond after reasonable 
attempts to contact him or her, the agency must proceed to deny, 
terminate, reduce or suspend medical assistance based on the applicant's 
or recipient's failure to cooperate.
    (3) If the applicant or recipient disputes the information, the 
agency must obtain evidence (from the source of the data, applicant, 
recipient, or otherwise) to substantiate any negative case action it may 
take.
    (d) The independent verification requirement concerning a category 
of data received from a Federal benefit agency may be waived if the 
Federal agency's Data Integrity Board approves the waiver. The Federal 
benefit agency involved in the data exchange will develop the request by 
petitioning its Data Integrity Board for a waiver of independent 
verification by a Medicaid State agency. The State agency must furnish 
the Federal agency with any information it needs to seek the Data 
Integrity Board's approval of the waiver.
    (e) In accordance with the Federal agency's procedures, the agency 
must provide data on the costs and benefits of the matching program to 
the Federal agency from which it receives information on individuals.
    (f) In accordance with the Federal agency's procedures, the agency 
must certify to the Federal agency that it will not take adverse action 
against an individual until the information has been independently 
verified and until 10 days (or sooner if permitted by Sec. 431.213 or 
Sec. 431.214) after the individual has been notified of the findings and 
given an opportunity to contest.
    (g) In accordance with the Federal agency's procedures for renewals 
of matching programs, the agency must certify to the Federal agency that 
the terms of the agreement have been followed.

Sec. 435.960  Standardized formats for furnishing and obtaining information to verifying income and eligibility.

    (a) The agency must maintain for all applicants and recipients 
within an agency file the SSN, surname and other data elements in a 
format that at

[[Page 166]]

a minimum allows the agency to furnish and to obtain eligibility and 
income information from the agencies or programs referenced in 
Sec. 435.945(b) and Sec. 435.948(a).
    (b) The format to be used will be prescribed by--
    (1) HCFA when the agency furnishes information to, or requests 
information from, any Federal or State agency, except SSA and the 
Internal Revenue Service as specified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3), 
respectively;
    (2) The Commissioner of Social Security when the agency requests 
information from SSA; and
    (3) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue when the agency requests 
information from the Internal Revenue Service.

<R05>
Sec. 435.965  Delay of effective date.

    (a) If the agency submits, by May 29, 1986, a plan describing a good 
faith effort to come into compliance with the requirements of section 
1137 of the Act and of Secs. 435.910 and 435.940 through 435.960 of this 
subpart, the Secretary may, after consultation with the Secretary of 
Agriculture and the Secretary of Labor, grant a delay in the effective 
date of Secs. 435.910 and 435.940 through 435.960, but not beyond 
September 30, 1986.
    (b) The Secretary may not grant a delay of the effective date of 
section 1137(c) of the Act, which is implemented by Sec. 435.955 (a) and 
(c). (The provisions of these statutory and regulation sections require 
the agency to follow certain procedures before taking any adverse 
actions based on information from the Internal Revenue Service 
concerning unearned income.)

recipient's liability. (See Sec. 435.914 and Sec. 436.901 of this 
subchapter for regulations on retroactive eligibility for Medicaid.)

<R05>
Sec. 435.1003  FFP for redeterminations.

that a recipient has been determined ineligible for SSI, FFP is 
available in Medicaid expenditures for services to the recipient as

    (c) When a change in Federal law affects the eligibility of 
substantial numbers of Medicaid recipients, the Secretary may waive the 
otherwise applicable FFP requirements and redetermination time limits of 
this section, in order to provide a reasonable time to complete such 
redeterminations. The Secretary will designate an additional amount of 
time beyond that allowed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
within which FFP will be available, to perform large numbers of 
redeterminations arising from a change in Federal law.

    For recipients in institutions whose Medicaid eligibility is based 
on a special income standard established under Sec. 435.236, FFP is

[45 FR 24887, Apr. 11, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 435.1007  Categorically needy, medically needy, and qualified Medicare beneficiaries.

    (a) FFP is available in expenditures for covered services provided 
to categorically needy recipients, medically needy recipients, and 
qualified Medicare beneficiaries, subject to the restrictions contained 
in subpart K of this part and as provided in paragraphs (b) and (e) of 
this section. However, the restrictions listed in paragraphs (b) and (e) 
of this section do not apply to expenditures for medical assistance made 
on behalf of qualified Medicare beneficiaries under section 1905(p) of 
the Act; individuals receiving Medicaid as categorically needy under 
section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), or (VII) 
and section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii) (I), (IX), or (X) of the Act; individuals 
who are eligible to receive benefits (or would be eligible for those 
benefits if they were not in a medical institution); and any individuals 
deemed to be members of the groups identified in this sentence.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, 
FFP is not available in State expenditures for individuals (including 
the medically

[[Page 168]]

needy) whose annual income after deductions specified in Sec. 435.831 
(a) and (c) does not exceed the following amounts, rounded to the next 
higher multiple of $100.
    (1) For individuals, 133\1/3\ percent of the highest money payment 
amount most frequently made to one-person families without income and 
resources under the State's AFDC plan.
    (2) For couples and families of two or more, 133\1/3\ percent of the 
highest money payment most frequently made under the State's AFDC plan 
to a family of the same size without income and resources. If the 
State's AFDC plan specifies a maximum family size beyond where there is 
no increase in benefits, the medically needy income levels for families 
whose size exceeds that maximum will be determined by adding an amount 
for each family member over the maximum size. These amounts must be 
reasonably related to the amounts by which the State's AFDC plan 
increases benefits for additional family members in families below the 
maximum size.
    (c) In the case of a family consisting only of two individuals, both 
of whom are adults and at least one of whom is aged, blind, or disabled, 
the State of California may use the amount of the AFDC payment most 
frequently made to a family of one adult and two children for purposes 
of computing the 133\1/3\ percent limitation (under the authority of 
section 4106 of Public Law 100-230).
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a State that 
as of June 1, 1989, has in its State plan (as defined in section 
2373(c)(5) of Public Law 98-369 as amended by section 9 of Public Law 
100-93) an amount for individuals that was reasonably related to 133\1/
3\ percent of the highest amount of AFDC which would ordinarily be paid 
to a family of two without income or resources may use an amount based 
upon a reasonable relationship to such an AFDC standard for a family of 
two.
    (e) FFP is not available in expenditures for services provided to 
categorically needy and medically needy recipients subject to the FFP 
limits if their annual income, after the cash assistance income 
deductions are applied and before the less restrictive income deductions 
under Sec. 435.601(c) are applied, exceeds the 133\1/3\ percent 
limitation described under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 435.1008  Institutionalized individuals.

    (a) FFP is not available in expenditures for services provided to--
    (1) Individuals who are inmates of public institutions as defined in 
Sec. 435.1009; or
    (2) Individuals under age 65 who are patients in an institution for 
mental diseases unless they are under age 22 and are receiving inpatient 
psychiatric services under Sec. 440.160 of this subchapter.
    (b) The exclusion of FFP described in paragraph (a) of this section 
does not apply during that part of the month in which the individual is 
not an inmate of a public institution or a patient in an institution for 
tuberculosis or mental diseases.
    (c) An individual on conditional release or convalescent leave from 
an institution for mental diseases is not considered to be a patient in 
that institution. However, such an individual who is under age 22 and 
has been receiving inpatient psychiatric services under Sec. 440.160 of 
this subchapter is considered to be a patient in the institution until 
he is unconditionally released or, if earlier, the date he reaches age 
22.

    In an institution refers to an individual who is admitted to live 
there and receive treatment or services provided there that are 
appropriate to his requirements.

    (a) He is in a public educational or vocational training institution 
for purposes of securing education or vocational training; or
    (b) He is in a public institution for a temporary period pending 
other arrangements appropriate to his needs.

diseases, whether or not it is licensed as such. An institution for the 
mentally retarded is not an institution for mental diseases.
    Institution for the mentally retarded or persons with related

needs; and a physician's guidance on the professional aspects of 
operating the institution.
    Outpatient means a patient of an organized medical facility or 
distinct part of that facility who is expected by

[[Page 170]]

the facility to receive, and who does receive, professional services for 
less than a 24-hour period regardless of the hour of admission, whether 
or not a bed is used or whether or not the patient remains in the 
facility past midnight.

    (b) It is manifested before the person reaches age 22.
    (c) It is likely to continue indefinitely.

    Public institution means an institution that is the responsibility 
of a governmental unit or over which a governmental unit exercises 
administrative control. The term ``public institution'' does not include  

    (a) A medical institution as defined in this section;
    (b) An intermediate care facility as defined in Secs. 440.140 and 
440.150 of this chapter;
    (c) A publicly operated community residence that serves no more than

individuals, and pregnant women listed in subpart D of this part who are

after their incurred expenses for medical or remedial care are 
deducted). (Specific financial requirements for determining eligibility 
of the medically needy appear in subpart I of this part.)

    This subpart prescribes requirements for coverage of categorically 
needy individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 436.110  Individuals receiving cash assistance.

    (a) A Medicaid agency must provide Medicaid to individuals receiving 
cash assistance under OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD.
    (b) For purposes of this section, an individual is receiving cash 
assistance if his needs are considered in determining the amount of the 
payment. This includes an individual whose presence in the home is 
considered essential to the well-being of a recipient under the State's 
plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD if that plan were as broad as 
allowed under the Act for FFP.

Sec. 436.111  Individuals who are not eligible for cash assistance because of a requirement not applicable under Medicaid.

eligible for OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD except for an eligibility 
requirement used in those programs that is specifically prohibited under 
title XIX of the Act.
    (b) The agency also must provide Medicaid to:

[[Page 175]]

    (1) Individuals denied AFDC solely because of policies requiring the 
deeming of income and resources of the following individuals who are not

[58 FR 4934, Jan. 19, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 43053, Aug. 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 436.112  Individuals who would be eligible for cash assistance except for increased OASDI under Pub. L. 92-336 (July 1, 1972).

    The agency must provide Medicaid to individuals who meet the 
following conditions:
    (a) In August 1972, the individual was entitled to OASDI and--
    (1) He was receiving cash assistance; or
    (2) He would have been eligible for cash assistance if he had 
applied, and the Medicaid plan covered this optional group; or
    (3) He would have been eligible for cash assistance if he were not 
in a medical institution or intermediate care facility, and the Medicaid 
plan covered this optional group.
    (b) The individual would currently be eligible for cash assistance 
except that the increase in OASDI under Pub. L. 92-336 raised his income 
over the limit allowed under the cash assistance program. This includes 
an individual who--
    (1) Meets all current requirements for cash assistance except for 
the requirement to file an application; or
    (2) Would meet all current requirements for cash assistance if he 
were not in a medical institution or intermediate care facility, and the 
Medicaid plan covers this optional group.


<R05>
Sec. 436.114  Individuals deemed to be receiving AFDC.

    (a) The Medicaid agency must provide Medicaid to individuals deemed 
to be receiving AFDC, as specified in this section.
    (b) The State must deem individuals to be receiving AFDC who are 
denied a cash payment from the title IV-A State agency solely because 
the amount of the AFDC payment would be less than $10.
    (c) The State may deem participants in a work supplementation 
program to be receiving AFDC under section 414(g) of the Act. This 
section permits States, for purposes of title XIX, to deem an individual 
and any child or relative of the individual (or other individual living 
in the same household) to be receiving AFDC, if the individual--
    (1) Participates in a State-operated work supplementation program 
under section 414 of the Act; and
    (2) Would be eligible for an AFDC cash payment if the individual 
were not participating in the work supplementation program.
    (d) The State must deem to be receiving AFDC those individuals who 
are denied AFDC payments from the title IV-A State agency solely because 
that agency is recovering an overpayment.
    (e) The State must deem to be receiving AFDC individuals described 
in section 473(a)(1) of the Act--
    (1) For whom an adoption assistance agreement is in effect under 
title IV-E of the Act, whether or not adoption assistance is being 
provided or an interlocutory or other judicial decree of adoption has 
been issued; or
    (2) For whom foster care maintenance payments are made under title 
IV-E of the Act.
    (f) The State must deem an individual to be receiving AFDC if a new 
collection or increased collection of child or spousal support under 
title IV-D of the Social Security Act results in the termination of AFDC 
eligibility in accordance with section 406(h) of the Social Security 
Act. States must continue to provide Medicaid for four consecutive 
calendar months, beginning with the first month of AFDC ineligibility, 
to each dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is 
living (including the eligible spouse of such relative as described in 
section 406(b) of the Social Security Act) who:
    (1) Becomes ineligible for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984; and

[[Page 176]]

    (2) Has received AFDC for at least three of the six months 
immediately preceding the month in which the individual becomes 
ineligible for AFDC; and
    (3) Becomes ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly as a result of the 
initiation of or an increase in the amount of a child or spousal support 
collection under title IV-D.
    (g)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, 
individuals who are eligible for extended Medicaid lose this coverage if 
they move to another State during the 4-month period. However, if they 
move back to and reestablish residence in the State in which they have 
extended coverage, they are eligible for any of the months remaining in 
the 4-month period in which they are residents of the State.
    (2) If a State has chosen in its State plan to provide Medicaid to 
non-residents, the State may continue to provide the 4-month extended 
benefits to individuals who have moved to another State.
    (h) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section:
    (1) The new collection or increased collection of child or spousal 
support results in the termination of AFDC eligibility when it actively 
causes or contributes to the termination. This occurs when:
    (i) The change in support collection in and of itself is sufficient 
to cause ineligibility. This rule applies even if the support collection 
must be added to other, stable income. It also applies even if other 
independent factors, alone or in combination with each other, might 
simultaneously cause ineligibility; or
    (ii) The change in support contributes to ineligibility but does not 
by itself cause ineligibility. Ineligibility must result when the change 
in support is combined with other changes in income or changes in other 
circumstances and the other changes in income or circumstances cannot 
alone or in combination result in termination without the change in 
support.
    (2) In cases of increases in the amounts of both the support 
collections and earned income, eligibility under this section does not 
preclude eligibility under 45 CFR 233.20(a)(14) or section 1925 of the 
Social Security Act (which was added by section 303(a) of the Family 
Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 1396r-6)). Extended periods resulting 
from both an increase in the amount of the support collection and from 
an increase in earned income must run concurrently.

Nov. 17, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 436.116  Families terminated from AFDC because of increased earnings or hours of employment.

    (a) If a family loses AFDC solely because of increased income from 
employment or increased hours of employment, the agency must continue to 
provide Medicaid for 4 months to all members of the family if--
    (1) The family received AFDC in any 3 or more months during the 6-
month period immediately before the month in which it became ineligible 
for AFDC; and
    (2) At least one member of the family is employed throughout the 4-
month period, although this need not be the same member for the whole 
period.
    (b) The 4 calendar month period begins on the date AFDC is 
terminated. If AFDC benefits are terminated retroactively, the 4 
calendar month period also begins retroactively with the first month in 
which AFDC was erroneously paid.

[47 FR 28656, July 1, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 436.120  Qualified pregnant women and children who are not qualified family members.

    (a) The Medicaid agency must provide Medicaid to a pregnant woman 
whose pregnancy has been medically verified and who--
    (1) Would be eligible for an AFDC cash payment (or would be eligible 
for

[[Page 177]]

an AFDC cash payment if coverage under the State's AFDC plan included 
the AFDC-unemployed parents program) if her child had been born and was 
living with her in the month of payment;
    (2) Is a member of a family that would be eligible for an AFDC cash 
payment if the State's AFDC plan included an AFDC-unemployed parents 
program; or
    (3) Meets the income and resource requirements of the State's 
approved AFDC plan. In determining whether the woman meets the AFDC 
income and resource requirements, the unborn child or children are 
considered members of the household, and the woman's family is treated 
as though deprivation exists.

prohibited under title XIX.
    (b) The agency must base any optional group covered under subparts B

consistent with the objectives of title XIX.
    (c) The agency must not use requirements for determining eligibility

<R05>
Sec. 436.402  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 436.403  State residence.

    (a) Requirement. The agency must provide Medicaid to eligible 
residents of the State, including residents who are absent from the 
State. The conditions under which payment for service is provided to 
out-of-State residents are set forth in Sec. 431.52 of this chapter.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of this section--Institution has the 
same meaning as Institution and Medical institution, as defined in 
Sec. 435.1009 of this chapter. For purposes of State placement, the term 
also includes ``foster care homes'', licensed as set forth in 45 CFR 
1355.20, and providing food, shelter and supportive services to one or 
more persons unrelated to the proprietor.
    (c) Incapability of indicating intent. For purposes of this section, 
an individual is considered incapable of indicating intent if the 
individual--
    (1) Has an I.Q. of 49 or less or has a mental age of 7 or less, 
based on tests acceptable to the mental retardation agency in the State;
    (2) Is judged legally incompetent; or
    (3) Is found incapable of indicating intent based on medical 
documentation obtained from a physician, psychologist, or other person 
licensed by the State in the field of mental retardation.
    (d) Who is a State resident. A resident of a State is any individual 
who:
    (1) Meets the conditions in paragraphs (e) through (h) of this 
section; or

[[Page 183]]

    (2) Meets the criteria specified in an interstate agreement under 
paragraph (j) of this section.
    (e) Placement by a State in an out-of-state institution--(1) General 
rule. Any agency of the State, including an entity recognized under 
State law as being under contract with the State for such purposes, that 
arranges for an individual to be placed in an institution located in 
another State, is recognized as acting on behalf of the State in making 
a placement. The State arranging or actually making the placement is 
considered as the individual's State of residence.
    (2) Any action beyond providing information to the individual and 
the individual's family would constitute arranging or making a State 
placement. However, the following actions do not constitute State 
placement:
    (i) Providing basic information to individuals about another State's 
Medicaid program, and information about the availability of health care 
services and facilities in another State.
    (ii) Assisting an individual in locating an institution in another 
State provided the individual is capable of indicating intent and 
independently decides to move.
    (3) When a competent individual leaves the facility in which the 
individual is placed by a State, that individual's State of residency 
for Medicaid purposes is the State where the individual is physically 
located.
    (4) Where placement is initiated by a State because the State lacks 
a sufficient number of appropriate facilities to provide services to its 
residents, the State making the placement is the individual's State of 
residence for Medicaid purposes.
    (f) Individuals receiving title IV-E payments. For individuals of 
any age who are receiving Federal payment for foster care and adoption 
assistance under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, the State of 
residence is the State where the child lives.
    (g) Individuals under age 21. (1) For any individual who is 
emancipated from his or her parents or who is married and capable of 
indicating intent, the State of residence is the State where the 
individual is living with the intention to remain there permanently or 
for an indefinite period.
    (2) For any individual not residing in an institution as defined in 
paragraph (b) whose Medicaid eligibility is based on blindness or 
disability, the State of residence is the State in which the individual 
is living.
    (3) For any other non-institutionalized individual not subject to 
paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, the State of residence is 
determined in accordance with 45 CFR 233.40, the rules governing 
residence under the AFDC program.
    (4) For any institutionalized individual who is neither married nor 
emancipated, the State of residence is--
    (i) The parents' or legal guardian's current State of residence at 
the time of placement; or
    (ii) The current State of residence of the parent or legal guardian 
who files the application, if the individual is institutionalized in 
that State. If a legal guardian has been appointed and the parental 
rights are terminated, the State of residence of the guardian is used 
instead of the parent's.
    (iii) The State of residence of the individual or party who files an 
application is used if the individual has been abandoned by his or her 
parent(s), does not have a legal guardian and is institutionalized in 
that State.
    (h) Individuals age 21 and over. (1) For any individual not residing 
in an institution as defined in paragraph (b), the State of residence is 
the State where the individual is--
    (i) Living with the intention to remain there permanently or for an 
indefinite period (or if incapable of stating intent, where the 
individual is living); or
    (ii) Living and which the individual entered with a job commitment 
or seeking employment (whether or not currently employed).
    (2) For any institutionalized individual who became incapable of 
indicating intent before age 21, the State of residence is--
    (i) That of the parents applying for Medicaid on the individual's 
behalf, if the parents reside in separate States;
    (ii) The parent's or legal guardian's State of residence at the time 
of placement; or

[[Page 184]]

    (iii) The current State of residence of the parent or legal guardian 
who files the application, if the individual is institutionalized in 
that State. If a legal guardian has been appointed and parental rights 
are terminated, the State of residence of the guardian is used instead 
of the legal parent's.
    (iv) The State of residence of the individual or party who files an 
application is used if the individual has been abandoned by his or her 
parent(s), does not have a legal guardian and is institutionalized in 
that State.
    (3) For any institutionalized individual who became incapable of 
indicating intent at or after age 21, the State of residence is the 
State in which the individual is physically present, except where 
another State makes a placement.
    (4) For any other institutionalized individual, the State of 
residence is the State where the individual is living with the intention 
to remain there permanently or for an indefinite period.
    (i) Specific prohibitions. (1) The agency may not deny Medicaid 
eligibility because an individual has not resided in the State for a 
specified period.
    (2) The agency may not deny Medicaid eligibility to an individual in 
an institution, who satisfies the residency rules set forth in this 
section, on the grounds that the individual did not establish residence 
in the State before entering the institution.
    (3) The agency may not deny or terminate a resident's Medicaid 
eligibility because of that person's temporary absence from the State if 
the person intends to return when the purpose of the absence has been 
accomplished, unless another State has determined that the person is a 
resident there for purposes of Medicaid.
    (j) Interstate agreements. A State may have a written agreement with 
another State setting forth rules and procedures resolving cases of 
disputed residency. These agreements may establish criteria other than 
those specified in paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section, but must 
not include criteria that result in loss of residency in both States or 
that are prohibited by paragraph (i) of this section. The agreements 
must contain a procedure for providing Medicaid to individuals pending 
resolution of the case.

States may use interstate agreements for purposes other than cases of 
disputed residency to facilitate administration of the program, and to 
facilitate the placement and adoption of title IV-E individuals when the 
child and his or her adoptive parent(s) move into another State.
    (k) Continued Medicaid for institutionalized recipients. An agency 
is providing Medicaid to an institutionalized recipient who, as a result 
of this section, would be considered a resident of a different State--
    (1) The agency must continue to provide Medicaid to that recipient 
from June 24, 1983 until July 5, 1984 unless it makes arrangements with 
another State of residence to provide Medicaid at an earlier date; and
    (2) Those arrangements must not include provisions prohibited by 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (l) Cases of disputed residency. Where two or more States cannot 
resolve which State is the State of residence, the State where the 
individual is physically located is the State of residence.

Medically Needy Income Eligibility and Liability for Payment of Medical 
                                Expenses


<R05>
Sec. 436.831  Income eligibility.

    The agency must determine income eligibility of medically needy 
individuals in accordance with this section.
    (a) Budget periods. (1) The agency must use budget periods of not 
more than 6 months to compute income. The agency may use more than one 
budget period.
    (2) The agency must include in the budget period in which income is 
computed all or part of the 3-month retroactive period specified in 
Sec. 435.914. The budget period can begin no earlier then the first 
month in the retroactive period in which the individual received covered 
services.
    (3) If the agency elects to begin the first budget period for the 
medically needy in any month of the 3-month period prior to the date of 
application in which the applicant received covered services, this 
election applies to all medically needy groups.
    (b) Determining countable income. The agency must, to determine 
countable income, deduct amounts that would be deducted in determining 
eligibility under the State's approved plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or 
AABD.

[[Page 191]]

    (c) Eligibility based on countable income. If countable income 
determined under paragraph (b) of this section is equal to or less than 
the applicable income standard under Sec. 436.814, the individual is 
eligible for Medicaid.
    (d) Deduction of incurred medical expenses. If countable income 
exceeds the income standard, the agency must deduct from income medical 
expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially responsible 
relatives that are not subject to payment by a third party. An expense 
is incurred on the date liability for the expense arises. The agency 
must determine deductible incurred expenses in accordance with 
paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of this section and deduct those expenses in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (e) Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required 
deductions based on kinds of services. Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (g) of this section, in determining incurred medical expenses 
to be deducted from income, the agency must include the following:
    (1) Expenses for Medicare and other health insurance premiums, and 
deductibles or coinsurance charges, including enrollment fees, 
copayments, or deductibles imposed under Sec. 447.51 or Sec. 447.53 of 
this chapter;
    (2) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially 
responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that 
are recognized under State law but not included in the plan;
    (3) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or by financially 
responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that 
are included in the plan, including those that exceed agency limitations 
on amount, duration or scope of services;
    (f) Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required 
deductions based on the age of bills. Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (g) of this section, in determining incurred medical expenses 
to be deducted from income, the agency must include the following:
    (1) For the first budget period or periods that include only months 
before the month of application for medical assistance, expenses 
incurred during such period or periods, whether paid or unpaid, to the 
extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in 
establishing eligibility;
    (2) For the first prospective budget period that also includes any 
of the 3 months before the month of application for medical assistance, 
expenses incurred during such budget period, whether paid or unpaid, to 
the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in 
establishing eligibility;
    (3) For the first prospective budget period that includes none of 
the months preceding the month of application, expenses incurred during 
such budget period and any of the 3 preceding months, whether paid or 
unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been deducted 
previously in establishing eligibility;
    (4) For any of the 3 months preceding the month of application that 
are not includable under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, expenses 
incurred in the 3-month period that were a current liability of the 
individual in any such month for which a spenddown calculation is made 
and that had not been previously deducted from income in establishing 
eligibility for medical assistance;
    (5) Current payments (that is, payments made in the current budget 
period) on other expenses incurred before the current budget period and 
not previously deducted from income in any budget period in establishing 
eligibility for such period; and
    (6) If the individual's eligibility for medical assistance was 
established in each such preceding period, expenses incurred before the 
current budget period but not previously deducted from income, to the 
extent that such expenses are unpaid and are:
    (i) Described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section; 
and
    (ii) Are carried over from the preceding budget period or periods 
because the individual had a spenddown liability in each such preceding 
period that was met without deducting all such incurred, unpaid 
expenses.
    (g) Determination of deductible incurred medical expenses: Optional 
deductions. In determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from 
income, the agency--

[[Page 192]]

    (1) May include medical institutional expenses (other than expenses 
in acute care facilities) projected to the end of the budget period at 
the Medicaid reimbursement rate;
    (2) May, to the extent determined by the agency and specified in its 
approved plan, include expenses incurred earlier than the third month 
before the month of application; and
    (3) May set reasonable limits on the amount to be deducted for 
expenses specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (g)(2) of this 
section.
    (h) Order of deduction. The agency must deduct incurred medical 
expenses that are deductible under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this 
section, in the order prescribed under one of the following three 
options:
    (1) Type of service. Under this option, the agency deducts expenses 
in the following order based on type of service:
    (i) Cost-sharing expenses as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.
    (ii) Services not included in the State plan as specified in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section but that exceed agency limitations on amount, 
duration, or scope of services.
    (iv) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section but that are within agency limitations on amount, 
duration, or scope of services.
    (2) Chronological order by service date. Under this option, the 
agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each service 
is furnished, or in the case of insurance premiums, coinsurance, or 
deductibles charges the date such amounts are due. Expenses for services 
furnished on the same day may be deducted in any reasonable order 
established by the State.
    (3) Chronological order by bill submission date. Under this option, 
the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each bill 
is submitted to the agency by the individual. If more than one bill is 
submitted at one time, the agency must deduct the bills from income in 
the order prescribed in either paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this 
section.
    (i) Eligibility based on incurred medical expenses.
    (1) Whether a State elects partial or full month coverage, an 
individual who is expected to contribute a portion of his or her income 
toward the costs of institutional care or home and community-based 
services under Sec. 436.832 is eligible on the first day of the 
applicable budget (spenddown) period--
    (i) If his or her spenddown liability is met after the first day of 
the budget period; and
    (ii) If beginning eligibility after the first day of the budget 
period makes the individual's share of health care expenses under 
Sec. 436.832 greater than the individual's contributable income 
determined under this section.
    (2) At the end of the prospective period specified in paragraph 
(f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section and any subsequent prospective period 
or, if earlier, when any significant change occurs, the agency must 
reconcile the projected amounts with the actual amounts incurred, or 
with changes in circumstances, to determine if the adjusted deduction of 
incurred expenses reduces income to the income standard.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, if 
agencies elect partial month coverage, an individual is eligible for 
Medicaid on the day that the deduction of incurred health care expenses 
(and of projected institutional expenses if the agency elects the option 
under paragraph (g)(1) of this section) reduces income to the income 
standard.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, if 
agencies elect full month coverage, an individual is eligible on the 
first day of the month in which spenddown liability is met.
    (5) Expenses used to meet spenddown liability are not reimbursable 
under Medicaid. Therefore, to the extent necessary to prevent the 
transfer of an individual's spenddown liability to the Medicaid program, 
States must reduce the amount of provider charges that would otherwise 
be reimbursable under Medicaid.

<R05>
Sec. 436.832  Post-eligibility treatment of income of institutionalized individuals: Application of patient income to the cost of care.

    (a) Basic rules. (1) The agency must reduce its payment to an 
institution, for services provided to an individual specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section, by the amount that remains after 
deducting the amounts specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section from the individual's total income.
    (2) The individual's income must be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Medical expenses must be determined in accordance with paragraph 
(f) of this section.
    (b) Applicability. This section applies to medically needy 
individuals in medical institutions and intermediate care facilities.
    (c) Required deductions. The agency must deduct the following 
amounts, in the following order, from the individual's total income as 
determined under paragraph (e) of this section. Income that was 
disregarded in determining eligibility must be considered in this 
process.
    (1) Personal needs allowance. A personal needs allowance that is 
reasonable in amount for clothing and other personal needs of the 
individual while in the institution. This protected personal needs 
allowance must be at least--
    (i) $30 a month for an aged, blind, or disabled individual, 
including a child applying for Medicaid on the basis of blindness or 
disability;
    (ii) $60 a month for an institutionalized couple if both spouses are 
aged, blind, or disabled and their income is considered available to 
each other in determining eligibility; and
    (iii) For other individuals, a reasonable amount set by the agency, 
based on a reasonable difference in their personal needs from those of 
the aged, blind, or disabled.
    (2) Maintenance needs of spouse. For an individual with only a 
spouse at home, an additional amount for the maintenance needs of the 
spouse. This amount must be based on a reasonable assessment of need but 
must not exceed the higher of--
    (i) The amount of the highest need standard for an individual 
without income and resources under the State's approved plan for OAA, 
AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD; or
    (ii) The amount of the highest medically needy income standard for 
one person established under Sec. 436.811.
    (3) Maintenance needs of family. For an individual with a family at 
home, an additional amount for the maintenance needs of the family. This 
amount must--
    (i) Be based on a reasonable assessment of their financial need;
    (ii) Be adjusted for the number of family members living in the 
home; and
    (iii) Not exceed the highest of the following need standards for a 
family of the same size:
    (A) The standard used to determine eligibility under the State's 
Medicaid plan, as provided for in Sec. 436.811.
    (B) The standard used to determine eligibility under the State's 
approved AFDC plan.
    (4) Expenses not subject to third party payment. Amounts for 
incurred expenses for medical or remedial care that are not subject to 
payment by a third party, including--
    (i) Medicare and other health insurance premiums, deductibles, or 
coinsurance charges; and
    (ii) Necessary medical or remedial care recognized under State law 
but not covered under the State's Medicaid plan, subject to reasonable 
limits the agency may establish on amounts of these expenses.
    (d) Optional deduction: Allowance for home maintenance. For single 
individuals and couples, an amount (in addition to the personal needs 
allowance) for maintenance of the individual's or couple's home if--
    (1) The amount is deducted for not more than a 6-month period; and
    (2) A physician has certified that either of the individuals is 
likely to return to the home within that period.
    (e) Determination of income--(1) Option. In determining the amount 
of an individual's income to be used to reduce the agency's payment to 
the institution, the agency may use total income received or it may 
project total

[[Page 194]]

monthly income for a prospective period not to exceed 6 months.
    (2) Basis for projection. The agency must base the projection on 
income received in the preceding period, not to exceed 6 months, and on 
income expected to be received.
    (3) Adjustments. At the end of the prospective period specified in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or when any significant change occurs, 
the agency must reconcile estimates with income received.
    (f) Determination of medical expenses--(1) Option. In determining 
the amount of medical expenses to be deducted from an individual's 
income, the agency may deduct incurred medical expenses, or it may 
project medical expenses for a prospective period not to exceed 6 
months.
    (2) Basis for projection. The agency must base the estimate on 
medical expenses incurred in the preceding period, not to exceed 6 
months, and medical expenses expected to be incurred.
    (3) Adjustments. At the end of the prospective period specified in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, or when any significant change occurs, 
the agency must reconcile estimates with incurred medical expenses.

                    Medically Needy Resource Standard


<R05>
Sec. 436.840  Medically needy resource standard: General requirements.

    (a) To determine eligibility of medically needy individuals, the 
Medicaid agency must use a single resource standard that is set at an 
amount that is no lower than the lowest resource standard used on or 
after January 1, 1966, to determine eligibility under the cash 
assistance programs that are related to the State's covered medically 
needy group or groups of individuals under Sec. 436.301.
    (b) The resource standard established under paragraph (a) of this 
section may not diminish by an increase in the number of persons in the 
assistance unit. For example, the resource level in the standard for an 
assistance unit of three may not be less than that set for an assistance 
unit of two.

            Determining Eligibility on the Basis of Resources


<R05>
Sec. 436.845  Medically needy resource eligibility.

    To determine eligibility on the basis of resources for medically 
needy individuals, the agency must--
    (a) Consider only the individual's resources and those that are 
considered available to him under the financial responsibility 
requirements for relatives under Sec. 436.602;
    (b) Consider only resources available during the period for which 
income is computed under Sec. 436.831(a);
    (c) Deduct the value of resources that would be deducted in 
determining eligibility under the State's plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, 
or AABD or under the State's less restrictive financial methodology 
specified in the State Medicaid plan in accordance with Sec. 436.601. In 
determining the amount of an individual's resources for Medicaid 
eligibility, States must count amounts of resources that otherwise would 
not be counted under the conditional eligibility provisions of the AFDC 
program.
    (d) Apply the resource standards established under Sec. 436.840.

specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that are provided to

MR, regardless of when the discharge occurred.
    (2) Services included. The agency may include as expanded 
habilitation services the following services:
    (i) Prevocational services, which means services that prepare an 
individual for paid or unpaid employment and that are not job-task 
oriented but are, instead, aimed at a generalized result. These services 
may include, for example, teaching an individual such concepts as 
compliance, attendance, task completion, problem solving and safety. 
Prevocational services are distinguishable from noncovered vocational 
services by the following criteria:

able to join the general work force or participate in a transitional 
sheltered workshop within one year (excluding supported employment 
programs).
    (B) If the recipients are compensated, they are compensated at less 
than 50 percent of the minimum wage;

at teaching specific job skills but at underlying habilitative goals 
(for example, attention span, motor skills); and
    (D) The services are reflected in a plan of care directed to 
habilitative rather than explicit employment objectives.
    (ii) Educational services, which means special education and related 
services (as defined in sections 602(16) and (17) of the Education of 
the Handicapped Act) (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16 and 17)) to the extent they are 
not prohibited under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

[[Page 207]]

    (iii) Supported employment services, which facilitate paid 
employment, that are--
    (A) Provided to persons for whom competitive employment at or above 
the minimum wage is unlikely and who, because of their disabilities, 
need intensive ongoing support to perform in a work setting;
    (B) Conducted in a variety of settings, particularly worksites in 
which persons without disabilities are employed; and
    (C) Defined as any combination of special supervisory services, 
training, transportation, and adaptive equipment that the State 
demonstrates are essential for persons to engage in paid employment and 
that are not normally required for nondisabled persons engaged in 
competitive employment.
    (3) Services not included. The following services may not be 
included as habilitation services:
    (i) Special education and related services (as defined in sections 
602(16) and (17) of the Education of the Handicapped Act) (20 U.S.C. 
1401 (16) and (17)) that are otherwise available to the individual 
through a local educational agency.

to the individual through a program funded under section 110 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 730).
    (d) Services for the chronically mentally ill--(1) Services 
included. Services listed in paragraph (b)(8) of this section include 
those provided to individuals who have been diagnosed as being 
chronically mentally ill, for which the agency has requested approval as 
part of either a new waiver request or a renewal and which have been 
approved by HCFA on or after October 21, 1986.
    (2) Services not included. Any home and community-based service, 
including those indicated in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, may not 
be included in home and community-based service waivers for the 
following individuals:
    (i) For individuals aged 22 through 64 who, absent the waiver, would 
be institutionalized in an institution for mental diseases (IMD); and, 
therefore, subject to the limitation on IMDs specified in 
Sec. 435.1008(a)(2) of this subchapter.
    (ii) For individuals, not meeting the age requirements described in 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, who, absent the waiver, would be

<R05>

    (a) Basic conditions for continuation of FFP. FFP may be continued 
for up to 30 days after the effective date of termination or expiration 
of a provider agreement, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The Medicaid payments are for recipients admitted to the 
facility before the effective date of termination or expiration.
    (2) The State agency is making reasonable efforts to transfer those 
recipients to other facilities or to alternate care.
    (b) When the 30-day period begins. The 30-day period begins on one 
of the following:
    (1) The effective date of termination of the facility's provider 
agreement by HCFA;
    (2) The effective date of termination of the facility's Medicaid 
provider agreement by the Medicaid agency on its own volition; or
    (3) In the case of an ICF/MR, the later of--

<R05>
Sec. 441.12  Inpatient hospital tests.

    Except in an emergency situation (see Sec. 440.170(e)(1) of this 
chapter for definition), FFP is not available in expenditures for 
inpatient hospital tests unless the tests are specifically ordered by 
the attending physician or other licensed practitioner, acting within 
the scope of practice as defined under State law, who is responsible for 
the diagnosis or treatment of a particular patient's condition.

[46 FR 48554, Oct. 1, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 441.13  Prohibitions on FFP: Institutionalized individuals.

    (a) FFP is not available in expenditures for services for--
    (1) Any individual who is in a public institution, as defined in 
Sec. 435.1009 of this subchapter; or
    (2) Any individual who is under age 65 and is in an institution for 
mental diseases, except an individual who is under age 22 and receiving 
inpatient psychiatric services under subpart D of this part.
    (b) With the exception of active treatment services (as defined in 
Sec. 483.440(a) of this chapter for residents of ICFs/MR and in

psychiatric services), payments to institutions for the mentally 
retarded or persons with related conditions and to psychiatric 
facilities or programs providing inpatient psychiatric services to 
individuals under age 21 may not include reimbursement for formal 
educational services or for vocational services. Formal educational 
services relate to training in traditional academic subjects. Subject 
matter rather than setting, time of day, or class size determines 
whether a service is educational. Traditional academic subjects include, 
but are not limited to, science, history, literature, foreign languages, 
and mathematics. Vocational services relate to organized programs that 
are directly related to the preparation of individuals for paid or 
unpaid employment. An example of vocational services is time-limited 
vocational training provided as a part of a regularly scheduled class 
available to the general public.
    (c) FFP is not available in expenditures for services furnished by 
an organ procurement organization on or after April 1, 1988, that does

    (3) Medical supplies, equipment, and appliances.
    (b) The agency provides home health services to--
    (1) Categorically needy recipients age 21 or over;

<R05>
Sec. 441.16  Home health agency requirements for surety bonds; Prohibition on FFP.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context 
indicates otherwise--
    Assets includes but is not limited to any listing that identifies 
Medicaid recipients to whom home health services were furnished by a 
participating or formerly participating HHA.
    Participating home health agency means a ``home health agency'' 
(HHA) as that term is defined at Sec. 440.70(d) of this subchapter.
    Surety bond means one or more bonds issued by one or more surety 
companies under 31 U.S.C. 9304 to 9308 and 31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 
225, provided the bond otherwise meets the requirements of this section.
    Uncollected overpayment means an ``overpayment,'' as that term is 
defined under Sec. 433.304 of this subchapter, plus accrued interest, 
for which the HHA is responsible, that has not been recouped by the 
Medicaid agency within a time period determined by the Medicaid agency.
    (b) Prohibition. FFP is not available in expenditures for home 
health services under Sec. 440.70 of this subchapter unless the home 
health agency furnishing these services meets the surety bond 
requirements of paragraphs (c) through (l) of this section.
    (c) Basic requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, each HHA that is a Medicaid participating HHA or that seeks to 
become a Medicaid participating HHA must--
    (1) Obtain a surety bond that meets the requirements of this section 
and instructions issued by the Medicaid agency; and
    (2) Furnish a copy of the surety bond to the Medicaid agency.
    (d) Requirement waived for Government-operated HHAs. An HHA operated 
by a Federal, State, local, or tribal government agency is deemed to 
have provided the Medicaid agency with a comparable surety bond under 
State law, and is therefore exempt from the requirements of this section 
if, during the preceding 5 years, the HHA has not had any uncollected 
overpayments.
    (e) Parties to the bond. The surety bond must name the HHA as 
Principal, the Medicaid agency as Obligee, and the surety company (and 
its heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assignees, jointly 
and severally) as Surety.
    (f) Authorized Surety and exclusion of surety companies. An HHA may 
obtain a surety bond required under this section only from an authorized 
Surety.
    (1) An authorized Surety is a surety company that--
    (i) Has been issued a Certificate of Authority by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9304 to 9308 and 
31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 225 as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds 
and the Certificate has neither expired nor been revoked;
    (ii) Has not been determined by the Medicaid agency to be an 
unauthorized Surety for the purpose of an HHA obtaining a surety bond 
under this section; and
    (iii) Meets other conditions, as specified by the Medicaid agency.
    (2) The Medicaid agency may determine that a surety company is an 
unauthorized Surety under this section--
    (i) If, upon request by the Medicaid agency, the surety company 
fails to furnish timely confirmation of the issuance of, and the 
validity and accuracy of information appearing on, a surety bond that an 
HHA presents to the Medicaid agency that shows the surety company as 
Surety on the bond;
    (ii) If, upon presentation by the Medicaid agency to the surety 
company of a request for payment on a surety bond and of sufficient 
evidence to establish the surety company's liability on the bond, the 
surety company fails to timely pay the Medicaid agency in full the 
amount requested up to the face amount of the bond; or
    (iii) For other good cause.
    (3) The Medicaid agency must specify the manner by which public 
notification of a determination under paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
is given and the effective date of the determination.
    (4) A determination by the Medicaid agency that a surety company is 
an unauthorized Surety under paragraph (f)(2) of this section--
    (i) Has effect only within the State; and

[[Page 216]]

    (ii) Is not a debarment, suspension, or exclusion for the purposes 
of Executive Order No. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189).
    (g) Amount of the bond.
    (1) Basic rule. The amount of the surety bond must be $50,000 or 15 
percent of the annual Medicaid payments made to the HHA by the Medicaid 
agency for home health services furnished under this subchapter for 
which FFP is available, whichever is greater.
    (2) Computation of the 15 percent: Participating HHA. The 15 percent 
is computed by the Medicaid agency on the basis of Medicaid payments 
made to the HHA for the most recent annual period for which information 
is available as specified by the Medicaid agency.
    (3) Computation of 15 percent: An HHA that seeks to become a 
participating HHA by obtaining assets or ownership interest. For an HHA 
that seeks to become a participating HHA by purchasing the assets or the 
ownership interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA, the 
15 percent is computed on the basis of Medicaid payments made by the 
Medicaid agency to the participating or formerly participating HHA for 
the most recent annual period as specified by the Medicaid agency.
    (4) Computation of 15 percent: Change of ownership. For an HHA that 
undergoes a change of ownership (as ``change of ownership'' is defined 
by the State Medicaid agency) the 15 percent is computed on the basis of 
Medicaid payments made by the Medicaid agency to the HHA for the most 
recent annual period as specified by the Medicaid agency.
    (5) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA without 
obtaining assets or ownership interest. For an HHA that seeks to become 
a participating HHA without purchasing the assets or the ownership 
interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA, the 15 
percent computation does not apply.
    (6) Exception to the basic rule. If an HHA's overpayment in the most 
recent annual period exceeds 15 percent, the State Medicaid agency may 
require the HHA to secure a bond in an amount up to or equal to the 
amount of the overpayment, provided the amount of the bond is not less 
than $50,000.
    (7) Expiration of the 15 percent provision. For an annual surety 
bond, or for a rider on a continuous surety bond, that is required to be 
submitted on or after June 1, 2005, notwithstanding any reference in 
this section to 15 percent as a basis for determining the amount of the 
bond, the amount of the bond or rider, as applicable, must be $50,000 or 
such amount as the Medicaid agency specifies in accordance with 
paragraph (g)(6) of this section, whichever amount is greater.
    (h) Additional requirements of the surety bond. The surety bond that 
an HHA obtains under this section must meet the following additional 
requirements:
    (1) The bond must guarantee that, upon written demand by the 
Medicaid agency to the Surety for payment under the bond and the 
Medicaid agency furnishing to the Surety sufficient evidence to 
establish the Surety's liability under the bond, the Surety will timely 
pay the Medicaid agency the amount so demanded, up to the stated amount 
of the bond.
    (2) The bond must provide that the Surety is liable for uncollected 
overpayments, as defined in paragraph (a), provided such uncollected 
overpayments are determined during the term of the bond and regardless 
of when the overpayments took place. Further, the bond must provide that 
the Surety remains liable if the HHA fails to furnish a subsequent 
annual bond that meets the requirements of this subpart or fails to 
furnish a rider for a year for which a rider is required to be 
submitted, or if the HHA's provider agreement terminates and that the 
Surety's liability shall be based on the last bond or rider in effect 
for the HHA, which shall then remain in effect for an additional 2-year 
period.
    (3) The bond must provide that the Surety's liability to the 
Medicaid agency is not extinguished by any of the following:
    (i) Any action by the HHA or the Surety to terminate or limit the 
scope or term of the bond. The Surety's liability may be extinguished, 
however, when--
    (A) The Surety furnishes the Medicaid agency with notice of such 
action not later than 10 days after receiving notice from the HHA of 
action by the HHA to terminate or limit the scope of

[[Page 217]]

the bond, or not later than 60 days before the effective date of such 
action by the Surety; or
    (B) The HHA furnishes the Medicaid agency with a new bond that meets 
the requirements of both this section and the Medicaid agency.
    (ii) The Surety's failure to continue to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section or the Medicaid agency's determination 
that the surety company is an unauthorized surety under paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section.
    (iii) Termination of the HHA's provider agreement described under 
Sec. 431.107 of this subchapter.
    (iv) Any action by the Medicaid agency to suspend, offset, or 
otherwise recover payments to the HHA.
    (v) Any action by the HHA to--
    (A) Cease operation;
    (B) Sell or transfer any assets or ownership interest;
    (C) File for bankruptcy; or
    (D) Fail to pay the Surety.
    (vi) Any fraud, misrepresentation, or negligence by the HHA in 
obtaining the surety bond or by the Surety (or by the Surety's agent, if 
any) in issuing the surety bond, except that any fraud, 
misrepresentation, or negligence by the HHA in identifying to the Surety 
(or to the Surety's agent) the amount of Medicaid payments upon which 
the amount of the surety bond is determined shall not cause the Surety's 
liability to the Medicaid agency to exceed the amount of the bond.
    (vii) The HHA's failure to exercise available appeal rights under 
Medicaid or to assign such rights to the Surety (provided the Medicaid 
agency permits such rights to be assigned).
    (4) The bond must provide that actions under the bond may be brought 
by the Medicaid agency or by an agent that the Medicaid agency 
designates.
    (i) Term and type of bond. (1) Initial term: Each participating HHA 
that is not exempted by paragraph (d) of this section must submit to the 
State Medicaid agency a surety bond for a term beginning January 1, 
1998. If an annual bond is submitted for the initial term it must be 
effective for an annual period specified by the State Medicaid agency.
    (2) Type of bond. The type of bond required to be submitted by an 
HHA, under this section, may be either--
    (i) An annual bond (that is, a bond that specifies an effective 
annual period that corresponds to an annual period specified by the 
Medicaid agency); or
    (ii) A continuous bond (that is, a bond that remains in full force 
and effect from term to term unless it is terminated or canceled as 
provided for in the bond or as otherwise provided by law) that is 
updated by the Surety for a particular period, via the issuance of a 
``rider,'' when the bond amount changes. For the purposes of this 
section, ``Rider'' means a notice issued by a Surety that a change to a 
bond has occurred or will occur. If the HHA has submitted a continuous 
bond and there is no increase or decrease in the bond amount, no action 
is necessary by the HHA to submit a rider as long as the continuous bond 
remains in full force and effect.
    (3) HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA.
    (i) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA must submit a 
surety bond before a provider agreement described under Sec. 431.107 of 
this subchapter can be entered into.
    (ii) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA through the 
purchase or transfer of assets or ownership interest of a participating 
or formerly participating HHA must also ensure that the surety bond is 
effective from the date of such purchase or transfer.
    (4) Change of ownership. An HHA that undergoes a change of ownership 
(as ``change of ownership'' is defined by the State Medicaid agency) 
must submit the surety bond to the State Medicaid agency by such time 
and for such term as is specified in the instructions of the State 
Medicaid agency.
    (5) Government-operated HHA that loses its waiver. A government-
operated HHA that, as of January 1, 1998, meets the criteria for waiver 
of the requirements of this section but thereafter is determined by the 
Medicaid agency to not meet such criteria, must submit a surety bond to 
the Medicaid agency within 60 days after it receives notice from the 
Medicaid agency that it does not meet the criteria for waiver.

[[Page 218]]

    (6) Change of Surety. An HHA that obtains a replacement surety bond 
from a different Surety to cover the remaining term of a previously 
obtained bond must submit the new surety bond to the Medicaid agency 
within 60 days (or such earlier date as the Medicaid agency may specify) 
of obtaining the bond from the new Surety for a term specified by the 
Medicaid agency.
    (j) Effect of failure to obtain, maintain, and timely file a surety 
bond.
    (1) The Medicaid agency must terminate the HHA's provider agreement 
if the HHA fails to obtain, file timely, and maintain a surety bond in 
accordance with this section and the Medicaid agency's instructions.
    (2) The Medicaid agency must refuse to enter into a provider 
agreement with an HHA if an HHA seeking to become a participating HHA 
fails to obtain and file timely a surety bond in accordance with this 
section and instructions issued by the State Medicaid agency.
    (k) Evidence of compliance.
    (1) The Medicaid agency may at any time require an HHA to make a 
specific showing of being in compliance with the requirements of this 
section and may require the HHA to submit such additional evidence as 
the Medicaid agency considers sufficient to demonstrate the HHA's 
compliance.
    (2) The Medicaid agency may terminate the HHA's provider agreement 
or refuse to enter into a provider agreement if an HHA fails to timely 
furnish sufficient evidence at the Medicaid agency's request to 
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section.
    (l) Surety's standing to appeal Medicaid determinations. The 
Medicaid agency must establish procedures for granting appeal rights to 
Sureties.
    (m) Effect of conditions of payment. If a Surety has paid the 
Medicaid agency an amount on the basis of liability incurred under a 
bond obtained by an HHA under this section, and the Medicaid agency 
subsequently collects from the HHA, in whole or in part, on such 
overpayment that was the basis for the Surety's liability, the Medicaid 
agency must reimburse the Surety such amount as the Medicaid agency 
collected from the HHA, up to the amount paid by the Surety to the 
Medicaid agency, provided the Surety has no other liability under the 
bond.

and identification of the HIV causative agent as described in 
Sec. 405.1316(f) (2) and (3) of this chapter, the laboratory records 
must contain the name and other identification of the person from whom 
the specimen was taken.
    (c) An agency may choose to approve the use of alternative 
identifiers, in place of the requirement for patient's name, in 
paragraph (b) of this section for HIV antibody or causative agent 
testing of Medicaid recipients.

    This subpart implements sections 1902(a)(43) and 1905(a)(4)(B) of 
the Social Security Act, by prescribing State plan requirements for 
providing early and periodic screening and diagnosis of eligible 
Medicaid recipients under age 21 to ascertain physical and mental 
defects, and providing treatment to correct or ameliorate defects and 
chronic conditions found.


<R05>
Sec. 441.55  State plan requirements.

    A State plan must provide that the Medicaid agency meets the 
requirements of Secs. 441.56-441.62, with respect to EPSDT services, as 
defined in Sec. 440.40(b) of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 441.56  Required activities.

    (a) Informing. The agency must--
    (1) Provide for a combination of written and oral methods designed 
to inform effectively all EPSDT eligible individuals (or their families) 
about the EPSDT program.
    (2) Using clear and nontechnical language, provide information about 
the following--
    (i) The benefits of preventive health care;
    (ii) The services available under the EPSDT program and where and 
how to obtain those services;
    (iii) That the services provided under the EPSDT program are without 
cost to eligible individuals under 18 years of age, and if the agency 
chooses, to those 18 or older, up to age 21, except for any enrollment 
fee, premium, or similar charge that may be imposed on medically needy 
recipients; and
    (iv) That necessary transportation and scheduling assistance 
described in Sec. 441.62 of this subpart is available to the EPSDT 
eligible individual upon request.
    (3) Effectively inform those individuals who are blind or deaf, or 
who cannot read or understand the English language.
    (4) Provide assurance to HCFA that processes are in place to 
effectively inform individuals as required under this paragraph, 
generally, within 60 days of the individual's initial Medicaid 
eligibility determination and in the case of families which have not 
utilized EPSDT services, annually thereafter.
    (b) Screening. (1) The agency must provide to eligible EPSDT 
recipients who request it, screening (periodic comprehensive child 
health assessments); that is, regularly scheduled examinations and 
evaluations of the general physical and mental health, growth, 
development, and nutritional status of infants, children, and youth. 
(See paragraph (c)(3) of this section for requirements relating to 
provision of immunization at the time of screening.) As a minimum, these

    (i) Comprehensive health and developmental history.
    (ii) Comprehensive unclothed physical examination.
    (iii) Appropriate vision testing.
    (iv) Appropriate hearing testing.
    (v) Appropriate laboratory tests.
    (vi) Dental screening services furnished by direct referral to a 
dentist for children beginning at 3 years of age. An agency may request 
from HCFA an exception from this age requirement (within an outer limit 
of age 5) for a two year period and may request additional two year 
exceptions. If an agency requests an exception, it must demonstrate to 
HCFA's satisfaction that there is a shortage of dentists that prevents 
the agency from meeting the age 3 requirement.
    (2) Screening services in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be 
provided

[[Page 221]]

in accordance with reasonable standards of medical and dental practice 
determined by the agency after consultation with recognized medical and 
dental organizations involved in child health care.
    (c) Diagnosis and treatment. In addition to any diagnostic and 
treatment services included in the plan, the agency must provide to 
eligible EPSDT recipients, the following services, the need for which is 
indicated by screening, even if the services are not included in the 
plan--
    (1) Diagnosis of and treatment for defects in vision and hearing, 
including eyeglasses and hearing aids;
    (2) Dental care, at as early an age as necessary, needed for relief 
of pain and infections, restoration of teeth and maintenance of dental 
health; and
    (3) Appropriate immunizations. (If it is determined at the time of 
screening that immunization is needed and appropriate to provide at the 
time of screening, then immunization treatment must be provided at that 
time.)
    (d) Accountability. The agency must maintain as required by 
Secs. 431.17 and 431.18--
    (1) Records and program manuals;
    (2) A description of its screening package under paragraph (b) of 
this section; and
    (3) Copies of rules and policies describing the methods used to 
assure that the informing requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is met.
    (e) Timeliness. With the exception of the informing requirements 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must set 
standards for the timely provision of EPSDT services which meet 
reasonable standards of medical and dental practice, as determined by 
the agency after consultation with recognized medical and dental 
organizations involved in child health care, and must employ processes 
to ensure timely initiation of treatment, if required, generally within 
an outer limit of 6 months after the request for screening services.

<R05>
Sec. 441.57  Discretionary services.

    Under the EPSDT program, the agency may provide for any other

if the agency does not otherwise provide for these services to other 
recipients or provides for them in a lesser amount, duration, or scope.


<R05>
Sec. 441.58  Periodicity schedule.

services that--
    (a) Meets reasonable standards of medical and dental practice 
determined by the agency after consultation with recognized medical and 
dental organizations involved in child health care;
    (b) Specifies screening services applicable at each stage of the 
recipient's life, beginning with a neonatal examination, up to the age 
at which an individual is no longer eligible for EPSDT services; and
    (c) At the agency's option, provides for needed screening services 
as determined by the agency, in addition to the otherwise applicable 
screening services specified under paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 441.59  Treatment of requests for EPSDT screening services.

    (a) The agency must provide the screening services described in 
Sec. 441.56(b) upon the request of an eligible recipient.
    (b) To avoid duplicate screening services, the agency need not

services, due under the agency's periodicity schedule, have already been 
provided to the eligible.


<R05>
Sec. 441.60  Continuing care.

    (a) Continuing care provider. For purposes of this subpart, a

under Sec. 441.56 or direct referral to a dentist to provide dental 
services required under Sec. 441.56(b)(1)(vi). The provider must specify 
in the agreement whether dental services or referral for dental services 
are provided. If the provider does not choose to provide either service, 
then the provider must refer recipients to the agency to obtain those 
dental services required under Sec. 441.56.
    (5) At the provider's option, provision of all or part of the 
transportation and scheduling assistance as required under Sec. 441.62. 
The provider must specify in the agreement the transportation and 
scheduling assistance to be furnished. If the provider does not choose 
to provide some or all of the assistance, then the provider must refer 
recipients to the agency to obtain the transportation and scheduling 
assistance required under Sec. 441.62.
    (b) Reports. A continuing care provider must provide to the agency 
any reports that the agency may reasonably require.
    (c) State monitoring. If the State plan provides for agreements with 
continuing care providers, the agency must employ methods described in 
the State plan to assure the providers' compliance with their 
agreements.
    (d) Effect of agreement with continuing care providers. Subject to 
the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, HCFA 
will deem the agency to meet the requirements of this subpart with 
respect to all EPSDT eligible recipients formally enrolled with the 
continuing care provider. To be formally enrolled, a recipient or 
recipient's family agrees to use one continuing care provider to be a 
regular source of the described set of services for a stated period of 
time. Both the recipient and the provider must sign statements that 
reflect their obligations under the continuing care arrangement.
    (e) If the agreement in paragraph (a) of this section does not 
provide for all or part of the transportation and scheduling assistance 
required under Sec. 441.62, or for dental service under Sec. 441.56, the 
agency must provide for those services to the extent they are not 
provided for in the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 441.61  Utilization of providers and coordination with related programs.

    (a) The agency must provide referral assistance for treatment not 
covered by the plan, but found to be needed as a result of conditions 
disclosed during screening and diagnosis. This referral assistance must 
include giving the family or recipient the names, addresses, and 
telephone numbers of providers who have expressed a willingness to 
furnish uncovered services at little or no expense to the family.
    (b) The agency must make available a variety of individual and group 
providers qualified and willing to provide EPSDT services.
    (c) The agency must make appropriate use of State health agencies, 
State vocational rehabilitation agencies, and Title V grantees (Maternal 
and Child Health/Crippled Children's Services). Further, the agency 
should make use of other public health, mental health, and education 
programs and related programs, such as Head Start, Title XX (Social 
Services) programs, and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, 
Infants and Children (WIC), to ensure an effective child health program.


<R05>
Sec. 441.62  Transportation and scheduling assistance.

    The agency must offer to the family or recipient, and provide if the

              Appendix to Subpart F--Required Consent Form

    Notice: Your decision at any time not to be sterilized will not 
result in the withdrawal or withholding of any benefits provided by 
programs or projects receiving Federal funds.

                        consent to sterilization

    I have asked for and received information about sterilization from 
(doctor or clinic). When I first asked for the information, I was told 
that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me. I was told 
that I could decide not to be sterilized. If I decide not to be 
sterilized, my decision will not affect my right to future care or 
treatment. I will not lose any help or benefits from programs receiving 
Federal funds, such as A.F.D.C. or Medicaid that I am now getting or for 
which I may become eligible.
    I understand that the sterilization must be considered permanent and 
not reversible. I have decided that I do not want to become pregnant, 
bear children or father children.
    I was told about those temporary methods of birth control that are 
available and could be provided to me which will allow me to bear or 
father a child in the future. I have rejected these alternatives and 
chosen to be sterilized.
    I understand that I will be sterilized by an operation known as a 
____________. The discomforts, risks and benefits associated with the 
operation have been explained to me. All my questions have been answered 
to my satisfaction.
    I understand that the operation will not be done until at least 30 
days after I sign this form. I understand that I can change my mind at 
any time and that my decision at any time not to be sterilized will not 
result in the withholding of any benefits or medical services provided 
by Federally funded programs.
    I am at least 21 years of age and was born on (Day) (Month) (Year).
    I, ____________, hereby consent of my own free will to be sterilized 
by ____________ by a method called ____________. My consent expires 180 
days from the date of my signature below.
    I also consent to the release of this form and other medical records 
about the operation to:
    Representatives of the Department of Health and Human Services or
    Employees of programs or projects funded by that Department but only 
for determining if Federal laws were observed.
    I have received a copy of this form. (Signature) (Date) (Month) 
(Day) (Year).
    You are requested to supply the following information, but it is not 
required: (Race and ethnicity designation (please check)) Black (not of 
Hispanic origin); Hispanic; Asian or Pacific Islander; American Indian 
or Alaskan native; or White (not of Hispanic origin).

                         interpreter's statement

    If an interpreter is provided to assist the individual to be 
sterilized:
    I have translated the information and advice presented orally to the 
individual to be sterilized by the person obtaining this consent. I have 
also read him/her the consent form in ____________ ____________ language 
and explained its contents to him/her. To the best of my knowledge and 
belief he/she understood this explanation. (Interpreter) (Date).

                  statement of person obtaining consent

    Before (name of individual) signed the consent form, I explained to 
him/her the nature of the sterilization operation ____________, the fact 
that it is intended to be a final and irreversible procedure and the 
discomforts, risks and benefits associated with it.
    I counseled the individual to be sterilized that alternative methods 
of birth control are available which are temporary. I explained that 
sterilization is different because it is permanent.
    I informed the individual to be sterilized that his/her consent can 
be withdrawn at any time and that he/she will not lose any health 
services or any benefits provided by Federal funds.
    To the best of my knowledge and belief the individual to be 
sterilized is at least 21 years old and appears mentally competent. He/
She knowingly and voluntarily requested to be sterilized and appears to 
understand the nature and consequence of the procedure. (Signature of 
person obtaining consent) (Date) (Facility) (Address).

                          physician's statement

    Shortly before I performed a sterilization operation upon (Name of 
individual to be sterilized) on (Date of sterilization) (operation), I 
explained to him/her the nature of the sterilization operation (specify 
type of operation), the fact that it is intended to be a final and 
irreversible procedure and the discomforts, risks and benefits 
associated with it.
    I counseled the individual to be sterilized that alternative methods 
of birth control are available which are temporary. I explained

[[Page 231]]

that sterilization is different because it is permanent.
    I informed the individual to be sterilized that his/her consent can 
be withdrawn at any time and that he/she will not lose any health 
services or benefits provided by Federal funds.

    Subpart G--Home and Community-Based Services: Waiver Requirements

    Source: 46 FR 48541, Oct. 1, 1981, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 441.300  Basis and purpose.

    Section 1915(c) of the Act permits States to offer, under a waiver 
of statutory requirements, an array of home and community-based services 
that an individual needs to avoid institutionalization. Those services 
are defined in Sec. 440.180 of this subchapter. This subpart describes 
what the Medicaid agency must do to obtain a waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 441.301  Contents of request for a waiver.

    (a) A request for a waiver under this section must consist of the 
following:
    (1) The assurances required by Sec. 441.302 and the supporting 
documentation required by Sec. 441.303.
    (2) When applicable, requests for waivers of the requirements of 
section 1902(a)(1), section 1902(a)(10)(B), or section 
1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act, which concern respectively, statewide 
application of Medicaid, comparability of services, and income and 
resource rules applicable to individuals with spouses living in the 
community.
    (3) A statement explaining whether the agency will refuse to offer 
home or community-based services to any recipient if the agency can 
reasonably expect that the cost of the services would exceed the cost of 
an equivalent level of care provided in--
    (i) A hospital (as defined in Sec. 440.10 of this chapter);
    (ii) A NF (as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act); or
    (iii) An ICF/MR (as defined in Sec. 440.150 of this chapter), if 
applicable.
    (b) If the agency furnishes home and community-based services, as 
defined in Sec. 440.180 of this subchapter, under a waiver granted under 
this subpart, the waiver request must--
    (1) Provide that the services are furnished--
    (i) Under a written plan of care subject to approval by the Medicaid 
agency;
    (ii) Only to recipients who are not inpatients of a hospital, NF, or 
ICF/MR; and
    (iii) Only to recipients who the agency determines would, in the 
absence of these services, require the Medicaid covered level of care 
provided in--
    (A) A hospital (as defined in Sec. 440.10 of this chapter);
    (B) A NF (as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act); or
    (C) An ICF/MR (as defined in Sec. 440.150 of this chapter);
    (2) Describe the qualifications of the individual or individuals who 
will be responsible for developing the individual plan of care;
    (3) Describe the group or groups of individuals to whom the services 
will be offered;
    (4) Describe the services to be furnished so that each service is 
separately defined. Multiple services that are generally considered to 
be separate services may not be consolidated under a single definition. 
Commonly accepted terms must be used to describe the

[[Page 232]]

service and definitions may not be open ended in scope. HCFA will, 
however, allow combined service definitions (bundling) when this will 
permit more efficient delivery of services and not compromise either a 
recipient's access to or free choice of providers.
    (5) Provide that the documentation requirements regarding individual 
evaluation, specified in Sec. 441.303(c), will be met; and
    (6) Be limited to one of the following target groups or any subgroup 
thereof that the State may define:
    (i) Aged or disabled, or both.
    (ii) Mentally retarded or developmentally disabled, or both.
    (iii) Mentally ill.

<R05>
Sec. 441.302  State assurances.

    Unless the Medicaid agency provides the following satisfactory 
assurances to HCFA, HCFA will not grant a waiver under this subpart and 
may terminate a waiver already granted:
    (a) Health and Welfare--Assurance that necessary safeguards have 
been taken to protect the health and welfare of the recipients of the 
services. Those safeguards must include--
    (1) Adequate standards for all types of providers that provide 
services under the waiver;
    (2) Assurance that the standards of any State licensure or 
certification requirements are met for services or for individuals 
furnishing services that are provided under the waiver; and
    (3) Assurance that all facilities covered by section 1616(e) of the 
Act, in which home and community-based services will be provided, are in 
compliance with applicable State standards that meet the requirements of 
45 CFR Part 1397 for board and care facilities.
    (b) Financial accountability-- The agency will assure financial 
accountability for funds expended for home and community-based services, 
provide for an independent audit of its waiver program (except as HCFA 
may otherwise specify for particular waivers), and it will maintain and 
make available to HHS, the Comptroller General, or other designees, 
appropriate financial records documenting the cost of services provided 
under the waiver, including reports of any independent audits conducted.
    (c) Evaluation of need. Assurance that the agency will provide for 
the following:
    (1) Initial evaluation. An evaluation of the need for the level of 
care provided in a hospital, a NF, or an ICF/MR when there is a 
reasonable indication that a recipient might need the services in the 
near future (that is, a month or less) unless he or she receives home or 
community-based services. For purposes of this section, ``evaluation'' 
means a review of an individual recipient's condition to determine--
    (i) If the recipient requires the level of care provided in a 
hospital as defined in Sec. 440.40 of this subchapter, a NF as defined 
in section 1919(a) of the Act, or an ICF/MR as defined by Sec. 440.150 
of this subchapter; and
    (ii) That the recipient, but for the provision of waiver services, 
would otherwise be institutionalized in such a facility.
    (2) Periodic reevaluations. Reevaluations, at least annually, of 
each recipient receiving home or community-based services to determine 
if the recipient continues to need the level of care provided and would, 
but for the provision of waiver services, otherwise be institutionalized 
in one of the following institutions:
    (i) A hospital;
    (ii) A NF; or
    (iii) An ICF/MR.
    (d) Alternatives--Assurance that when a recipient is determined to 
be likely to require the level of care provided in an SNF, ICF, or ICF/
MR, the recipient or his or her legal representative will be--
    (1) Informed of any feasible alternatives available under the 
waiver; and
    (2) Given the choice of either institutional or home and community-
based services.

[[Page 233]]

    (e) Average per capita expenditures. Assurance that the average per 
capita fiscal year expenditures under the waiver will not exceed 100 
percent of the average per capita expenditures that would have been made 
in the fiscal year for the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, or 
ICF/MR under the State plan had the waiver not been granted.
    (1) These expenditures must be reasonably estimated and documented 
by the agency.
    (2) The estimate must be on an annual basis and must cover each year 
of the waiver period.
    (f) Actual total expenditures. Assurance that the agency's actual 
total expenditures for home and community-based and other Medicaid 
services under the waiver and its claim for FFP in expenditures for the 
services provided to recipients under the waiver will not, in any year 
of the waiver period, exceed 100 percent of the amount that would be 
incurred by the State's Medicaid program for these individuals, absent 
the waiver, in--
    (1) A hospital;
    (2) A NF; or
    (3) An ICF/MR.
    (g) Institutionalization absent waiver. Assurance that, absent the 
waiver, recipients in the waiver would receive the appropriate type of 
Medicaid-funded institutional care (hospital, NF, or ICF/MR) that they 
require.
    (h) Reporting. Assurance that annually, the agency will provide HCFA 
with information on the waiver's impact. The information must be 
consistent with a data collection plan designed by HCFA and must address 
the waiver's impact on--
    (1) The type, amount, and cost of services provided under the State 
plan; and
    (2) The health and welfare of recipients.
    (i) Habilitation services. Assurance that prevocational, 
educational, or supported employment services, or a combination of these 
services, if provided as habilitation services under the waiver, are--
    (1) Not otherwise available to the individual through a local 
educational agency under section 602 (16) and (17) of the Education of 
the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16 and 17)) or as services under 
section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 730); and
    (2) Furnished only to individuals who have been deinstitutionalized, 
regardless of discharge date from a Medicaid-certified NF or ICF/MR.
    (3) Furnished as part of expanded habilitation services on or after 
April 7, 1986, if the State has requested and received HCFA's approval 
under a waiver or an amendment to a waiver.
    (j) Day treatment or partial hospitalization, psychosocial 
rehabilitation services, and clinic services for individuals with 
chronic mental illness. Assurance that FFP will not be claimed in 
expenditures for waiver services including, but not limited to, day 
treatment or partial hospitalization, psychosocial rehabilitation 
services, and clinic services provided as home and community-based 
services to individuals with chronic mental illnesses if these 
individuals, in the absence of a waiver, would be placed in an IMD and 
are--
    (1) Age 22 to 64;
    (2) Age 65 and older and the State has not included the optional 
Medicaid benefit cited in Sec. 440.140; or
    (3) Age 21 and under and the State has not included the optional 
Medicaid benefit cited in Sec. 440.160.

[50 FR 10026, Mar. 13, 1985, as amended at 59 FR 37717, July 25, 1994]

    Effective Date Note:  At 59 FR 37717, July 25, 1994, in 
Sec. 441.302, the introductory text and paragraphs (c) and (e) were 
revised, (f) was redesignated as (h), and new paragraphs (f), (g), (i) 
and (j) were added. This amendment contains information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval 
has been given by the Office of Management and Budget. A notice will be

<R05>
Sec. 441.303  Supporting documentation required.

    The agency must furnish HCFA with sufficient information to support 
the assurances required by Sec. 441.302. Except as HCFA may otherwise 
specify for particular waivers, the information must consist of the 
following:
    (a) A description of the safeguards necessary to protect the health 
and welfare of recipients. This information must include a copy of the 
standards established by the State for facilities

[[Page 234]]

that are covered by section 1616(e) of the Act.
    (b) A description of the records and information that will be 
maintained to support financial accountability.
    (c) A description of the agency's plan for the evaluation and 
reevaluation of recipients, including--
    (1) A description of who will make these evaluations and how they 
will be made;
    (2) A copy of the evaluation form to be used; and if it differs from 
the form used in placing recipients in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR, a 
description of how and why it differs and an assurance that the outcome 
of the new evaluation form is reliable, valid, and fully comparable to 
the form used for hospital, NF, or ICF/MR placement;
    (3) The agency's procedure to ensure the maintenance of written 
documentation on all evaluations and reevaluations; and
    (4) The agency's procedure to ensure reevaluations of need at 
regular intervals.
    (d) A description of the agency's plan for informing eligible 
recipients of the feasible alternatives available under the waiver and 
allowing recipients to choose either institutional services or home and 
community-based services.
    (e) An explanation of how the agency will apply the applicable 
provisions regarding the post-eligibility treatment of income and 
resources of those individuals receiving home and community-based 
services who are eligible under a special income level (included in 
Sec. 435.217 of this chapter).
    (f) An explanation with supporting documentation satisfactory to 
HCFA of how the agency estimated the average per capita expenditures for 
services.
    (1) The annual average per capita expenditure estimate of the cost 
of home and community-based and other Medicaid services under the waiver 
must not exceed the estimated annual average per capita expenditures of 
the cost of services in the absence of a waiver. The estimates are to be 
based on the following equation:
D+D' <ls-thn-eq> G+G'.

The symbol ``<ls-thn-eq>'' means that the result of the left side of the 
          equation must be less than or equal to the result of the right 
          side of the equation.
D = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for home and 
          community-based services for individuals in the waiver 
          program.
D' = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for all other 
          services provided to individuals in the waiver program.
G = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for hospital, 
          NF, or ICF/MR care that would be incurred for individuals 
          served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted.
G' = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid costs for all 
          services other than those included in factor G for individuals 
          served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted.

    (2) For purposes of the equation, the prime factors include the 
average per capita cost for all State plan services and expanded EPSDT 
services provided that are not accounted for in other formula values.
    (3) In making estimates of average per capita expenditures for a 
waiver that applies only to individuals with a particular illness (for 
example, acquired immune deficiency syndrome) or condition (for example, 
chronic mental illness) who are inpatients in or who would require the 
level of care provided in hospitals as defined by Sec. 440.10, NFs as 
defined in section 1919(a) of the Act, or ICFs/MR, the agency may 
determine the average per capita expenditures for these individuals 
absent the waiver without including expenditures for other individuals 
in the affected hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR.
    (4) In making estimates of average per capita expenditures for a 
separate waiver program that applies only to individuals identified 
through the preadmission screening annual resident review (PASARR) 
process who are developmentally disabled, inpatients of a NF, and 
require the level of care provided in an ICF/MR as determined by the 
State on the basis of an evaluation under Sec. 441.303(c), the agency 
may determine the average per capita expenditures that would have been 
made in a fiscal year for those individuals based on the average per 
capita expenditures for inpatients in an ICF/MR. When submitting 
estimates of institutional costs without the waiver, the agency may use 
the average per capita costs of

[[Page 235]]

ICF/MR care even though the deinstitutionalized developmentally disabled 
were inpatients of NFs.
    (5) For persons diverted rather than deinstitutionalized, the 
State's evaluation process required by Sec. 441.303(c) must provide for 
a more detailed description of their evaluation and screening procedures 
for recipients to ensure that waiver services will be limited to persons 
who would otherwise receive the level of care provided in a hospital, 
NF, or ICF/MR, as applicable.
    (6) The State must indicate the number of unduplicated beneficiaries 
to which it intends to provide waiver services in each year of its 
program. This number will constitute a limit on the size of the waiver 
program unless the State requests and the Secretary approves a greater 
number of waiver participants in a waiver amendment.
    (7) In determining the average per capita expenditures that would 
have been made in a waiver year, for waiver estimates that apply to 
persons with mental retardation or related conditions, the agency may 
include costs of Medicaid residents in ICFs/MR that have been terminated 
on or after November 5, 1990.
    (8) In submitting estimates for waivers that include personal 
caregivers as a waiver service, the agency may include a portion of the 
rent and food attributed to the unrelated personal caregiver who resides 
in the home or residence of the recipient covered under the waiver. The 
agency must submit to HCFA for review and approval the method it uses to 
apportion the costs of rent and food. The method must be explained fully 
to HCFA. A personal caregiver provides a waiver service to meet the 
recipient's physical, social, or emotional needs (as opposed to services 
not directly related to the care of the recipient; that is, housekeeping 
or chore services). FFP for live-in caregivers is not available if the 
recipient lives in the caregiver's home or in a residence that is owned 
or leased by the caregiver.
    (9) In submitting estimates for waivers that apply to individuals 
with mental retardation or a related condition, the agency may adjust 
its estimate of average per capita expenditures to include increases in 
expenditures for ICF/MR care resulting from implementation of a PASARR 
program for making determinations for individuals with mental 
retardation or related conditions on or after January 1, 1989.
    (10) For a State that has HCFA approval to bundle waiver services, 
the State must continue to compute separately the costs and utilization 
of the component services that make up the bundled service to support 
the final cost and utilization of the bundled service that will be used 
in the cost-neutrality formula.
    (g) The State, at its option, may provide for an independent 
assessment of its waiver that evaluates the quality of care provided, 
access to care, and cost-neutrality. The results of the assessment 
should be submitted to HCFA at least 90 days prior to the expiration 
date of the approved waiver-period and cover the first 24 or 48 months 
of the waiver. If a State chooses to provide for an independent 
assessment, FFP is available for the costs attributable to the 
independent assessment.
    (h) For States offering habilitation services that include 
prevocational, educational, or supported employment services, or a 
combination of these services, consistent with the provisions of 
Sec. 440.180(c) of this chapter, an explanation of why these services 
are not available as special education and related services under 
sections 602 (16) and (17) of the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 
U.S.C. 1401 (16 and 17)) or as services under section 110 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. section 730);
    (i) For States offering home and community-based services for 
individuals diagnosed as chronically mentally ill, an explanation of why 
these individuals would not be placed in an institution for mental 
diseases (IMD) absent the waiver, and the age group of these 
individuals.

<R05>
Sec. 441.304  Duration of a waiver.

    (a) The effective date for a new waiver of Medicaid requirements to 
provide home and community-based services approved under this subpart is 
established by HCFA prospectively on or

[[Page 236]]

after the date of approval and after consultation with the State agency. 
The initial approved waiver continues for a 3-year period from the 
effective date. If the agency requests it, the waiver may be extended 
for additional periods unless--
    (1) HCFA's review of the prior waiver period shows that the 
assurances required by Sec. 441.302 were not met; and
    (2) HCFA is not satisfied with the assurances and documentation 
provided by the State in regard to the extension period.
    (b) HCFA will determine whether a request for extension of an 
existing waiver is actually an extension request or a request for a new 
waiver. If a State submits an extension request that would add a new 
group to the existing group of recipients covered under the waiver (as 
defined under Sec. 441.301(b)(6)), HCFA will consider it to be two 
requests: One as an extension request for the existing group, and the 
other as a new waiver request for the new group. Waivers may be extended 
for additional 5-year periods.
    (c) HCFA may grant a State an extension of its existing waiver for 
up to 90 days to permit the State to document more fully the 
satisfaction of statutory and regulatory requirements needed to approve 
a new waiver request. HCFA will consider this option when it requests 
additional information on a new waiver request submitted by a State to 
extend its existing waiver or when HCFA disapproves a State's request 
for extension.
    (d) If HCFA finds that an agency is not meeting one or more of the 
requirements for a waiver contained in this subpart, the agency is given 
a notice of HCFA's findings and an opportunity for a hearing to rebut 
the findings. If HCFA determines that the agency is not in compliance 
with this subpart after the notice and any hearing, HCFA may terminate 
the waiver. For example, a State submits to HCFA a waiver request for 
home and community-based services that includes an estimate of the 
expenditures that would be incurred if the services were provided to the 
covered individuals in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR in the absence of the 
waiver. HCFA approves the waiver. At the end of the waiver year, the 
State submits to HCFA a report of its actual expenditures under the 
waiver. HCFA finds that the actual expenditures under the waiver exceed 
100 percent of the State's approved estimate of expenditures for these 
individuals in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR in the absence of the waiver. 
HCFA next requires the State to amend its estimates for subsequent 
waiver year(s). HCFA then compares the revised estimates with the 
State's actual experience to determine if the revised estimates are 
reasonable. HCFA may terminate the waiver if the revised estimates 
indicate that the waiver is not cost-neutral or that the revised 
estimates are unreasonable.

<R05>
Sec. 441.305  Replacement of recipients in approved waiver programs.

    (a) Regular waivers. A State's estimate of the number of individuals 
who may receive home and community-based services must include those who 
will replace recipients who leave the program for any reason. A State 
may replace recipients who leave the program due to death or loss of 
eligibility under the State plan without regard to any federally-imposed 
limit on utilization, but must maintain a record of recipients replaced 
on this basis.
    (b) Model waivers. (1) The number of individuals who may receive 
home and community-based services under a model waiver may not exceed 
200 recipients at any one time.
    (2) The agency may replace any individuals who die or become 
ineligible for State plan services to maintain a count up to the number 
specified by the State and approved by HCFA within the 200-maximum 
limit.

Sec. 441.306  Cooperative arrangements with the Maternal and Child Health program.

    Whenever appropriate, the State agency administering the plan under 
Medicaid may enter into cooperative arrangements with the State agency 
responsible for administering a program for children with special health 
care needs under the Maternal and Child Health program (Title V of the

[[Page 237]]

Act) in order to ensure improved access to coordinated services to meet 
the children's needs.

<R05>
Sec. 441.307  Notification of a waiver termination.

    (a) If a State chooses to terminate its waiver before the three-year 
period is up, it must notify HCFA in writing 30 days before terminating 
services to recipients.
    (b) If HCFA or the State terminates the waiver, the State must 
notify recipients of services under the waiver in accordance with 
Sec. 431.210 of this subchapter and notify them 30 days before 
terminating services.

<R05>
Sec. 441.310  Limits on Federal financial participation (FFP).

    (a) FFP for home and community-based services listed in Sec. 440.180 
of this chapter is not available in expenditures for the following:
    (1) Services provided in a facility subject to the health and 
welfare requirements described in Sec. 441.302(a) during any period in 
which the facility is found not to be in compliance with the applicable 
State standards described in that section.
    (2) The cost of room and board except when provided as--
    (i) Part of respite care services in a facility approved by the 
State that is not a private residence; or
    (ii) For waivers that allow personal caregivers as providers of 
approved waiver services, a portion of the rent and food that may be 
reasonably attributed to the unrelated caregiver who resides in the same 
household with the waiver recipient. FFP for a live-in caregiver is not 
available if the recipient lives in the caregiver's home or in a 
residence that is owned or leased by the provider of Medicaid services 
(the caregiver). For purposes of this provision, ``board'' means 3 meals 
a day or any other full nutritional regimen and does not include meals 
provided as part of a program of adult day health services as long as 
the meals provided do not constitute a ``full'' nutritional regimen.
    (3) Prevocational, educational, or supported employment services, or 
any combination of these services, as part of habilitation services that 
are--
    (i) Provided prior to April 7, 1986;
    (ii) Provided in approved waivers that include a definition of 
``habilitation services'' but which have not included prevocational, 
educational and supported employment services in that definition;
    (iii) Provided to recipients who were never institutionalized in a 
Medicaid certified NF,or ICF/MR; or
    (iv) Otherwise available to the recipient under either special 
education and related services as defined in section 602(16) and (17) of 
the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16) and (17)) or 
vocational rehabilitation services available to the individual through a 
program funded under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 730).
    (4) For waiver applications and renewals approved on or after 
October 21, 1986, home and community-based services provided to 
individuals aged 22 through 64 diagnosed as chronically mentally ill who 
would be placed in an institution for mental diseases. FFP is also not 
available for such services provided to individuals aged 65 and over and 
21 and under as an alternative to institutionalization in an IMD if the 
State does not include the appropriate optional Medicaid benefits 
specified at Secs. 440.140 and 440.160 of this chapter in its State 
plan.
    (b) FFP is available for expenditures for expanded habilitation 
services, as described in Sec. 440.180, if the services are included 
under a waiver or waiver amendment approved by HCFA on or after April 7, 
1986.

Subpart H--Home and Community-Based Services Waivers for Individuals Age 
                    65 or Older: Waiver Requirements

    Source: 57 FR 29156, June 30, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 441.350  Basis and purpose.

    Section 1915(d) of the Act permits States to offer, under a waiver 
of statutory requirements, home and community-based services not 
otherwise available under Medicaid to individuals age 65 or older, in 
exchange for accepting an aggregate limit on the amount of expenditures 
for which they claim FFP for certain services furnished to these 
individuals. The home and community-based services that may be furnished 
are listed in Sec. 440.181 of this subchapter. This subpart describes 
the procedures the Medicaid agency must follow to request a waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 441.351  Contents of a request for a waiver.

    A request for a waiver under this section must meet the following 
requirements:
    (a) Required signatures. The request must be signed by the Governor, 
the Director of the Medicaid agency or the Director of the larger State 
agency of which the Medicaid agency is a component or any official of 
the Medicaid agency to whom this authority has been delegated. A request 
from any other agency of State government will not be accepted.
    (b) Assurances and supporting documentation. The request must 
provide the assurances required by Sec. 441.352 of this part and the 
supporting documentation required by Sec. 441.353.
    (c) Statement for sections of the Act. The request must provide a 
statement as to whether waiver of section 1902(a)(1), 1902(a)(10)(B), or 
1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act is requested. If the State requests a 
waiver of section 1902(a)(1) of the Act, the waiver must clearly specify 
the geographic areas or political subdivisions in which the services 
will be offered. The State must indicate whether it is requesting a 
waiver of one or all of these sections. The State may request a waiver 
of any one of the sections cited above.
    (d) Identification of services. The request must identify all 
services available under the approved State plan, which are also 
included in the APEL and which are identified under Sec. 440.181, and 
any limitations that the State has imposed on the provision of any 
service. The request must also identify and describe each service 
specified in Sec. 440.181 of this subchapter to be furnished under the 
waiver, and any additional services to be furnished under the authority 
of Sec. 440.181(b)(7). Descriptions of additional services must explain 
how each additional service included under Sec. 440.181(b)(7) will 
contribute to the health and well-being of the recipients and to their 
ability to reside in a community-based setting.
    (e) Recipients served. The request must provide that the home and 
community-based services described in Sec. 440.181 of this subchapter, 
are furnished only to individuals who--
    (1) Are age 65 or older;
    (2) Are not inpatients of a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR; and
    (3) The agency determines would be likely to require the care 
furnished in a NF under Medicaid.
    (f) Plan of care. The request must provide that the home and 
community-based services described in Sec. 440.181 of this subchapter, 
are furnished under a written plan of care based on an assessment of the 
individual's health and welfare needs and developed by qualified 
individuals for each recipient under the waiver. The qualifications of 
the individual or individuals who will be responsible for developing the 
individual plan of care must be described. Each plan of care must 
contain, at a minimum, the medical and other services to be provided, 
their frequency, and the type of provider to furnish them. Plans of care 
must be subject to the approval of the Medicaid agency.
    (g) Medicaid agency review. The request must assure that the State 
agency maintain and exercise its authority to review (at a minimum) a 
valid statistical sample of each month's plans of care. When the 
services in a plan do not comport with the stated disabilities and needs 
of the recipient, the agency must implement immediate

[[Page 239]]

corrective action procedures to ensure that the needs of the recipient 
are adequately addressed.
    (h) Groups served. The request must describe the group or groups of 
individuals to whom the services will be offered.
    (i) Assurances regarding amount expended. The request must assure 
that the total amount expended by the State under the plan for 
individuals age 65 or older during a waiver year for medical assistance 
with respect to NF, home health, private duty nursing, personal care, 
and home and community-based services described in Secs. 440.180 and 
440.181 of this subchapter and furnished as an alternative to NF care 
will not exceed the aggregate projected expenditure limit (APEL) defined 
in Sec. 441.354.


<R05>
Sec. 441.352  State assurances.

    Unless the Medicaid agency provides the following satisfactory 
assurances to HCFA, HCFA will not grant a waiver under this subpart and 
may terminate a waiver already granted.
    (a) Health and welfare. The agency must assure that necessary 
safeguards have been taken to protect the health and welfare of the 
recipients of services by assuring that the following conditions are 
met:
    (1) Adequate standards for all types of providers that furnish 
services under the waiver are met. (These standards must be reasonably 
related to the requirements of the waiver service to be furnished.)
    (2) The standards of any State licensure or certification 
requirements are met for services or for individuals furnishing services 
under the waiver.
    (3) All facilities covered by section 1616(e) of the Act, in which 
home and community-based services are furnished, are in compliance with 
applicable State standards that meet the requirements of 45 CFR part 
1397 for board and care facilities.
    (4) Physician reviews of prescribed psychotropic drugs (when 
prescribed for purposes of behavior control of waiver recipients) occur 
at least every 30 days.
    (b) Financial accountability. The agency must assure financial 
accountability for funds expended for home and community-based services. 
The State must provide for an independent audit of its waiver program. 
The performance of a single financial audit, in accordance with the 
Single Audit Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-502, enacted on October 19, 1984), 
is deemed to satisfy the requirement for an independent audit. The 
agency must maintain and make available to HHS, the Comptroller General, 
or other designees, appropriate financial records documenting the cost 
of services furnished to individuals age 65 or older under the waiver 
and the State plan, including reports of any independent audits 
conducted.
    (c) Evaluation of need. The agency must provide for an initial 
evaluation (and periodic reevaluations) of the need for the level of 
care furnished in a NF when there is a reasonable indication that 
individuals age 65 or older might need those services in the near 
future, but for the availability of home and community-based services. 
The procedures used to assess level of care for a potential waiver 
recipient must be at least as stringent as any existing State procedures 
applicable to individuals entering a NF. The qualifications of 
individuals performing the waiver assessment must be as high as those of 
individuals assessing the need for NF care, and the assessment 
instrument itself must be the same as any assessment instrument used to 
establish level of care of prospective inpatients in NFs. A periodic 
reevaluation of the level of care must be performed. The period of 
reevaluation of level of care cannot extend beyond 1 year.
    (d) Expenditures. The agency must assure that the total amount 
expended by the State for medical assistance with respect to NF, home 
health, private duty nursing, personal care services, home and 
community-based services furnished under a section 1915(c) waiver 
granted under Subpart G of this part to individuals age 65 or older, and 
the home and community-based services approved and furnished under a 
section 1915(d) waiver for individuals age 65 or older during a waiver 
year will not exceed the APEL, calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 441.354.
    (e) Reporting. The agency must assure that it will provide HCFA 
annually

[[Page 240]]

with information on the waiver's impact. The information must be 
consistent with a reasonable data collection plan designed by HCFA and 
must address the waiver's impact on--
    (1) The type, amount, and cost of services furnished under the State 
plan; and
    (2) The health and welfare of recipients of the services described 
in Sec. 440.181 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 441.353  Supporting documentation required.

    The agency must furnish HCFA with sufficient information to support 
the assurances required under Sec. 441.352, in order to meet the 
requirement that the assurances are satisfactory. At a minimum, this 
information must consist of the following:
    (a) Safeguards. A description of the safeguards necessary to protect 
the health and welfare of recipients.
    This information must include:
    (1) A copy of the standards established by the State for facilities 
(in which services will be furnished) that are covered by section 
1616(e) of the Act.
    (2) The minimum educational or professional qualifications of the 
providers of the services.
    (3) A description of the administrative oversight mechanisms 
established by the State to ensure quality of care.
    (b) Records. A description of the records and information that are 
maintained by the agency and by providers of services to support 
financial accountability, information regarding how the State meets the 
requirement for financial accountability, and an explanation of how the 
State assures that there is an audit trail for State and Federal funds 
expended for section 1915(d) home and community-based waiver services. 
If the State has an approved Medicaid Management Information System 
(MMIS), this system must be used to process individual claims data and 
account for funds expended for services furnished under the waiver.
    (c) Evaluation and reevaluation of recipients. A description of the 
agency's plan for the evaluation and reevaluation of recipients' level 
of care, including the following:
    (1) A description of who makes these evaluations and how they are 
made.
    (2) A copy of the evaluation instrument.
    (3) The agency's procedure to assure the maintenance of written 
documentation on all evaluations and reevaluations and copies of the 
forms. In accordance with regulations at 45 CFR part 74, written 
documentation of all evaluations and reevaluations must be maintained 
for a minimum period of 3 years.
    (4) The agency's procedure to assure reevaluations of need at 
regular intervals.
    (5) The intervals at which reevaluations occur, which may be no less 
frequent than for institutionalized individuals at comparable levels of 
care.
    (6) The procedures and criteria used for evaluation and reevaluation 
of waiver recipients must be the same or more stringent than those used 
for individuals served in NFs.
    (d) Alternatives available. A description of the agency's plan for 
informing eligible recipients of the feasible alternatives available 
under the waiver and allowing recipients to choose either institutional 
or home and community-based services must be submitted to HCFA. A copy 
of the forms or documentation used by the agency to verify that this 
choice has been offered and that recipients of waiver services, or their 
legal representatives, have been given the free choice of the providers 
of both waiver and State plan services must also be available for HCFA 
review. The Medicaid agency must provide an opportunity for a fair 
hearing, under 42 CFR part 431, subpart E, to recipients who are not 
given the choice of home or community-based services as an alternative 
to institutional care in a NF or who are denied the service(s) or the 
providers of their choice.
    (e) Post-eligibility of income. An explanation of how the agency 
applies the applicable provisions regarding the post-eligibility 
treatment of income and resources of those individuals receiving home 
and community-based services who are eligible under a special income 
level (included in Sec. 435.217 of this subchapter).

<R05>
Sec. 441.354  Aggregate projected expenditure limit (APEL).

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term base year 
means--
    (1) Federal fiscal year (FFY) 1987 (that is, October 1, 1986 through 
September 30, 1987); or
    (2) In the case of a State which did not report expenditures on the 
basis of age categories during FFY 1987, the base year means FFY 1989 
(that is, October 1, 1988 through September 30, 1989).
    (b) General. (1) The total amount expended by the State for medical 
assistance with respect to NF, home and community-based services under 
the waiver, home health services, personal care services, private duty 
nursing services, and services furnished under a waiver under subpart G 
of this part to individuals age 65 or older furnished as an alternative 
to care in an SNF or ICF (NF effective October 1, 1990), may not exceed 
the APEL calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) In applying for a waiver under this subpart, the agency must 
clearly identify the base year it intends to use.
    (3) The State may make a preliminary calculation of the expenditure 
limit at the time of the waiver approval; however, HCFA makes final 
calculations of the aggregate limit after base data have been verified 
and accepted.
    (4) All base year and waiver year data are subject to final cost 
settlement within 2 years from the end of the base or waiver year 
involved.
    (c) Formula for calculating APEL. Except as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section, the formula for calculating the APEL follows:

APEL=P  x  (1+Y) + V  x  (1+Z), where
P=The aggregate amount of the State's medical assistance under title XIX 
          for SNF and ICF (NF effective October 1, 1990) services 
          furnished to individuals who have reached age 65, defined as 
          the total medical assistance payments (Federal and State) 
          reported on line 6 of form HCFA 64 (as adjusted) for SNF 
          services, ICF-other services, and mental health facility 
          services for the base year, multiplied by the ratio of 
          expenditures for SNF and ICF-other services for the aged to 
          total expenditures for these services as reported on form HCFA 
          2082 for the base year.
Q=The market basket index for SNF and ICF (NF effective October 1, 1990) 
          services for the waiver year involved, defined as the total 
          SNF Input Price Index used in the Medicare program, identified 
          as the third quarter data available from HCFA's Office of 
          National Cost Estimates in August preceding the start of the 
          fiscal year.
R=The SNF Input Price Index for the base year.
S=The number of residents in the State in the waiver year involved who 
          have reached age 65, defined as the number of aged Medicare 
          beneficiaries in the State, equal to the Mid-Period Enrollment 
          in HI or SMI in that State on July 1 preceding the start of 
          the fiscal year.
T=The number of aged Medicare beneficiaries in the State who are 
          enrolled in either the HI or SMI programs in the base year, as 
          defined in S, above.
U=The number of years beginning after the base year and ending on the 
          last day of the waiver year involved.
V=The aggregate amount of the State's medical assistance under title XIX 
          in the base year for home and community-based services for 
          individuals who have reached age 65, defined as the total 
          medical assistance payments (Federal and State) reported on 
          line 6 of form HCFA 64 (as adjusted) for home health, personal 
          care, and home and community-based services waivers, which 
          provide services as an alternative to care in a SNF or ICF (NF 
          effective October 1, 1990), increased by an estimate 
          (acceptable to HCFA) of expenditures for private duty nursing 
          services, multiplied by the ratio of expenditures for home 
          health services for the aged to total expenditures for home 
          health services, as reported on form HCFA 2082, for the base 
          year.
W=The market basket index for home and community-based services for the 
          waiver year involved, defined as the Home Agency Input Price 
          Index, used in the Medicare program identified as the third 
          quarter data available from HCFA's Office of National Cost 
          Estimates in August preceding the start of the fiscal year.
X=The Home Health Agency Input Price Index for the base year.
Y=The greater of--
    (U x .07), or (Q/R)-1+(S/T)-1+(U x .02).
Z=The greater of--
    (U x .07), or (W/X)-1+(S/T)-1++(U x .02).

    (d) Amendment of the APEL. The State may request amendment of its 
APEL to reflect an increase in the aggregate amount of medical 
assistance for NF services and for services included in

[[Page 242]]

the calculation of the APEL as required by paragraph (c) of this section 
when the increase is directly attributable to legislation enacted on or 
after December 22, 1987, which amends title XIX of the Act. Costs 
attributable to laws enacted before December 22, 1987 will not be 
considered. Because the APEL for each year of the waiver is computed 
separately from the APEL for any other waiver year, a separate amendment 
must be submitted for each year in which the State chooses to raise its 
APEL. Documentation specific to the waiver year involved must be 
submitted to HCFA.


<R05>
Sec. 441.355  Duration, extension, and amendment of a waiver.

    (a) Effective dates and extension periods. (1) The effective date 
for a waiver of Medicaid requirements to furnish home and community-
based services to individuals age 65 or older under this subpart is 
established by HCFA prospectively on the first day of the FFY following 
the date on which the waiver is approved.
    (2) The initial waiver is approved for a 3-year period from the 
effective date. Subsequent renewals are approved for 5-year periods.
    (3) If the agency requests it, the waiver may be extended for an 
additional 5-year period if HCFA's review of the prior period shows that 
the assurances required by Sec. 441.352 were met.
    (4) The agency may request that waiver modifications be made 
effective retroactive to the first day of the waiver year in which the 
amendment is submitted, unless the amendment involves substantive 
change. Substantive changes may include, but are not limited to, 
addition of services under the waiver, a change in the qualifications of 
service providers, or a change in the eligible population.
    (5) A request for an amendment that involves a substantive change is 
given a prospective effective date, but this date need not coincide with 
the start of the next FFY.
    (b) Extension or new waiver request. HCFA determines whether a 
request for extension of an existing waiver is actually an extension 
request, or a request for a new waiver. Generally, if a State's 
extension request proposes a substantive change in services furnished, 
eligible population, service area, statutory sections waived, or 
qualifications of service providers, HCFA considers it a new waiver 
request.
    (c) Reconsideration of denial. A determination of HCFA to deny a 
request for a waiver (or for extension of a waiver) under this subpart 
may be reconsidered in accordance with Sec. 441.357.
    (d) Existing waiver effectiveness after denial. If HCFA denies a 
request for an extension of an existing waiver under this subpart:
    (1) The existing waiver remains in effect for a period of not less 
than 90 days after the date on which HCFA denies the request, or, if the 
State seeks reconsideration in accordance with Sec. 441.357, the date on 
which a final determination is made with respect to that review.
    (2) HCFA calculates an APEL for the period for which the waiver 
remains in effect, and this calculation is used to pro-rate the limit 
according to the number of days to which it applies.


<R05>
Sec. 441.356  Waiver termination.

    (a) Termination by the State. If a State chooses to terminate its 
waiver before an approved program is due to expire, the following 
conditions apply:
    (1) The State must notify HCFA in writing at least 30 days before 
terminating services to recipients.
    (2) The State must notify recipients of services under the waiver at 
least 30 days before terminating services in accordance with 
Sec. 431.210 of this chapter.
    (3) HCFA continues to apply the APEL described in Sec. 441.354 
through the end of the waiver year, but this limit is not applied in 
subsequent years.
    (4) The State may not decrease the services available under the 
approved State plan to individuals age 65 or older by an amount that 
violates the comparability of service requirements set forth in 
Sec. 440.240 of this chapter.
    (b) Termination by HCFA. (1) If HCFA finds, during an approved 
waiver period, that an agency is not meeting one or more of the 
requirements for a waiver contained in this subpart, HCFA notifies the 
agency in writing of its findings and grants an opportunity for a 
hearing in accordance with Sec. 441.357. If

[[Page 243]]

HCFA determines that the agency is not in compliance with this subpart 
after the notice and any hearing, HCFA may terminate the waiver.
    (2) If HCFA terminates the waiver, the following conditions apply:
    (i) The State must notify recipients of services under the waiver at 
least 30 days before terminating services in accordance with 
Sec. 431.210 of this chapter.
    (ii) HCFA continues to apply the APEL in Sec. 441.354 of this 
subpart, but the limit is prorated according to the number of days in 
the fiscal year during which waiver services were offered. The limit 
expires concurrently with the termination of home and community-based 
services under the waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 441.357  Hearing procedures for waiver denials.

    The procedures specified in Sec. 430.18 of this subchapter apply to 
State requests for hearings on denials, renewals, or amendments of 
waivers for home and community-based services for individuals age 65 or 
older.


<R05>
Sec. 441.360  Limits on Federal financial participation (FFP).

    FFP for home and community-based services listed in Sec. 440.181 of 
this subchapter is not available in expenditures for the following:
    (a) Services furnished in a facility subject to the health and 
welfare requirements described in Sec. 441.352(a) during any period in 
which the facility is found not to be in compliance with the applicable 
State requirements described in that section.
    (b) The cost of room and board except when furnished as part of 
respite care services in a facility, approved by the State, that is not 
a private residence. For purposes of this subpart, ``board'' means three 
meals a day or any other full nutritional regimen. ``Board'' does not 
include meals, which do not comprise a full nutritional regimen, 
furnished as part of adult day health services.
    (c) The portion of the cost of room and board attributed to 
unrelated, live-in personal caregivers when the waiver recipient lives 
in the caregiver's home or a residence owned or leased by the provider 
of the Medicaid services (the caregiver).
    (d) Services that are not included in the approved State plan and 
not approved as waiver services by HCFA.
    (e) Services furnished to recipients who are ineligible under the 
terms of the approved waiver.
    (f) Services furnished by a provider when either the services or the 
provider do not meet the standards that are set by the State and 
included in the approved waiver.
    (g) Services furnished to a recipient by his or her spouse.


<R05>
Sec. 441.365  Periodic evaluation, assessment, and review.

    (a) Purpose. This section prescribes requirements for periodic 
evaluation, assessment, and review of the care and services furnished to 
individuals receiving home and community-based waiver services under 
this subpart.
    (b) Evaluation and assessment review team. (1) A review team, as 
described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, must 
periodically evaluate and assess the care and services furnished to 
recipients under this subpart. The review team must be created by the 
State agency directly, or (through interagency agreement) by other 
departments of State government (such as the Department of Health or the 
Agency on Aging).
    (2) Each review team must consist of at least one physician or 
registered nurse, and at least one other individual with health and 
social service credentials who the State believes is qualified to 
properly evaluate and assess the care and services provided under the 
waiver. If there is no physician on the review team, the Medicaid agency 
must ensure that a physician is available to provide consultation to the 
review team.
    (3) For waiver services furnished to individuals who have been found 
to be likely to require the level of care furnished in a NF that is also 
an IMD, each review team must have a psychiatrist or physician and other 
appropriate mental health or social service personnel who are 
knowledgeable about geriatric mental illness.
    (c) Financial interests and employment of review team members. (1) 
No member of a review team may have a financial

[[Page 244]]

interest in or be employed by any entity that furnishes care and 
services under the waiver to a recipient whose care is under review.
    (2) No physician member of a review team may evaluate or assess the 
care of a recipient for whom he or she is the attending physician.
    (3) No individual who serves as case manager, caseworker, benefit 
authorizer, or any similar position, may serve as member of a review 
team that evaluates and assesses care furnished to a recipient with whom 
he or she has had a professional relationship.
    (d) Number and location of review teams. A sufficient number of 
teams must be located within the State so that onsite inspections can be 
made at appropriate intervals at sites where waiver recipients receive 
care and services.
    (e) Frequency of periodic evaluations and assessments. Periodic 
evaluations and assessments must be conducted at least annually for each 
recipient under the waiver. The review team and the agency have the 
option to determine the frequency of further periodic evaluations and 
assessments, based on the quality of services and access to care being 
furnished under the waiver and the condition of patients receiving care 
and services.
    (f) Notification before inspection. No provider of care and services 
under the waiver may be notified in advance of a periodic evaluation, 
assessment, and review. However, when a recipient receives services in 
his own home or the home of a relative, notification must be provided to 
the residents of the household at least 48 hours in advance. The 
recipient must have an opportunity to decline access to the home. If the 
recipient declines access to his or her own home, or the home of a 
relative, the review is limited solely to the review of the provider's 
records. If the recipient is incompetent, the head of the household has 
the authority to decline access to the home.
    (g) Personal contact with and observation of recipients and review 
of records. (1) For recipients of care and services under a waiver, the 
review team's evaluation and assessment must include--
    (i) A review of each recipient's medical record, the evaluation and 
reevaluation required by Sec. 441.353(c), and the plan of care under 
which the waiver and other services are furnished; and
    (ii) If the records described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section 
are inadequate or incomplete, personal contact and observation of each 
recipient.
    (2) The review team may personally contact and observe any recipient 
whose care the team evaluates and assesses.
    (3) The review team may consult with both formal and informal 
caregivers when the recipient's records are inadequate or incomplete and 
when any apparent discrepancy exists between services required by the 
recipient and services furnished under the waiver.
    (h) Determinations by the review team. The review team must 
determine in its evaluation and assessment whether--
    (1) The services included in the plan of care are adequate to meet 
the health and welfare needs of each recipient;

the recipient as planned;
    (3) It is necessary and in the interest of the recipient to continue 
receiving services through the waiver program; and
    (4) It is feasible to meet the recipient's health and welfare needs 
through the waiver program.
    (i) Other information considered by review team. When making 
determinations, under paragraph (h) of this section, for each recipient, 
the review team must consider the following information and may consider 
other information as it deems necessary:
    (1) Whether the medical record, the determination of level of care, 
and the plan of care are consistent, and whether all ordered services 
have been furnished and properly recorded.
    (2) Whether physician review of prescribed psychotropic medications 
(when required for behavior control) has occurred at least every 30 
days.
    (3) Whether tests or observations of each recipient indicated by his

recorded.
    (4) Whether progress notes entered in the record by formal and 
informal

[[Page 245]]

caregivers are made as required and appear to be consistent with the 
observed condition of the recipient.
    (5) Whether reevaluations of the recipient's level of care have 
occurred at least as frequently as would be required if that individual 
were served in a NF.
    (6) Whether the recipient receives adequate care and services, 
based, at a minimum, on the following when observations are necessary 
(the requirements for the necessity of observations are set forth in new 
Sec. 441.365(g)(3)):
    (i) Cleanliness.
    (ii) Absence of bedsores.
    (iii) Absence of signs of malnutrition or dehydration.
    (7) Whether the recipient needs any service that is not included in 
the plan of care, or if included, is not being furnished by formal or 
informal caregivers under the waiver or through arrangements with 
another public or private source of assistance.
    (8) Determination as to whether continued home and community-based 
services are required by the recipient to avoid the likelihood of 
placement in a NF.

to the Medicaid agency the results of its periodic evaluation, 
assessment and review of the care of the recipient:
    (1) Within 1 month of the completion of the review.
    (2) Immediately upon its determination that conditions exist that 
may constitute a threat to the life or health of a recipient.
    (k) Agency's action. The Medicaid agency must establish and adhere 
to procedures for taking appropriate action in response to the findings 
reported by the review team. These procedures must provide for immediate 
response to any finding that the life or health of a recipient may be 
jeopardized.

<R05>
Sec. 442.2  Terms.

    In this part--
    Facility refers to a nursing facility, and an intermediate care 
facility for

[[Page 247]]

the mentally retarded or persons with related conditions (ICF/MR).
    Facility, and any specific type of facility referred to, may include 
a distinct part of a facility as specified in Sec. 440.40 or 
Sec. 440.150 of this subchapter.
    Immediate jeopardy means a situation in which immediate corrective 
action is necessary because the provider's noncompliance with one or 
more requirements of participation or conditions of participation has 
caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm, impairment, or 
death to an individual receiving care in a facility.
    New admission means the admission of a Medicaid recipient who has 
never been in the facility or, if previously admitted, had been 
discharged or had voluntarily left the facility. The term does not 
include the following:
    (a) Individuals who were in the facility before the effective date 
of denial of payment for new admissions, even if they become eligible 
for Medicaid after that date.
    (b) If the approved State plan includes payments for reserved beds, 
individuals who, after a temporary absence from the facility, are 
readmitted to beds reserved for them in accordance with Sec. 447.40(a) 
of this chapter.

    A State plan must provide that requirements of this subpart are met.


<R05>
Sec. 442.12  Provider agreement: General requirements.

    (a) Certification and recertification. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, a Medicaid agency may not execute a 
provider agreement with a facility for nursing facility services nor 
make Medicaid payments to a facility for those services unless the 
Secretary or the State survey agency has certified the facility under 
this part to provide those services. (See Sec. 442.101 for certification 
by the Secretary or by the State survey agency).
    (b) Exception. The certification requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section does not apply with respect to Christian Science sanitoria 
operated, or listed and certified, by the First Church of Christ 
Scientist, Boston, Mass.
    (c) Conformance with certification condition. An agreement must be 
in accordance with the certification provisions set by the Secretary or 
the survey agency under subpart C of this part for ICFs/MR or subpart E 
of part 488 of this chapter for NFs.
    (d) Denial for good cause. (1) If the Medicaid agency has adequate 
documentation showing good cause, it may refuse to execute an agreement, 
or may cancel an agreement, with a certified facility.
    (2) A provider agreement is not a valid agreement for purposes of 
this part even though certified by the State survey agency, if the 
facility fails to meet the civil rights requirements set forth in 45 CFR 
parts 80, 84, and 90.

[45 FR 22936, Apr. 4, 1980, as amended at 56 FR 48865, Sept. 26, 1991;

    (a) Assignment of agreement. When there is a change of ownership, 
the Medicaid agency must automatically assign the agreement to the new

agreement is subject to all applicable statutes and regulations and to 
the terms and conditions under which it was originally issued, 
including, but not limited to, the following:
    (1) Any existing plan of correction.
    (2) Any expiration date for ICFs/MR.
    (3) Compliance with applicable health and safety requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 442.15  Duration of agreement for ICFs/MR.

    (a) Except as specified under Sec. 442.16, the duration of an 
agreement may not exceed 12 months.
    (b) The agreement must be for the same duration as the certification 
period set by the survey agency. However, if the Medicaid agency has 
adequate documentation showing good cause, it may make an agreement for 
less than this period.
    (c) FFP is available for services provided by a facility for up to 
30 days after its agreement expires or terminates under the conditions 
specified in Sec. 441.11 of this subchapter.

[43 FR 45233, Sept. 29, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 31532, July 20, 1982; 
59 FR 56235, Nov. 10, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 442.16  Extension of agreement for ICFs/MR.

    A Medicaid agency may extend a provider agreement for a single 
period of up to 2 months beyond the original expiration date specified 
in the agreement if it receives written notice from the survey agency, 
before the expiration date of the agreement, that extension will not 
jeopardize the patients' health and safety, and--
    (a) Is needed to prevent irreparable harm to the facility or 
hardship to the recipients in the facility; or
    (b) Is needed because it is impracticable to determine, before the 
expiration date, whether the facility meets certification requirements.

[43 FR 45233, Sept. 29, 1978, as amended at 52 FR 32551, Aug. 28, 1987; 
53 FR 20495, June 3, 1988; 59 FR 56235, Nov. 10, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 442.30  Agreement as evidence of certification.

    (a) Under Secs. 440.40(a) and 440.150 of this chapter, FFP is 
available in expenditures for NF and ICF/MR services only if the 
facility has been certified as meeting the requirements for Medicaid 
participation, as evidenced by a provider agreement executed under this 
part. An agreement is not valid evidence that a facility has met those 
requirements if HCFA determines that--
    (1) The survey agency failed to apply the applicable requirements 
under subpart B of part 483 of this chapter for NFs or subpart I of part 
483 of this chapter, which set forth the conditions of participation for 
ICFs/MR.
    (2) The survey agency failed to follow the rules and procedures for 
certification set forth in subpart C of this part, subpart E of part 
488, and Sec. 431.610 of this subchapter;
    (3) The survey agency failed to perform any of the functions 
specified in Sec. 431.610(g) of this subchapter relating to evaluating 
and acting on information about the facility and inspecting the 
facility;
    (4) The agency failed to use the Federal standards, and the forms, 
methods and procedures prescribed by HCFA as required under 
Sec. 431.610(f)(1) or Sec. 488.318(b) of this chapter, for determining 
the qualifications of providers; or
    (5) The survey agency failed to adhere to the following principles 
in determining compliance:
    (i) The survey process is the means to assess compliance with 
Federal health, safety and quality standards;
    (ii) The survey process uses resident outcomes as the primary means 
to establish the compliance status of facilities. Specifically, 
surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and 
services to residents, and the effects of that care, to assess whether 
the care provided meets the needs of individual residents;
    (iii) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert 
with Federal forms and procedures, to determine compliance;
    (iv) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform 
and consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;
    (v) Federal forms are used by all surveyors to ensure proper 
recording of findings and to document the basis for the findings.

[[Page 249]]

    (6) The survey agency failed to assess in a systematic manner a 
facility's actual provision of care and services to residents and 
effects of that care on residents.
    (7) Required elements of the NF survey process fails to include all 
of the following:
    (i) An entrance conference;
    (ii) A resident-centered tour of facility;
    (iii) An in-depth review of a sample of residents including 
observation, interview and record review;
    (iv) Observation of the preparation and administration of drugs for 
a sample of residents;
    (v) Evaluation of a facility's meals, dining areas and eating 
assistance procedures;
    (vi) Formulation of a deficiency statement based on the 
incorporation of all appropriate findings onto the survey report form;
    (vii) An exit conference; and
    (viii) Follow-up surveys as appropriate.
    (8) The agreement's terms and conditions do not meet the 
requirements of this subpart.
    (b) The Administrator will make the determination under paragraph 
(a) of this section through onsite surveys, other Federal reviews, State 
certification records, or reports he may require from the Medicaid or 
survey agency.
    (c) If the Administrator disallows a State's claim for FFP because 
of a determination under paragraph (a) of this section, the State is 
entitled upon request to reconsideration of the disallowance under 45 
CFR part 16.

[43 FR 45233, Sept. 29, 1978, as amended at 51 FR 21558, June 13, 1986;

Sept. 26, 1991; 59 FR 56235, Nov. 10, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 442.40  Availability of FFP during appeals for ICFs/MR.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section--
    Effective date of expiration means the date of expiration originally 
specified in the provider agreement, or the later date specified if the 
agreement is extended under Sec. 442.16; and
    Effective date of termination means a date earlier than the 
expiration date, set by the Medicaid agency when continuing 
participation until the expiration date is not justified, because the 
facility no longer meets the requirements for participation.
    (b) Scope, applicability, and effective date--(1) Scope. This 
section sets forth the extent of FFP in State Medicaid payments to an 
ICF/MR after its provider agreement has been terminated or has expired 
and not been renewed.
    (2) Applicability. (i) This section and Sec. 442.42 apply only when 
the Medicaid agency, of its own volition, terminates or does not a renew 
a provider agreement, and only when the survey agency certifies that 
there is no jeopardy to recipient health and safety. When the survey 
agency certifies that there is jeopardy to recipient health and safety, 
or when it fails to certify that there is no jeopardy, FFP ends on the 
effective date of termination or expiration.
    (ii) When the State acts under instructions from HCFA, FFP ends on 
the date specified by HCFA (HCFA instructs the State to terminate the 
Medicaid provider agreement when HCFA in validating a State survey 
agency certification, determines that an ICF/MR does not meet the 
requirements for participation.)
    (3) Effective date. This section and Sec. 442.42 apply to 
terminations or expirations that are effective on or after September 28, 
1987. For terminations or nonrenewals that were effective before that 
date, FFP may continue for up to 120 days from September 28, 1987, or 12 
months from the effective date of termination or nonrenewal, whichever 
is earlier.
    (c) Basic rules. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section, FFP in payments to an ICF/MR ends on the effective date of 
termination of the facility's provider agreement, or if the agreement is 
not terminated, on the effective date of expiration.
    (2) If State law, or a Federal or State court order or injunction, 
requires the agency to extend the provider agreement or continue 
payments to a facility after the dates specified in paragraph (d) of 
this section, FFP is not available in those payments.
    (d) Exception: Continuation of FFP after termination or expiration 
of provider

[[Page 250]]

agreement--(1) Conditions for continuation. FFP is available after the 
effective date of termination or expiration only if--
    (i) The evidentiary hearing required under Sec. 431.153 of this 
chapter is provided by the State agency after the effective date of 
termination or expiration (or, if begun before termination or 
expiration, is not completed until after that date); and
    (ii) Termination or nonrenewal action is based on a survey agency 
certification that there is no jeopardy to recipients' health and 
safety.
    (2) Extent of continuation. FFP is available only through the 
earlier of the following:
    (i) The date of issuance of an administrative hearing decision that 
upholds the agency's termination or nonrenewal action.
    (ii) The 120th day after the effective date of termination of the 
facility's provider agreement or, if the agreement is not terminated, 
the 120th day after the effective date of expiration. (If a hearing 
decision that upholds the facility is issued after the end of the 120-
day period, when FFP has already been discontinued, the rules of 
Sec. 442.42 on retroactive agreements apply).
    (e) Applicability of Sec. 441.11. If FFP is continued during appeal 
under paragraph (d) of this section, the 30-day period provided by 
Sec. 441.11 of this chapter would not begin to run until issuance of a 
hearing decision that upholds the agency's termination or nonrenewal 
action.

59 FR 56236, Nov. 10, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 442.42  FFP under a retroactive provider agreement following appeal.

    (a) Basic rule. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, if an NF or ICF/MR prevails on appeal from termination or, in 
the case of an ICF/MR, nonrenewal of a provider agreement, and the State 
issues a retroactive agreement, FFP is available beginning with the 
retroactive effective date, which must be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 442.13.
    (b) Exception. This rule does not apply if HCFA determines, under 
Sec. 442.30, that the agreement is not valid evidence that the facility 
meets the requirements for participation. This exclusion applies even if 
the State issues the new agreement as the result of an administrative 
hearing decision favorable to the facility or under a Federal or State 
court order.

<R05>
Sec. 442.101  Obtaining certification.

    (a) This section states the requirements for obtaining notice of an 
ICF/MR's certification before a Medicaid agency executes a provider 
agreement under Sec. 442.12.
    (b) The agency must obtain notice of certification from the 
Secretary for an ICF/MR located on an Indian reservation.
    (c) The agency must obtain notice of certification from the survey 
agency for all other ICFs/MR.
    (d) The notice must indicate that one of the following provisions 
pertains to the ICF/MR:
    (1) An ICF/MR meets the conditions of participation set forth in 
subpart I of part 483 of this chapter.
    (2) The ICF/MR has been granted a waiver or variance by HCFA or the 
survey agency under subpart I of part 483 of this chapter.
    (3) An ICF/MR has been certified with standard-level deficiencies 
and
    (i) All conditions of participation are found met; and
    (ii) The facility submits an acceptable plan of correction covering 
the remaining deficiencies, subject to other limitations specified in 
Sec. 442.105.
    (e) The failure to meet one or more of the applicable conditions of 
participation is cause for termination or non-renewal of the ICF/MR 
provider agreement.

[[Page 251]]


<R05>
Sec. 442.105  Certification of ICFs/MR with deficiencies: General provisions.

    If a survey agency finds a facility deficient in meeting the 
standards for ICFs/MR, as specified under subpart I of part 483 of this 
chapter, the agency may certify the facility for Medicaid purposes under 
the following conditions:
    (a) The agency finds that the facility's deficiencies, individually 
or in combination, do not jeopardize the patient's health and safety, 
nor seriously limit the facility's capacity to give adequate care.
    (b) The agency finds acceptable the facility's written plan for 
correcting the deficiencies.
    (c) If a facility was previously certified with a deficiency and has 
a different deficiency at the time of the next survey, the agency 
documents that the facility--

before the effective date of the sanction, with a notice that includes 
the effective date and the reasons for the denial of payments.

Sec. 442.119  Duration of denial of payments and subsequent termination of an ICF/MR.

    (a) Period of denial. The denial of payments for new admissions will 
continue for 11 months after the month it was imposed unless, before the 
end of that period, the Medicaid agency finds that--
    (1) The facility has corrected the deficiencies or is making a good 
faith effort to achieve compliance with the conditions of participation 
for ICFs/MR; or
    (2) The deficiencies are such that it is necessary to terminate the 
facility's provider agreement.
    (b) Subsequent termination. The Medicaid agency must terminate a 
facility's provider agreement--
    (1) Upon the agency's finding that the facility has been unable to 
achieve compliance with the conditions of participation for ICFs/MR 
during the period that payments for new admissions have been denied;
    (2) Effective the day following the last day of the denial of 
payments period; and
    (3) In accordance with the procedures for appeal of terminations set

<R05>
Sec. 447.1  Purpose.

    This subpart prescribes State plan requirements, FFP limitations and 
procedures concerning payments made by State Medicaid agencies for 
Medicaid services.


<R05>
Sec. 447.10  Prohibition against reassignment of provider claims.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section implements section 1902(a)(32) 
of the

[[Page 254]]

Act which prohibits State payments for Medicaid services to anyone other 
than a provider or recipient, except in specified circumstances.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    Facility means an institution that furnishes health care services to 
inpatients.
    Factor means an individual or an organization, such as a collection 
agency or service bureau, that advances money to a provider for accounts 
receivable that the provider has assigned, sold or transferred to the 
individual organization for an added fee or a deduction of a portion of 
the accounts receivable. Factor does not include a business 
representative as described in paragraph (f) of this section.
    Organized health care delivery system means a public or private 
organization for delivering health services. It includes, but is not 
limited to, a clinic, a group practice prepaid capitation plan, and a 
health maintenance organization.
    (c) State plan requirements. A State plan must provide that the 
requirements of paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section are met.
    (d) Who may receive payment. Payment may be made only--
    (1) To the provider; or
    (2) To the recipient if he is a noncash recipient eligible to 
receive the payment under Sec. 447.25; or
    (3) In accordance with paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section.
    (e) Reassignments. Payment may be made in accordance with a 
reassignment from the provider to a government agency or reassignment by 
a court order.
    (f) Business agents. Payment may be made to a business agent, such 
as a billing service or an accounting firm, that furnishes statements 
and receives payments in the name of the provider, if the agent's 
compensation for this service is--
    (1) Related to the cost of processing the billing;
    (2) Not related on a percentage or other basis to the amount that is 
billed or collected; and
    (3) Not dependent upon the collection of the payment.
    (g) Individual practitioners. Payment may be made to--
    (1) The employer of the practitioner, if the practitioner is 
required as a condition of employment to turn over his fees to the 
employer;
    (2) The facility in which the service is provided, if the 
practitioner has a contract under which the facility submits the claim; 
or
    (3) A foundation, plan, or similar organization operating an 
organized health care delivery system, if the practitioner has a 
contract under which the organization submits the claim.
    (h) Prohibition of payment to factors. Payment for any service 
furnished to a recipient by a provider may not be made to or through a 
factor, either directly or by power of attorney.

61 FR 38398, July 24, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 447.15  Acceptance of State payment as payment in full.

    A State plan must provide that the Medicaid agency must limit 
participation in the Medicaid program to providers who accept, as 
payment in full, the amounts paid by the agency plus any deductible, 
coinsurance or copayment required by the plan to be paid by the 
individual. However, the provider may not deny services to any eligible 
individual on account of the individual's inability to pay the cost 
sharing amount imposed by the plan in accordance with Sec. 431.55(g) or 
Sec. 447.53. The previous sentence does not apply to an individual who 
is able to pay. An individual's inability to pay does not eliminate his 
or her liability for the cost sharing charge.

[50 FR 23013, May 30, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 447.20  Provider restrictions: State plan requirements.

    A State plan must provide for the following:
    (a) In the case of an individual who is eligible for medical 
assistance under the plan for service(s) for which a third party or 
parties is liable for payment, if the total amount of the established 
liability of the third party or parties for the service is--

[[Page 255]]

    (1) Equal to or greater than the amount payable under the State plan 
(which includes, when applicable, cost-sharing payments provided for in 
Secs. 447.53 through 447.56), the provider furnishing the service to the 
individual may not seek to collect from the individual (or any 
financially responsible relative or representative of that individual) 
any payment amount for that service; or
    (2) Less than the amount payable under the State plan (including 
cost sharing payments set forth in Secs. 447.53 through 447.56), the 
provider furnishing the service to that individual may collect from the 
individual (or any financially responsible relative or representative of 
the individual) an amount which is the lesser of--
    (i) Any cost-sharing payment amount imposed upon the individual 
under Secs. 447.53 through 447.56; or
    (ii) An amount which represents the difference between the amount 
payable under the State plan (which includes, where applicable, cost-
sharing payments provided for in Secs. 447.53 through 447.56) and the 
total of the established third party liability for the services.
    (b) A provider may not refuse to furnish services covered under the 
plan to an individual who is eligible for medical assistance under the 
plan on account of a third party's potential liability for the 
service(s).

[55 FR 1433, Jan. 16, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 447.21  Reduction of payments to providers.

    If a provider seeks to collect from an individual (or any 
financially responsible relative or representative of that individual) 
an amount that exceeds an amount specified under Sec. 447.20(a)--
    (a) The Medicaid agency may provide for a reduction of any payment 
amount otherwise due to the provider in addition to any other sanction 
available to the agency; and
    (b) The reduction may be equal to up to three times the amount that 
the provider sought to collect in violation of Sec. 447.20(a).

[55 FR 1433, Jan. 16, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 447.25  Direct payments to certain recipients for physicians' or dentists' services.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section implements section 1905(a) of 
the Act by prescribing requirements applicable to States making direct 
payments to certain recipients for physicians' or dentists' services.
    (b) State plan requirements. Except for groups specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section, a State may make direct payments to 
recipients for physicians' or dentists' services. If it does so, the 
State plan must--
    (1) Provide for direct payments; and
    (2) Specify the conditions under which payments are made.
    (c) Federal financial participation. No FFP is available in 
expenditures for direct payment for physicians' or dentists' services to 
any recipient--
    (1) Who is receiving assistance under the State's approved plan 
under title I, IV-A, X, XIV or XVI (AABD) of the Act; or
    (2) To whom supplemental security benefits are being paid under 
title XVI of the Act; or
    (3) Who is receiving or eligible for a State supplementary payment 
or would be eligible if he were not in a medical institution, and who is 
eligible for Medicaid as a categorically needy recipient.
    (d) Federal requirements. (1) Direct payments to recipients under 
this section are an alternative to payments directly to providers and 
are subject to the same conditions; for example, the State's reasonable 
charge schedules are applicable.
    (2) Direct payments must be supported by providers' bills for 
services.


<R05>
Sec. 447.30  Withholding the Federal share of payments to Medicaid providers to recover Medicare overpayments.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section implements section 1914 of the 
Act, which provides for withholding the Federal share of Medicaid 
payments to a provider if the provider has not arranged to repay 
Medicare overpayments or has failed to provide information to determine 
the amount of the overpayments. The intent of the statute and 
regulations is to facilitate the recovery of Medicare overpayments.

[[Page 256]]

The provision enables recovery of overpayments when institutions have 
reduced participation in Medicare or when physicians and suppliers have 
submitted few or no claims under Medicare, thus not receiving enough in 
Medicare reimbursement to permit offset of the overpayment.
    (b) When withholding occurs. The Federal share of Medicaid payments 
may be withheld from any provider specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section to recover Medicare overpayments that HCFA has been unable to 
collect if the provider participates in Medicaid and--
    (1) The provider has not made arrangements satisfactory to HCFA to 
repay the Medicare overpayment; or
    (2) HCFA has been unable to collect information from the provider to 
determine the existence or amount of Medicare overpayment.
    (c) The Federal share of Medicaid payments may be withheld with 
respect to the following providers:
    (1) An institutional provider that has or previously had in effect a 
Medicare provider agreement under section 1866 of the Act; and
    (2) A Medicaid provider who has previously accepted Medicare payment 
on the basis of an assignment under section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the 
Act; and during the 12 month period preceding the quarter in which the 
Federal share is to be withheld for a Medicare overpayment, submitted no 
claims under Medicare or submitted claims which total less than the 
amount of overpayment.
    (d) Order to reduce State payment.
    (1) HCFA may, at its discretion, issue an order to the Medicaid 
agency of any State that is using the provider's services, to reduce its 
payment to the provider by the amount specified in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (2) The order to reduce payment to the provider will remain in 
effect until--
    (i) The Medicaid agency determines that the overpayment has been 
completely recovered; or
    (ii) HCFA terminates the order.
    (3) HCFA may withhold FFP from any State that does not comply with 
the order specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to reduce 
payment to the provider and claims FFP for the expenditure on its 
quarterly expenditure report.
    (e) Notice of withholding. (1) Before the Federal share of payments 
may be withheld under this section, HCFA will notify the provider and 
the Medicaid agency of each State that HCFA believes may use the 
overpaid provider's services under Medicaid.
    (2) The notice will include the instruction to reduce State 
payments, as provided under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) HCFA will send the notice referred to in paragraph (e)(1) by 
certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (4) Each Medicaid agency must identify the amount of payment due the 
provider under Medicaid and give that information to HCFA in the next 
quarterly expenditure report.
    (5) The Medicaid agency may appeal any disallowance of FFP resulting 
from the withholding decision to the Grant Appeals Board, in accordance 
with 45 CFR part 16.
    (f) Amount to be withheld. HCFA may require the Medicaid agency to 
reduce the Federal share of its payment to the provider by the lesser of 
the following amounts.
    (1) The Federal matching share of payments to the provider, or
    (2) The total Medicare overpayment to the provider.
    (g) Effective date of withholding. Withholding of payment will 
become effective no less than 60 days after the day on which the agency 
receives notice of withholding.
    (h) Duration of withholding. No Federal funds are available in 
expenditures for services that are furnished by a provider specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section from the date on which the withholding 
becomes effective until the termination of withholding under paragraph 
(i) of this section.
    (i) Termination of withholding.
    (1) HCFA will terminate the order to reduce State payment if it 
determines that any of the following has occurred:
    (i) The Medicare overpayment is completely recovered:
    (ii) The institution or person makes an agreement satisfactory to 
HCFA to repay the overpayment; or

[[Page 257]]

    (iii) HCFA determines that there is no overpayment based on newly 
acquired evidence or a subsequent audit.
    (2) HCFA will notify each State that previously received a notice 
ordering the withholding that the withholding has been terminated.
    (j) Procedures for restoring excess withholding. If an amount 
ultimately determined to be in excess of the Medicare overpayment is 
withheld, HCFA will restore any excess funds withheld.
    (k) Recovery of funds from Medicaid agency. A provider is not 
entitled to recover from the Medicaid agency the amount of payment 
withheld by the agency in accordance with a HCFA order issued under 
paragraph (d) of this section.

[50 FR 19688, May 10, 1985; 50 FR 23307, June 3, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 447.31  Withholding Medicare payments to recover Medicaid overpayments.

    (a) Basis and purpose. Section 1885 of the Act provides authority 
for HCFA to withhold Medicare payments to a Medicaid provider in order 
to recover Medicaid overpayments to the provider. Section 405.377 of 
this chapter sets forth the Medicare rules implementing section 1885, 
and specifies under what circumstances withholding will occur and the 
providers that are subject to withholding. This section establishes the 
procedures that the Medicaid agency must follow when requesting that 
HCFA withhold Medicare payments.
    (b) Agency notice to providers. (1) Before the agency requests 
recovery of a Medicaid overpayment through Medicare, the agency must 
send either or both of the following notices, in addition to that 
required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, to the provider.
    (i) Notice that--
    (A) There has been an overpayment;
    (B) Repayment is required; and
    (C) The overpayment determination is subject to agency appeal 
procedures, but we may withhold Medicare payments while an appeal is in 
progress.
    (ii) Notice that--
    (A) Information is needed to determine the amount of overpayment if 
any; and
    (B) The provider has at least 30 days in which to supply the 
information to the agency.
    (2) Notice that, 30 days or later from the date of the notice, the 
agency intends to refer the case to HCFA for withholding of Medicare 
payments.
    (3) The agency must send all notices to providers by certified mail, 
return receipt requested.
    (c) Documentation to be submitted to HCFA. The agency must submit 
the following information or documentation to HCFA (unless otherwise 
specified) with the request for withholding of Medicare payments.
    (1) A statement of the reason that withholding is requested.
    (2) The amount of overpayment, type of overpayment, date the 
overpayment was determined, and the closing date of the pertinent cost 
reporting period (if applicable).
    (3) The quarter in which the overpayment was reported on the 
quarterly expenditure report (Form HCFA 64).
    (4) As needed, and upon request from HCFA, the names and addresses 
of the provider's officers and owners for each period that there is an 
outstanding overpayment.
    (5) A statement of assurance that the State agency has met the 
notice requirements under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (6) As needed, and upon request for HCFA, copies of notices (under 
paragraph (b) of this section), and reports of contact or attempted 
contact with the provider concerning the overpayment, including any 
reduction or suspension of Medicaid payments made with respect to that 
overpayment.
    (7) A copy of the provider's agreement with the agency under

establish procedures satisfactory to HCFA to assure the return to the 
provider of amounts withheld under this section that are ultimately 
determined to be in excess of overpayments. Those procedures are subject

    (4) At least one of the practitioners received payments on a fee-
for-service basis under titles V, XVIII, and XIX in an amount exceeding 
$5,000 for any one month during the preceding 12 months or in an

date of receipt, except in the following circumstances:
    (i) This time limitation does not apply to retroactive adjustments 
paid to providers who are reimbursed under a retrospective payment 
system, as defined in Sec. 447.272 of this part.
    (ii) If a claim for payment under Medicare has been filed in a 
timely manner, the agency may pay a Medicaid claim relating to the same

payment.
    (e) Waivers. (1) The Administrator may waive the requirements of 
paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section upon request by an agency if 
he finds that the agency has shown good faith in trying to meet them. In 
deciding whether the agency has shown good faith, the Administrator will 
consider whether the agency has received an unusually high volume of 
claims which are not clean claims, and whether the agency is making 
diligent efforts to implement an automated claims processing and 
information retrieval system.
    (2) The agency's request for a waiver must contain a written plan of 
correction specifying all steps it will take to meet the requirements of 
this section.

logically consistent with the recipient's characteristics and 
circumstances, such as type of illness, age, sex, service location;

<R05>
Sec. 447.53  Applicability; specification; multiple charges.

    (a) Basic requirements. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the plan may impose a nominal deductible, coinsurance, 
copayment, or similar charge upon categorically and medically needy 
individuals for any service under the plan.
    (b) Exclusions from cost sharing. The plan may not provide for 
impositions of a deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or similar charge 
upon categorically or medically needy individuals (except as specified 
in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) for the following:
    (1) Children. Services furnished to individuals under 18 years of 
age (and, at the option of the State, individuals under 21, 20, or 19 
years of age, or any reasonable category of individuals 18 years of age 
or over but under 21) are excluded from cost sharing.
    (2) Pregnant women. Services furnished to pregnant women if such 
services related to the pregnancy, or to any other medical condition 
which may complicate the pregnancy are excluded from cost sharing 
obligations. These services include routine prenatal care, labor and 
delivery, routine post-partum care, family planning services, 
complications of pregnancy or delivery likely to affect the pregnancy, 
such as hypertension, diabetes, urinary tract infection, and services 
furnished during the postpartum period for conditions or complications 
related to the pregnancy. The postpartum period is the immediate 
postpartum period which begins on the last day of pregnancy and extends 
through the end of the month in which the 60-day period following 
termination of pregnancy ends. States may further exclude from cost 
sharing all services furnished to pregnant women if they desire.
    (3) Institutionalized individuals. Services furnished to any 
individual who is an inpatient in a hospital, long-term care facility, 
or other medical institution if the individual is required (pursuant to 
Sec. 435.725, Sec. 435,733, Sec. 435.832, or Sec. 436.832), as a 
condition of receiving services in the institution, to spend all but a 
minimal amount of his income required for personal needs, for medical 
care costs are excluded from cost sharing.
    (4) Emergency services. Services provided in a hospital, clinic, 
office, or other facility that is equipped to furnish the required care, 
after the sudden onset of a medical condition manifesting itself by 
acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that the 
absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to 
result in--
    (i) Placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy;
    (ii) Serious impairment to bodily functions; or
    (iii) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.
    (5) Family planning. Family planning services and supplies furnished 
to individuals of child-bearing age are excluded from cost sharing.
    (6) HMO Enrollees. Services furnished by a health maintenance 
organization (HMO) to categorically needy individuals enrolled in the 
HMO are excluded from cost sharing. States may further exclude copayment 
charges for HMO services furnished to medically needy individuals.
    (c) Prohibition against multiple charges. For any service, the plan 
may not impose more than one type of charge referred to in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (d) State plan specifications. For each charge imposed under this 
section, the plan must specify--
    (1) The service for which the charge is made;
    (2) The amount of the charge;
    (3) The basis for determining the charge;
    (4) The basis for determining whether an individual is unable to pay 
the charge and the means by which such an individual will be identified 
to providers; and
    (5) The procedures for implementing and enforcing the exclusions 
from cost sharing found in paragraph (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 447.54  Maximum allowable charges.

    (a) Non-institutional services. Except as specified in paragraph 
(b), for non-institutional services, the plan must provide that--
    (1) Any deductible it imposes does not exceed $2.00 per month per 
family for each period of Medicaid eligibility. For example, if Medicaid 
eligibility is certified for a 3-month period, the maximum deductible 
which may be imposed on a family for that period of eligibility is 
$6.00;
    (2) Any coinsurance rate it imposes does not exceed 5 percent of the 
payment the agency makes for the services; and
    (3) Any co-payments it imposes do not exceed the amounts shown in 
the following table:

$50.01 or more..............................................        3.00
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Waiver of the requirement that cost sharing amounts be nominal. 
Upon approval from HCFA, the requirement that cost sharing charges must 
be nominal may be waived, in accordance with section 431.55(g) for 
nonemergency services furnished in a hospital emergency room.
    (c) Institutional services. For institutional services, the plan 
must provide that the maximum deductible, coinsurance or co-payment 
charge for each admission does not exceed 50 percent of the payment the 
agency makes for the first day of care in the institution.
    (d) Cumulative maximum. The plan may provide for a cumulative 
maximum amount for all deductible, coinsurance or co-payment charges 
that it imposes on any family during a specified period of time.

[48 FR 5736, Jan. 8, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 447.55  Standard co-payment.

    (a) The plan may provide for a standard, or fixed, co-payment amount 
for any service.
    (b) This standard copayment amount for any service may be determined 
by applying the maximum co-payment amounts specified in Sec. 447.54 (a) 
and (b) to the agency's average or typical payment for that service. For 
example, if the agency's typical payment for prescribed drugs is $4 to 
$5 per prescription, the agency might set a standard copayment of $0.50 
per prescription.


<R05>
Sec. 447.56  Income-related charges.

    Subject to the maximum allowable charges specified in Sec. 447.54 
(a) and (b), the plan may provide for income-related deductible, 
coinsurance or co-payment charges. For example, an agency may impose a 
higher charge on medically needy recipients than it imposes upon 
categorically needy recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 447.57  Restrictions on payments to providers.

    (a) The plan must provide that the agency does not increase the 
payment it makes to any provider to offset uncollected amounts for 
deductibles, coinsurance, copayments or similar charges that the 
provider has waived or are uncollectable, except as permitted under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) For those providers that the agency reimburses under Medicare 
reasonable cost reimbursement principles, in accordance with subpart B 
of this part, an agency may increase its payment to offset uncollected 
deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or similar charges that are bad 
debts of providers.


<R05>
Sec. 447.58  Payments to prepaid capitation organizations.

    Except for HMO services subject to the co-payment exclusion in 
Sec. 447.53(b)(6), if the agency contracts with a prepaid capitation 
organization that does not impose the agency's deductibles, coinsurance, 
co-payments or similar charges on its recipient members, the plan must 
provide that the agency calculates its payments to the organization as 
if those cost sharing charges were collected.

methods used to make the estimate.
    (2) An estimate of the composite average percentage increase of the 
revised payment rates over the preceding rates.


<R05>
Sec. 447.204  Encouragement of provider participation.

    The agency's payments must be sufficient to enlist enough providers

Sec. 447.250  Basis and purpose.

    (a) This subpart implements section 1902(a)(13)(A) of the Act, which 
requires that the State plan provide for payment for hospital and long-
term care facility services through the use of rates that the State 
finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary, are 
reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be incurred by 
efficiently and economically operated facilities to provide services in 
conformity with State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and 
safety standards.
    (b) Section 447.253(a)(2) implements section 1902(a)(30) of the Act, 
which requires that payments be consistent with efficiency, economy, and 
quality of care;
    (c) Sections 447.253 (c) and (d) implement sections 1902(a)(13)(B) 
and 1902(a)(13)(C) of the Act, which require a State Medicaid agency to 
make certain assurances to the Secretary regarding increases in payments 
resulting solely from changes in ownerships of hospitals, NFs, and ICFs/
MR.
    (d) Section 447.271 implements section 1903(i)(3) of the Act, which 
requires that payments for inpatient hospital services not exceed the 
hospital's customary charges.
    (e) Section 447.280 implements section 1913(b) of the Act, which 
concerns reimbursement for long-term care services furnished by swing-
bed hospitals.

<R05>
Sec. 447.253  Other requirements.

    (a) State assurances. In order to receive HCFA approval of a State 
plan change in payment methods and standards, the Medicaid agency must 
make assurances satisfactory to HCFA that the requirements set forth in 
paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section are being met, must submit 
the related information required by Sec. 447.255 of this subpart, and 
must comply with all other requirements of this subpart.
    (b) Findings. Whenever the Medicaid agency makes a change in its 
methods and standards, but not less often than annually, the agency must 
make the following findings:

[[Page 265]]

    (1) Payment rates. (i) The Medicaid agency pays for inpatient 
hospital services and long-term care facility services through the use 
of rates that are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be 
incurred by efficiently and economically operated providers to provide 
services in conformity with applicable State and Federal laws, 
regulations, and quality and safety standards.
    (ii) With respect to inpatient hospital services--
    (A) The methods and standards used to determine payment rates take 
into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate 
number of low income patients with special needs;
    (B) If a State elects in its State plan to cover inappropriate level 
of care services (that is, services furnished to hospital inpatients who 
require a lower covered level of care such as skilled nursing or 
intermediate care services) under conditions similar to those described 
in section 1861(v)(1)(G) of the Act, the methods and standards used to 
determine payment rates must specify that the payments for this type of 
care must be made at rates lower than those for inpatient hospital level 
of care services, reflecting the level of care actually received, in a 
manner consistent with section 1861(v)(1)(G) of the Act; and
    (C) The payment rates are adequate to assure that recipients have 
reasonable access, taking into account geographic location and 
reasonable travel time, to inpatient hospital services of adequate 
quality.
    (iii) With respect to nursing facility services--
    (A) Except for preadmission screening for individuals with mental 
illness and mental retardation under Sec. 483.20(f) of this Chapter, the 
methods and standards used to determine payment rates take into account 
the costs of complying with the requirements of part 483 subpart B of 
this chapter;
    (B) The methods and standards used to determine payment rates 
provide for an appropriate reduction to take into account the lower 
costs (if any) of the facility for nursing care under a waiver of the 
requirement in Sec. 483.30(c) of this Chapter to provide licensed nurses 
on a 24-hour basis;
    (C) The State establishes procedures under which the data and 
methodology used in establishing payment rates are made available to the 
public.
    (2) Upper payment limits. The agency's proposed payment rate will 
not exceed the upper payment limits as specified in Sec. 447.272.
    (c) Changes in ownership of hospitals. In determining payment when 
there has been a sale or transfer of the assets of a hospital, the 
State's methods and standards must provide that payment rates can 
reasonably be expected not to increase in the aggregate solely as a 
result of changes of ownership, more than the payments would increase 
under Medicare under Secs. 413.130, 413.134, 413.153, and 413.157 of 
this chapter, insofar as these sections affect payments for 
depreciation, interest on capital indebtedness, return on equity capital 
(if applicable), acquisition costs for which payments were previously 
made to prior owners, and the recapture of depreciation.
    (d) Changes in ownership of NFs and ICFs/MR. In determining payment 
when there has been a sale or transfer of assets of an NF or ICF/MR, the 
State's methods and standards must provide the following depending upon 
the date of the transfer.
    (1) For transfers on or after July 18, 1984 but before October 1, 
1985, the State's methods and standards must provide that payment rates 
can reasonably be expected not to increase in the aggregate, solely as 
the result of a change in ownership, more than payments would increase 
under Medicare under Secs. 413.130, 413.134, 413.153 and 413.157 of this 
chapter, insofar as these sections affect payment for depreciation, 
interest on capital indebtedness, return on equity capital (if 
applicable), acquisition costs for which payments were previously made 
to prior owners, and the recapture of depreciation.
    (2) For transfers on or after October 1, 1985, the State's methods 
and standards must provide that the valuation of capital assets for 
purposes of determining payment rates for NFs and ICFs/MR is not to 
increase (as measured from the date of acquisition by the

[[Page 266]]

seller to the date of the change of ownership) solely as a result of a 
change of ownership, by more than the lesser of--
    (i) One-half of the percentage increase (as measured from the date 
of acquisition by the seller to the date of the change of ownership, or, 
if necessary, as extrapolated retrospectively by the Secretary) in the 
Dodge construction index applied in the aggregate with respect to those 
facilities that have undergone a change of ownership during the fiscal 
year; or
    (ii) One-half of the percentage increase (as measured from the date 
of acquisition by the seller to the date of the change of ownership) in 
the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) (United States 
city average) applied in the aggregate with respect to those facilities 
that have undergone a change of ownership during the fiscal year.
    (e) Provider appeals. The Medicaid agency must provide an appeals or 
exception procedure that allows individual providers an opportunity to 
submit additional evidence and receive prompt administrative review, 
with respect to such issues as the agency determines appropriate, of 
payment rates.
    (f) Uniform cost reporting. The Medicaid agency must provide for the 
filing of uniform cost reports by each participating provider.
    (g) Audit requirements. The Medicaid agency must provide for 
periodic audits of the financial and statistical records of 
participating providers.
    (h) Public notice. The Medicaid agency must provide that it has 
complied with the public notice requirements in Sec. 447.205 of this 
part when it is proposing significant changes to its methods or 
standards for setting payment rates for inpatient hospital or LTC 
facility services.
    (i) Rates paid. The Medicaid agency must pay for inpatient hospital 
and long term care services using rates determined in accordance with 
methods and standards specified in an approved State plan.

Sec. 447.255  Related information.

    The Medicaid agency must submit, with the assurances described in 
Sec. 447.253(a), the following information:
    (a) The amount of the estimated average proposed payment rate for 
each type of provider (hospital, ICF/MR, or nursing facility), and the 
amount by which that estimated average rate increased or decreased 
relative to the average payment rate in effect for each type or provider 
for the immediately preceding rate period;
    (b) An estimate of the short-term and, to the extent feasible, long-
term effect the change in the estimated average rate will have on--
    (1) The availability of services on a Statewide and geographic area 
basis;
    (2) The type of care furnished;
    (3) The extent of provider participation; and
    (4) The degree to which costs are covered in hospitals that serve a 
disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs.

Sec. 447.256  Procedures for HCFA action on assurances and State plan amendments.

    (a) Criteria for approval. (1) HCFA approval action on State plans 
and State plan amendments, is taken in accordance with subpart B of part 
430 of this chapter and sections 1116, 1902(b) and 1915(f) of the Act.
    (2) In the case of State plan and plan amendment changes in payment 
methods and standards, HCFA bases its approval on the acceptability of 
the Medicaid agency's assurances that the requirements of Sec. 447.253 
have been met, and the State's compliance with the other requirements of 
this subpart.
    (b) Time limit. HCFA will send a notice to the agency of its 
determination as to whether the assurances regarding a State plan 
amendment are acceptable within 90 days of the date HCFA receives the 
assurances described in

[[Page 267]]

Sec. 447.253, and the related information described in Sec. 447.255 of 
this subpart. If HCFA does not send a notice to the agency of its 
determination within this time limit and the provisions in paragraph (a) 
of this section are met, the assurances and/or the State plan amendment 
will be deemed accepted and approved.
    (c) Effective date. A State plan amendment that is approved will 
become effective not earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter 
in which an approvable amendment is submitted in accordance with 
Sec. 430.20 of this chapter and 447.253.

<R05>
Sec. 447.257  FFP: Conditions relating to institutional reimbursement.

    FFP is not available for a State's expenditures for hospital 
inpatient or long-term care facility services that are in excess of the 
amounts allowable under this subpart.

                              Upper Limits


<R05>
Sec. 447.271  Upper limits based on customary charges.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the agency 
may not pay a provider more for inpatient hospital services under 
Medicaid than the provider's customary charges to the general public for 
the services.
    (b) The agency may pay a public provider that provides services free 
or at a nominal charge at the same rate that would be used if the 
provider's charges were equal to or greater than its costs.


<R05>
Sec. 447.272  Application of upper payment limits.

    (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, aggregate payments by an agency to each group of health care 
facilities (that is, hospitals, nursing facilities and ICFs for the 
mentally retarded (ICFs/MR)), may not exceed the amount that can 
reasonably be estimated would have been paid for those services under 
Medicare payment principles.
    (b) State operated facilities. In addition to meeting the 
requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, aggregate payments to each 
group of State-operated facilities (that is, hospitals, nursing 
facilities and ICFs/MR) may not exceed the amount that can reasonably be 
estimated would have been paid under Medicare payment principles.
    (c) Disproportionate share. The upper payment limitation established 
under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section does not apply to payment 
adjustments made under a State plan to hospitals found to serve a 
disproportionate number of low-income patients with special needs as 
provided in Sec. 447.253(b)(1)(ii)(A). The payment limitations for 
aggregate State disproportionate share hospital payments are specified 
in Secs. 447.296 through 447.299. States must submit a separate upper 
payment limit assurance that its aggregate disproportionate share 
hospital payments do not exceed the disproportionate share hospital 
payment limits.

    (a) General rule. If the State plan provides for NF services 
furnished by a swing-bed hospital, as specified in Secs. 440.40(a) and 
440.150(f) of this chapter, the methods and standards used to determine 
payment rates for routine NF services must--
    (1) Provide for payment at the average rate per patient day paid to 
NFs, as applicable, for routine services furnished during the previous 
calendar year; or
    (2) Meet the State plan and payment requirements described in this 
subpart, as applicable.
    (b) Application of the rule. The payment methodology used by a State 
to set payment rates for routine NF services must apply to all swing-bed 
hospitals in the State.

<R05>
Sec. 447.296  Limitations on aggregate payments for disproportionate share hospitals for the period January 1, 1992 through September 30, 1992.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply to the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia, but not to any State whose entire Medicaid program 
is operated under a waiver granted under section 1115 of the Act.
    (b) For the period January 1, 1992 through September 30, 1992, FFP 
is available for aggregate payments to hospitals that serve a 
disproprotionate number of low-income patients with special needs only 
if the payments are made in accordance with sections 1902(a)(13)(A) and 
1923 of the Act, and with one of the following:
    (1) An approved State plan in effect as of September 30, 1991.
    (2) A State plan amendment submitted to HCFA by September 30, 1991.
    (3) A State plan amendment, or modification thereof, submitted to 
HCFA between October 1, 1991 and November 26, 1991, if the amendment, or 
modification thereof, was intended to limit the State's definition of 
disproportionate share hospitals to those hospitals with Medicaid 
inpatient utilization rates or low-income utilization rates (as defined 
in section 1923 (b) of the Act) at or above the statewide arithmetic 
mean.
    (4) A methodology for disproportionate share hospital payments that 
was established and in effect as of September 30, 1991, or in accordance 
with a State law enacted or State regulation adopted as of September 30, 
1991.
    (5) A State plan amendment submitted to HCFA by September 30, 1992 
that increases aggregate disproportionate share hospitals payments in 
order to meet the minimum payment adjustments required by section 
1923(c)(1) of the Act. The minimum payment adjustment is the amount 
required by the Medicare methodology described in section 1923(c)(1) of 
the Act for those hospitals that satisfy the minimum Federal definition 
of a disproportionate share hospital in section 1923(b) of the Act.
    (6) A State plan amendment submitted to HCFA by September 30, 1992 
that provides for a redistribution of disproportionate share hospital 
payments within the State without raising total payments compared to the 
previously approved State plan. HCFA will approve the amendment only if 
the State submits written documentation that demonstrates to HCFA that 
the aggregate payments that will be made after the redistribution are no 
greater than those payments made before the redistribution.
    (7) A State plan amendment submitted to HCFA by September 30, 1992 
that provides for a reduction in disproportionate share hospital 
payments.


<R05>
Sec. 447.297  Limitations on aggregate payments for disproportionate share hospitals beginning October 1, 1992.

    (a) Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to the 50 
States and the District of Columbia, but not to any State whose entire 
Medicaid program is operated under a waiver granted under section 1115 
of the Act.
    (b) National payment target. The national payment target for 
disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments for any Federal fiscal 
year is equal to 12 percent of the total medical assistance expenditures 
that will be made during the Federal fiscal year under State plans, 
excluding administrative costs. A preliminary national expenditure 
target will be published by HCFA prior to October 1 of each year. This 
preliminary national expenditure target will be superseded by a final 
national expenditure target published by April 1 of each Federal fiscal 
year, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) State disproportionate share hospital allotments. Prior to 
October 1 of each Federal fiscal year, HCFA will publish in the Federal 
Register preliminary State DSH allotments for each State.

[[Page 269]]

These preliminary State DSH allotments will be determined using the most 
current applicable actual and estimated State expenditure information as 
reported to HCFA and adjusted by HCFA as may be necessary using the 
methodology described in Sec. 447.298. HCFA will publish final State DSH 
allotments by April 1 of each Federal fiscal year, as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Final national disproportionate share hospitals expenditure 
target and State disproportionate share hospitals allotments.
    (1) HCFA will revise the preliminary national expenditure target and 
the preliminary State DSH allotments by April 1 of each Federal fiscal 
year. The final national DSH expenditure target and State DSH allotments 
will be based on the most current applicable actual and estimated 
expenditure information reported to HCFA and adjusted by HCFA as may be 
necessary immediately prior to the April 1 publication date. The final 
national expenditure target and State DSH allotments will not be 
recalculated for that Federal fiscal year based upon any subsequent 
actual or estimated expenditure information reported to HCFA.
    (2) If HCFA determines that at any time a State has exceeded its 
final DSH allotment for a Federal fiscal year, FFP attributable to the 
excess DSH expenditures will be disallowed.
    (3) If a State's actual DSH expenditures applicable to a Federal 
fiscal year are less than its final State DSH allotment for that Federal 
fiscal year, the State is permitted, to the extent allowed by its 
approved State plan, to make additional DSH expenditures applicable to 
that Federal fiscal year up to the amount of its final DSH allotment for 
that Federal fiscal year.
    (e) Publication of limits.
    (1) Before the beginning of each Federal fiscal year, HCFA will 
publish in the Federal Register--
    (i) A preliminary national DSH expenditure target for the Federal 
fiscal year; and
    (ii) A preliminary DSH allotment for each State for the Federal 
fiscal year.
    (2) The final national DSH expenditure target and State DSH 
allotments will be published in the Federal Register by April 1 of each 
Federal fiscal year.

[57 FR 55143, Nov. 24, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 43182, Aug. 13, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 447.298  State disproportionate share hospital allotments.

    (a) Calculation of State's base allotment for Federal fiscal year 
1993.
    (1) For Federal fiscal year 1993, HCFA will calculate for each State 
a DSH allotment, using the State's ``base allotment.'' The State's base 
allotment is the greater of:
    (i) The total amount of the State's projected DSH payments for 
Federal fiscal year 1992 under the State plan applicable to Federal 
fiscal year 1992, calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section; or
    (ii) $1,000,000.
    (2) In calculating the State's DSH payments applicable to Federal 
fiscal year 1992, HCFA will derive amounts from payments applicable to 
the period of October 1, 1991, through September 30, 1992, under State 
plans or plan amendments that meet the requirements specified in 
Sec. 447.296(b). The calculation will not include--
    (i) DSH payment adjustments made by the State applicable to the 
period October 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991 under State plans or 
plan amendments that do not meet the criteria described in Sec. 447.296; 
and
    (ii) Retroactive DSH payments made in 1992 that are not applicable 
to Federal fiscal year 1992.
    (3) HCFA will calculate a percentage for each State by dividing the 
DSH base allotment by the total unadjusted medical assistance 
expenditures, excluding administrative costs, made during Federal fiscal 
year 1992. On the basis of this percentage, HCFA will classify each 
State as a ``high-DSH'' or ``low-DSH'' State.
    (i) If the State's base allotment exceeded 12 percent of its total 
unadjusted medical assistance expenditures made under the State plan in 
Federal fiscal year 1992, HCFA will classify the State as a ``high-DSH'' 
State.
    (ii) If the State's base allotment was 12 percent or less of its 
total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures made under the State 
plan in

[[Page 270]]

Federal fiscal year 1992, HCFA will classify the State as a ``low-DSH'' 
State.
    (b) State disproportionate share hospital allotments for Federal 
fiscal year 1993. (1) For Federal fiscal year 1993, HCFA will calculate 
a DSH allotment for each low-DSH State that equals the State's base 
allotment described under paragraph (a) of this section, increased by 
State growth, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) For high-DSH States, the dollar amount of DSH payments in 
Federal fiscal year 1993 may not exceed the dollar amount of DSH 
payments applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992 (that is, the State base 
allotment).
    (c) State disproportionate share hospital allotment for Federal 
fiscal years 1994 and after. For Federal fiscal years 1994 and after--
    (1) For low-DSH States, HCFA will calculate the DSH allotment for 
each Federal fiscal year by increasing the prior year's State DSHs 
allotment by--
    (i) State growth, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (ii) A supplemental amount, if applicable, as described in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (2) For high-DSH States, the dollar amount of DSH payments 
applicable to any Federal fiscal year may not exceed the dollar amount 
of payments applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992 (that is, the State 
base allotment). This payment limitation will apply until the Federal 
fiscal year in which the State's DSH payments applicable to that Federal 
fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of the State's total unadjusted 
medical assistance expenditures in that Federal fiscal year, equal 12 
percent or less. When a high-DSH State's percentage equals 12 percent or 
less, the State will be reclassified as a low-DSH State.
    (d) State growth. (1) The State growth for a State in a Federal 
fiscal year is equal to the product of--
    (i) The growth factor that is HCFA's projected percentage increase 
in the State's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures 
(including administrative costs) relative to the corresponding amount in 
the previous year; and
    (ii) The State's prior year DSH allotment.
    (2) If the growth factor is zero or is negative, the State growth is 
zero.
    (3) If a low-DSH State experiences a level of negative growth to the 
extent that its previous Federal fiscal year's DSH allotment would be 
more than 12 percent of its current Federal fiscal year's total 
unadjusted medical assistance expenditures (excluding administrative 
costs), the low-DSH State's previous year's DSH allotment will be 
reduced to the extent necessary to maintain the individual low-DSH 
State's 12-percent limit and that amount will become the low-DSH State's 
DSH allotment for the current Federal fiscal year. In no Federal fiscal 
year will a low-DSH State's DSH allotment be allowed to exceed its 
individual State 12-percent limit.
    (e) Supplemental amount available for low-DSH States.
    (1) A supplemental amount is the State's share of a pool of money 
(referred to as a redistribution pool).
    (2) HCFA will calculate the redistribution pool for the appropriate 
Federal fiscal year by subtracting from the projected national DSH 
expenditure target the following:
    (i) The total of the State DSH base allotments for all high-DSH 
States;
    (ii) The total of the previous year's State DSH allotments for all 
low-DSH States;
    (iii) The State growth amount for all low-DSH States; and
    (iv) The total amount of additional DSH payment adjustments made in 
order to meet the minimum payment adjustments required under section 
1923(c)(l) of the Act, which are made in accordance with 
Sec. 447.296(b)(5).
    (3) HCFA will determine the percent of the redistribution pool for 
each low-DSH State on the basis of each State's relative share of the 
total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures for the Federal fiscal 
year compared to the total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures 
for the Federal fiscal year projected to be made by all low-DSH States. 
The percent of the redistribution pool that each State will receive is 
equal to the State's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures 
divided by the total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures for all 
low-DSH States.

[[Page 271]]

    (4) HCFA will not provide any low-DSH State a supplemental amount 
that would result in the State's total DSH allotment exceeding 12 
percent of its projected total unadjusted medical assistance 
expenditures. HCFA will reallocate any supplemental amounts not 
allocated to States because of this 12-percent limitation to other low-
DSH States in accordance with the percentage determined in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section.
    (5) HCFA will not reallocate to low-DSH States the difference 
between any State's actual DSH expenditures applicable to a Federal 
fiscal year and its State DSH allotment applicable to that Federal 
fiscal year. Thus, any unspent DSH allotment may not be reallocated.
    (f) Special provision. Any increases in a State's aggregate 
disproportionate payments, that are made to meet the minimum payment 
requirements specified in Sec. 447.296(b)(5), may exceed the State base 
allotment to the extent such increases are made to satisfy the minimum 
payment requirement. In such cases, HCFA will adjust the State's base 
allotment in the subsequent Federal fiscal year to include the increased 
minimum payments.

Sec. 447.299  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Beginning with the first quarter of Federal fiscal year 1993, 
each State must submit to HCFA the quarterly aggregate amount of its 
disproportionate share hospital payments made to each individual public 
and private provider or facility. States' reports must present a 
complete, accurate, and full disclosure of all of their DSH programs and 
expenditures.
    (b) Each State must report the aggregate information specified under 
paragraph (a) of this section on a quarterly basis in accordance with 
procedures established by HCFA.
    (c) Each State must maintain, in readily reviewable form, supporting 
documentation that provides a detailed description of each DSH program, 
the legal basis of each DSH program, and the amount of DSH payments made 
to each individual public and private provider or facility each quarter. 
This information must be made available to Federal reviewers upon 
request.
    (d) If a State fails to comply with the reporting requirements 
contained in this section, future grant awards will be reduced by the 
amount of FFP HCFA estimates is attributable to the expenditures made to 
the disproportionate share hospitals as to which the State has not 
reported properly, until such time as the State complies with the 
reporting requirements. Deferrals and/or disallowances of equivalent 
amounts may also be imposed with respect to quarters for which the State 
has failed to report properly. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, FFP 
for those expenditures will be released when the State complies with all 
reporting requirements.

                      Rural Health Clinic Services


<R05>
Sec. 447.371  Services furnished by rural health clinics.

    The agency must pay for rural health clinic services, as defined in 
Sec. 440.20(b) of this subchapter, and for other ambulatory services 
furnished by a rural health clinic, as defined in Sec. 440.20(c) of this 
subchapter, as follows:
    (a) For provider clinics, the agency must pay the reasonable cost of 
rural health clinic services and other ambulatory services on the basis 
of the cost reimbursement principles in part 413 of this chapter. For 
purposes of this section, a provider clinic is an integral part of a 
hospital, skilled nursing facility, or home health agency that is 
participating in Medicare and is licensed, governed, and supervised with 
other departments of the facility.
    (b) For clinics other than provider clinics that do not offer any 
ambulatory services other than rural health clinic services, the agency 
must pay for rural health clinic services at the reasonable cost rate 
per visit determined by a Medicare carrier under Secs. 405.2426 through 
405.2429 of this chapter.
    (c) For clinics other than provider clinics that do offer ambulatory 
services other than rural health clinic services, the agency must pay 
for the other ambulatory services by one of the following methods:
    (1) The agency may pay for other ambulatory services and rural 
health clinic services at a single rate per visit that is based on the 
cost of all services furnished by the clinic. The rate must be 
determined by a Medicare carrier under Secs. 405.2426 through 405.2429 
of this chapter.
    (2) The agency may pay for other ambulatory services at a rate set 
for each service by the agency. The rate must not exceed the upper 
limits in this subpart. The agency must pay for rural health clinic 
services at the Medicare reimbursement rate per visit, as specified in 
Sec. 405.2426 of this chapter.
    (3) The agency may pay for dental services at a rate per visit that 
is based on the cost of dental services furnished by the clinic. The 
rate must be determined by a Medicare carrier under Secs. 405.2426 
through 405.2429 of this chapter. The agency must pay for ambulatory 
services other than dental services under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of 
this section.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (c) (1) and (3) of this section, 
``visit'' means a face-to-face encounter between a clinic patient and 
any health professional whose services are reimbursed under the State 
plan. Encounters with more than one health professional, and multiple 
encounters with the same health professional, that take place on the 
same day and at a single location constitute a single visit, except when 
the patient, after the first encounter, suffers illness or injury 
requiring additional diagnosis or treatment.

Sec. 455.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part unless the context indicates otherwise--
    Abuse means provider practices that are inconsistent with sound 
fiscal, business, or medical practices, and result in an unnecessary 
cost to the Medicaid program, or in reimbursement for services that are 
not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized 
standards for health care. It also includes recipient practices that 
result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program.
    Conviction or Convicted means that a judgment of conviction has been 
entered by a Federal, State, or local court, regardless of whether an 
appeal from that judgment is pending.
    Exclusion means that items or services furnished by a specific 
provider who has defrauded or abused the Medicaid program will not be 
reimbursed under Medicaid.
    Fraud means an intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a 
person with the knowledge that the deception could result in some 
unauthorized benefit to himself or some other person. It includes any 
act that constitutes fraud under applicable Federal or State law.
    Furnished refers to items and services provided directly by, or 
under the direct supervision of, or ordered by, a practitioner or other 
individual (either as an employee or in his or her own capacity), a 
provider, or other supplier of services. (For purposes of denial of 
reimbursement within this part, it does not refer to services ordered by 
one party but billed for and provided by or under the supervision of 
another.)
    Practitioner means a physician or other individual licensed under 
State law to practice his or her profession.
    Suspension means that items or services furnished by a specified 
provider who has been convicted of a program-related offense in a 
Federal, State, or

[[Page 276]]

local court will not be reimbursed under Medicaid.

    If the findings of a preliminary investigation give the agency 
reason to believe that an incident of fraud or abuse has occurred in the 
Medicaid program, the agency must take the following action, as 
appropriate:
    (a) If a provider is suspected of fraud or abuse, the agency must--
    (1) In States with a State Medicaid fraud control unit certified 
under subpart C of part 1002 of this title , refer the case to the unit 
under the terms of its agreement with the unit entered into under 
Sec. 1002.309 of this title; or
    (2) In States with no certified Medicaid fraud control unit, or in

certified under subpart C of this part,
    (a) The agency must--
    (1) Refer all cases of suspected provider fraud to the unit;
    (2) If the unit determines that it may be useful in carrying out the

<R05>
Sec. 455.23  Withholding of payments in cases of fraud or willful misrepresentation.

    (a) Basis for withholding. The State Medicaid agency may withhold 
Medicaid payments, in whole or in part, to a provider upon receipt of 
reliable evidence that the circumstances giving rise to the need for a 
withholding of payments involve fraud or willful misrepresentation under 
the Medicaid program. The State Medicaid agency may withhold payments 
without first notifying the provider of its intention to withhold such 
payments. A provider may request, and must be granted, administrative 
review where State law so requires.
    (b) Notice of withholding. The State agency must send notice of its 
withholding of program payments within 5 days of taking such action. The 
notice must set forth the general allegations as to the nature of the 
withholding action, but need not disclose any specific information 
concerning its ongoing investigation. The notice must:
    (1) State that payments are being withheld in accordance with this 
provision;
    (2) State that the withholding is for a temporary period, as stated 
in paragraph (c) of this section, and cite the circumstances under which 
withholding will be terminated;
    (3) Specify, when appropriate, to which type or types of Medicaid 
claims withholding is effective; and
    (4) Inform the provider of the right to submit written evidence for 
consideration by the agency.
    (c) Duration of withholding. All withholding of payment actions 
under this section will be temporary and will not continue after:
    (1) The agency or the prosecuting authorities determine that there 
is insufficient evidence of fraud or willful misrepresentation by the 
provider; or
    (2) Legal proceedings related to the provider's alleged fraud or 
willful misrepresentation are completed.

    This subpart implements sections 1124, 1126, 1902(a)(38), 
1903(i)(2), and 1903(n) of the Social Security Act. It sets forth State 
plan requirements regarding--
    (a) Disclosure by providers and fiscal agents of ownership and 
control information; and
    (b) Disclosure of information on a provider's owners and other 
persons convicted of criminal offenses against Medicare, Medicaid, or 
the title XX services program.

The subpart also specifies conditions under which the Administrator will

independent clinical laboratory, renal disease facility, rural health 
clinic, or health maintenance organization that participates in Medicare 
(title XVIII);

[[Page 279]]

    (b) Any Medicare intermediary or carrier; and

health-related services for which it claims payment under any plan or 
program established under title V or title XX of the Act.
    Fiscal agent means a contractor that processes or pays vendor claims 
on behalf of the Medicaid agency.
    Group of practitioners means two or more health care practitioners 
who practice their profession at a common location (whether or not they 
share common facilities, common supporting staff, or common equipment).
    Indirect ownership interest means an ownership interest in an entity 
that has an ownership interest in the disclosing entity. This term 
includes an ownership interest in any entity that has an indirect 
ownership interest in the disclosing entity.
    Managing employee means a general manager, business manager, 
administrator, director, or other individual who exercises operational 
or managerial control over, or who directly or indirectly conducts the 
day-to-day operation of an institution, organization, or agency.
    Ownership interest means the possession of equity in the capital, 
the stock, or the profits of the disclosing entity.
    Person with an ownership or control interest means a person or

<R05>
Sec. 455.102  Determination of ownership or control percentages.

    (a) Indirect ownership interest. The amount of indirect ownership 
interest is determined by multiplying the percentages of ownership in 
each entity. For example, if A owns 10 percent of the stock in a 
corporation which owns 80 percent of the stock of the disclosing entity, 
A's interest equates to an 8 percent indirect ownership interest in the 
disclosing entity and must be reported. Conversely, if B owns 80 percent 
of the stock of a corporation which owns 5 percent of the stock of the 
disclosing entity, B's interest equates to a 4 percent indirect 
ownership interest in the disclosing entity and need not be reported.
    (b) Person with an ownership or control interest. In order to 
determine percentage of ownership, mortgage, deed of

[[Page 280]]

trust, note, or other obligation, the percentage of interest owned in 
the obligation is multiplied by the percentage of the disclosing 
entity's assets used to secure the obligation. For example, if A owns 10 
percent of a note secured by 60 percent of the provider's assets, A's 
interest in the provider's assets equates to 6 percent and must be 
reported. Conversely, if B owns 40 percent of a note secured by 10 
percent of the provider's assets, B's interest in the provider's assets 
equates to 4 percent and need not be reported.


<R05>
Sec. 455.103  State plan requirement.

    A State plan must provide that the requirements of Secs. 455.104 
through 455.106 are met.

<R05>
Sec. 455.106  Disclosure by providers: Information on persons convicted of crimes.

    (a) Information that must be disclosed. Before the Medicaid agency 
enters into or renews a provider agreement, or at any time upon written

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 456.1  Basis and purpose of part.

    (a) This part prescribes requirements concerning control of the 
utilization of Medicaid services including--
    (1) A statewide program of control of the utilization of all 
Medicaid services; and
    (2) Specific requirements for the control of the utilization of 
Medicaid services in institutions.
    (3) Specific requirements for an outpatient drug use review program.
    (b) The requirements in this part are based on the following 
sections of the Act. Table 1 shows the relationship between these 
sections of the Act and the requirements in this part.
    (1) Methods and procedures to safeguard against unnecessary 
utilization of care and services. Section 1902(a)(30) requires that the 
State plan provide methods and procedures to safeguard against 
unnecessary utilization of care and services.
    (2) Penalty for failure to have an effective program to control 
utilization of institutional services. Section 1903(g)(1) provides for a 
reduction in the amount of Federal Medicaid funds paid to a State for 
long-stay inpatient services if the State does not make a showing 
satisfactory to the Secretary that it has an effective program of 
control over utilization of those services. This penalty provision 
applies to inpatient services in hospitals, mental hospitals, and 
intermediate care facilities (ICF's). Specific requirements are:
    (i) Under section 1903(g)(1)(A), a physician must certify at 
admission, and a physician (or physician assistant or nurse practitioner 
under the supervision of a physician) must periodically recertify, the 
individual's need for inpatient care.
    (ii) Under section 1903(g)(1)(B), services must be furnished under a 
plan established and periodically evaluated by a physician.
    (iii) Under section 1903(g)(1)(C), the State must have in effect a 
continuous program of review of utilization of care and services under 
section 1902(a)(30) whereby each admission is reviewed or screened in 
accordance with criteria established by medical and other professional 
personnel.
    (iv) Under section 1903(g)(1)(D), the State must have an effective 
program under sections 1902(a) (26) and (31) of review of care in 
intermediate care facilities and mental hospitals. This must include 
evaluation at least annually of the professional management of each 
case.
    (3) Medical review in mental hospitals. Section 1902(a)(26)(A) 
requires that the plan provide for a program of medical review that 
includes a medical evaluation of each individual's need for care in a 
mental hospital, a plan of care, and, where applicable, a plan of 
rehabilitation.
    (4) Independent professional review in intermediate care facilities. 
Section 1902(a)(31)(A) requires that the plan provide for a program of 
independent professional review that includes a medical evaluation of 
each individual's need for intermediate care and a written plan of 
service.
    (5) Inspection of care and services in institutions. Sections 
1902(a)(26) (B) and (C) and 1902(a)(31) (B) and (C) require that the 
plan provide for periodic inspections and reports, by a team of 
professional persons, of the care being provided to each recipient in 
institutions for mental diseases (IMD's), and ICF's participating in 
Medicaid.
    (6) Denial of FFP for failure to have specified utilization review 
procedures. Section 1903(i)(4) provides that FFP is not available in a 
State's expenditures for hospital or mental hospital services unless the 
institution has in effect a utilization review plan that meets Medicare 
requirements. However, the Secretary may waive this requirement if the 
Medicaid agency demonstrates to

[[Page 285]]

his satisfaction that it has utilization review procedures superior in 
effectiveness to the Medicare procedures.
    (7) State health agency guidance on quality and appropriateness of 
care and services. Section 1902(a)(33)(A) requires that the plan provide 
that the State health or other appropriate medical agency establish a 
plan for review, by professional health personnel, of the 
appropriateness and quality of Medicaid services to provide guidance to 
the Medicaid agency and the State licensing agency in administering the 
Medicaid program.
    (8) Drug use review program. Section 1927(g) of the Act provides 
that, for payment to be made under section 1903 of the Act for covered 
outpatient drugs, the State must have in operation, by not later than 
January 1, 1993, a drug use review (DUR) program. It also requires that 
each State provide, either directly or through a contract with a private 
organization, for the establishment of a DUR Board.

    (2) How the Administrator will determine whether reductions will be 
imposed; and

[[Page 307]]

    (3) How the required reductions will be implemented.
    (c) Scope. The reductions required by this subpart do not apply to--
    (1) Services provided under a contract with a health maintenance 
organization; or
    (2) Facilities in which a PRO is performing medical and utilization 
reviews under contract with the Medicaid agency in accordance with

[43 FR 45266, Sept. 29, 1978, as amended at 61 FR 38399, July 24, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 456.652  Requirements for an effective utilization control program.

    (a) General requirements. In order to avoid a reduction in FFP, the 
Medicaid agency must make a satisfactory showing to the Administrator, 
in each quarter, that it has met the following requirements for each 
recipient:
    (1) Certification and recertification of the need for inpatient 
care, as specified in Secs. 456.60, 456.160, 456.360 and 456.481.
    (2) A plan of care established and periodically reviewed and 
evaluated by a physician, as specified in Secs. 456.80, 456.180, and 
456.481.
    (3) A continuous program of utilization review under which the 
admission of each recipient is reviewed or screened in accordance with 
section 1903(g)(1)(C) of the Act; and
    (4) A regular program of reviews, including medical evaluations, and 
annual on-site reviews of the care of each recipient, as specified in 
Secs. 456.170, and 456.482 and subpart I of this part.
    (b) Annual on-site review requirements. (1) An agency meets the 
quarterly on-site review requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section for a quarter if it completes on-site reviews of each recipient 
in every facility in the State, and in every State-owned facility 
regardless of location, by the end of the quarter in which a review is 
required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) An on-site review is required in a facility by the end of a 
quarter if the facility entered the Medicaid program during the same 
calendar quarter 1 year earlier or has not been reviewed since the same 
calendar quarter 1 year earlier. If there is no Medicaid recipient in 
the facility on the day a review is scheduled, the review is not 
required until the next quarter in which there is a Medicaid recipient 
in the facility.
    (3) If a facility is not reviewed in the quarter in which it is 
required to be reviewed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it will 
continue to require a review in each subsequent quarter until the review 
is performed.
    (4) The requirement for an on-site review in a given quarter is not 
affected by the addition or deletion of a level of care in a facility's 
provider agreement.
    (c) Facilities without valid provider agreements. The requirements 
of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply with respect to 
recipients for whose care the agency intends to claim FFP even if the 
recipients receive care in a facility whose provider agreement has 
expired or been terminated.

FR 38399, July 24, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 456.653  Acceptable reasons for not meeting requirements for annual on-site review.

    The Administrator will find an agency's showing satisfactory, even 
if it failed to meet the annual review requirements of 
Sec. 456.652(a)(4), if--
    (a) The agency demonstrates that--
    (1) It completed reviews by the end of the quarter in at least 98 
percent of all facilities requiring review by the end of the quarter;

[[Page 308]]

    (2) It completed reviews by the end of the quarter in all facilities 
with 200 or more certified Medicaid beds requiring review by the end of 
the quarter; and
    (3) With respect to all unreviewed facilities, the agency exercised 
good faith and due diligence by attempting to review those facilities 
and would have succeeded but for events beyond its control which it 
could not have reasonably anticipated; or
    (b) The agency demonstrates that it failed to meet the standard in 
paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section by the close of the quarter 
for technical reasons, but met the standard within 30 days after the 
close of the quarter. Technical reasons are circumstances within the 
agency's control.
    (c) Facilities that are reviewed under paragraph (b) of this 
section, after the quarter in which they were due for review, retain 
their original anniversary quarter due date for purposes of subsequent 
reviews.


<R05>
Sec. 456.654  Requirements for content of showings and procedures for submittal.

    (a) An agency's showing for a quarter must--
    (1) Include a certification by the agency that the requirements of 
Sec. 456.652(a) (1) through (4) were met during the quarter for each 
level of care or, if applicable, a certification of the reasons the 
annual on-site review requirements of Sec. 456.652(a)(4) were not met in 
any facilities;
    (2) For all mental hospitals, intermediate care facilities, and 
facilities providing inpatient psychiatric services for individuals 
under 21, participating in Medicaid any time during the 12-month period 
ending on the last day of the quarter, list each facility by level of 
care, name, address and provider number;
    (3) For each facility entering or leaving the program during the 12-
month period ending on the last day of the quarter, list the beginning 
or ending dates of the provider agreement and supply a copy of the 
provider agreement;
    (4) If review has been contracted to a PRO under Sec. 431.630 of 
this chapter, list the date the PRO contracted for review.
    (5) List all dates of on-site reviews completed by review teams 
anytime during the 12-month period ending on the last day of the 
quarter;
    (6) For all facilities in which an on-site review was required but 
not conducted, list the facility by name, address and provider number;
    (7) For each on-site review in a mental hospital, intermediate care 
facility that primarily cares for mental patients, or inpatient 
psychiatric facility, list the name and qualifications of one team 
member who is a physician; and
    (8) For each on-site review in an intermediate care facility that 
does not primarily care for mental patients, list the name and 
qualifications of one team member who is either a physician or 
registered nurse.
    (b) The quarterly showing must be in the form prescribed by the 
Administrator.
    (c) The quarterly showing must be postmarked or received within 30 
days after the close of the quarter for which it is made, unless the 
agency demonstrates good cause for later submittal and the showing is 
postmarked or received within 45 days after the close of the quarter. 
Good cause means unanticipated circumstances beyond the agency's 
control.

<R05>
Sec. 456.655  Validation of showings.

    (a) The Administrator will periodically validate showings submitted 
under Sec. 456.654. Validation procedures will include on-site sample 
surveys of institutions and surveys at the Medicaid agencies.
    (b) The Administrator will not find an agency's showing satisfactory 
if the information obtained through his validation procedures 
demonstrates, that any of the requirements of Sec. 456.652(a) (1) 
through (4) were not met during the quarter for which the showing was 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 456.656  Reductions in FFP.

    (a) If the Administrator determines an agency's showing does not 
meet each of the requirements of this sub-part, he will give the agency 
30 days

[[Page 309]]

notice before making the required reduction.
    (b) If the Administrator determines that a showing for any quarter 
is unsatisfactory on its face, he will make the required reduction in 
the grant award based on the Quarterly Medicaid Statement of 
Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program for that quarter. (This 
form HCFA-64 is described in Sec. 430.30(c) of this chapter.)
    (c) If the Administrator finds a showing satisfactory on its face, 
but after validation determines the showing to be unsatisfactory, he 
will notify the agency of any required reduction in FFP no later than 
the first day of the fourth calendar quarter following the calendar 
quarter for which the showing was made. Any required reduction will be 
made by amending or adjusting the agency's grant award.
    (d) The agency may request reconsideration of a reduction in 
accordance with the procedures specified in 45 CFR part 16.


<R05>
Sec. 456.657  Computation of reductions in FFP.

    (a) For each level of care specified in a provider agreement, and 
for each quarter for which a satisfactory showing is not made, the 
amount of the reduction in FFP is computed as follows:
    (1) For each level of care, the number of recipients who received 
services in facilities that did not meet the requirements of this 
subpart is divided by the total number of recipients who received 
services in facilities for which a showing was required under this 
subpart. If any of the requirements specified in Sec. 456.652(a)(1) 
through (4) were not met for any recipient in a facility, the reduction 
will be computed on the total number of recipients in that facility at 
the level of care in question.
    (2) The fraction obtained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 
multiplied by one-third.
    (3) The product obtained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is 
multiplied by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP).
    (4) The product obtained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is 
multiplied by the agency payments for longstay services furnished during 
the quarter at that level of care.
    (b) If any of the data required to compute the amount of the 
reduction in FFP are unavailable, the Administrator will substitute an 
estimate. If the agency determines the exact data to the satisfaction of 
the Administrator, the estimate may later be adjusted. If the number of 
recipients in individual facilities is not available, the fraction 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be estimated, for 
each level of care, by dividing the number of facilities in which the 
requirements were not met by the total number of facilities for which a 
showing is required under this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 456.703  Drug use review program.

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, in order for FFP to be paid or made available under section 
1903 of the Act for covered outpatient drugs, the State must have in 
operation, by not later than January 1, 1993, a DUR program consisting 
of prospective drug review, retrospective drug use review, and an 
educational program that meets the requirements of this subpart. The 
goal of the State's DUR program must be to ensure appropriate drug 
therapy, while permitting sufficient professional prerogatives to allow 
for individualized drug therapy.
    (b) Exception for drugs dispensed to certain nursing facility 
residents. Prospective drug review and retrospective drug use review 
(including interventions and education) under the DUR program are not 
required for drugs dispensed to residents of nursing facilities that are 
in compliance with the drug regimen review procedures set forth in part 
483 of this chapter. This does not preclude the State agency from making 
such drugs subject to prospective DUR or retrospective DUR or both, 
provided the State agency makes the drugs subject to all the 
requirements of this subpart applicable to the respective review.
    (c) Exemption for certain covered outpatient drugs dispensed by 
hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
    (1) The State plan must provide that covered outpatient drugs 
dispensed by a hospital using drug formulary systems and billed to the 
plan at no more than the hospital's purchasing costs are not subject to 
the requirements of this subpart. Individual hospitals requesting this 
exemption must provide assurances to the State agency that they meet the 
requirements specified in section 1927(j)(2) of the Act.
    (2) The State plan must provide that covered outpatient drugs 
dispensed by health maintenance organizations are not subject to the 
requirements of this subpart.
    (d) Use of predetermined standards. A DUR program must assess drug 
use information against predetermined standards.
    (e) Source of predetermined standards. The predetermined standards 
must be--
    (1) Developed directly by the State or its contractor;
    (2) Obtained by the State through contracts with commercial vendors 
of DUR services;
    (3) Obtained by the State from independent organizations, such as 
the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, or entities receiving 
funding from the Public Health Service, HCFA, or State agencies; or
    (4) Any combination of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this 
section.
    (f) Requirements for predetermined standards. The predetermined 
standards used in the DUR program must meet the following requirements:
    (1) The source materials for their development are consistent with 
peer-reviewed medical literature (that is, scientific, medical, and 
pharmaceutical publications in which original manuscripts are published 
only after having been critically reviewed by unbiased independent 
experts) and the following compendia:
    (i) American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information;
    (ii) United States Pharmacopeia-Drug Information;

[[Page 311]]

    (iii) American Medical Association Drug Evaluations.
    (2) Differences between source materials were resolved by physicians 
and pharmacists developing consensus solutions. The consensus process 
means the reliance, by the criteria developers, on the expertise of 
physicians and pharmacists to evaluate differences in criteria source 
materials and to come to agreement on how differences should be 
resolved.
    (3) They are non-proprietary and readily available to providers of 
services. Systems and algorithms using the predetermined standards may 
remain proprietary.
    (4) They are clinically-based and scientifically valid.
    (5) The review based on clinical criteria uses predetermined 
standards to determine the population at risk of a clinically 
significant adverse medical result and applies standards, appropriate to 
this population, across providers and patients to determine the provider 
outliers whose prescribing, dispensing, or consumption practices may not 
conform to accepted standards of care. Various statistical measures 
(including mean, range, or other measures at the discretion of the 
State) may be applied to these data. Standards may be considered in 
deciding if an in-depth review is needed to determine whether to 
intervene once the potential therapeutic problems have been identified 
through the use of clinical criteria.
    (6) They have been tested against claims data prior to adoption in 
order to validate the level of possibly significant therapeutic problems 
without undue levels of false positives.
    (7) The predetermined standards for prospective and retrospective 
DUR are compatible.
    (8) They are subjected to ongoing evaluation and modification either 
as a result of actions by their developer or as a result of 
recommendations by the DUR Board.
    (g) Access to predetermined standards. Upon their adoption, 
predetermined standards must be available to the public. Pharmacists and 
physicians must be informed of the existence of predetermined standards 
and of how they can obtain copies of them.
    (h) Confidentiality of patient related data. In implementing the DUR 
program, the agency must establish, in regulations or through other 
means, policies concerning confidentiality of patient related data that 
are consistent with applicable Federal confidentiality requirements at 
part 431, subpart F of this chapter; the State Pharmacy Practice Act; 
and the guidelines adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy or other 
relevant licensing bodies.

Sec. 456.705  Prospective drug review.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Secs. 456.703 (b) and (c), the 
State plan must provide for a review of drug therapy before each 
prescription is filled or delivered to a recipient, and applicable State 
law (including State Board policy incorporated in the State law by 
reference) must establish standards for counseling of the recipient or 
the recipient's caregiver. The State must provide pharmacies with 
detailed information as to what they must do to comply with prospective 
DUR requirements, including guidelines on counseling, profiling, and 
documentation of prospective DUR activities by the pharmacists. The 
pharmacies, in turn, must provide this information to their pharmacists. 
This information is to be based on guidelines provided by this subpart 
and by other sources that the State may specify.
    (b) Point-of-sale or point-of-distribution review. Except as 
provided in Secs. 456.703 (b) and (c), the State plan must provide for 
point-of-sale or point-of-distribution review of drug therapy using 
predetermined standards before each prescription is filled or delivered 
to the recipient or the recipient's caregiver. The review must include 
screening to identify potential drug therapy problems of the following 
types:
    (1) Therapeutic duplication, that is, the prescribing and dispensing 
of two or more drugs from the same therapeutic class such that the 
combined daily dose puts the recipient at risk of an adverse medical 
result or incurs additional program costs without additional therapeutic 
benefit.

[[Page 312]]

    (2) Drug-disease contraindication, that is, the potential for, or 
the occurrence of--
    (i) An undesirable alteration of the therapeutic effect of a given 
drug because of the presence, in the patient for whom it is prescribed, 
of a disease condition; or
    (ii) An adverse effect of the drug on the patient's disease 
condition.
    (3) Adverse drug-drug interaction, that is, the potential for, or 
occurrence of, a clinically significant adverse medical effect as a 
result of the recipient using two or more drugs together.
    (4) Incorrect drug dosage, that is, the dosage lies outside the 
daily dosage specified in predetermined standards as necessary to 
achieve therapeutic benefit. Dosage is the strength multiplied by the 
quantity dispensed divided by day's supply.
    (5) Incorrect duration of drug treatment, that is, the number of 
days of prescribed therapy exceeds or falls short of the recommendations 
contained in the predetermined standards.
    (6) Drug-allergy interactions, that is, the significant potential 
for, or the occurrence of, an allergic reaction as a result of drug 
therapy.
    (7) Clinical abuse/misuse, that is, the occurrence of situations 
referred to in the definitions of abuse, gross overuse, overutilization, 
and underutilization, as defined in Sec. 456.702, and incorrect dosage 
and incorrect duration, as defined in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of 
this section, respectively.
    (c) Drug counseling. (1) As part of the prospective drug review 
program, standards for counseling by pharmacists of recipients or the 
recipients' caregivers must be established by State law or other method 
that is satisfactory to the State agency. A State agency's counseling 
standards must address special situations where the patient or the 
patient's representative, is not readily available to receive the offer 
to counsel or the actual counseling, for example, prescriptions 
delivered offsite or through the mail. The State agency, at a minimum, 
must also address the following issues in their counseling standards:
    (i) Whether the offer to counsel is required for new prescriptions 
only, or for both new and refill prescriptions;
    (ii) Whether pharmacists must make the offer to counsel or auxiliary 
personnel are authorized to make the offer;
    (iii) Whether only a patient's refusal of the offer to counsel must 
be documented, or whether documentation of all offers is required;
    (iv) Whether documentation of counseling is required; and
    (v) Whether counseling is required in situations where the patient's 
representative is not readily available to receive a counseling offer or 
the counseling itself.
    (2) The standards must meet the following requirements:
    (i) They must require pharmacists to offer to counsel (in person, 
whenever practicable, or through access to a telephone service that is 
toll-free for long-distance calls) each recipient or recipient's 
caregiver who presents a prescription. A pharmacist whose primary 
patient population is accessible through a local measured or toll-free 
exchange need not be required to offer toll-free service. Mail order 
pharmacies are required to provide toll-free telephone service for long 
distance calls.
    (ii) They need not require a pharmacist to provide consultation when 
a Medicaid recipient or the recipient's caregiver refuses that 
consultation.
    (iii) They must specify what documentation by the pharmacy of 
refusal of the offer of counseling is required.
    (3) The standards must specify that the counseling include those 
matters listed in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(viii) of this 
section that, in the exercise of his or her professional judgement 
(consistent with State law regarding the provision of such information), 
the pharmacist considers significant as well as other matters the 
pharmacist considers significant.
    (i) The name and description of the medication;
    (ii) The dosage form, dosage, route of administration, and duration 
of drug therapy;
    (iii) Special directions and precautions for preparation, 
administration, and use by the patient;
    (iv) Common severe side or adverse effects or interactions and 
therapeutic

[[Page 313]]

contraindications that may be encountered, including their avoidance, 
and the action required if they occur;
    (v) Techniques for self-monitoring drug therapy;
    (vi) Proper storage;
    (vii) Prescription refill information; and
    (viii) Action to be taken in the event of a missed dose.
    (d) Profiling. The State agency must require that, in the case of 
Medicaid recipients, the pharmacist make a reasonable effort to obtain, 
record, and maintain patient profiles containing, at a minimum, the 
information listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.
    (1) Name, address, telephone number, date of birth (or age), and 
gender of the patient;
    (2) Individual history, if significant, including disease state or 
states, known allergies and drug reactions, and a comprehensive list of 
medications and relevant devices; and
    (3) Pharmacist's comments relevant to the individual's drug therapy.

[57 FR 49408, Nov. 2, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 48824, Sept. 23, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 456.709  Retrospective drug use review.

    (a) General. The State plan must provide for a retrospective DUR 
program for ongoing periodic examination (no less frequently than 
quarterly) of claims data and other records in order to identify 
patterns of fraud, abuse, gross overuse, or inappropriate or medically 
unnecessary care among physicians, pharmacists, and Medicaid recipients, 
or associated with specific drugs or groups of drugs. This examination 
must involve pattern analysis, using predetermined standards, of 
physician prescribing practices, drug use by individual patients and, 
where appropriate, dispensing practices of pharmacies. This program must 
be provided through the State's mechanized drug claims processing and 
information retrieval systems approved by HCFA (that is, the Medicaid 
Management Information System (MMIS)) or an electronic drug claims 
processing system that is integrated with MMIS. States that do not have 
MMIS systems may use existing systems provided that the results of the 
examination of drug claims as described in this section are integrated 
within their existing system.
    (b) Use of predetermined standards. Retrospective DUR includes, but 
is not limited to, using predetermined standards to monitor for the 
following:
    (1) Therapeutic appropriateness, that is, drug prescribing and 
dispensing that is in conformity with the predetermined standards.
    (2) Overutilization and underutilization, as defined in 
Sec. 456.702.
    (3) Appropriate use of generic products, that is, use of such 
products in conformity with State product selection laws.
    (4) Therapeutic duplication as described in Sec. 456.705(b)(1).
    (5) Drug-disease contraindication as described in 
Sec. 456.705(b)(2).
    (6) Drug-drug interaction as described in Sec. 456.705(b)(3).
    (7) Incorrect drug dosage as described in Sec. 456.705(b)(4).
    (8) Incorrect duration of drug treatment as described in 
Sec. 456.705(b)(5).
    (9) Clinical abuse or misuse as described in Sec. 456.705(b)(7).


<R05>
Sec. 456.711  Educational program.

    The State plan must provide for ongoing educational outreach 
programs that, using DUR Board data on common drug therapy problems, 
educate practitioners on common drug therapy problems with the aim of 
improving prescribing and dispensing practices. The program may be 
established directly by the DUR Board or through contracts with 
accredited health care educational institutions, State medical societies 
or State pharmacists associations/societies, or other organizations. The 
program must include the interventions listed in paragraphs (a) through 
(d) of this section. The DUR Board determines the content of education 
regarding common therapy problems and the circumstances in which each of 
the interventions is to be used.
    (a) Dissemination of information to physicians and pharmacists in 
the State concerning the duties and powers of the DUR Board and the 
basis for the standards required by Sec. 456.705(c) for use in assessing 
drug use.

[[Page 314]]

    (b) Written, oral, or electronic reminders containing patient-
specific or drug-specific information (or both) and suggested changes in 
prescribing or dispensing practices. These reminders must be conveyed in 
a manner designed to ensure the privacy of patient-related information.
    (c) Face-to-face discussions, with follow up discussions when 
necessary, between health care professionals expert in appropriate drug 
therapy and selected prescribers and pharmacists who have been targeted 
for educational intervention on optimal prescribing, dispensing, or 
pharmacy care practices.
    (d) Intensified review or monitoring of selected prescribers or 
dispensers.


<R05>
Sec. 456.712  Annual report.

    (a) DUR Board report. The State must require the DUR Board to 
prepare and submit an annual DUR report to the Medicaid agency that 
contains information specified by the State.
    (b) Medicaid agency report. The Medicaid agency must prepare and 
submit, on an annual basis, a report to the Secretary that incorporates 
the DUR Board's report and includes the following information:
    (1) A description of the nature and scope of the prospective drug 
review program.
    (2) A description of how pharmacies performing prospective DUR 
without computers are expected to comply with the statutory requirement 
for written criteria.
    (3) Detailed information on the specific criteria and standards in 
use. After the first annual report, information regarding only new or 
changed criteria must be provided and deleted criteria must be 
identified.
    (4) A description of the steps taken by the State to include in the 
prospective and retrospective DUR program drugs dispensed to residents 
of a nursing facility that is not in compliance with the drug regimen 
review procedures set forth in part 483 of this chapter. After the first 
annual report, only changes must be reported.
    (5) A description of the actions taken by the State Medicaid agency 
and the DUR Board to ensure compliance with the requirements for 
predetermined standards at Sec. 456.703(f) and with the access to the 
predetermined standards requirement at Sec. 456.703(g). After the first 
annual report, only changes must be reported.
    (6) A description of the nature and scope of the retrospective DUR 
program.
    (7) A summary of the educational interventions used and an 
assessment of the effect of these educational interventions on the 
quality of care.
    (8) A description of the steps taken by the State Agency to monitor 
compliance by pharmacies with the prospective DUR counseling 
requirements contained in Federal and State laws and regulations. After 
the first annual report, only changes must be reported.
    (9) Clear statements of purpose that delineate the respective goals, 
objectives, and scopes of responsibility of the DUR and surveillance and 
utilization (SUR) functions. These statements must clarify the working 
relationships between DUR and SUR functions and other entities such as 
the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and State Board of Pharmacy. The annual 
report also must include a statement delineating how functional 
separation will be maintained between the fraud and abuse activities and 
the educational activities. After the first annual report, only changes 
must be reported.
    (10) An estimate of the cost savings generated as a result of the 
DUR program. This report must identify costs of DUR and savings to the 
Medicaid drug program attributable to prospective and retrospective DUR.


<R05>
Sec. 456.714  DUR/surveillance and utilization review relationship.

    (a) The retrospective DUR requirements in this subpart parallel a 
portion of the surveillance and utilization review (SUR) requirements in 
subpart A of this part and in part 455 of this chapter.
    (b) A State agency may direct DUR staffs to limit review activities 
to those that focus on what constitutes appropriate and medically 
necessary care to avoid duplication of activities relating to fraud and 
abuse under the SUR program.

outpatient drugs.
    (3) Drug use review, evaluation, and intervention.
    (4) Medical quality assurance.
    (b) Board composition. At least one-third but not more than 51 
percent of the DUR Board members must be physicians, and at least one-
third of the Board members must be pharmacists. These physicians and 
pharmacists must be actively practicing and licensed.
    (c) Medicaid agency/DUR Board relationship. The Medicaid agency is 
ultimately responsible for ensuring that the DUR program is operational 
and conforms with the requirements of this subpart. The agency has the 
authority to accept or reject the recommendations or decisions of the 
DUR Board.
    (d) DUR Board activities. The State agency must ensure that the 
operational tasks involved in carrying out the DUR Board activities set 
forth at section 1927(g)(3)(C) of the Act are assigned, limited only by 
the requirements of section 1927(g)(3)(C) of the Act, based on 
consideration of operational requirements and on where the necessary 
expertise resides. Except as limited by the requirements of section 
1927(g)(3)(C) of the Act, the State agency may alter the suggested 
working relationships set forth in this paragraph.
    (1) Application of predetermined standards: Board's activities. The 
DUR Board should perform the following activities:
    (i) Review and make recommendations on predetermined standards 
submitted to it by the Medicaid agency or the agency's contractor.
    (ii) Evaluate the use of the predetermined standards, including 
assessing the operational effect of the predetermined standards in use, 
and make recommendations to the Medicaid agency or the agency's 
contractor concerning modification or elimination of existing 
predetermined standards or the addition of new ones.

The Medicaid agency or its contractor should perform the following 
activities:
    (i) Submit predetermined standards to the DUR Board for its review 
and recommendations before the Medicaid agency applies them to drug 
claims data.
    (ii) If prospective DUR is conducted using an electronic claims 
management (ECM) system, apply software approved by the Board.
    (iii) If prospective DUR is not conducted through an ECM system, as 
part of general compliance monitoring, ensure that Medicaid 
participating pharmacies conduct prospective drug review that screens 
for the potential drug therapy problems listed in section 1927(g)(2)(A) 
of the Act.
    (3) Retrospective DUR: Board's activities. The DUR Board should 
perform the following activities:
    (i) Review and make recommendations on predetermined standards 
submitted to it by the Medicaid agency or the agency's contractor.
    (ii) Make recommendations to the Medicaid agency or the agency's 
contractor concerning modification or elimination of existing 
predetermined standards or the addition of new ones.
    (4) Retrospective DUR: Medicaid agency role. The Medicaid agency or 
its contractor should apply the predetermined standards to drug claims 
data in order to generate reports that identify patterns of fraud, 
abuse, gross overuse, or inappropriate or medically unnecessary care.
    (5) Education program (including interventions): Board's activities. 
The DUR Board must perform the following activities:
    (i) Identify and develop educational topics if education of 
practitioners on common drug therapy problems is

[[Page 316]]

needed to improve prescribing or dispensing practices.
    (ii) Make recommendations as to which mix of the interventions set 
forth in Secs. 456.711 (a) through (d) would most effectively lead to 
improvement in the quality of drug therapy. The DUR board 
recommendations must be based upon an in-depth review of the results of 
the application of predetermined standards against claims data reports, 
must be appropriate based upon program experience, and must match the 
educational program with the drug therapy problems identified.
    (iii) Periodically re-evaluate and, if necessary, modify the 
interventions.
    (6) Education program (including interventions): Medicaid agency's 
role. The Medicaid agency or its contractor should perform the following 
activities.
    (i) Apply predetermined standards to drug claims data to generate 
reports that provide the basis for retrospective education and 
interventions and furnish those reports to the Board.
    (ii) Carry out the educational programs and interventions specified 
by the Board.
    (e) Funding for the Board. FFP is available for expenses associated 
with the operation of the DUR Board in carrying out its 
responsibilities, and payment is made under procedures established in 
part 433 of this chapter as follows:
    (1) If the requirements for skilled professional medical personnel 
at Sec. 432.50 of this chapter are met, at the rate of 75 percent.

<R05>
Sec. 456.719  Funding for DUR program.

    FFP is available for sums that the Secretary determines are 
attributable to the Statewide adoption of a DUR program as described in 
this subpart, and payment is made under procedures established in part 
433 of this chapter as follows:
    (a) For funds expended by the State during calendar years 1991 
through 1993, at the rate of 75 percent.
    (b) For funds expended by the State after December 31, 1993, at the 
rate of 50 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 456.722  Electronic claims management system.

    (a) Point-of-sale system. Each Medicaid agency, at its option, may 
establish, as its principal (but not necessarily exclusive) means of 
processing claims for covered outpatient drugs, a point-of-sale 
electronic claims management (ECM) system to perform on-line, real-time 
(that is, immediate) eligibility verifications, claims data capture, 
adjudication of claims, and to assist pharmacists and other authorized 
persons (including dispensing physicians) in applying for and receiving 
payment. The State determines who must participate in an ECM system and 
who may decline to do so. If the State exercises this option and wishes 
to receive FFP for its ECM system, the system must meet the functional 
and additional procurement and system requirements in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section.
    (b) Functional requirements. The ECM system developed by the State 
must include at least the on-line, real-time capabilities specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The real-time requirement 
for prescriptions filled for nursing facilities and prescriptions filled 
by mail order dispensers may be waived by the State to permit claims to 
be processed in the batch mode at the end of the day or other time 
mutually agreed to by the nursing facility or mail order dispenser and 
Medicaid agency.
    (1) Eligibility verification, including identification of the 
following:
    (i) Third-party payers.
    (ii) Recipients in managed care programs.
    (iii) Recipients and providers in restricted service programs (for 
example, lock-in and lock-out).
    (iv) Properly enrolled providers.
    (2) Claims data capture, including the following:
    (i) Transfer of claims information from the pharmacy to the Medicaid 
agency or the Medicaid agency's contractor.
    (ii) Identification of prescriber.

[[Page 317]]

    (iii) Minimum data set (as defined in Part 11 of the State Medicaid 
Manual).
    (3) Claims adjudication, including the following:
    (i) Performing all edits and audits contained in the State's 
Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) applicable to prescription 
drugs.
    (ii) Notifying the pharmacist (or other authorized person, such as 
the dispensing physician) about the claim status.
    (iii) Taking steps up to, but not including, payment of the claim.
    (c) Additional requirements. In order to receive FFP for its ECM 
system, the State must meet the following requirements:
    (1) The ECM system must be acquired through applicable competitive 
procurement process in the State and must be the most cost-effective 
telecommunications network and automatic data processing services and 
equipment. The procurement must meet the procurement requirements set 
forth in 45 CFR part 74, subpart P, and appendix G-O of OMB circular A-
102. The request for proposal (RFP) may be substituted for the advance 
planning and implementation documents otherwise required by part 433 of 
this chapter, 45 CFR 95.205, and 45 CFR part 307. A cost-benefit 
analysis must accompany the RFP. If in its advance planning document, a 
State establishes that a separate procurement is not cost-effective, 
modification of an existing fiscal agent contract will be acceptable. In 
this case, procurement of network services and equipment (but not 
software modifications) must be competitively procured.
    (2) States wishing to do prospective DUR as part of their ECM must 
do the following:
    (i) Submit a cost benefit analysis showing the cost-effectiveness of 
such a system. A State's decisions as to who must participate in the ECM 
system and who may decline to do so must be included in the cost-benefit 
analysis.
    (ii) Establish a central State-wide electronic repository for 
capturing, storing, and updating data for all prescriptions dispensed 
and for providing access to such data by all authorized participants.
    (iii) Design the system to assess data for a review of drug therapy 
before each prescription is filled or delivered to a Medicaid recipient. 
The type of review conducted must meet the requirements for prospective 
drug review set forth in Sec. 456.705.
    (3) ECM is considered a subsystem and must be fully integrated with 
the remainder of the State's MMIS. In addition, information about ECM 
claims must be part of the single comprehensive utilization and 
management reporting system used by the DUR program.


<R05>
Sec. 456.725  Funding of ECM system.

    (a) For funds expended during calendar quarters in fiscal years 1991 
and 1992 and attributable to the design, development, and implementation 
of an on-line, real-time claims management system (that is, the most 
cost-effective telecommunications network and automatic data processing 
services and equipment) that meets the requirements of Sec. 456.722, FFP 
is available at a matching rate of 90 percent. After fiscal year 1992, 
ECM subsystems are funded at the standard applicable MMIS enhanced 
rates, subject to the requirements of part 433, subpart A of this 
chapter.
    (b) FFP is available at a matching rate of 75 percent for funds 
expended for the following:
    (1) Telecommunications equipment and other equipment to directly 
access MMIS files.
    (2) Telecommunications equipment (such as modems and point of sale 
terminals) furnished to providers.
    (3) Operational costs including telecommunications network costs, 
provided that the ECM system includes eligibility verification systems, 
electronic claims capture, claims adjudication (except for payment), and 
a claims data process that is integrated into a single comprehensive 
utilization and information reporting system.

<R05>
Sec. 466.70  Statutory bases and applicability.

    (a) Statutory basis. Sections 1154, 1866(a)(1)(F) and 1886(f)(2) of 
the Act require that a PRO review those services furnished by 
physicians, other health care professionals, providers and suppliers as 
specified in its contract with the Secretary. Section 1154(a)(4) of the 
Act requires PROs, or, in certain circumstances, non-PRO entities, to 
perform quality of care reviews of services furnished under risk-basis 
contracts by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and competitive 
medical plans (CMPs) that are covered under subpart C of part 417 of 
this chapter.
    (b) Applicability. The regulations in this subpart apply to review 
conducted by a PRO and its subcontractors. Section 466.72 of this part 
also applies, for purposes of quality of care reviews under section 
1154(a)(4) of the Act, to non-PRO entities that enter into contracts to 
perform reviews of services furnished under risk-basis contracts by HMOs 
and CMPs under subpart C of part 417 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 466.71  PRO review requirements.

    (a) Scope of PRO review. In its review, the PRO must determine (in 
accordance with the terms of its contract)--
    (1) Whether the services are or were reasonable and medically 
necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of illness or injury or to 
improve functioning of

[[Page 324]]

a malformed body member, or (with respect to pneumococcal vaccine) for 
prevention of illness or (in the case of hospice care) for the 
palliation and management of terminal illness;
    (2) Whether the quality of the services meets professionally 
recognized standards of health care;
    (3) Whether those services furnished or proposed to be furnished on 
an inpatient basis could, consistent with the provisions of appropriate 
medical care, be effectively furnished more economically on an 
outpatient basis or in an inpatient health care facility of a different 
type;
    (4) Through DRG validation, the validity of diagnostic and 
procedural information supplied by the hospital;
    (5) The completeness, adequacy and quality of hospital care 
provided;
    (6) The medical necessity, reasonableness and appropriateness of 
hospital admissions and discharges;
    (7) The medical necessity, reasonableness and appropriateness of 
inpatient hospital care for which additional payment is sought under the 
outlier provisions of Secs. 412.82 and 412.84 of this chapter; and
    (8) Whether a hospital has misrepresented admission or discharge 
information or has taken an action that results in--
    (i) The unnecessary admission of an individual entitled to benefits 
under part A;
    (ii) Unnecessary multiple admissions of an individual; or
    (iii) Other inappropriate medical or other practices with respect to 
beneficiaries or billing for services furnished to beneficiaries.
    (b) Payment determinations. On the basis of the review specified 
under paragraphs (a) (1), (3), (6), (7), and (8) of this section, the 
PRO must determine whether payment may be made for these services. A PRO 
may grant a period of not more than two days (grace days) for the 
purpose of arranging post discharge care when the provider did not know 
or could not reasonably be expected to have known that payment for the 
service(s) would not be made under the Medicare program as specified in 
Sec. 405.330(b).
    (c) Other duties and functions. (1) The PRO must review at least a 
random sample of hospital discharges each quarter and submit new 
diagnostic and procedural information to the Medicare fiscal 
intermediary or carrier if it determines that the information submitted 
by the hospital was incorrect.
    (2) As directed by HCFA, the PRO must review changes in DRG 
assignment made by the intermediary under the provisions of 
Sec. 412.60(d) that result in the assignment of a higher-weighted DRG. 
The PRO's review must verify that the diagnostic and procedural 
information supplied by the hospital is substantiated by the information 
in the medical record.
    (d) Coordination of sanction activities. The PRO must carry out the 
responsibilities specified in subpart C of part 1004 of this title 
regarding imposition of sanctions on providers and practitioners who 
violate their statutory obligations under section 1156 of the Act.

    (a) (1) For purposes of a review under section 1154(a)(4) of the 
Act, a PRO must determine whether the quality of services (including 
both inpatient and outpatient services) provided by an HMO or CMP meets 
professionally recognized standards of health care, including whether 
appropriate health care services have not been provided or have been 
provided in inappropriate settings.
    (2) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply with respect to 
a contract year if another entity has been awarded a contract to perform 
those reviews under section 1154(a)(4)(C) of the Act.
    (b) For purposes of reviews under this section, non-PRO entities 
selected to perform these reviews under section 1154(a)(4)(C) of the Act 
are subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
and--
    (1) Part 476 of this chapter regarding acquisition, protection, and 
disclosure of peer review information; and

dates of the PRO contract and specifies the area and types of health 
care facilities to be reviewed by the PRO. The PRO must make a similar 
notification when review responsibilities are subcontracted.
    (b) Notification to health care facilities and the public. As 
specified in its contract with HCFA, the PRO must--
    (1) Provide, to each health care facility scheduled to come under 
review, a timely written notice that specifies the date and manner in

furnished by the facility to each Medicare beneficiary upon admission as 
specified in Sec. 466.78(b)(3) of this part.
    (2) Publish, in at least one local newspaper of general circulation 
in the PRO area, a notice that states the date the PRO will assume

or carrier of its assumption of review in specific health care 
facilities no later than five working days after the day that review is 
assumed in the facility.
    (c) A PRO must maintain and make available for public inspection at 
its principal business office--
    (1) A copy of each agreement with Medicare fiscal intermediaries and

    (3) Copies of all subcontracts for the conduct of review.
    (d) A PRO must not subcontract with a facility to conduct any review 
activities except for the review of the quality of care. The PRO may 
subcontract with a non-facility organization to conduct review in a 
facility.
    (e) If required by HCFA, a PRO is responsible for compiling 
statistics based on the criteria contained in Sec. 405.332 of this 
chapter and making limitation of liability determinations on excluded 
coverage of certain services that are made under section 1879 of the 
Act. If required by HCFA, PROs must also notify a provider of these 
determinations. These determinations and further appeals are governed by 
the reconsideration and appeals procedures in part 405, subpart G of 
this chapter for Medicare Part A related determinations and part 405, 
subpart H of this chapter for Medicare Part B related determinations.
    (f) A PRO must make its responsibilities under its contract with 
HCFA, primary to all other interests and activities that the PRO 
undertakes.


<R05>
Sec. 466.76  Cooperation with health care facilities.

    Before implementation of review, a PRO must make a good faith effort 
to discuss the PRO's administrative and review procedures with each 
involved health care facility.


<R05>
Sec. 466.78  Responsibilities of health care facilities.

    (a) Every hospital seeking payment for services furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries must maintain a written agreement with a PRO 
operating in the area in which the hospital is located. These agreements 
must provide for the PRO review specified in Sec. 466.71.

[[Page 326]]

    (b) Cooperation with PROs. Health care facilities that submit 
Medicare claims must cooperate in the assumption and conduct of PRO 
review. Facilities must--
    (1) Allocate adequate space to the PRO for its conduct of review at 
the times the PRO is conducting review.
    (2) Provide patient care data and other pertinent data to the PRO at 
the time the PRO is collecting review information that is required for 
the PRO to make its determinations. The facility must photocopy and 
deliver to the PRO all required information within 30 days of a request. 
PROs pay hospitals paid under the prospective payment system for the 
costs of photocopying records requested by the PRO in accordance with 
the payment rate determined under the methodology described in paragraph 
(c) of this section and for first class postage for mailing the records 
to the PRO. When the PRO does post-admission, preprocedure review, the 
facility must provide the necessary information before the procedure is 
performed, unless it must be performed on an emergency basis.
    (3) Inform Medicare beneficiaries at the time of admission, in 
writing, that the care for which Medicare payment is sought will be 
subject to PRO review and indicate the potential outcomes of that 
review. Furnishing this information to the patient does not constitute 
notice, under Sec. 405.332(a) of this chapter, that can support a 
finding that the beneficiary knew the services were not covered.
    (4) When the facility has issued a written determination in 
accordance with Sec. 412.42(c)(3) of this chapter that a beneficiary no 
longer requries inpatient hospital care, it must submit a copy of its 
determination to the PRO within 3 working days.
    (5) Assure, in accordance with the provisions of its agreement with 
the PRO, that each case subject to preadmission review has been reviewed 
and approved by the PRO before admission to the hospital or a timely 
request has been made for PRO review.
    (6)(i) Agree to accept financial liability for any admission subject 
to preadmission review that was not reviewed by the PRO and is 
subsequently determined to be inappropriate or not medically necessary.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section do not 
apply if a facility, in accordance with its agreement with a PRO, makes 
a timely request for preadmission review and the PRO does not review the 
case timely. Cases of this type are subject to retrospective prepayment 
review under paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
    (7) Agree that, if the hospital admits a case subject to 
preadmission review without certification, the case must receive 
retrospective prepayment review, according to the review priority 
established by the PRO.
    (c) Photocopying reimbursement methodology for prospective payment 
system hospitals. Hospitals subject to the prospective payment system 
are paid for the photocopying costs that are directly attributable to 
the hospitals' responsibility to the PROs to provide photocopies of 
requested hospital records. The payment is in addition to payment 
already provided for these costs under other provisions of the Social 
Security Act and is based on a fixed amount per page as determined by 
HCFA as follows:
    (1) Step one. HCFA adds the annual salary of a photocopy machine 
operator and the costs of fringe benefits as determined in accordance 
with the principles set forth in OMB Circular A-76.
    (2) Step two. HCFA divides the amount determined in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section by the number of pages that can be reasonably expected 
to be made annually by the photocopy machine operator to establish the 
labor cost per page.
    (3) HCFA adds to the per-page labor cost determined in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section the per-page costs of supplies.
    (d) Appeals. Reimbursement for the costs of photocopying and mailing 
records for PRO review is an additional payment to hospitals under the 
prospective system, as specified in Sec. 412.115

[[Page 327]]

of this chapter. Thus, appeals concerning these costs are subject to the 
review process specified in part 405, subpart R of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 466.80  Coordination with Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers.

    (a) Procedures for agreements. The Medicare fiscal intermediary or 
carrier must have a written agreement with the PRO. The PRO must take 
the initiative with the fiscal intermediary or carrier in developing the 
agreement. The following steps must be taken in developing the 
agreement.
    (1) The PRO and the fiscal intermediary or carrier must negotiate in 
good faith in an effort to reach written agreement. If they cannot reach 
agreement, HCFA will assist them in resolving matters in dispute.
    (2) The PRO must incorporate its administrative procedures into an 
agreement with the fiscal intermediary or carrier and obtain approval 
from HCFA, before it makes conclusive determinations for the Medicare 
program, unless HCFA finds that the fiscal intermediary or carrier has--
    (i) Refused to negotiate in good faith or in a timely manner, or
    (ii) Insisted on including in the agreement, provisions that are 
outside the scope of its authority under the Act.
    (b) Content of agreement. The agreement must include procedures 
for--
    (1) Informing the appropriate Medicare fiscal intermediaries and 
carriers of--
    (i) Changes as a result of DRG validations and revisions as a result 
of the review of these changes; and
    (ii) Initial denial determinations and revisions of these 
determinations as a result of reconsideration, or reopening all 
approvals and denials with respect to cases subject to preadmission 
review, and outlier claims in hospitals under a prospective payment 
system for health care services and items;
    (2) Exchanging data or information;
    (3) Modifying the procedures when additional review responsibility 
is authorized by HCFA; and
    (4) Any other matters that are necessary for the coordination of 
functions.
    (c) Action by HCFA. (1) Within the time specified in its contract, 
the PRO must submit to HCFA for approval its agreement with the Medicare 
fiscal intermediaries and carriers, or if an agreement has not been 
established, the PRO's proposed administrative procedures, including any 
comments by the Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers.
    (2) If HCFA approves the agreement or the administrative procedures 
(after a finding by HCFA as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section), the PRO may begin to make determinations under its contract 
with HCFA.
    (3) If HCFA disapproves the agreement or procedures, it will--
    (i) Notify the PRO and the appropriate fiscal agents in writing, 
stating the reasons for disapproval; and
    (ii) Require the PRO and fiscal intermediary or carrier to revise 
its agreements or procedures.
    (d) Modification of agreements. Agreements or procedures may be 
modified, with HCFA's approval--
    (1) Through a revised agreement with the fiscal intermediary or 
carrier, or
    (2) In the case of procedures, by the PRO, after providing 
opportunity for comment by the fiscal intermediary or carrier.
    (e) Role of the fiscal intermediary. (1) The fiscal intermediary 
will not pay any claims for those cases which are subject to 
preadmission review by the PRO, until it receives notice that the PRO 
has approved the admission after preadmission or retrospective review.
    (2) A PRO's determination that an admission is medically necessary 
is not a guarantee of payment by the fiscal intermediary. Medicare 
coverage requirements must also be applied.

Sec. 466.82  Continuation of functions not assumed by PROs.

    Any of the duties and functions under Part B of Title XI of the Act 
for which a PRO has not assumed responsibility under its contract with 
HCFA must be

[[Page 328]]

performed in the manner and to the extent otherwise provided for under 
the Act or in regulations.

                          PRO Review Functions


<R05>
Sec. 466.83  Initial denial determinations.

    A determination by a PRO that the health care services furnished or 
proposed to be furnished to a patient are not medically necessary, are 
not reasonable, or are not at the appropriate level of care, is an 
initial denial determination and is appealable under part 473 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 466.84  Changes as a result of DRG validation.

    A provider or practitioner may obtain a review by a PRO under part 
473 of this chapter for changes in diagnostic and procedural coding that 
resulted in a change in DRG assignment as a result of PRO validation 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 466.85  Conclusive effect of PRO initial denial determinations and changes as a result of DRG validations.

    A PRO initial denial determination or change as a result of DRG 
validation is final and binding unless, in accordance with the 
procedures in part 473--
    (a) The initial denial determination is reconsidered and revised; or
    (b) The change as a result of DRG validation is reviewed and 
revised.


<R05>
Sec. 466.86  Correlation of Title XI functions with Title XVIII functions.

    (a) Payment determinations. (1) PRO initial denial determinations 
under this part with regard to the reasonableness, medical necessity, 
and appropriateness of placement at an acute level of patient care as 
are also conclusive for payment purposes with regard to the following 
medical issues:
    (i) Whether inpatient care furnished in a psychiatric hospital meets 
the requirements of Sec. 424.14 of this chapter.
    (ii) Whether payment for inpatient hospital or SNF care beyond 20 
consecutive days is precluded under Sec. 489.50 of this chapter because 
of failure to perform review of long-stay cases.
    (iii) Whether the care furnished was custodial care or care not 
reasonable and necessary and, as such, excluded under Sec. 405.310(g) or 
Sec. 405.310(k) of this chapter.
    (iv) Whether the care was appropriately furnished in the inpatient 
or outpatient setting.
    (2) Reviews with respect to determinations listed in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section must not be conducted, for purposes of payment, 
by Medicare fiscal intermediaries or carriers except as outlined in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) PROs make determinations as to the appropriateness of the 
location in which procedures are performed. A procedure may be medically 
necessary but denied if the PRO determines that it could, consistent 
with the provision of appropriate medical care, be effectively provided 
more economically on an outpatient basis or in an inpatient health care 
facility of a different type.
    (4) PRO determinations as to whether the provider and the 
beneficiary knew or could reasonably be expected to have known that the 
services described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section were excluded are 
also conclusive for payment purposes.
    (b) Utilization review activities. PRO review activities to 
determine whether inpatient hospital or SNF care services are reasonable 
and medically necessary and are furnished at the appropriate level of 
care fulfill the utilization review requirements set forth in 
Secs. 405.1035, 405.1042, and 405.1137 of this chapter.
    (c) Coverage. Nothing in paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section 
will be construed as precluding HCFA or a Medicare fiscal intermediary 
or carrier, in the proper exercise of its duties and functions, from 
reviewing claims to determine:
    (1) In the case of items or services not reviewed by a PRO, whether 
they meet coverage requirements of Title XVIII relating to medical 
necessity, reasonableness, or appropriateness of placement at an acute 
level of patient care. However, if a coverage determination pertains to 
medical necessity, reasonableness, or appropriateness of placement at an 
acute level of patient care, the fiscal intermediary or carrier

[[Page 329]]

must use a PRO to make a determination on those issues if a PRO is 
conducting review in the area and must abide by the PRO's determination.
    (2) Whether any claim meets coverage requirements of Title XVIII 
relating to issues other than medical necessity, reasonableness or 
appropriateness of placement at an acute level of patient care.
    (d) Payment. Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers are not 
precluded from making payment determinations with regard to coverage 
determinations made under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Survey, compliance and assistance activities. PRO review and 
monitoring activities fulfill the requirements for compliance and 
assistance activities of State survey agencies under section 1864(a) 
with respect to sections 1861(e)(6), 1861(j)(8), 1861(j)(12), and 
1861(k) of the Act, and activities required of intermediaries and 
carriers under Secs. 421.100(d) and 421.200(f) of this chapter.
    (f) Appeals. The requirements and procedures for PRO review of 
changes as a result of DRG validation and the reconsideration, hearing 
and judicial review of PRO initial denial determinations are set forth 
in part 473 of this chapter.

[50 FR 15330, Apr. 17, 1985; 50 FR 41886, Oct. 16, 1985, as amended at 
53 FR 6648, Mar. 2, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 466.88  Examination of the operations and records of health care facilities and practitioners.

    (a) Authorization to examine records. A facility claiming Medicare 
payment must permit a PRO or its subcontractor to examine its operation 
and records (including information on charges) that are pertinent to 
health care services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries and are 
necessary for the PRO or its subcontractor to--
    (1) Perform review functions including, but not limited to--
    (i) DRG validation;
    (ii) Outlier review in facilities under a prospective payment 
system; and
    (iii) Implementation of corrective action and fraud and abuse 
prevention activities;
    (2) Evaluate cases that have been identified as deviating from the 
PRO norms and criteria, or standards; and
    (3) Evaluate the capability of the facility to perform quality 
review functions under a subcontract with the PRO.
    (b) Limitations on access to records. A PRO has access to the 
records of non-Medicare patients if--
    (1) The records relate to review performed under a non-Medicare PRO 
contract and if authorized by those patients in accordance with State 
law; or
    (2) The PRO needs the records to perform its quality review 
responsibilities under the Act and receives authorization from the 
facility or practitioner.
    (c) Conditions of examination. When examining a facility's operation 
or records the PRO must--
    (1) Examine only those operations and records (including information 
on charges) required to fulfill the purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (2) Cooperate with agencies responsible for other examination 
functions under Federal or Federally assisted programs in order to 
minimize duplication of effort;
    (3) Conduct the examinations during reasonable hours; and
    (4) Maintain in its principal office written records of the results 
of the examination of the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 466.90  Lack of cooperation by a health care facility or practitioner.

    (a) If a health care facility or practitioner refuses to allow a PRO 
to enter and perform the duties and functions required under its 
contract with HCFA, the PRO may--
    (1) Determine that the health care facility or practitioner has 
failed to comply with the requirements of Sec. 474.30(c) of this chapter 
and report the matter to the HHS Inspector General; or
    (2) Issue initial denial determinations for those claims it is 
unable to review, make the determination that financial liability will 
be assigned to the health care facility, and report the matter to the 
HHS Inspector General.
    (b) If a PRO provides a facility with sufficient notice and a 
reasonable amount of time to respond to a request for information about 
a claim, and if

[[Page 330]]

the facility does not respond in a timely manner, the PRO will deny the 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 466.93  Opportunity to discuss proposed initial denial determination and changes as a result of a DRG validation.

    Before a PRO reaches an initial denial determination or makes a 
change as a result of a DRG validation, it must--
    (a) Promptly notify the provider or supplier and the patient's 
attending physician (or other attending health care practitioner) of the 
proposed determination or DRG change; and
    (b) Afford an opportunity for the provider or supplier and the 
physician (or other attending health care practitioner) to discuss the 
matter with the PRO physician advisor and to explain the nature of the 
patient's need for health care services, including all factors which 
preclude treatment of the patient as an outpatient or in an alternative 
level of inpatient care.


<R05>
Sec. 466.94  Notice of PRO initial denial determination and changes as a result of a DRG validation.

    (a) Notice of initial denial determination--(1) Parties to be 
notified. A PRO must provide written notice of an initial denial 
determination to--
    (i) The patient, or if the patient is expected to be unable to 
comprehend the notice, the patient's next of kin, guardian or other 
representative or sponsor;
    (ii) The attending physician, or other attending health care 
practitioner;
    (iii) The facility; and
    (iv) The fiscal intermediary or carrier.
    (2) Timing of the notice. The notice must be delivered to 
beneficiaries in the facility or mailed to those no longer in the 
facility, within the following time periods--
    (i) For admission, on the first working day after the initial denial 
determination;
    (ii) For continued stay (e.g., outliers in facilities under a 
prospective payment system), by the first working day after the initial 
denial determination if the beneficiary is still in the facility, and 
within 3 working days if the beneficiary has been discharged;
    (iii) For preprocedure review, before the procedure is performed;
    (iv) For preadmission review, before admission;
    (v) If identification as a Medicare program patient has been 
delayed, within three working days of identification;
    (vi) For retrospective review, (excluding DRG validation and post 
procedure review), within 3 working days of the initial denial 
determination; and
    (vii) For post-procedure review, within 3 working days of the 
initial denial determination.
    (3) Preadmission review. In the case of preadmission review, the PRO 
must document that the patient and the facility received notice of the 
initial denial determination.
    (b) Notice of changes as a result of a DRG validation. The PRO must 
notify the provider and practitioner of changes to procedural and 
diagnostic information that result in a change of DRG assignment, within 
30 days of the PRO's decision.
    (c) Content of the notice. The notice must be understandable and 
written in plain English and must contain--
    (1) The reason for the initial denial determination or change as a 
result of the DRG validation;
    (2) For day outliers in hospitals, the date on which the stay or 
services in the facility will not be approved as being reasonable and 
medically necessary or appropriate to the patients' health care needs;
    (3) A statement informing each party or his or her representative of 
the right to request in accordance with the provisions of part 473, 
subpart B of this chapter--
    (i) Review of a change resulting from DRG validation; or
    (ii) Reconsideration of the initial denial determination;
    (4) The locations for filing a request for reconsideration or review 
and the time period within which a request must be filed;
    (5) A statement about who is liable for payment of the denied 
services under section 1879 of the Act; and
    (6) A statement concerning the duties and functions of the PRO under 
the Act.

[[Page 331]]

    (d) Notice to payers. The PRO must provide prompt written notice of 
an initial denial determination or changes as a result of a DRG 
validation to the Medicare fiscal intermediary or carrier within the 
same time periods as the notices to the other parties.
    (e) Record of initial denial determination and changes as a result 
of a DRG validation. (1) The PRO must document and preserve a record of 
all initial denial determinations and changes as a result of DRG 
validations for six years from the date the services in question were 
provided.
    (2) The documentary record must include--
    (i) The detailed basis for the initial denial determination or 
changes as a result of a DRG validation; and
    (ii) A copy of the determination or change in DRG notices sent to 
all parties and identification of each party and the date on which the 
notice was mailed or delivered.


<R05>
Sec. 466.96  Review period and reopening of initial denial determinations and changes as a result of DRG validations.

    (a) General timeframe. A PRO or its subcontractor--
    (1) Within one year of the date of the claim containing the service 
in question, may review and deny payment; and
    (2) Within one year of the date of its decision, may reopen an 
initial denial determination or a change as a result of a DRG 
validation.
    (b) Extended timeframes. (1) An initial denial determination or 
change as a result of a DRG validation may be made after one year but 
within four years of the date of the claim containing the service in 
question, if HCFA approves.
    (2) A reopening of an initial denial determination or change as a 
result of a DRG validation may be made after one year but within four 
years of the date of the PRO's decision if--
    (i) Additional information is received on the patient's condition;
    (ii) Reviewer error occurred in interpretation or application of 
Medicare coverage policy or review criteria;
    (iii) There is an error apparent on the face of the evidence upon 
which the initial denial or DRG validation was based; or
    (iv) There is a clerical error in the statement of the initial 
denial determination or change as a result of a DRG validation.
    (c) Fraud and abuse. (1) A PRO or its subcontractor may review and 
deny payment anytime there is a finding that the claim for service 
involves fraud or a similar abusive practice that does not support a 
finding of fraud.
    (2) An initial denial determination or change as a result of a DRG 
validation may be reopened and revised anytime there is a finding that 
it was obtained through fraud or a similar abusive practice that does 
not support a finding of fraud.


<R05>
Sec. 466.98  Reviewer qualifications and participation.

    (a) Peer review by physician. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, each person who makes an initial denial 
determination about services furnished or proposed to be furnished by a 
licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathy or by a doctor of dentistry 
must be respectively another licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathy 
or of dentistry with active staff privileges in one or more hospitals in 
the PRO area.
    (2) If a PRO determines that peers are not available to make initial 
denial determinations, a doctor of medicine or osteopathy may make 
denial determinations for services ordered or performed by a doctor in 
any of the three specialties.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, individuals 
authorized to practice medicine in American Samoa, the Northern Mariana 
Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands as ``medical 
officers'' may make determinations on care ordered or furnished by their 
peers but not on care ordered or furnished by licensed doctors of 
medicine or osteopathy.
    (b) Peer review by health care practitioners other than physicians. 
Health care practitioners other than physicians may review services 
furnished by other practitioners in the same professional field.
    (c) DRG validation review. Decisions about procedural and diagnostic 
information must be made by physicians.

[[Page 332]]

Technical coding issues must be reviewed by individuals with training 
and experience in ICD-9-CM coding.
    (d) Persons excluded from review. (1) A person may not review health 
care services or make initial denial determinations or changes as a 
result of DRG validations if he or she, or a member of his or her 
family--
    (i) Participated in developing or executing the beneficiary's 
treatment plan;
    (ii) Is a member of the beneficiary's family; or
    (iii) Is a governing body member, officer, partner, 5 percent or 
more owner, or managing employee in the health care facility where the 
services were or are to be furnished.
    (2) A member of a reviewer's family is a spouse (other than a spouse 
who is legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate 
maintenance), child (including a legally adopted child), grandchild, 
parent, or grandparent.


<R05>
Sec. 466.100  Use of norms and criteria.

    (a) Use of norms. As specified in its contract, a PRO must use 
national, or where appropriate, regional norms in conducting review to 
achieve PRO contract objectives. However, with regard to determining the 
number of procedures selected for preadmission review, a PRO must use 
national admission norms.
    (b) Use of criteria. In assessing the need for and appropriateness 
of an inpatient health care facility stay, a PRO must apply criteria to 
determine--
    (1) The necessity for facility admission and continued stay (in 
cases of day outliers in hospitals under prospective payment);
    (2) The necessity for surgery and other invasive diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures; or
    (3) The appropriateness of providing services at a particular health 
care facility or at a particular level of care. The PRO must determine 
whether the beneficiary requires the level of care received or whether a 
lower and less costly level of care would be equally effective.
    (c) Establishment of criteria and standards. For the conduct of 
review a PRO must--
    (1) Establish written criteria based upon typical patterns of 
practice in the PRO area, or use national criteria where appropriate; 
and
    (2) Establish written criteria and standards to be used in 
conducting quality review studies.
    (d) Variant criteria and standards. A PRO may establish specific 
criteria and standards to be applied to certain locations and facilities 
in the PRO area if the PRO determines that--
    (1) The patterns of practice in those locations and facilities are 
substantially different from patterns in the remainder of the PRO area; 
and
    (2) There is a reasonable basis for the difference which makes the 
variation appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 466.102  Involvement of health care practitioners other than physicians.

    (a) Basic requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, a PRO must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Consult with the peers of the practitioners who furnish the 
services under review if the PRO reviews care and services delivered by 
health care practitioners other than physicians.
    (2) Assure that in determinations regarding medical necessity of 
services or the quality of the services they furnish, these 
practitioners are involved in--
    (i) Developing PRO criteria and standards;
    (ii) Selecting norms to be used; and
    (iii) Developing review mechanisms for care furnished by their 
peers.
    (3) Ensure that an initial denial determination or a change as a 
result of DRG validation of services provided by a health care 
practitioner other than a physician is made by a physician only after 
consultation with a peer of that practitioner. Initial denial 
determinations and changes as a result of DRG validations must be made 
only by a physician or dentist.
    (b) Exception. The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do 
not apply if--
    (1) The PRO has been unable to obtain a roster of peer practitioners 
available to perform review; or
    (2) The practitioners are precluded from performing review because 
they

[[Page 333]]

participated in the treatment of the patient, the patient is a relative, 
or the practitioners have a financial interest in the health care 
facility as described in Sec. 466.98(d).
    (c) Peer involvement in quality review studies. Practitioners must 
be involved in the design of quality review studies, development of 
criteria, and actual conduct of studies involving their peers.
    (d) Consultation with practitioners other than physicians. To the 
extent practicable, a PRO must consult with nurses and other 
professional health care practitioners (other than physicians defined in 
1861(r) (1) and (2) of the Act) and with representatives of 
institutional and noninstitutional providers and suppliers with respect 
to the PRO's responsibility for review.

[50 FR 15330, Apr. 17, 1985; 50 FR 41886, Oct. 16, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 466.104  Coordination of activities.

    In order to achieve efficient and economical review, a PRO must 
coordinate its activities (including information exchanges) with the 
activities of--

<R05>
Sec. 473.10  Scope.

    This subpart establishes the requirements and procedures for--
    (a) Reconsiderations conducted by a Utilization and Quality Control 
Peer Review Organization (PRO) or its subcontractor of initial denial 
determinations concerning services furnished or proposed to be furnished 
under Medicare;
    (b) Hearings and judicial review of reconsidered determinations; and
    (c) PRO review of a change in diagnostic and procedural coding 
information.

[50 FR 15372, Apr. 17, 1985; 50 FR 41887, Oct. 16, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 473.12  Statutory basis.

    (a) Under section 1154 of the Act, a PRO may make an initial 
determination that services furnished or proposed to be furnished are 
not reasonable, necessary, or delivered in the most appropriate setting.
    (b) Under section 1155 of the Act, the following rules apply:

[[Page 334]]

    (1) A Medicare beneficiary, a provider, or an attending practitioner 
who is dissatisfied with an initial denial determination under paragraph 
(a) of this section is entitled to a reconsideration by the PRO that 
made that determination.
    (2) The beneficiary is also entitled to the following:
    (i) A hearing by an administrative law judge if $200 or more is 
still in controversy after a reconsidered determination.
    (ii) Judicial review if $2000 or more is still in controversy after 
a final determination by the Department.
    (c) Under section 1866(a)(1)(F) of the Act, a hospital that is 
reimbursed by the Medicare program must maintain an agreement with a PRO 
under which the PRO reviews the validity of diagnostic information 
furnished by the hospital.

<R05>
Sec. 473.14  Applicability.

    (a) Basic provision. This subpart applies to reconsiderations and 
hearings of a PRO initial denial determination involving the following 
issues:
    (1) Reasonableness of services.
    (2) Medical necessity of services.
    (3) Appropriateness of the inpatient setting in which services were 
furnished or are proposed to be furnished.
    (b) Concurrent appeal. A reconsideration or hearing provided under 
this subpart fulfills the requirements of any other review, hearing, or 
appeal under the Act to which a party may be entitled with respect to 
the same issues.
    (c) Nonapplicability of rules to related determinations. (1) A PRO 
may not reconsider its decision whether to grant grace days.
    (2) Limitation of liability determinations on excluded coverage of 
certain services are made under section 1879 of the Act. Initial 
determinations under section 1879 and further appeals are governed by 
the reconsideration and appeal procedures in part 405, subpart G of this 
chapter for determinations under Medicare Part A, and part 405, subpart 
H of this chapter for determinations under Medicare Part B. References 
in those subparts to initial and reconsidered determinations made by an 
intermediary, carrier or HCFA should be read to mean initial and 
reconsidered determinations made by a PRO.

<R05>
Sec. 473.15  PRO review of changes resulting from DRG validation.

    (a) General rules. (1) A provider or practitioner dissatisfied with 
a change to the diagnostic or procedural coding information made by a 
PRO as a result of DRG validation under section 1866(a)(1)(F) of the Act 
is entitled to a review of that change if--
    (i) The change caused an assignment of a different DRG; and
    (ii) Resulted in a lower payment.
    (2) A beneficiary may obtain a review of a PRO DRG coding change 
only if that change results in noncoverage of a furnished service.
    (3) The individual who reviews changes in DRG procedural or 
diagnostic information must be a physician, and the individual who 
reviews changes in DRG coding must be qualified through training and 
experience with ICD-9-CM coding.
    (b) Procedures. Procedures described in Secs. 473.18 through 473.36, 
and 473.48 (a) and (c) for a PRO reconsideration or reopening also apply 
to PRO review of a DRG coding change.
    (c) Finality of review. No additional review or appeal for matters 
governed by paragraph (a) of this section is available.

the PRO that made the initial denial determination.


<R05>
Sec. 473.18  Location for submitting requests for reconsideration.

    (a) Beneficiaries. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section concerning requests for expedited reconsideration, a beneficiary

    (c) Expedited reconsideration. A request for an expedited 
reconsideration of a preadmission denial determination must be submitted 
directly to the PRO.


<R05>
Sec. 473.20  Time limits for requesting reconsideration.

    (a) Basic rules. (1) Except for a request for expedited 
reconsideration as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or a late

file a request for reconsideration within 60 days after receipt of the 
notice of an initial determination.
    (2) The date of receipt of the notice of the initial determination 
is presumed to be five days after the date on the notice, unless there 
is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
    (3) A request is considered filed on the date it is postmarked.
    (b) Late filing of request. A PRO will accept a request filed after

good cause for the party's failure to file a timely request.
    (c) Request for expedited reconsideration. A request for an 
expedited reconsideration under Sec. 473.18(c) must be submitted within 
three days after receipt of the notice of the initial denial 
determination.


<R05>
Sec. 473.22  Good cause for late filing of a request for a reconsideration or hearing.

    (a) General Rule. In determining whether a party has good cause for 
not filing a request for reconsideration or hearing timely, the PRO or 
ALJ, respectively, must consider the following:
    (1) What circumstances kept the party from making the request on 
time.
    (2) Whether an action by the PRO misled the party.
    (3) Whether the party understood the requirements of the Act as 
affected by amendments to the Act, other legislation, or court 
decisions.
    (b) Examples. Examples of circumstances in which good cause may 
exist include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) A party was seriously ill and was prevented from requesting a 
reconsideration in person, through another person, or in writing.
    (2) There was a death or serious illness in a party's immediate 
family.
    (3) Important records were accidentally destoryed or damaged by fire 
or other cause.
    (4) A party made a diligent effort but could not find or obtain 
necessary relevent information within the appropriate time period.
    (5) A party requested additional information to further explain the 
determination within the time limit, and requested reconsideration 
within 60 days of receiving the explanation (or within 30 days for a 
Departmental Appeals Board hearing).
    (6) The PRO gave the party incorrect or incomplete information about 
when and how to request a reconsideration or hearing.
    (7) A party sent the request to another Government agency in good 
faith within the time limit, but the request did not reach an office 
authorized to receive the request until after the time period had 
expired.
    (8) Other unusual or unavoidable circumstances exist that--
    (i) Show that a party could not have known of the need to file 
timely; or
    (ii) Prevented a party from filing timely.

the hearing and the PRO that the PRO reconsidered determination is 
conclusive for Medicare payment purposes.

review of an Departmental Appeals Board decision, or an ALJ hearing 
decision if a request for review by the Departmental Appeals Board was 
denied, by filing a civil action under the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure within 60 days after the date the party received notice of the 
Departmental Appeals Board decision or denial.

its own motion or at the request of a party, within one year from the 
date of the reconsidered determination or review.
    (2) Extension of time limit. A PRO or PRO subcontractor may reopen 
and revise its reconsidered determination, or its review of a DRG change

a review of a DRG change, or a decision of an ALJ or the Departmental 
Appeals Board may be reopened and revised at any time, if the 
reconsidered determination, review, or decision was obtained through

have and implement written protocols that:
    (1) Incorporate an agreement with an OPO designated under part 486 
of this chapter, under which it must notify, in a timely manner, the OPO 
or a third party designated by the OPO of individuals whose death is 
imminent or who have died in the hospital. The OPO determines medical 
suitability for organ donation and, in the absence of alternative 
arrangements by the hospital, the OPO determines medical suitability for 
tissue and eye donation, using the definition of potential tissue and 
eye donor and the notification protocol developed in consultation with 
the tissue and eye banks identified by the hospital for this purpose;
    (2) Incorporate an agreement with at least one tissue bank and at 
least one eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, processing, 
preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and eyes, as may be 
appropriate to assure that all usable tissues and eyes are obtained from 
potential donors, insofar as such an agreement does not interfere with 
organ procurement;
    (3) Ensure, in collaboration with the designated OPO, that the 
family of each potential donor is informed of its options to donate 
organs, tissues, or eyes or to decline to donate. The individual 
designated by the hospital to initiate the request to the family must be 
an organ procurement representative or a designated requestor. A 
designated requestor is an individual who has completed a course offered 
or approved by the OPO and designed in conjunction with the tissue and 
eye bank community in the methodology for approaching potential donor 
families and requesting organ or tissue donation;
    (4) Encourage discretion and sensitivity with respect to the 
circumstances, views, and beliefs of the families of potential donors;
    (5) Ensure that the hospital works cooperatively with the designated 
OPO, tissue bank and eye bank in educating staff on donation issues, 
reviewing death records to improve identification of potential donors, 
and maintaining potential donors while necessary testing and placement 
of potential donated organs, tissues, and eyes take place.
    (b) Standard: Organ transplantation responsibilities. (1) A hospital 
in which organ transplants are performed must be a member of the Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) established and operated 
in accordance with section 372 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act

means those rules provided for in regulations issued by the Secretary in 
accordance with section 372 of the PHS Act which are enforceable under 
42 CFR 121.10. No hospital is considered to be out of compliance with 
section 1138(a)(1)(B) of the Act, or with the requirements of this 
paragraph, unless the Secretary has given the OPTN formal notice that he 
or she approves the decision to exclude the hospital from the OPTN and 
has notified the hospital in writing.
    (2) For purposes of these standards, the term ``organ'' means a 
human kidney, liver, heart, lung, or pancreas.
    (3) If a hospital performs any type of transplants, it must provide 
organ-transplant-related data, as requested by the OPTN, the Scientific 
Registry, and the OPOs. The hospital must also provide such data 
directly to the Department when requested by the Secretary.

Sec. 482.66  Special requirements for hospital providers of long-term care services (``swing-beds'').

    A hospital that has a Medicare provider agreement must meet the 
following requirements in order to be granted an approval from HCFA to 
provide post-hospital extended care services, as specified in 
Sec. 409.30 of this chapter, and be reimbursed as a swing-bed hospital, 
as specified in Sec. 413.114 of this chapter:
    (a) Eligibility. A hospital must meet the following eligibility 
requirements:
    (1) The facility has fewer than 100 hospital beds, excluding beds 
for newborns and beds in intensive care type inpatient units (for 
eligibility of hospitals with distinct parts electing the optional 
reimbursement method, see Sec. 413.24(d)(5) of this chapter).
    (2) The hospital is located in a rural area. This includes all areas 
not delineated as ``urbanized'' areas by the Census Bureau, based on the 
most recent census.
    (3) When required by State in which it is located, the hospital has 
been granted a certificate of need for the provision of long-term care 
services from the State health planning and development agency 
(designated under section 1521 of the Public Health Service Act).
    (4) The hospital does not have in effect a 24-hour nursing waiver 
granted under Sec. 488.54(c) of this chapter.
    (5) The hospital has not had a swing-bed approval terminated within 
the two years previous to application.
    (6) A hospital with more than 49 beds (but fewer than 100) approved 
under this section after March 31, 1988, must--
    (i) Unless a Medicare-participating SNF is not available or the SNFs 
are not willing to enter into an agreement when one is offered, have an 
availability agreement with each SNF in its geographic region that 
requires the SNF to notify the hospital of the availability of 
posthospital SNF care beds and the dates when those beds will be 
available; and
    (ii) Transfer the extended care patient within 5 days (excluding 
weekends and holidays) after learning that a SNF bed is available or in 
the case of prospective notification by the SNF, within 5 days of the 
date the bed becomes available, unless the patient's physician 
certifies, as required under Sec. 424.20, that the transfer is not 
medically appropriate.
    (7) The hospital must provide written assurance to HCFA that the 
hospital will not operate over 49 or over 99 beds except in connection 
with a catastrophic event. The hospital bed count is determined as 
follows:
    (i) A hospital bed count is calculated by excluding from the count, 
beds that because of their special nature, such as newborn and intensive 
care beds, would not be available for swing-bed use. Also excluded from 
the bed count are beds in separately certified ``distinct part'' SNFs 
and NFs and beds in a psychiatric or rehabilitation unit that is 
excluded from the prospective payment system.
    (ii) A hospital licensed for more than 49 or 99 beds, is considered 
to have the number of beds that it consistently utilizes and staffs. 
Hospitals, at a minimum, document their count by staffing schedules and 
census information for the previous 12 months before application to be a 
swing-bed hospital.
    (b) Skilled nursing facility services. The facility is substantially 
in compliance with the following skilled nursing facility requirements 
contained in subpart B of part 483 of this chapter.

          Subpart B--Requirements for Long Term Care Facilities

    Source: 54 FR 5359, Feb. 2, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 483.1  Basis and scope.

    (a) Statutory basis. (1) Sections 1819 (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the 
Act provide that--
    (i) Skilled nursing facilities participating in Medicare must meet 
certain specified requirements; and
    (ii) The Secretary may impose additional requirements (see section 
1819(d)(4)(B)) if they are necessary for the health and safety of 
individuals to whom services are furnished in the facilities.
    (2) Section 1861(l) of the Act requires the facility to have in 
effect a transfer agreement with a hospital.
    (3) Sections 1919 (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Act provide that 
nursing facilities participating in Medicaid must meet certain specific 
requirements.
    (b) Scope. The provisions of this part contain the requirements that 
an institution must meet in order to qualify to participate as a SNF in 
the Medicare program, and as a nursing facility in the Medicaid program. 
They serve as the basis for survey activities for the purpose of 
determining whether a facility meets the requirements for participation 
in Medicare and Medicaid.

[56 FR 48867, Sept. 26, 1991, as amended at 57 FR 43924, Sept. 23, 1992; 
60 FR 50443, Sept. 29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 483.5  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart--
    Facility means, a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or a nursing 
facility (NF) which meets the requirements of sections 1819 or 1919 (a), 
(b), (c), and (d) of the Act. ``Facility'' may include a distinct part 
of an institution specified in Sec. 440.40 of this chapter, but does not 
include an institution for the mentally retarded or persons with related 
conditions described in Sec. 440.150 of this chapter. For Medicare and 
Medicaid purposes (including eligibility, coverage, certification, and 
payment), the ``facility'' is always the entity which participates in 
the program, whether that entity is comprised of all of, or a distinct 
part of a larger institution. For Medicare, a SNF (see section 
1819(a)(1)), and for Medicaid, a NF (see section 1919(a)(1)) may not be 
an institution for mental diseases as defined in Sec. 435.1009.

[56 FR 48867, Sept. 26, 1991, as amended at 57 FR 43924, Sept. 23, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 483.10  Resident rights.

    The resident has a right to a dignified existence, self-
determination, and communication with and access to persons and services 
inside and outside the facility. A facility must protect and promote the 
rights of each resident, including each of the following rights:
    (a) Exercise of rights. (1) The resident has the right to exercise 
his or her rights as a resident of the facility and as a citizen or 
resident of the United States.
    (2) The resident has the right to be free of interference, coercion, 
discrimination, and reprisal from the facility in exercising his or her 
rights.
    (3) In the case of a resident adjudged incompetent under the laws of 
a State by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rights of the resident 
are exercised by the person appointed under State law to act on the 
resident's behalf.
    (4) In the case of a resident who has not been adjudged incompetent 
by the State court, any legal-surrogate designated in accordance with 
State law may exercise the resident's rights to the extent provided by 
State law.
    (b) Notice of rights and services. (1) The facility must inform the 
resident both orally and in writing in a language that the resident 
understands of his or her rights and all rules and regulations governing 
resident conduct and responsibilities during the stay in the facility. 
The facility must also provide the resident with the notice (if any) of 
the State developed under section 1919(e)(6) of the Act. Such 
notification must be made prior to or upon admission and during the 
resident's stay. Receipt of such information, and any amendments to it, 
must be acknowledged in writing;
    (2) The resident or his or her legal representative has the right--

[[Page 372]]

    (i) Upon an oral or written request, to access all records 
pertaining to himself or herself including current clinical records 
within 24 hours (excluding weekends and holidays); and
    (ii) After receipt of his or her records for inspection, to purchase 
at a cost not to exceed the community standard photocopies of the 
records or any portions of them upon request and 2 working days advance 
notice to the facility.
    (3) The resident has the right to be fully informed in language that 
he or she can understand of his or her total health status, including 
but not limited to, his or her medical condition;
    (4) The resident has the right to refuse treatment, to refuse to 
participate in experimental research, and to formulate an advance 
directive as specified in paragraph (8) of this section; and
    (5) The facility must--
    (i) Inform each resident who is entitled to Medicaid benefits, in 
writing, at the time of admission to the nursing facility or, when the 
resident becomes eligible for Medicaid of--
    (A) The items and services that are included in nursing facility 
services under the State plan and for which the resident may not be 
charged;
    (B) Those other items and services that the facility offers and for 
which the resident may be charged, and the amount of charges for those 
services; and
    (ii) Inform each resident when changes are made to the items and 
services specified in paragraphs (5)(i) (A) and (B) of this section.
    (6) The facility must inform each resident before, or at the time of 
admission, and periodically during the resident's stay, of services 
available in the facility and of charges for those services, including 
any charges for services not covered under Medicare or by the facility's 
per diem rate.
    (7) The facility must furnish a written description of legal rights 
which includes--
    (i) A description of the manner of protecting personal funds, under 
paragraph (c) of this section;
    (ii) A description of the requirements and procedures for 
establishing eligibility for Medicaid, including the right to request an 
assessment under section 1924(c) which determines the extent of a 
couple's non-exempt resources at the time of institutionalization and 
attributes to the community spouse an equitable share of resources which 
cannot be considered available for payment toward the cost of the 
institutionalized spouse's medical care in his or her process of 
spending down to Medicaid eligibility levels;
    (iii) A posting of names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all 
pertinent State client advocacy groups such as the State survey and 
certification agency, the State licensure office, the State ombudsman 
program, the protection and advocacy network, and the Medicaid fraud 
control unit; and
    (iv) A statement that the resident may file a complaint with the 
State survey and certification agency concerning resident abuse, 
neglect, misappropriation of resident property in the facility, and non-
compliance with the advance directives requirements.
    (8) The facility must comply with the requirements specified in 
subpart I of part 489 of this chapter relating to maintaining written 
policies and procedures regarding advance directives. These requirements 
include provisions to inform and provide written information to all 
adult residents concerning the right to accept or refuse medical or 
surgical treatment and, at the individual's option, formulate an advance 
directive. This includes a written description of the facility's 
policies to implement advance directives and applicable State law. 
Facilities are permitted to contract with other entities to furnish this 
information but are still legally responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements of this section are met. If an adult individual is 
incapacitated at the time of admission and is unable to receive 
information (due to the incapacitating condition or a mental disorder) 
or articulate whether or not he or she has executed an advance 
directive, the facility may give advance directive information to the 
individual's family or surrogate in the same manner that it issues other 
materials about policies and procedures to the family of the 
incapacitated individual or to a surrogate or other concerned persons in 
accordance with State law. The facility is not relieved

[[Page 373]]

of its obligation to provide this information to the individual once he 
or she is no longer incapacitated or unable to receive such information. 
Follow-up procedures must be in place to provide the information to the 
individual directly at the appropriate time.
    (9) The facility must inform each resident of the name, specialty, 
and way of contacting the physician responsible for his or her care.
    (10) The facility must prominently display in the facility written 
information, and provide to residents and applicants for admission oral 
and written information about how to apply for and use Medicare and 
Medicaid benefits, and how to receive refunds for previous payments 
covered by such benefits.
    (11) Notification of changes. (i) A facility must immediately inform 
the resident; consult with the resident's physician; and if known, 
notify the resident's legal respresentative or an interested family 
member when there is--
    (A) An accident involving the resident which results in injury and 
has the potential for requiring physician intervention;
    (B) A significant change in the resident's physical, mental, or 
psychosocial status (i.e., a deterioration in health, mental, or 
psychosocial status in either life-threatening conditions or clinical 
complications);
    (C) A need to alter treatment significantly (i.e., a need to 
discontinue an existing form of treatment due to adverse consequences, 
or to commence a new form of treatment); or
    (D) A decision to transfer or discharge the resident from the 
facility as specified in Sec. 483.12(a).
    (ii) The facility must also promptly notify the resident and, if 
known, the resident's legal representative or interested family member 
when there is--
    (A) A change in room or roommate assignment as specified in 
Sec. 483.15(e)(2); or
    (B) A change in resident rights under Federal or State law or 
regulations as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iii) The facility must record and periodically update the address 
and phone number of the resident's legal representative or interested 
family member.
    (c) Protection of resident funds. (1) The resident has the right to 
manage his or her financial affairs, and the facility may not require 
residents to deposit their personal funds with the facility.
    (2) Management of personal funds. Upon written authorization of a 
resident, the facility must hold, safeguard, manage, and account for the 
personal funds of the resident deposited with the facility, as specified 
in paragraphs (c)(3)-(8) of this section.
    (3) Deposit of funds. (i) Funds in excess of $50. The facility must 
deposit any residents' personal funds in excess of $50 in an interest 
bearing account (or accounts) that is separate from any of the 
facility's operating accounts, and that credits all interest earned on 
resident's funds to that account. (In pooled accounts, there must be a 
separate accounting for each resident's share.)
    (ii) Funds less than $50. The facility must maintain a resident's 
personal funds that do not exceed $50 in a non-interest bearing account, 
interest-bearing account, or petty cash fund.
    (4) Accounting and records. The facility must establish and maintain 
a system that assures a full and complete and separate accounting, 
according to generally accepted accounting principles, of each 
resident's personal funds entrusted to the facility on the resident's 
behalf.
    (i) The system must preclude any commingling of resident funds with 
facility funds or with the funds of any person other than another 
resident.
    (ii) The individual financial record must be available through 
quarterly statements and on request to the resident or his or her legal 
representative.
    (5) Notice of certain balances. The facility must notify each 
resident that receives Medicaid benefits--
    (i) When the amount in the resident's account reaches $200 less than 
the SSI resource limit for one person, specified in section 
1611(a)(3)(B) of the Act; and
    (ii) That, if the amount in the account, in addition to the value of 
the resident's other nonexempt resources, reaches the SSI resource limit 
for one person, the resident may lose eligibility for Medicaid or SSI.
    (6) Conveyance upon death. Upon the death of a resident with a 
personal

[[Page 374]]

fund deposited with the facility, the facility must convey within 30 
days the resident's funds, and a final accounting of those funds, to the 
individual or probate jurisdiction administering the resident's estate.
    (7) Assurance of financial security. The facility must purchase a 
surety bond, or otherwise provide assurance satisfactory to the 
Secretary, to assure the security of all personal funds of residents 
deposited with the facility.
    (8) Limitation on charges to personal funds. The facility may not 
impose a charge against the personal funds of a resident for any item or 
service for which payment is made under Medicaid or Medicare (except for 
applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts). The facility may charge 
the resident for requested services that are more expensive than or in 
excess of covered services in accordance with Sec. 489.32 of this 
chapter. (This does not affect the prohibition on facility charges for 
items and services for which Medicaid has paid. See Sec. 447.15, which 
limits participation in the Medicaid program to providers who accept, as 
payment in full, Medicaid payment plus any deductible, coinsurance, or 
copayment required by the plan to be paid by the individual.)
    (i) Services included in Medicare or Medicaid payment. During the 
course of a covered Medicare or Medicaid stay, facilities may not charge 
a resident for the following categories of items and services:
    (A) Nursing services as required at Sec. 483.30 of this subpart.

charge, and if payment is not made by Medicare or Medicaid:
    (A) Telephone.
    (B) Television/radio for personal use.

resident may have, including those with respect to the behavior of other 
residents.
    (g) Examination of survey results. A resident has the right to--
    (1) Examine the results of the most recent survey of the facility

    (ii) A resident of a NF from the distinct part of the institution 
that is a NF to a distinct part of the institution that is a SNF.
    (2) A resident's exercise of the right to refuse transfer under

each resident to remain in the facility, and not transfer or discharge 
the resident from the facility unless--
    (i) The transfer or discharge is necessary for the resident's

    (5) Registry verification. Before allowing an individual to serve as 
a nurse aide, a facility must receive registry verification that the 
individual has met competency evaluation requirements unless--
    (i) The individual is a full-time employee in a training and 
competency evaluation program approved by the State; or
    (ii) The individual can prove that he or she has recently 
successfully completed a training and competency evaluation program or 
competency evaluation program approved by the State and has not yet been 
included in the registry. Facilities must follow up to ensure that such 
an individual actually becomes registered.
    (6) Multi-State registry verification. Before allowing an individual 
to serve as a nurse aide, a facility must seek information from every 
State registry established under sections 1819(e)(2)(A) or 1919(e)(2)(A) 
of the Act the facility believes will include information on the 
individual.
    (7) Required retraining. If, since an individual's most recent 
completion of a training and competency evaluation program, there has 
been a continuous period of 24 consecutive months during none of which 
the individual provided nursing or nursing-related services for monetary 
compensation, the individual must complete a new training and competency 
evaluation program or a new competency evaluation program.
    (8) Regular in-service education. The facility must complete a 
performance review of every nurse aide at least once every 12 months, 
and must provide regular in-service education based on the outcome of 
these reviews. The in-service training must--
    (i) Be sufficient to ensure the continuing competence of nurse 
aides, but must be no less than 12 hours per year;
    (ii) Address areas of weakness as determined in nurse aides' 
performance reviews and may address the special needs of residents as 
determined by the facility staff; and
    (iii) For nurse aides providing services to individuals with 
cognitive impairments, also address the care of the cognitively 
impaired.
    (f) Proficiency of Nurse aides. The facility must ensure that nurse 
aides are able to demonstrate competency in skills and techniques 
necessary to care for residents' needs, as identified through resident 
assessments, and described in the plan of care.

time, part-time or consultant basis those professionals necessary to 
carry out the provisions of these requirements.
    (2) Professional staff must be licensed, certified, or registered in 
accordance with applicable State laws.
    (h) Use of outside resources. (1) If the facility does not employ a 
qualified professional person to furnish a specific service to be 
provided by the facility, the facility must have that service furnished 
to residents by a person or agency outside the facility under an 
arrangement described in section 1861(w)

Subpart C--Preadmission Screening and Annual Review of Mentally Ill and 
                      Mentally Retarded Individuals

    Source: 57 FR 56506, Nov. 30, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 483.100  Basis.

    The requirements of Secs. 483.100 through 483.138 governing the 
State's responsibility for preadmission screening and annual resident 
review (PASARR) of individuals with mental illness and mental 
retardation are based on section 1919(e)(7) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 483.102  Applicability and definitions.

    (a) This subpart applies to the screening or reviewing of all 
individuals with mental illness or mental retardation who apply to or 
reside in Medicaid certified NFs regardless of the source of payment for 
the NF services, and regardless of the individual's or resident's known 
diagnoses.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subpart--
    (1) An individual is considered to have a serious mental illness 
(MI) if the individual meets the following requirements on diagnosis, 
level of impairment and duration of illness:
    (i) Diagnosis. The individual has a major mental disorder 
diagnosable under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 3rd edition, revised in 1987.
    Incorporation of the 1987 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, was approved by the Director of 
the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 
51 that govern the use of incorporation by reference.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is 
available for inspection at the Health Care Financing Administration, 
room 132, East High Rise Building, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, 
Maryland, or at the Office of the Federal Register, suite 700, 800 North 
Capitol St. NW., Washington, DC. Copies may be obtained from the 
American Psychiatric Association, Division of Publications and 
Marketing, 1400 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This mental disorder is--
    (A) A schizophrenic, mood, paranoid, panic or other severe anxiety 
disorder; somatoform disorder; personality disorder; other psychotic 
disorder; or another mental disorder that may lead to a chronic 
disability; but
    (B) Not a primary diagnosis of dementia, including Alzheimer's 
disease or a related disorder, or a non-primary diagnosis of dementia 
unless the primary diagnosis is a major mental disorder as defined in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
    (ii) Level of impairment. The disorder results in functional 
limitations in major life activities within the past 3 to 6 months that 
would be appropriate for the individual's developmental stage. An 
individual typically has at least one of the following characteristics 
on a continuing or intermittent basis:
    (A) Interpersonal functioning. The individual has serious difficulty 
interacting appropriately and communicating effectively with other 
persons, has a possible history of altercations, evictions, firing, fear 
of strangers, avoidance of interpersonal relationships and social 
isolation;
    (B) Concentration, persistence, and pace. The individual has serious 
difficulty in sustaining focused attention for a long enough period to 
permit the completion of tasks commonly found in work settings or in 
work-like structured activities occurring in school or home settings, 
manifests difficulties in concentration, inability to complete simple 
tasks within an established time period, makes frequent errors, or 
requires assistance in the completion of these tasks; and
    (C) Adaptation to change. The individual has serious difficulty in 
adapting to typical changes in circumstances associated with work, 
school, family, or social interaction, manifests agitation, exacerbated 
signs and symptoms associated with the illness, or withdrawal

[[Page 395]]

from the situation, or requires intervention by the mental health or 
judicial system.
    (iii) Recent treatment. The treatment history indicates that the 
individual has experienced at least one of the following:
    (A) Psychiatric treatment more intensive than outpatient care more 
than once in the past 2 years (e.g., partial hospitalization or 
inpatient hospitalization); or
    (B) Within the last 2 years, due to the mental disorder, experienced 
an episode of significant disruption to the normal living situation, for 
which supportive services were required to maintain functioning at home, 
or in a residential treatment environment, or which resulted in 
intervention by housing or law enforcement officials.
    (2) An individual is considered to have dementia if he or she has a 
primary diagnosis of dementia, as described in the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised in 1987, or 
a non-primary diagnosis of dementia unless the primary diagnosis is a 
major mental disorder as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section.
    (3) An individual is considered to have mental retardation (MR) if 
he or she has--
    (i) A level of retardation (mild, moderate, severe or profound) 
described in the American Association on Mental Retardation's Manual on 
Classification in Mental Retardation (1983). Incorporation by reference 
of the 1983 edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation's 
Manual on Classification in Mental Retardation was approved by the 
Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 
1 CFR part 51 that govern the use of incorporations by reference;\2\ or

chapter.

[57 FR 56506, Nov. 30, 1992; 58 FR 25784, Apr. 28, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 483.104  State plan requirement.

    As a condition of approval of the State plan, the State must operate 
a preadmission screening and annual resident review program that meets 
the requirements of Secs. 483.100 through 438.138.


<R05>
Sec. 483.106  Basic rule.

    (a) Requirement. The State PASARR program must require--(1) 
Preadmission screening of all individuals with mental illness or mental 
retardation who apply as new admissions to Medicaid NFs on or after 
January 1, 1989;
    (2) Initial review, by April 1, 1990, of all current residents with 
mental retardation or mental illness who entered Medicaid NFs prior to 
January 1, 1989; and
    (3) At least annual review, as of April 1, 1990, of all residents 
with mental illness or mental retardation, regardless of whether they 
were first screened under the preadmission screening or annual resident 
review requirements.
    (b) Admissions, readmissions and interfacility transfers--(1) New 
admission. An individual is a new admission if he or she is admitted to 
any NF for the first time or does not qualify as a readmission. With the 
exception of certain hospital discharges described in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, new admissions are subject to preadmission screening.
    (2) Exempted hospital discharge. (i) An exempted hospital discharge 
means an individual--
    (A) Who is admitted to any NF directly from a hospital after 
receiving acute inpatient care at the hospital;
    (B) Who requires NF services for the condition for which he or she 
received care in the hospital; and
    (C) Whose attending physician has certified before admission to the 
facility that the individual is likely to require less than 30 days 
nursing facility services.
    (ii) If an individual who enters a NF as an exempted hospital 
discharge is later found to require more than 30 days of NF care, the 
State mental

[[Page 396]]

health or mental retardation authority must conduct an annual resident 
review within 40 calendar days of admission.
    (3) Readmissions. An individual is a readmission if he or she was 
readmitted to a facility from a hospital to which he or she was 
transferred for the purpose of receiving care. Readmissions are subject 
to annual resident review rather than preadmission screening.
    (4) Interfacility transfers--(i) An interfacility transfer occurs 
when an individual is transferred from one NF to another NF, with or 
without an intervening hospital stay. Interfacility transfers are 
subject to annual resident review rather than preadmission screening.
    (ii) In cases of transfer of a resident with MI or MR from a NF to a 
hospital or to another NF, the transferring NF is responsible for 
ensuring that copies of the resident's most recent PASARR and resident 
assessment reports accompany the transferring resident.
    (c) Purpose. The preadmission screening and annual resident review 
process must result in determinations based on a physical and mental 
evaluation of each individual with mental illness or mental retardation, 
that are described in Secs. 483.112 and 483.114.
    (d) Responsibility for evaluations and determinations. The PASARR 
determinations of whether an individual requires the level of services 
provided by a NF and whether specialized services are needed--
    (1) For individuals with mental illness, must be made by the State 
mental health authority and be based on an independent physical and 
mental evaluation performed by a person or entity other than the State 
mental health authority; and
    (2) For individuals with mental retardation, must be made by the 
State mental retardation or developmental disabilities authority.
    (e) Delegation of responsibility--(1) The State mental health and 
mental retardation authorities may delegate by subcontract or otherwise 
the evaluation and determination functions for which they are 
responsible to another entity only if--
    (i) The State mental health and mental retardation authorities 
retain ultimate control and responsibility for the performance of their 
statutory obligations;
    (ii) The two determinations as to the need for NF services and for 
specialized services are made, based on a consistent analysis of the 
data; and
    (iii) The entity to which the delegation is made is not a NF or an 
entity that has a direct or indirect affiliation or relationship with a 
NF.
    (2) The State mental retardation authority has responsibility for 
both the evaluation and determination functions for individuals with MR 
whereas the State mental health authority has responsibility only for 
the determination function.
    (3) The evaluation of individuals with MI cannot be delegated by the 
State mental health authority because it does not have responsibility 
for this function. The evaluation function must be performed by a person 
or entity other than the State mental health authority. In designating 
an independent person or entity to perform MI evaluations, the State 
must not use a NF or an entity that has a direct or indirect affiliation 
or relationship with a NF.

[57 FR 56506, Nov. 30, 1992; 58 FR 25784, Apr. 28, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 483.108  Relationship of PASARR to other Medicaid processes.

    (a) PASARR determinations made by the State mental health or mental 
retardation authorities cannot be countermanded by the State Medicaid 
agency, either in the claims process or through other utilization 
control/review processes or by the State survey and certification 
agency. Only appeals determinations made through the system specified in 
subpart E of this part may overturn a PASARR determination made by the 
State mental health or mental retardation authorities.
    (b) In making their determinations, however, the State mental health 
and mental retardation authorities must not use criteria relating to the 
need for NF care or specialized services that are inconsistent with this 
regulation and any supplementary criteria adopted by the State Medicaid 
agency under its approved State plan.

[[Page 397]]

    (c) To the maximum extent practicable, in order to avoid duplicative 
testing and effort, the PASARR must be coordinated with the routine 
resident assessments required by Sec. 483.20(b).


<R05>
Sec. 483.110  Out-of-State arrangements.

    (a) Basic rule. The State in which the individual is a State 
resident (or would be a State resident at the time he or she becomes 
eligible for Medicaid), as defined in Sec. 435.403 of this chapter, must 
pay for the PASARR and make the required determinations, in accordance 
with Sec. 431.52(b).
    (b) Agreements. A State may include arrangements for PASARR in its 
provider agreements with out-of-State facilities or reciprocal 
interstate agreements.

[57 FR 56506, Nov. 30, 1992; 58 FR 25784, Apr. 28, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 483.112  Preadmission screening of applicants for admission to NFs.

    (a) Determination of need for NF services. For each NF applicant 
with MI or MR, the State mental health or mental retardation authority 
(as appropriate) must determine, in accordance with Sec. 483.130, 
whether, because of the resident's physical and mental condition, the 
individual requires the level of services provided by a NF.
    (b) Determination of need for specialized services. If the 
individual with mental illness or mental retardation is determined to 
require a NF level of care, the State mental health or mental 
retardation authority (as appropriate) must also determine, in 
accordance with Sec. 483.130, whether the individual requires 
specialized services for the mental illness or mental retardation, as 
defined in Sec. 483.120.
    (c) Timeliness--(1) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section, a preadmission screening determination must be made in writing 
within an annual average of 7 to 9 working days of referral of the 
individual with MI or MR by whatever agent performs the Level I 
identification, under Sec. 483.128(a) of this part, to the State mental 
health or mental retardation authority for screening. (See 
Sec. 483.128(a) for discussion of Level I evaluation.)
    (2) The State may convey determinations verbally to nursing 
facilities and the individual and confirm them in writing.
    (3) The State may compute separate annual averages for the mentally 
ill and the mentally retarded/developmentally disabled populations.
    (4) The Secretary may grant an exception to the timeliness standard 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section when the State--
    (i) Exceeds the annual average; and
    (ii) Provides justification satisfactory to the Secretary that a 
longer time period was necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 483.114  Annual review of NF residents.

    (a) Individuals with mental illness. For each resident of a NF who 
has mental illness, the State mental health authority must determine in 
accordance with Sec. 483.130 whether, because of the resident's physical 
and mental condition, the resident requires--
    (1) The level of services provided by--
    (i) A NF;
    (ii) An inpatient psychiatric hospital for individuals under age 21, 
as described in section 1905(h) of the Act; or
    (iii) An institution for mental diseases providing medical 
assistance to individuals age 65 or older; and
    (2) Specialized services for mental illness, as defined in 
Sec. 483.120.
    (b) Individuals with mental retardation. For each resident of a NF 
who has mental retardation, the State mental retardation or 
developmental disability authority must determine in accordance with 
Sec. 483.130 whether, because of his or her physical or mental 
condition, the resident requires--
    (1) The level of services provided by a NF or an intermediate care 
facility for the mentally retarded; and
    (2) Specialized services for mental retardation as defined in 
Sec. 483.120.
    (c) Frequency of review--(1) A review and determination must be 
conducted for each resident of a Medicaid NF who has mental illness or 
mental retardation not less often than annually.
    (2) ``Annually'' is defined as occurring within every fourth quarter 
after the previous preadmission screen or annual resident review.
    (d) April 1, 1990 deadline for initial reviews. The first set of 
annual reviews on residents who entered the NF prior

[[Page 398]]

to January 1, 1989, must be completed by April 1, 1990.


<R05>
Sec. 483.116  Residents and applicants determined to require NF level of services.

    (a) Individuals needing NF services. If the State mental health or 
mental retardation authority determines that a resident or applicant for 
admission to a NF requires a NF level of services, the NF may admit or 
retain the individual.
    (b) Individuals needing NF services and specialized services. If the 
State mental health or mental retardation authority determines that a 
resident or applicant for admission requires both a NF level of services 
and specialized services for the mental illness or mental retardation--
    (1) The NF may admit or retain the individual; and
    (2) The State must provide or arrange for the provision of the 
specialized services needed by the individual while he or she resides in 
the NF.


<R05>
Sec. 483.118  Residents and applicants determined not to require NF level of services.

    (a) Applicants who do not require NF services. If the State mental 
health or mental retardation authority determines that an applicant for 
admission to a NF does not require NF services, the applicant cannot be 
admitted. NF services are not a covered Medicaid service for that 
individual, and further screening is not required.
    (b) Residents who require neither NF services nor specialized 
services for MI or MR. If the State mental health or mental retardation 
authority determines that a resident requires neither the level of 
services provided by a NF nor specialized services for MI or MR, 
regardless of the length of stay in the facility, the State must--
    (1) Arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from 
the facility in accordance with Sec. 483.12(a); and
    (2) Prepare and orient the resident for discharge.
    (c) Residents who do not require NF services but require specialized 
services for MI or MR--(1) Long term residents. Except as otherwise may 
be provided in an alternative disposition plan adopted under section 
1919(e)(7)(E) of the Act, for any resident who has continuously resided 
in a NF for at least 30 months before the date of the determination, and 
who requires only specialized services as defined in Sec. 483.120, the 
State must, in consultation with the resident's family or legal 
representative and caregivers--
    (i) Offer the resident the choice of remaining in the facility or of 
receiving services in an alternative appropriate setting;
    (ii) Inform the resident of the institutional and noninstitutional 
alternatives covered under the State Medicaid plan for the resident;
    (iii) Clarify the effect on eligibility for Medicaid services under 
the State plan if the resident chooses to leave the facility, including 
its effect on readmission to the facility; and
    (iv) Regardless of the resident's choice, provide for, or arrange 
for the provision of specialized services for the mental illness or 
mental retardation.
    (2) Short term residents. Except as otherwise may be provided in an 
alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the 
Act, for any resident who requires only specialized services, as defined 
in Sec. 483.120, and who has not continuously resided in a NF for at 
least 30 months before the date of the determination, the State must, in 
consultation with the resident's family or legal representative and 
caregivers--
    (i) Arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from 
the facility in accordance with Sec. 483.12(a);
    (ii) Prepare and orient the resident for discharge; and
    (iii) Provide for, or arrange for the provision of, specialized 
services for the mental illness or mental retardation.
    (3) For the purpose of establishing length of stay in a NF, the 30 
months of continuous residence in a NF or longer--
    (i) Is calculated back from the date of the first annual resident 
review determination which finds that the individual is not in need of 
NF level of services;
    (ii) May include temporary absences for hospitalization or 
therapeutic leave; and

[[Page 399]]

    (iii) May consist of consecutive residences in more than one NF.


<R05>
Sec. 483.120  Specialized services.

    (a) Definition--(1) For mental illness, specialized services means 
the services specified by the State which, combined with services 
provided by the NF, results in the continuous and aggressive 
implementation of an individualized plan of care that--
    (i) Is developed and supervised by an interdisciplinary team, which 
includes a physician, qualified mental health professionals and, as 
appropriate, other professionals.
    (ii) Prescribes specific therapies and activities for the treatment 
of persons experiencing an acute episode of serious mental illness, 
which necessitates supervision by trained mental health personnel; and
    (iii) Is directed toward diagnosing and reducing the resident's 
behavioral symptoms that necessitated institutionalization, improving 
his or her level of independent functioning, and achieving a functioning 
level that permits reduction in the intensity of mental health services 
to below the level of specialized services at the earliest possible 
time.
    (2) For mental retardation, specialized services means the services 
specified by the State which, combined with services provided by the NF 
or other service providers, results in treatment which meets the 
requirements of Sec. 483.440(a)(1).
    (b) Who must receive specialized services. The State must provide or 
arrange for the provision of specialized services, in accordance with 
this subpart, to all NF residents with MI or MR whose needs are such 
that continuous supervision, treatment and training by qualified mental 
health or mental retardation personnel is necessary, as identified by 
the screening provided in Sec. 483.130 or Secs. 483.134 and 483.136.
    (c) Services of lesser intensity than specialized services. The NF 
must provide mental health or mental retardation services which are of a 
lesser intensity than specialized services to all residents who need 
such services.


<R05>
Sec. 483.122  FFP for NF services.

    (a) Basic rule. Except as otherwise may be provided in an 
alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the 
Act, FFP is available in State expenditures for NF services provided to 
a Medicaid eligible individual subject to the requirements of this part 
only if the individual has been determined--
    (1) To need NF care under Sec. 483.116(a) or
    (2) Not to need NF services but to need specialized services, meets 
the requirements of Sec. 483.118(c)(1), and elects to stay in the NF.
    (b) FFP for late reviews. When a preadmission screening has not been 
performed prior to admission or an annual review is not performed 
timely, in accordance with Sec. 483.114(c), but either is performed at a 
later date, FFP is available only for services furnished after the 
screening or review has been performed, subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 483.124  FFP for specialized services.

    FFP is not available for specialized services furnished to NF 
residents as NF services.


<R05>
Sec. 483.126  Appropriate placement.

    Placement of an individual with MI or MR in a NF may be considered 
appropriate only when the individual's needs are such that he or she 
meets the minimum standards for admission and the individual's needs for 
treatment do not exceed the level of services which can be delivered in 
the NF to which the individual is admitted either through NF services 
alone or, where necessary, through NF services supplemented by 
specialized services provided by or arranged for by the State.


<R05>
Sec. 483.128  PASARR evaluation criteria.

    (a) Level I: Identification of individuals with MI or MR. The 
State's PASARR program must identify all individuals who are suspected 
of having MI or MR as defined in Sec. 483.102. This identification 
function is termed Level I. Level II is the function of evaluating and 
determining whether NF services and specialized services are needed. The 
State's performance of the Level I

[[Page 400]]

identification function must provide at least, in the case of first time 
identifications, for the issuance of written notice to the individual or 
resident and his or her legal representative that the individual or 
resident is suspected of having MI or MR and is being referred to the 
State mental health or mental retardation authority for Level II 
screening.
    (b) Adaptation to culture, language, ethnic origin. Evaluations 
performed under PASARR and PASARR notices must be adapted to the 
cultural background, language, ethnic origin and means of communication 
used by the individual being evaluated.
    (c) Participation by individual and family. PASARR evaluations must 
involve--
    (1) The individual being evaluated;
    (2) The individual's legal representative, if one has been 
designated under State law; and
    (3) The individual's family if--
    (i) Available; and
    (ii) The individual or the legal representative agrees to family 
participation.
    (d) Interdisciplinary coordination. When parts of a PASARR 
evaluation are performed by more than one evaluator, the State must 
ensure that there is interdisciplinary coordination among the 
evaluators.
    (e) The State's PASARR program must use at least the evaluative 
criteria of Sec. 483.130 (if one or both determinations can easily be 
made categorically as described in Sec. 483.130) or of Secs. 483.132 and 
483.134 or Sec. 483.136 (or, in the case of individuals with both MI and 
MR, Secs. 483.132, 483.134 and 483.136 if a more extensive 
individualized evaluation is required).
    (f) Data. In the case of individualized evaluations, information 
that is necessary for determining whether it is appropriate for the 
individual with MI or MR to be placed in an NF or in another appropriate 
setting should be gathered throughout all applicable portions of the 
PASARR evaluation (Secs. 483.132 and 483.134 and/or Sec. 483.136). The 
two determinations relating to the need for NF level of care and 
specialized services are interrelated and must be based upon a 
comprehensive analysis of all data concerning the individual.
    (g) Preexisting data. Evaluators may use relevant evaluative data, 
obtained prior to initiation of preadmission screening or annual 
resident review, if the data are considered valid and accurate and 
reflect the current functional status of the individual. However, in the 
case of individualized evaluations, to supplement and verify the 
currency and accuracy of existing data, the State's PASARR program may 
need to gather additional information necessary to assess proper 
placement and treatment.
    (h) Findings. For both categorical and individualized 
determinations, findings of the evaluation must correspond to the 
person's current functional status as documented in medical and social 
history records.
    (i) Evaluation report: Individualized determinations. For 
individualized PASARR determinations, findings must be issued in the 
form of a written evaluative report which--
    (1) Identifies the name and professional title of person(s) who 
performed the evaluation(s) and the date on which each portion of the 
evaluation was administered;
    (2) Provides a summary of the medical and social history, including 
the positive traits or developmental strengths and weaknesses or 
developmental needs of the evaluated individual;
    (3) If NF services are recommended, identifies the specific services 
which are required to meet the evaluated individual's needs, including 
services required in paragraph (i)(5) of this section;
    (4) If specialized services are not recommended, identifies any 
specific mental retardation or mental health services which are of a 
lesser intensity than specialized services that are required to meet the 
evaluated individual's needs;
    (5) If specialized services are recommended, identifies the specific 
mental retardation or mental health services required to meet the 
evaluated individual's needs; and
    (6) Includes the bases for the report's conclusions.

[[Page 401]]

    (j) Evaluation report: Categorical determinations. For categorical 
PASARR determinations, findings must be issued in the form of an 
abbreviated written evaluative report which--
    (1) Identifies the name and professional title of the person 
applying the categorical determination and the data on which the 
application was made;
    (2) Explains the categorical determination(s) that has (have) been 
made and, if only one of the two required determinations can be made 
categorically, describes the nature of any further screening which is 
required;
    (3) Identifies, to the extent possible, based on the available data, 
NF services, including any mental health or specialized psychiatric 
rehabilitative services, that may be needed; and
    (4) Includes the bases for the report's conclusions.
    (k) Interpretation of findings to individual. For both categorical 
and individualized determinations, findings of the evaluation must be 
interpreted and explained to the individual and, where applicable, to a 
legal representative designated under State law.
    (l) Evaluation report. The evaluator must send a copy of the 
evaluation report to the--
    (1) Individual or resident and his or her legal representative;
    (2) Appropriate State authority in sufficient time for the State 
authorities to meet the times identified in Sec. 483.112(c) for PASs and 
Sec. 483.114(c) for ARRs;
    (3) Admitting or retaining NF;
    (4) Individual's attending physician; and
    (5) The discharging hospital if the individual is seeking NF 
admission from a hospital.
    (m) The evaluation may be terminated if the evaluator finds at any 
time during the evaluation that the individual being evaluated--
    (1) Does not have MI or MR; or
    (2) Has--
    (i) A primary diagnosis of dementia (including Alzheimer's Disease 
or a related disorder); or
    (ii) A non-primary diagnosis of dementia without a primary diagnosis 
that is a serious mental illness, and does not have a diagnosis of MR or 
a related condition.

<R05>
Sec. 483.130  PASARR determination criteria.

    (a) Basis for determinations. Determinations made by the State 
mental health or mental retardation authority as to whether NF level of 
services and specialized services are needed must be based on an 
evaluation of data concerning the individual, as specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (b) Types of determinations. Determinations may be--
    (1) Advance group determinations, in accordance with this section, 
by category that take into account that certain diagnoses, levels of 
severity of illness, or need for a particular service clearly indicate 
that admission to or residence in a NF is normally needed, or that the 
provision of specialized services is not normally needed; or
    (2) Individualized determinations based on more extensive 
individualized evaluations as required in Sec. 483.132, Sec. 483.134, or 
Sec. 483.136 (or, in the case of an individual having both MR and MI, 
Secs. 483.134 and 483.136).
    (c) Group determinations by category. Advance group determinations 
by category developed by the State mental health or mental retardation 
authorities may be made applicable to individuals by the NF or other 
evaluator following Level I review only if existing data on the 
individual appear to be current and accurate and are sufficient to allow 
the evaluator readily to determine that the individual fits into the 
category established by the State authorities (see Sec. 483.132(c)). 
Sources of existing data on the individual that could form the basis for 
applying a categorical determination by the State authorities would be 
hospital records, physician's evaluations, election of hospice status, 
records of community mental health centers or community mental 
retardation or developmental disability providers.
    (d) Examples of categories. Examples of categories for which the 
State mental health or mental retardation authority

[[Page 402]]

may make an advance group determination that NF services are needed 
are--
    (1) Convalescent care from an acute physical illness which--
    (i) Required hospitalization; and
    (ii) Does not meet all the criteria for an exempt hospital 
discharge, which is not subject to preadmission screening, as specified 
in Sec. 483.106(b)(2).
    (2) Terminal illness, as defined for hospice purposes in Sec. 418.3 
of this chapter;
    (3) Severe physical illnesses such as coma, ventilator dependence, 
functioning at a brain stem level, or diagnoses such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's 
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and congestive heart failure 
which result in a level of impairment so severe that the individual 
could not be expected to benefit from specialized services;
    (4) Provisional admissions pending further assessment in cases of 
delirium where an accurate diagnosis cannot be made until the delirium 
clears;
    (5) Provisional admissions pending further assessment in emergency 
situations requiring protective services, with placement in a nursing 
facility not to exceed 7 days; and
    (6) Very brief and finite stays of up to a fixed number of days to 
provide respite to in-home caregivers to whom the individual with MI or 
MR is expected to return following the brief NF stay.
    (e) Time limits. The State may specify time limits for categorical 
determinations that NF services are needed and in the case of paragraphs 
(d)(4), (5) and (6) of this section, must specify a time limit which is 
appropriate for provisional admissions pending further assessment and 
for emergency situations and respite care. If an individual is later 
determined to need a longer stay than the State's limit allows, the 
individual must be subjected to an annual resident review before 
continuation of the stay may be permitted and payment made for days of 
NF care beyond the State's time limit.
    (f) The State mental health and mental retardation authorities may 
make categorical determinations that specialized services are not needed 
in the provisional, emergency and respite admission situations 
identified in Sec. 483.130(d)(4)-(6). In all other cases, except for 
Sec. 483.130(h), a determination that specialized services are not 
needed must be based on a more extensive individualized evaluation under 
Sec. 483.134 or Sec. 483.136.
    (g) Categorical determinations: No positive specialized treatment 
determinations. The State mental health and mental retardation 
authorities must not make categorical determinations that specialized 
services are needed. Such a determination must be based on a more 
extensive individualized evaluation under Sec. 483.134 or Sec. 483.136 
to determine the exact nature of the specialized services that are 
needed.
    (h) Categorical determinations: Dementia and MR. The State mental 
retardation authority may make categorical determinations that 
individuals with dementia, which exists in combination with mental 
retardation or a related condition, do not need specialized services.
    (i) If a State mental health or mental retardation authority 
determines NF needs by category, it may not waive the specialized 
services determination. The appropriate State authority must also 
determine whether specialized services are needed either by category (if 
permitted) or by individualized evaluations, as specified in 
Sec. 483.134 or Sec. 483.136.
    (j) Recording determinations. All determinations made by the State 
mental health and mental retardation authority, regardless of how they 
are arrived at, must be recorded in the individual's record.
    (k) Notice of determination. The State mental health or mental 
retardation authority must notify in writing the following entities of a 
determination made under this subpart:
    (1) The evaluated individual and his or her legal representative;
    (2) The admitting or retaining NF;
    (3) The individual or resident's attending physician; and
    (4) The discharging hospital, unless the individual is exempt from 
preadmission screening as provided for at Sec. 483.106(b)(2).
    (l) Contents of notice. Each notice of the determination made by the 
State

[[Page 403]]

mental health or mental retardation authority must include--
    (1) Whether a NF level of services is needed;
    (2) Whether specialized services are needed;
    (3) The placement options that are available to the individual 
consistent with these determinations; and
    (4) The rights of the individual to appeal the determination under 
subpart E of this part.
    (m) Placement options. Except as otherwise may be provided in an 
alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the 
Act, the placement options and the required State actions are as 
follows:
    (1) Can be admitted to a NF. Any applicant for admission to a NF who 
has MI or MR and who requires the level of services provided by a NF, 
regardless of whether specialized services are also needed, may be 
admitted to a NF, if the placement is appropriate, as determined in 
Sec. 483.126. If specialized services are also needed, the State is 
responsible for providing or arranging for the provision of the 
specialized services.
    (2) Cannot be admitted to a NF. Any applicant for admission to a NF 
who has MI or MR and who does not require the level of services provided 
by a NF, regardless of whether specialized services are also needed, is 
inappropriate for NF placement and must not be admitted.
    (3) Can be considered appropriate for continued placement in a NF. 
Any NF resident with MI or MR who requires the level of services 
provided by a NF, regardless of the length of his or her stay or the 
need for specialized services, can continue to reside in the NF, if the 
placement is appropriate, as determined in Sec. 483.126.
    (4) May choose to remain in the NF even though the placement would 
otherwise be inappropriate. Any NF resident with MI or MR who does not 
require the level of services provided by a NF but does require 
specialized services and who has continuously resided in a NF for at 
least 30 consecutive months before the date of determination may choose 
to continue to reside in the facility or to receive covered services in 
an alternative appropriate institutional or noninstitutional setting. 
Wherever the resident chooses to reside, the State must meet his or her 
specialized services needs. The determination notice must provide 
information concerning how, when, and by whom the various placement 
options available to the resident will be fully explained to the 
resident.
    (5) Cannot be considered appropriate for continued placement in a NF 
and must be discharged (short-term residents). Any NF resident with MI 
or MR who does not require the level of services provided by a NF but 
does require specialized services and who has resided in a NF for less 
than 30 consecutive months must be discharged in accordance with 
Sec. 483.12(a) to an appropriate setting where the State must provide 
specialized services. The determination notice must provide information 
on how, when, and by whom the resident will be advised of discharge 
arrangements and of his/her appeal rights under both PASARR and 
discharge provisions.
    (6) Cannot be considered appropriate for continued placement in a NF 
and must be discharged (short or long-term residents). Any NF resident 
with MI or MR who does not require the level of services provided by a 
NF and does not require specialized services regardless of his or her 
length of stay, must be discharged in accordance with Sec. 483.12(a). 
The determination notice must provide information on how, when, and by 
whom the resident will be advised of discharge arrangements and of his 
or her appeal rights under both PASARR and discharge provisions.
    (n) Specialized services needed in a NF. If a determination is made 
to admit or allow to remain in a NF any individual who requires 
specialized services, the determination must be supported by assurances 
that the specialized services that are needed can and will be provided 
or arranged for by the State while the individual resides in the NF.
    (o) Record retention. The State PASARR system must maintain records 
of evaluations and determinations, regardless of whether they are 
performed categorically or individually, in order to support its 
determinations and actions and to protect the appeal rights of 
individuals subjected to PASARR; and

[[Page 404]]

    (p) Tracking system. The State PASARR system must establish and 
maintain a tracking system for all individuals with MI or MR in NFs to 
ensure that appeals and future reviews are performed in accordance with 
this subpart and subpart E.

[57 FR 56506, Nov. 30, 1992; 58 FR 25784, Apr. 28, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 483.132  Evaluating the need for NF services and NF level of care (PASARR/NF).

    (a) Basic rule. For each applicant for admission to a NF and each NF 
resident who has MI or MR, the evaluator must assess whether--
    (1) The individual's total needs are such that his or her needs can 
be met in an appropriate community setting;
    (2) The individual's total needs are such that they can be met only 
on an inpatient basis, which may include the option of placement in a 
home and community-based services waiver program, but for which the 
inpatient care would be required;
    (3) If inpatient care is appropriate and desired, the NF is an 
appropriate institutional setting for meeting those needs in accordance 
with Sec. 483.126; or
    (4) If the inpatient care is appropriate and desired but the NF is 
not the appropriate setting for meeting the individual's needs in 
accordance with Sec. 483.126, another setting such as an ICF/MR 
(including small, community-based facilities), an IMD providing services 
to individuals aged 65 or older, or a psychiatric hospital is an 
appropriate institutional setting for meeting those needs.
    (b) Determining appropriate placement. In determining appropriate 
placement, the evaluator must prioritize the physical and mental needs 
of the individual being evaluated, taking into account the severity of 
each condition.
    (c) Data. At a minimum, the data relied on to make a determination 
must include:
    (1) Evaluation of physical status (for example, diagnoses, date of 
onset, medical history, and prognosis);
    (2) Evaluation of mental status (for example, diagnoses, date of 
onset, medical history, likelihood that the individual may be a danger 
to himself/herself or others); and
    (3) Functional assessment (activities of daily living).
    (d) Based on the data compiled in Sec. 483.132 and, as appropriate, 
in Secs. 483.134 and 483.136, the State mental health or mental 
retardation authority must determine whether an NF level of services is 
needed.


<R05>
Sec. 483.134  Evaluating whether an individual with mental illness requires specialized services (PASARR/MI).

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the minimum 
data needs and process requirements for the State mental health 
authority, which is responsible for determining whether or not the 
applicant or resident with MI, as defined in Sec. 483.102(b)(1) of this 
part, needs a specialized services program for mental illness as defined 
in Sec. 483.120.
    (b) Data. Minimum data collected must include--(1) A comprehensive 
history and physical examination of the person. The following areas must 
be included (if not previously addressed):
    (i) Complete medical history;
    (ii) Review of all body systems;
    (iii) Specific evaluation of the person's neurological system in the 
areas of motor functioning, sensory functioning, gait, deep tendon 
reflexes, cranial nerves, and abnormal reflexes; and
    (iv) In case of abnormal findings which are the basis for an NF 
placement, additional evaluations conducted by appropriate specialists.
    (2) A comprehensive drug history including current or immediate past 
use of medications that could mask symptoms or mimic mental illness.
    (3) A psychosocial evaluation of the person, including current 
living arrangements and medical and support systems.
    (4) A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation including a complete 
psychiatric history, evaluation of intellectual functioning, memory 
functioning, and orientation, description of current attitudes and overt 
behaviors, affect, suicidal or homicidal ideation, paranoia, and degree 
of reality testing (presence and content of delusions) and 
hallucinations.

[[Page 405]]

    (5) A functional assessment of the individual's ability to engage in 
activities of daily living and the level of support that would be needed 
to assist the individual to perform these activities while living in the 
community. The assessment must determine whether this level of support 
can be provided to the individual in an alternative community setting or 
whether the level of support needed is such that NF placement is 
required.
    (6) The functional assessment must address the following areas: 
Self-monitoring of health status, self-administering and scheduling of 
medical treatment, including medication compliance, or both, self-
monitoring of nutritional status, handling money, dressing 
appropriately, and grooming.
    (c) Personnel requirements. (1) If the history and physical 
examination are not performed by a physician, then a physician must 
review and concur with the conclusions.
    (2) The State may designate the mental health professionals who are 
qualified--
    (i) To perform the evaluations required under paragraph (b) (2)-(6) 
of this section including the--
    (A) Comprehensive drug history;
    (B) Psychosocial evaluation;
    (C) Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation;
    (D) Functional assessment; and
    (ii) To make the determination required in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (d) Data interpretation. Based on the data compiled, a qualified 
mental health professional, as designated by the State, must validate 
the diagnosis of mental illness and determine whether a program of 
psychiatric specialized services is needed.


<R05>
Sec. 483.136  Evaluating whether an individual with mental retardation requires specialized services (PASARR/MR).

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the minimum 
data needs and process requirements for the State mental retardation 
authority to determine whether or not the applicant or resident with 
mental retardation, as defined in Sec. 483.102(b)(3) of this part, needs 
a continuous specialized services program, which is analogous to active 
treatment, as defined in Secs. 435.1009 and 483.440 of this chapter.
    (b) Data. Minimum data collected must include the individual's 
comprehensive history and physical examination results to identify the 
following information or, in the absence of data, must include 
information that permits a reviewer specifically to assess:
    (1) The individual's medical problems;
    (2) The level of impact these problems have on the individual's 
independent functioning;
    (3) All current medications used by the individual and the current 
response of the individual to any prescribed medications in the 
following drug groups:
    (i) Hypnotics,
    (ii) Antipsychotics (neuroleptics),
    (iii) Mood stabilizers and antidepressants,
    (iv) Antianxiety-sedative agents, and
    (v) Anti-Parkinson agents.
    (4) Self-monitoring of health status;
    (5) Self-administering and scheduling of medical treatments;
    (6) Self-monitoring of nutritional status;
    (7) Self-help development such as toileting, dressing, grooming, and 
eating;
    (8) Sensorimotor development, such as ambulation, positioning, 
transfer skills, gross motor dexterity, visual motor perception, fine 
motor dexterity, eye-hand coordination, and extent to which prosthetic, 
orthotic, corrective or mechanical supportive devices can improve the 
individual's functional capacity;
    (9) Speech and language (communication) development, such as 
expressive language (verbal and nonverbal), receptive language (verbal 
and nonverbal), extent to which non-oral communication systems can 
improve the individual's function capacity, auditory functioning, and 
extent to which amplification devices (for example, hearing aid) or a 
program of amplification can improve the individual's functional

Sec. 484.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part, unless the context indicates otherwise--Bylaws 
or equivalent means a set of rules adopted by an HHA for governing the 
agency's operation.
    Branch office means a location or site from which a home health 
agency provides services within a portion of the total geographic area 
served by the parent agency. The branch office is part of the home 
health agency and is located sufficiently close to share administration, 
supervision, and services in a manner that renders it unnecessary for 
the branch independently to meet the conditions of participation as a 
home health agency.
    Clinical note means a notation of a contact with a patient that is 
written and dated by a member of the health team, and that describes 
signs and symptoms, treatment and drugs administered and the patient's 
reaction, and any changes in physical or emotional condition.
    HHA stands for home health agency.
    Nonprofit agency means an agency exempt from Federal income taxation 
under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    Parent home health agency means the agency that develops and 
maintains administrative controls of subunits and/or branch offices.
    Primary home health agency means the agency that is responsible for 
the services furnished to patients and for implementation of the plan of 
care.
    Progress note means a written notation, dated and signed by a member 
of the health team, that summarizes facts about care furnished and the 
patient's response during a given period of time.
    Proprietary agency means a private profit-making agency licensed by 
the State.
    Public agency means an agency operated by a State or local 
government.
    Subdivision means a component of a multi-function health agency, 
such as the home care department of a hospital or the nursing division 
of a health department, which independently meets the conditions of 
participation for HHAs. A subdivision that has subunits or branch 
offices is considered a parent agency.
    Subunit means a semi-autonomous organization that--
    (1) Serves patients in a geographic area different from that of the 
parent agency; and
    (2) Must independently meet the conditions of participation for HHAs 
because it is too far from the parent agency to share administration, 
supervision, and services on a daily basis.
    Summary report means the compilation of the pertinent factors of a 
patient's clinical notes and progress notes that is submitted to the 
patient's physician.
    Supervision means authoritative procedural guidance by a qualified 
person for the accomplishment of a function or activity. Unless

nursing and other therapeutic services furnished are under the 
supervision and direction of a physician or a registered nurse (who 
preferably has at least 1 year of nursing experience and is a public 
health nurse). This person, or similarly qualified alternate, is 
available at all times during operating hours and participates in all 
activities relevant to the professional services furnished, including 
the development of qualifications and the assignment of personnel.
    (e) Standard: Personnel policies. Personnel practices and patient 
care are supported by appropriate, written personnel policies. Personnel 
records include qualifications and licensure that are kept current.
    (f) Standard: Personnel under hourly or per visit contracts. If 
personnel under hourly or per visit contracts are used by the HHA, there 
is a written contract between those personnel and the agency that 
specifies the following:
    (1) Patients are accepted for care only by the primary HHA.

that effective interchange, reporting, and coordination of patient care 
does occur. A written summary report for each patient is sent to the 
attending physician at least every 62 days.
    (h) Standard: Services under arrangements. Services furnished under 
arrangements are subject to a written contract conforming with the 
requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section and with the 
requirements of section 1861(w) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1495x(w)).
    (i) Standard: Institutional planning. The HHA, under the direction 
of the governing body, prepares an overall plan and a budget that 
includes an annual operating budget and capital expenditure plan.
    (1) Annual operating budget. There is an annual operating budget 
that includes all anticipated income and expenses related to items that 
would, under generally accepted accounting principles, be considered 
income and expense items. However, it is not required that there be 
prepared, in connection with any budget, an item by item identification 
of the components of each type of anticipated income or expense.
    (2) Capital expenditure plan. (i) There is a capital expenditure 
plan for at least a 3-year period, including the operating budget year. 
The plan includes and identifies in detail the anticipated sources of 
financing for, and the objectives of, each anticipated expenditure of 
more than $600,000 for items that would under generally accepted 
accounting principles, be considered capital items. In determining if a 
single capital expenditure exceeds $600,000, the cost of studies, 
surveys, designs, plans, working drawings, specifications, and other 
activities essential to the acquisition, improvement, modernization, 
expansion, or replacement of land, plant, building, and equipment are 
included. Expenditures directly or indirectly related to capital 
expenditures, such as grading, paving, broker commissions, taxes 
assessed during the construction period, and costs involved in 
demolishing or razing structures on land are also included. Transactions 
that are separated in time, but are components of an overall plan or 
patient care objective, are viewed in their entirety without regard to 
their timing. Other costs related to capital expenditures include title 
fees, permit and license fees, broker commissions, architect, legal, 
accounting, and appraisal fees; interest, finance, or carrying charges 
on bonds, notes and other costs incurred for borrowing funds.
    (ii) If the anticipated source of financing is, in any part, the 
anticipated payment from title V (Maternal and Child Health and Crippled 
Children's Services) or title XVIII (Medicare) or title XIX (Medicaid) 
of the Social Security Act, the plan specifies the following:
    (A) Whether the proposed capital expenditure is required to comform, 
or is likely to be required to conform, to current standards, criteria, 
or plans developed in accordance with the Public Health Service Act or 
the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers 
Construction Act of 1963.
    (B) Whether a capital expenditure proposal has been submitted to the 
designated planning agency for approval in accordance with section 1122 
of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-1) and implementing regulations.
    (C) Whether the designated planning agency has approved or 
disapproved the proposed capital expenditure if it was presented to that 
agency.
    (3) Preparation of plan and budget. The overall plan and budget is 
prepared under the direction of the governing

[[Page 437]]

body of the HHA by a committee consisting of representatives of the 
governing body, the administrative staff, and the medical staff (if any) 
of the HHA.
    (4) Annual review of plan and budget. The overall plan and budget is 
reviewed and updated at least annually by the committee referred to in 
paragraph (i)(3) of this section under the direction of the governing 
body of the HHA.
    (j) Standard: Laboratory services. (1) If the HHA engages in 
laboratory testing outside of the context of assisting an individual in 
self-administering a test with an appliance that has been cleared for 
that purpose by the FDA, such testing must be in compliance with all 
applicable requirements of part 493 of this chapter.
    (2) If the HHA chooses to refer specimens for laboratory testing to 
another laboratory, the referral laboratory must be certified in the 
appropriate specialties and subspecialties of services in accordance 
with the applicable requirements of part 493 of this chapter.

follows a written plan of care established and periodically reviewed by 
a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, or podiatric medicine.
    (a) Standard: Plan of care. The plan of care developed in 
consultation with the agency staff covers all pertinent diagnoses, 
including mental status, types of services and equipment required, 
frequency of visits, prognosis, rehabilitation potential, functional 
limitations, activities permitted, nutritional requirements, medications 
and treatments, any safety measures to protect against injury, 
instructions for timely discharge or referral, and any other appropriate 
items. If a physician refers a patient under a plan of care that cannot 
be completed until after an evaluation visit, the physician is consulted 
to approve additions or modifications to the original plan. Orders for 
therapy services include the specific procedures and modalities to be 
used and the amount, frequency, and duration. The therapist and other 
agency personnel participate in developing the plan of care.
    (b) Standard: Periodic review of plan of care. The total plan of 
care is reviewed by the attending physician and HHA personnel as often 
as the severity of the patient's condition requires, but at least once 
every 62 days. Agency professional staff promptly alert the physician to 
any changes that suggest a need to alter the plan of care.
    (c) Standard: Conformance with physician orders. Drugs and 
treatments are administered by agency staff only as ordered by the 
physician. Oral orders are put in writing and signed and dated with the 
date of receipt by the registered nurse or qualified therapist (as

[[Page 438]]

defined in Sec. 484.4 of this chapter) responsible for furnishing or 
supervising the ordered services. Oral orders are only accepted by 
personnel authorized to do so by applicable State and Federal laws and 
regulations as well as by the HHA's internal policies. Agency staff 
check all medicines a patient may be taking to identify possible 
ineffective drug therapy or adverse reactions, significant side effects, 
drug allergies, and contraindicated medication, and promptly report any 
problem to the physician.

Sec. 484.48  Condition of participation: Clinical records.

    A clinical record containing pertinent past and current findings in 
accordance with accepted professional standards is maintained for every 
patient receiving home health services.

[[Page 442]]

In addition to the plan of care, the record contains appropriate 
identifying information; name of physician; drug, dietary, treatment, 
and activity orders; signed and dated clinical and progress notes; 
copies of summary reports sent to the attending physician; and a 
discharge summary. The HHA must inform the attending physician of the 
availability of a discharge summary. The discharge summary must be sent 
to the attending physician upon request and must include the patient's 
medical and health status at discharge.
    (a) Standards: Retention of records. Clinical records are retained 
for 5 years after the month the cost report to which the records apply 
is filed with the intermediary, unless State law stipulates a longer 
period of time. Policies provide for retention even if the HHA 
discontinues operations. If a patient is transferred to another health 
facility, a copy of the record or abstract is sent with the patient.
    (b) Standards: Protection of records. Clinical record information is 
safe-guarded against loss or unauthorized use. Written procedures govern 
use and removal of records and the conditions for release of 
information. Patient's written consent is required for release of 
information not authorized by law.

Sec. 484.52  Condition of participation: Evaluation of the agency's program.

    The HHA has written policies requiring an overall evaluation of the 
agency's total program at least once a year by the group of professional 
personnel (or a committee of this group), HHA staff, and consumers, or 
by professional people outside the agency working in conjunction with 
consumers. The evaluation consists of an overall policy and 
administrative review and a clinical record review. The evaluation 
assesses the extent to which the agency's program is appropriate, 
adequate, effective, and efficient. Results of the evaluation are 
reported to and acted upon by those responsible for the operation of the 
agency and are maintained separately as administrative records.
    (a) Standard: Policy and administrative review. As a part of the 
evaluation process the policies and administrative practices of the 
agency are reviewed to determine the extent to which they promote 
patient care that is appropriate, adequate, effective, and efficient. 
Mechanisms are established in writing for the collection of pertinent 
data to assist in evaluation.
    (b) Standard: Clinical record review. At least quarterly, 
appropriate health professionals, representing at least the scope of the 
program, review a sample of both active and closed clinical records to 
determine whether established policies are followed in furnishing 
services directly or under arrangement. There is a continuing review of 
clinical records for each 62-day period that a patient receives home 
health services to determine adequacy of the plan of care and 
appropriateness of continuation of care.

Sec. 486.307  OPO service area size designation and documentation requirements.

    (a) General documentation requirement. An OPO must make available to 
HCFA documentation verifying that the OPO meets the requirements of 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section at the time of application 
and throughout the period of its designation.
    (b) Boundary designation. The defined service area either includes 
an entire Metropolitan Statistical Area or a New England County 
Metropolitan Area as specified by the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget or does not include any part of such an area.
    (c) Service area location and characteristics. An OPO must precisely 
define and document a proposed service area's location through the 
following information:
    (1) The names of counties (or parishes in Louisiana) served or, if 
the service area includes an entire State, the name of the State.
    (2) Geographic boundaries of the service area for which U.S. 
population statistics are available.
    (3) Total population in service area.
    (4) The number of and the names of acute care hospitals in the 
service area with an operating room and the equipment and personnel to 
retrieve organs.
    (d) Sufficient size requirements. (1) Before January 1, 1996, an OPO 
must demonstrate that it can procure organs from at least 50 potential 
donors per calendar year or that its service area comprises an entire 
State.
    (2) Beginning January 1, 1996, an OPO must meet at least one of the 
following requirements:
    (i) Its service area must include an entire State or official U.S. 
territory.
    (ii) It must either procure organs from an average of at least 24 
donors per calendar year in the 2 years before the year of redesignation 
or request and be granted an exception to this requirement under 
paragraph (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section.
    (iii) In the case of an OPO operating exclusively in a noncontiguous 
U.S. State, a U.S. territory, or a U.S. commonwealth, such as Hawaii or 
Puerto Rico, it must procure organs at the rate of 50 percent of the 
national average of all OPOs for kidney procurement per million 
population and for kidney transplantation per million population.
    (iv) If it is an entity that has not been previously designated as 
an OPO,

[[Page 479]]

it must demonstrate that it can procure organs from at least 50 
potential donors per calendar year.
    (3) HCFA may grant an OPO an exception to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of 
this section if the OPO can demonstrate that--
    (i) It failed to meet the requirement because of unusual 
circumstances beyond its control;
    (ii) It has historically maintained a service area of sufficient 
size to meet the criterion in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section; and
    (iii) It has a specific plan to meet the size criterion in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section in the future.
    (4) During the 1996 redesignation process only, HCFA may grant an 
exception to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section to an OPO that can 
demonstrate that--
    (i) It meets the performance criteria in Sec. 486.310(b); and
    (ii) It has a specific plan to meet the service area size criterion 
in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section by the 1998 redesignation 
period.

[61 FR 19744, May 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 486.308  Condition: Participation in organ procurement and transplantation network.

    In order to be designated as the OPO for its service area, and to 
continue to be the designated OPO once designated, an OPO must be a 
member of, have a written agreement with, and abide by the rules of the 
OPTN established and operated in accordance with section 372 of the 
Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 274). The term ``rules of the 
OPTN'' means those rules provided for in regulations issued by the 
Secretary in accordance with section 372 of the PHS Act. No OPO is 
considered to be out of compliance with section 1138(b)(1)(D) of the Act 
or this section unless the Secretary has given the OPTN formal notice 
that he or she approves the decision to exclude the entity from the OPTN 
and also has notified the entity in writing.

50448, Sept. 29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 486.310  Condition: Adherence to performance standards.

    (a) Standards before January 1, 1996. Before January 1, 1996, OPOs 
must meet the following performance standards:
    (1) Each OPO must procure within its service area a minimum ratio of 
23 cadaveric kidneys per million population of its service area for each 
12-month period surveyed.
    (2) Each OPO must provide a minimum ratio of cadaveric kidneys 
procured in its service area and transplanted (either locally or 
exported and transplanted) of 19 cadaveric kidneys per million 
population of its service area for each 12-month period surveyed.
    (b) Standards beginning on January 1, 1996. Except as specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section, each OPO must achieve at least 75 percent 
of the national mean for four of the following five performance 
categories, averaged over the 2 calendar years before the year of 
redesignation:
    (1) Number of actual donors per million population.
    (2) Number of kidneys recovered per million population.
    (3) Number of extrarenal organs recovered per million population.
    (4) Number of kidneys transplanted per million population.
    (5) Number of extrarenal organs transplanted per million population.
    (c) Exceptions and exemptions--(1) Exception based on location. OPOs 
operating exclusively in a noncontiguous U.S. State, a U.S. territory, 
or a U.S. commonwealth, such as Hawaii or Puerto Rico, may be granted an 
exception from the performance standards of paragraph (b) of this 
section because of special geographically related characteristics, such 
as difficulty in transporting organs to the mainland, that impede 
satisfaction of the national rate of organ procurement. They must meet a 
standard of 50 percent of the national average of all OPOs for kidneys 
recovered and transplanted per million population.
    (2) Exception because of lack of competition for a service area. 
HCFA may continue to designate an OPO that does not meet the standards 
under paragraph (b) of this section for a service

[[Page 480]]

area if no OPO that meets the performance and qualification requirements 
is willing to accept responsibility for the service area and if the 
designated OPO submits an acceptable corrective action plan in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) Exception for 1996 transition period. During the 1996 
designation period only, HCFA may continue to designate for a service 
area an OPO that does not meet the standards under paragraph (b) of this 
section if the OPO:
    (i) Meets three of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) 
of this section; and
    (ii) Submits an acceptable corrective action plan in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Corrective action plans and corrected information--(1) 
Corrective action plans. (i) If a designated OPO does not meet the 
standards of paragraph (a) of this section, it may submit to the 
appropriate HCFA regional office a corrective action plan explaining why 
it failed to meet them and specifying the actions it will take to ensure 
it meets those standards in the future.
    (ii) HCFA will not accept corrective action plans from an OPO for 
failure to meet the standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section 
unless the OPO continues to be designated under paragraph (c)(2) or 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (2) Corrected information. An OPO may request correction of the 
information required by Sec. 486.306(e) from HCFA throughout the two-
year designation period. HCFA will evaluate the OPO's request and may 
seek input from other sources, such as hospital personnel, neighboring 
OPOs, the OPTN contractor, and the Census Bureau as necessary to verify 
the OPO's information before making the changes requested by the OPO. In 
addition, HCFA will notify an OPO if it does not meet the performance 
standards based on the information reported. Any OPO so notified may 
provide corrected information for consideration within 30 days of 
receipt of a notice of failure to meet the standards.

<R05>
Sec. 486.314  Effect of failure to meet requirements.

    Failure to continue to meet any of the requirements in Secs. 486.306 
and 486.308 or to meet the performance standards in Sec. 486.310 may 
result in termination of the OPO's agreement with HCFA.

50448, Sept. 29, 1995; 61 FR 19745, May 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 486.316  Designation of one OPO for each service area.

    (a) HCFA designates only one OPO per service area. Applications for 
designation are accepted only during a period when the service area is 
an open area. A service area is open for competition once the existing 
designation period has expired, when the existing designated status of 
the OPO for that service area has been terminated, or when no OPO has 
been designated for the area. HCFA may also declare the service area 
open in the event an OPO ceases to operate or HCFA has reasonable ground 
for anticipating it will cease to operate. In cases of urgent need (such 
as evidence of medically or ethically unsound practices), HCFA may 
terminate its agreement with an OPO immediately. The service area 
remains open until an OPO is designated for it. If more than one 
organization applies and substantially meets the requirements of 
Sec. 486.306 in a given service area, HCFA considers other factors in 
reaching a decision concerning which organization to designate. These 
factors follow:
    (1) Prior performance, including the previous year's experience in 
terms of the number of organs retrieved and wasted and the average cost 
per organ;
    (2) Actual number of donors compared to the number of potential 
donors;
    (3) The nature of relationships and degree of involvement with 
hospitals in the organization's service area;
    (4) Bed capacity associated with the hospitals with which the 
organizations have a working relationship;
    (5) Willingness and ability to place organs within the service area; 
and
    (6) Proximity of the organization to the donor hospitals.

[[Page 481]]

    (b) An organization that applies to HCFA to be the designated OPO 
for its service area and that is not designated may appeal its 
nondesignation under part 498 of this chapter.
    (c) After January 1, 1996, a hospital must enter into an agreement 
only with the OPO designated to serve the area in which the hospital is 
located unless HCFA has granted the hospital a waiver under paragraphs 
(d) through (g) of this section to be serviced by another OPO.
    (d) If HCFA changes the OPO designated for an area, hospitals 
located in that area must enter into agreements with the newly 
designated OPO or submit a request for a waiver in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section within 30 days of notice of the change in 
designation.
    (e) A hospital may request and HCFA may grant a waiver permitting 
the hospital to have an agreement with a designated OPO other than the 
OPO designated for the service area in which the hospital is located. To 
qualify for a waiver, the hospital must submit data to HCFA establishing 
that--
    (1) The waiver is expected to increase organ donations; and
    (2) The waiver will ensure equitable treatment of patients referred 
for transplants within the service area served by the hospital's 
designated OPO and within the service area served by the OPO with which 
the hospital seeks to enter into an agreement.
    (f) In making a determination on waiver requests, HCFA considers:
    (1) Cost effectiveness;
    (2) Improvements in quality;
    (3) Changes in a hospital's designated OPO due to changes in the 
metropolitan service area designations, if applicable; and
    (4) The length and continuity of a hospital's relationship with an 
OPO other than the hospital's designated OPO.
    (g) A hospital may continue to operate under its existing agreement 
with an out-of-area OPO while HCFA is processing the waiver request. If 
a waiver request is denied, a hospital must enter into an agreement with 
the designated OPO within 30 days of notification of the final 
determination.

<R05>
Sec. 486.318  Changes in ownership or service area.

    (a) OPO requirements. (1) A designated OPO considering a change in 
ownership or in its service area must notify HCFA before putting it into 
effect. This notification is required to ensure that the entity, as 
changed, will continue to satisfy Medicare and Medicaid requirements. A 
change in ownership takes place if there is the merger of one entity 
into another or the consolidation of one entity with another.
    (2) A designated OPO considering a change in its service area must 
obtain prior HCFA approval. In the case of a service area change that 
results from a change of ownership due to merger or consolidation, the 
entities must submit anew the information required in an application for 
designation, or other written documentation HCFA determines to be 
necessary for designation.
    (b) HCFA requirements. (1) If HCFA finds that the entity has changed 
to such an extent that it no longer satisfies the prerequisites for OPO 
designation, HCFA may terminate the OPO's agreement and declare the 
OPO's service area to be an open area.
    (2) If HCFA finds that the changed entity continues to satisfy the 
prerequisites for OPO designation, the period of designation of the 
changed entity is the remaining designation term of the OPO that was 
reorganized. If more than one designated OPO is involved in the 
reorganization, the remaining designation term is ordinarily the longest 
of the remaining periods. HCFA may determine, however, that a shorter 
period applies if it decides that a shorter period is in the best 
interest of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The performance 
standards of Sec. 486.310 apply at the end of this remaining period.

<R05>
Sec. 486.325  Terminations of agreement with HCFA.

    (a) Types--(1) Voluntary termination. If an OPO wishes to terminate 
its agreement, it must send written notice of its intention with the 
proposed effective date to HCFA. HCFA may approve the proposed date, set 
a different date no later than 6 months after the proposed effective 
date, or set a date less than 6 months after the proposed date if it 
determines that it would not disrupt services to the service area or 
otherwise interfere with the effective and efficient administration of 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If HCFA determines that a designated 
OPO has ceased to furnish organ procurement services to its service 
area, the cessation of services is deemed to constitute a voluntary 
termination by the OPO, effective on a date determined by HCFA.
    (2) Involuntary termination. HCFA may terminate an agreement if it 
finds that an OPO no longer meets the conditions for coverage in this 
subpart, or is not in substantial compliance with any other applicable 
Federal regulations or provisions of titles XI, XVIII, or title XIX of 
the Act. HCFA may also terminate an agreement immediately in cases of 
urgent need, such as the discovery of unsound medical practices.
    (b) Notice to OPO. HCFA gives notice of termination to an OPO at 
least 90 days before the effective date stated in the notice.
    (c) Appeal right. The OPO may appeal the termination in accordance 
with the provisions set forth in part 498, which sets forth appeals 
procedures for determinations that affect participation in the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs.
    (d) Effects of termination. When an OPO agreement is terminated--
    (1) Medicare and Medicaid payments may not be made for organ 
procurement services the OPO furnishes on or after the effective date of 
termination; and
    (2) HCFA will accept applications from any entity to be the 
designated OPO for that area.
    (e) Public notice. In the case of voluntary termination, the OPO 
must give prompt public notice of the date of termination, and such 
information regarding the effect of that termination as HCFA may 
require, through publication in local newspapers in the service area. In 
the case of involuntary termination, HCFA gives notice of the date of 
termination.
    (f) Reinstatement. HCFA may, at its discretion, designate an OPO 
whose agreement was previously terminated if HCFA finds that the cause 
for termination has been removed, is satisfied that it is not likely to 
recur, has not designated another OPO for the service area, and finds 
that the OPO meets all the necessary requirements for designation.

<R05>
Sec. 488.1  Definitions.

    As used in this part--

[[Page 499]]

    Accredited provider or supplier means a provider or supplier that 
has voluntarily applied for and has been accredited by a national 
accreditation program meeting the requirements of and approved by HCFA 
in accordance with Sec. 488.5 or Sec. 488.6.
    Act means the Social Security Act.
    AOA stands for the American Osteopathic Association.
    Certification is a recommendation made by the State survey agency on 
the compliance of providers and suppliers with the conditions of 
participation, requirements (for SNFs and NFs), and conditions of 
coverage.
    Conditions for coverage means the requirements suppliers must meet 
to participate in the Medicare program.
    Conditions of participation means the requirements providers other 
than skilled nursing facilities must meet to participate in the Medicare 
program and includes conditions of certification for rural health 
clinics.
    Full review means a survey of a hospital for compliance with all 
conditions of participation for hospitals.
    JCAHO stands for the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare 
Organizations.
    Medicare condition means any condition of participation or for 
coverage, including any long term care requirements.
    Provider of services or provider means a hospital, critical access 
hospital, skilled nursing facility, nursing facility, home health 
agency, hospice, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, or 
provider of outpatient physical therapy or speech pathology services.
    Rate of disparity means the percentage of all sample validation 
surveys for which a State survey agency finds noncompliance with one or 
more Medicare conditions and no comparable condition level deficiency 
was cited by the accreditation organization, where it is reasonable to 
conclude that the deficiencies were present at the time of the 
accreditation organization's most recent surveys of providers or 
suppliers of the same type.
    Example: Assume that during a validation review period State survey 
agencies perform validation surveys at 200 facilities of the same type 
(for example, ambulatory surgical centers, home health agencies) 
accredited by the same accreditation organization. The State survey 
agencies find 60 of the facilities out of compliance with one or more 
Medicare conditions, and it is reasonable to conclude that these 
deficiencies were present at the time of the most recent survey by an 
accreditation organization. The accreditation organization, however, has 
found deficiencies comparable to the condition level deficiencies at 
only 22 of the 60 facilities. These validation results would yield ((60-
22)/200) a rate of disparity of 19 percent.
    Reasonable assurance means that an accreditation organization has 
demonstrated to HCFA's satisfaction that its requirements, taken as a 
whole, are at least as stringent as those established by HCFA, taken as 
a whole.
    State includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.
    State survey agency means the State health agency or other 
appropriate State or local agency used by HFCA to perform survey and 
review functions for Medicare.
    Substantial allegation of noncompliance means a complaint from any 
of a variety of sources (including complaints submitted in person, by 
telephone, through written correspondence, or in newspaper or magazine 
articles) that, if substantiated, would affect the health and safety of 
patients and raises doubts as to a provider's or supplier's 
noncompliance with any Medicare condition.
    Supplier means any of the following: Independent laboratory; 
portable X-ray services physical therapist in independent practice; ESRD 
facility; rural health clinic; Federally qualified health center; or 
chiropractor.
    Validation review period means the one year period during which HCFA 
conducts a review of the validation surveys and evaluates the results of 
the most recent surveys performed by the accreditation organization.

safety requirements for providers and suppliers in that State, which are 
higher than those otherwise applied in the Medicare program.
    (3) If a State or political subdivision imposes higher requirements 
on institutions as a condition for the purchase of health services under 
a State Medicaid Plan approved under Title XIX of the Act, (or if Guam, 
Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands does so under a State plan for Old 
Age Assistance under Title I of the Act, or for Aid to the Aged, Blind, 
and Disabled under the original Title XVI of the Act), the Secretary is 
required to impose similar requirements as a condition for payment under 
Medicare in that State or political subdivision.

Sec. 488.5  Effect of JCAHO or AOA accreditation of hospitals.

    (a) Deemed to meet. Institutions accredited as hospitals by the 
JCAHO or AOA are deemed to meet all of the Medicare conditions of 
participation for hospitals, except--
    (1) The requirement for utilization review as specified in section 
1861(e)(6) of the Act and in Sec. 482.30 of this chapter;
    (2) The additional special staffing and medical records requirements 
that are considered necessary for the provision of active treatment in 
psychiatric hospitals (section 1861(f) of the Act) and implementing 
regulations; and
    (3) Any requirements under section 1861(e) of the Act and 
implementing regulations that HCFA, after consulting with JCAHO or AOA, 
identifies as being higher or more precise than the requirements for 
accreditation (section 1865(a)(4) of the Act).
    (b) Deemed status for providers and suppliers that participate in 
the Medicaid program. Eligibility for Medicaid participation can be 
established through Medicare deemed status for providers and suppliers 
that are not required under Medicaid regulations to comply with any 
requirements other than Medicare participation requirements for that 
provider or supplier type.
    (c) Release and use of hospital accreditation surveys.
    (1) A hospital deemed to meet program requirements must authorize 
its accreditation organization to release to HCFA and the State survey 
agency a copy of its most current accreditation survey together with any 
other information related to the survey that HCFA may require (including 
corrective action plans).
    (2) HCFA may use a validation survey, an accreditation survey or 
other information related to the survey to determine that a hospital 
does not meet the Medicare conditions of participation.
    (3) HCFA may disclose the survey and information related to the 
survey to the extent that the accreditation survey and related survey 
information are related to an enforcement action taken by HCFA.

Sec. 488.6  Other national accreditation programs for hospitals and other providers and suppliers.

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of this subpart, a national 
accreditation program for hospitals; psychiatric hospitals; SNFs; HHAs; 
ASCs; RHCs; CORFs; hospices; screening mammography services; critical 
access hospitals; or clinic, rehabilitation agency, or public health 
agency providers of outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy or 
speech pathology services may provide reasonable assurance to HCFA that 
it requires the providers or suppliers it accredits to meet requirements 
that are at least as stringent as the Medicare conditions when taken as 
a whole. In such a case, HCFA may deem the providers or suppliers the 
program accredits to be in compliance with the appropriate Medicare 
conditions. These providers and suppliers are subject to validation 
surveys under Sec. 488.7 of this subpart. HCFA will publish notices in 
the Federal Register in accordance with Sec. 488.8(b) identifying the 
programs and deeming authority of any national accreditation program and 
the providers or suppliers it accredits. The notice will describe how 
the accreditation organization's accreditation program provides 
reasonable assurance that entities accredited by the organization meet 
Medicare requirements. (See Sec. 488.5 for requirements concerning 
hospitals accredited by JCAHO or AOA.)
    (b) Eligibility for Medicaid participation can be established 
through Medicare deemed status for providers and suppliers that are not 
required under Medicaid regulations to comply with any requirements 
other than Medicare participation requirements for that provider or 
supplier type.
    (c)(1) A provider or supplier deemed to meet program requirements 
under paragraph (a) of this section must authorize its accreditation 
organization to release to HCFA and the State survey agency a copy of 
its most current accreditation survey, together with any information 
related to the survey that HCFA may require (including corrective action 
plans).
    (2) HCFA may determine that a provider or supplier does not meet the 
Medicare conditions on the basis of its own investigation of the 
accreditation survey or any other information related to the survey.
    (3) Upon written request, HCFA may disclose the survey and 
information related to the survey--
    (i) Of any HHA; or
    (ii) Of any other provider or supplier specified at paragraph (a) of 
this section if the accreditation survey and related survey information 
relate to an enforcement action taken by HCFA.

[58 FR 61840, Nov. 23, 1993, as amended at 62 FR 46037, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 488.7  Validation survey.

    (a) Basis for survey. HCFA may require a survey of an accredited 
provider or supplier to validate its organization's accreditation 
process. These surveys will be conducted on a representative sample 
basis, or in response to substantial allegations of noncompliance.
    (1) When conducted on a representative sample basis, the survey is 
comprehensive and addresses all Medicare conditions or is focused on a 
specific condition or conditions.
    (2) When conducted in response to a substantial allegation, the 
State survey agency surveys for any condition that HCFA determines is 
related to the allegations.
    (3) If the State survey agency substantiates a deficiency and HCFA 
determines that the provider or supplier is out of compliance with any 
Medicare condition, the State survey agency conducts a full Medicare 
survey.
    (b) Effect of selection for survey. A provider or supplier selected 
for a validation survey must--
    (1) Authorize the validation survey to take place; and
    (2) Authorize the State survey agency to monitor the correction of 
any deficiencies found through the validation survey.
    (c) Refusal to cooperate with survey. If a provider or supplier 
selected for a validation survey fails to comply with the requirements 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, it will no longer be deemed 
to meet the Medicare conditions but will be subject to full review by 
the State survey agency in accordance with Sec. 488.11 and may be 
subject to termination of its provider

[[Page 504]]

agreement under Sec. 489.53 of this chapter.
    (d) Consequences of finding of noncompliance. If a validation survey 
results in a finding that the provider or supplier is out of compliance 
with one or more Medicare conditions, the provider or supplier will no 
longer be deemed to meet any Medicare conditions. Specifically, the 
provider or supplier will be subject to the participation and 
enforcement requirements applied to all providers or suppliers that are 
found out of compliance following a State agency survey under 
Sec. 488.24 and to full review by a State agency survey in accordance 
with Sec. 488.11 and may be subject to termination of the provider 
agreement under Sec. 439.53 of this chapter and any other applicable 
intermediate sanctions and remedies.
    (e) Reinstating effect of accreditation. An accredited provider or 
supplier will again be deemed to meet the Medicare conditions in 
accordance with this section if--
    (1) It withdraws any prior refusal to authorize its accreditation 
organization to release a copy of the provider's or supplier's current 
accreditation survey;
    (2) It withdraws any prior refusal to allow a validation survey; and
    (3) HCFA finds that the provider or supplier meets all the 
applicable Medicare conditions. If HCFA finds that an accredited 
facility meets the Life Safety Code Standard by virtue of a plan of 
correction, the State survey agency will continue to monitor the 
facility until it is in compliance with the Life Safety Code Standard.

<R05>
Sec. 488.8  Federal review of accreditation organizations.

    (a) Review and approval of national accreditation organization. 
HCFA's review and evaluation of a national accreditation organization 
will be conducted in accordance with, but will not necessarily be 
limited to, the following general criteria--
    (1) The equivalency of an accreditation organization's accreditation 
requirements of an entity to the comparable HCFA requirements for the 
entity;
    (2) The organization's survey process to determine--
    (i) The composition of the survey team, surveyor qualifications, and 
the ability of the organization to provide continuing surveyor training;
    (ii) The comparability of survey procedures to those of State survey 
agencies, including survey frequency, and the ability to investigate and 
respond appropriately to complaints against accredited facilities;
    (iii) The organization's procedures for monitoring providers or 
suppliers found by the organization to be out of compliance with program 
requirements. These monitoring procedures are to be used only when the 
organization identifies noncompliance. If noncompliance is identified 
through validation surveys, the State survey agency monitors corrections 
as specified at Sec. 488.7(b)(3);
    (iv) The ability of the organization to report deficiencies to the 
surveyed facilities and respond to the facility's plan of correction in 
a timely manner;
    (v) The ability of the organization to provide HCFA with electronic 
data in ASCII comparable code and reports necessary for effective 
validation and assessment of the organization survey process;
    (vi) The adequacy of staff and other resources;
    (vii) The organization's ability to provide adequate funding for 
performing required surveys; and
    (viii) The organization's policies with respect to whether surveys 
are announced or unannounced; and
    (3) The accreditation organization's agreement to provide HCFA with 
a copy of the most current accreditation survey together with any other 
information related to the survey as HCFA may require (including 
corrective action plans).
    (b) Notice and comment. (1) HCFA will publish a proposed notice in 
the Federal Register whenever it contemplates approving an accreditation 
organization's application for deeming authority. The proposed notice 
will specify the basis for granting approval of deeming authority and 
the types of providers and suppliers accredited by

[[Page 505]]

the organization for which deeming authority would be approved. The 
proposed notice will also describe how the accreditation organization's 
accreditation program provides reasonable assurance that entities 
accredited by the organization meet Medicare requirements. The proposed 
notice will also provide opportunity for public comment.
    (2) HCFA will publish a final notice in the Federal Register 
whenever it grants deeming authority to a national accreditation 
organization. Publication of the final notice will follow publication of 
the proposed notice by at least six months. The final notice will 
specify the effective date of the approval of deeming authority and the 
term of approval (which will not exceed six years).
    (c) Effects of approval of an accreditation organization. HCFA will 
deem providers and suppliers accredited by an approved accreditation 
organization to meet the Medicare conditions for which the approval of 
deeming authority has specifically been granted. The deeming authority 
will take effect 90 days following the publication of the final notice.
    (d) Continuing Federal oversight of equivalency of an accreditation 
organization and removal of deeming authority. This paragraph 
establishes specific criteria and procedures for continuing oversight 
and for removing the approval of deeming authority of a national 
accreditation organization.
    (1) Comparability review. HCFA will compare the equivalency of an 
accreditation organization's accreditation requirements to the 
comparable HCFA requirements if--
    (i) HCFA imposes new requirements or changes its survey process;
    (ii) An accreditation organization proposes to adopt new 
requirements or change its survey process. An accreditation organization 
must provide written notification to HCFA at least 30 days in advance of 
the effective date of any proposed changes in its accreditation 
requirements or survey process; and
    (iii) An accreditation organization's approval has been in effect 
for the maximum term specified by HCFA in the final notice.
    (2) Validation review. Following the end of a validation review 
period, HCFA will identify any accreditation programs for which--
    (i) Validation survey results indicate a rate of disparity between 
certifications of the accreditation organization and certification of 
the State agency of 20 percent or more; or
    (ii) Validation survey results, irrespective of the rate of 
disparity, indicate widespread or systematic problems in an 
organization's accreditation process that provide evidence that there is 
no longer reasonable assurance that accredited entities meet Medicare 
requirements.
    (3) Reapplication procedures. (i) Every six years, or sooner as 
determined by HCFA, an approved accreditation organization must reapply 
for continued approval of deeming authority. HCFA will notify the 
organization of the materials the organization must submit as part of 
the reapplication procedure.
    (ii) An accreditation organization that is not meeting the 
requirements of this subpart, as determined through a comparability 
review, must furnish HCFA, upon request and at any time, with the 
reapplication materials HCFA requests. HCFA will establish a deadline by 
which the materials are to be submitted.
    (e) Notice. If a comparability or validation review reveals 
documentation that an accreditation organization is not meeting the 
requirements of this subpart, HCFA will provide written notice to the 
organization indicating that its deeming authority approval may be in 
jeopardy and that a deeming authority review is being initiated. The 
notice provides the following information--
    (1) A statement of the requirements, instances, rates or patterns of 
discrepancies that were found as well as other related documentation;
    (2) An explanation of HCFA's deeming authority review on which the 
final determination is based;
    (3) A description of the process available if the accreditation 
organization wishes an opportunity to explain or justify the findings 
made during the comparability or validation review;
    (4) A description of the possible actions that may be imposed by 
HCFA

[[Page 506]]

based on the findings from the validation review; and
    (5) The reapplication materials the organization must submit and the 
deadline for their submission.
    (f) Deeming authority review. (1) HCFA will conduct a review of an 
accreditation organization's accreditation program if the comparability 
or validation review produces findings as described at paragraph (d)(1) 
or (2), respectively, of this section. HCFA will review as appropriate 
either or both--
    (i) The requirements of the accreditation organization; or
    (ii) The criteria described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to 
reevaluate whether the accreditation organization continues to meet all 
these criteria.
    (2) If HCFA determines, following the deeming authority review, that 
the accreditation organization has failed to adopt requirements 
comparable to HCFA's or submit new requirements timely, the 
accreditation organization may be given a conditional approval of its 
deeming authority for a probationary period of up to 180 days to adopt 
comparable requirements.
    (3) If HCFA determines, following the deeming authority review, that 
the rate of disparity identified during the validation review meets 
either of the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section 
HCFA--
    (i) May give the accreditation organization conditional approval of 
its deeming authority during a probationary period of up to one year 
(whether or not there are also noncomparable requirements) that will be 
effective 30 days following the date of this determination;
    (ii) Will require the accreditation organization to release to HCFA 
upon its request any facility-specific data that is required by HCFA for 
continued monitoring:
    (iii) Will require the accreditation organization to provide HCFA 
with a survey schedule for the purpose of intermittent onsite monitoring 
by HCFA staff, State surveyors, or both; and
    (iv) Will publish in the Medicare Annual Report to Congress the name 
of any accreditation organization given a probationary period by HCFA.
    (4) Within 60 days after the end of any probationary period, HCFA 
will make a final determination as to whether or not an accreditation 
program continues to meet the criteria described at paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section and will issue an appropriate notice (including reasons for 
the determination) to the accreditation organization and affected 
providers or suppliers. This determination will be based on any of the 
following--
    (i) The evaluation of the most current validation survey and review 
findings. The evaluation must indicate an acceptable rate of disparity 
of less than 20 percent between the certifications of the accreditation 
organization and the certifications of the State agency as described at 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section in order for the accreditation 
organization to retain its approval;
    (ii) The evaluation of facility-specific data, as necessary, as well 
as other related information;
    (iii) The evaluation of an accreditation organization's surveyors in 
terms of qualifications, ongoing training composition of survey team, 
etc.;
    (iv) The evaluation of survey procedures; or
    (v) The accreditation requirements.
    (5) If the accreditation program has not made improvements 
acceptable to HCFA during the probationary period, HCFA may remove 
recognition of deemed authority effective 30 days from the date that it 
provides written notice to the organization that its deeming authority 
will be removed.
    (6) The existence of any validation review, deeming authority 
review, probationary period, or any other action by HCFA, does not 
affect or limit the conducting of any validation survey.
    (7) HCFA will publish a notice in the Federal Register containing a 
justification of the basis for removing the deeming authority from an 
accreditation organization. The notice will provide the reasons the 
accreditation organization's accreditation program no longer meets 
Medicare requirements.
    (8) After HCFA removes approval of an accreditation organization's 
deeming authority, an affected provider's or supplier's deemed status 
continues in effect 60 days after the removal of approval. HCFA may 
extend the period

[[Page 507]]

for an additional 60 days for a provider or supplier if it determines 
that the provider or supplier submitted an application within the 
initial 60 day timeframe to another approved accreditation organization 
or to HCFA so that a certification of compliance with Medicare 
conditions can be determined.
    (9) Failure to comply with the timeframe requirements specified in 
paragraph (f)(8) of this section will jeopardize a provider's or 
supplier's participation in the Medicare program and where applicable in 
the Medicaid program.
    (g) If at any time HCFA determines that the continued approval of 
deeming authority of any accreditation organization poses an immediate 
jeopardy to the patients of the entities accredited by that 
organization, or such continued approval otherwise constitutes a 
significant hazard to the public health, HCFA may immediately withdraw 
the approval of deeming authority of that accreditation organization.
    (h) Any accreditation organization dissatisfied with a determination 
to remove its deeming authority may request a reconsideration of that 
determination in accordance with subpart D of this part.

Sec. 488.10  State survey agency review: Statutory provisions.

    (a) Section 1864(a) of the Act requires the Secretary to enter into 
an agreement with any State that is able and willing to do so, under 
which appropriate State or local survey agencies will determine whether:
    (1) Providers or prospective providers meet the Medicare conditions 
of participation or requirements (for SNFs and NFs);
    (2) Suppliers meet the conditions for coverage; and
    (3) Rural health clinics meet the conditions of certification.
    (b) Section 1865(a) of the Act provides that if an institution is 
accredited as a hospital by the JCAHO, it will be deemed to meet the 
conditions of participation:
    (1) Except those specified in Sec. 488.5;
    (2) Provided that such hospital, if it is included within a 
validation survey, authorizes the JCAHO to release to HCFA (on a 
confidential basis) upon request a copy of the most current JCAHO 
accreditation survey.
    (c) Section 1864(c) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to enter 
into agreements with State survey agencies for the purpose of conducting 
validation surveys in hospitals accredited by the JCAHO. Section 1865(b) 
provides that an accredited hospital which is found after a validation 
survey to have significant deficiencies related to the health and safety 
of patients will no longer be deemed to meet the conditions of 
participation.
    (d) Section 1865(a) of the Act also provides that if HCFA finds that 
accreditation of a hospital; psychiatric hospital; SNF; HHA; hospice; 
ASC; RHC; CORF; laboratory; screening mammography service; critical 
access hospital; or clinic, rehabilitation agency, or public health 
agency provider of outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, or 
speech pathology services by any national accreditation organization 
provides reasonable assurance that any or all Medicare conditions are 
met, HCFA may treat the provider or supplier as meeting the conditions.

Sec. 488.12  Effect of survey agency certification.

    Certifications by the State survey agency represent recommendations 
to HCFA.
    (a) On the basis of these recommendations, HCFA will determine 
whether:
    (1) A provider or supplier is eligible to participate in or be 
covered under the Medicare program; or
    (2) An accredited hospital is deemed to meet the Medicare conditions 
of participation or is subject to full review by the State survey 
agency.
    (b) Notice of HCFA's determination will be sent to the provider or 
supplier.

Sec. 488.18  Documentation of findings.

    (a) The findings of the State agency with respect to each of the 
conditions of participation, requirements (for SNFs and NFs), or 
conditions for coverage must be adequately documented. When the State 
agency certifies to the Secretary that a provider or supplier is not in 
compliance with the conditions or requirements (for SNFs and NFs), and 
therefore not eligible to participate in the program, such documentation 
includes, in addition to the description of the specific deficiencies 
which resulted in the agency's recommendation, any provider or supplier 
response.
    (b) If a provider or supplier is certified by the State agency as in 
compliance with the conditions or participation requirements (for SNFs 
and NFs) or as meeting the requirements for special certification (see 
Sec. 488.54), with deficiencies not adversely affecting the health and 
safety of patients, the following information will be incorporated into 
the finding:
    (1) A statement of the deficiencies that were found.
    (2) A description of further action that is required to remove the 
deficiencies.
    (3) A time-phased plan of correction developed by the provider and 
supplier and concurred with by the State agency.
    (4) A scheduled time for a resurvey of the institution or agency to 
be conducted by the State agency within 90 days following the completion 
of the survey.
    (c) If, on the basis of the State certification, the Secretary 
determines that the provider or supplier is eligible to participate, the 
information described in paragraph (b) of this section will be 
incorporated into a notice of eligibility to the provider or supplier.
    (d) If the State agency receives information to the effect that a 
hospital or a critical access hospital (as defined in section 
1861(mm)(1) of the Act) has violated Sec. 489.24 of this chapter, the 
State agency is to report the information to HCFA promptly.

Sec. 488.20  Periodic review of compliance and approval.

    (a) Determinations by HCFA to the effect that a provider or supplier 
is in compliance with the conditions of participation, or requirements 
(for SNFs and NFs), or the conditions for coverage are made as often as 
HCFA deems necessary and may be more or less than a 12-month period, 
except for SNFs, NFs and HHAs. (See Sec. 488.308 for special rules for 
SNFs and NFs.)
    (b) The responsibilities of State survey agencies in the review and 
certification of compliance are as follows:
    (1) Resurvey providers or suppliers as frequently as necessary to 
ascertain compliance and confirm the correction of deficiencies;
    (2) Review reports prepared by a Professional Standards Review 
Organization (authorized under Part B Title XI of the Act) or a State 
inspection of care team (authorized under Title XIX of the Act) 
regarding the quality of a facility's care;
    (3) Evaluate reports that may pertain to the health and safety of 
patients; and
    (4) Take appropriate actions that may be necessary to achieve 
compliance or certify noncompliance to HCFA.
    (c) A State survey agency certification to HCFA that a provider or 
supplier is no longer in compliance with the conditions of participation 
or requirements (for SNFs and NFs) or conditions for coverage will 
supersede the State survey agency's previous certification.

    (b) The State agency will certify that a provider or supplier is not 
or is no longer in compliance with the conditions of participation or 
conditions for coverage where the deficiencies are of such character as 
to substantially limit the provider's or supplier's capacity to furnish 
adequate care or which adversely affect the health and safety of 
patients; or
    (c) If HCFA determines that an institution or agency does not 
qualify for participation or coverage because it is not in compliance 
with the conditions of participation or conditions for coverage, or if a 
provider's agreement is terminated for that reason, the institution or 
agency has the right to request that the determination be reviewed.

Sec. 488.26  Determining compliance.

    (a) Additional rules for certification of compliance for SNFs and 
NFs are set forth in Sec. 488.330.
    (b) The decision as to whether there is compliance with a particular 
requirement, condition of participation, or condition for coverage 
depends upon the manner and degree to which the provider or supplier 
satisfies the various standards within each condition. Evaluation of a 
provider's or supplier's performance against these standards enables the 
State survey agency to document the nature and extent of deficiencies, 
if any, with respect to a particular function, and to assess the need 
for improvement in relation to the prescribed conditions.
    (c) The State survey agency must adhere to the following principles 
in determining compliance with participation requirements:
    (1) The survey process is the means to assess compliance with 
Federal health, safety and quality standards;
    (2) The survey process uses resident outcomes as the primary means 
to establish the compliance status of facilities. Specifically surveyors 
will directly observe the actual provision of care and services to 
residents, and the effects of that care, to assess whether the care 
provided meets the needs of individual residents;
    (3) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert 
with Federal forms and procedures, to determine compliance;

[[Page 510]]

    (4) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform 
and consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;
    (5) Federal forms are used by all surveyors to ensure proper 
recording of findings and to document the basis for the findings.
    (d) The State survey agency must use the survey methods, procedures, 
and forms that are prescribed by HCFA.
    (e) The State survey agency must ensure that a facility's actual 
provision of care and services to residents and the effects of that care 
on residents are assessed in a systematic manner.

<R05>
Sec. 488.28  Providers or suppliers, other than SNFs and NFs, with deficiencies.

    (a) If a provider or supplier is found to be deficient with respect 
to one or more of the standards in the conditions of participation or 
conditions for coverage, it may participate in or be covered under the 
Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled Program only if the facility 
has submitted an acceptable plan of correction for achieving compliance 
within a reasonable period of time acceptable to the Secretary.
    (b) The existing deficiencies noted either individually or in 
combination neither jeopardize the health and safety of patients nor are 
of such character as to seriously limit the provider's capacity to 
render adequate care.
    (c)(1) If it is determined during a survey that a provider or 
supplier is not in compliance with one or more of the standards, it is 
granted a reasonable time to achieve compliance.
    (2) The amount of time depends upon the--
    (i) Nature of the deficiency; and
    (ii) State survey agency's judgment as to the capabilities of the 
facility to provide adequate and safe care.
    (d) Ordinarily a provider or supplier is expected to take the steps 
needed to achieve compliance within 60 days of being notified of the 
deficiencies but the State survey agency may recommend that additional 
time be granted by the Secretary in individual situations, if in its 
judgment, it is not reasonable to expect compliance within 60 days, for 
example, a facility must obtain the approval of its governing body, or 
engage in competitive bidding.

<R05>
Sec. 488.52  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 488.54  Temporary waivers applicable to hospitals.

    (a) General provisions. If a hospital is found to be out of 
compliance with one or more conditions of participation for hospitals, 
as specified in part 482 of this chapter, a temporary waiver may be 
granted by HCFA. HCFA may extend a temporary waiver only if such a 
waiver would not jeopardize or adversely affect the health and safety of 
patients. The waiver may be issued for any one year period or less under 
certain circumstances. The waiver may be withdrawn earlier if HCFA 
determines this action is necessary to protect the health and safety of 
patients. A waiver may be granted only if:
    (1) The hospital is located in a rural area. This includes all areas 
not delineated as ``urban'' by the Bureau of the Census, based on the 
most recent census;
    (2) The hospital has 50 or fewer inpatient hospital beds;
    (3) The character and seriousness of the deficiencies do not 
adversely affect the health and safety of patients; and
    (4) The hospital has made and continues to make a good faith effort 
to comply with personnel requirements consistent with any waiver.
    (b) Minimum compliance requirements. Each case will have to be 
decided on its individual merits, and while the degree and extent of 
compliance will vary, the institution must, as a minimum, meet all of 
the statutory conditions in section 1861(e)(1)-(8), in addition to 
meeting such other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary under 
section 1861(e)(9). (For further information relating to the exception 
in section 1861(e)(5) of the Act, see paragraph (c) of this section.)
    (c) Temporary waiver of 24-hour nursing requirement of 24-hour 
registered nurse requirement. HCFA may waive the requirement contained 
in section 1861(e)(5) that a hospital must provide

[[Page 511]]

24-hour nursing service furnished or supervised by a registered nurse. 
Such a waiver may be granted when the following criteria are met:
    (1) The hospital's failure to comply fully with the 24-hour nursing 
requirement is attributable to a temporary shortage of qualified nursing 
personnel in the area in which the hospital is located.
    (2) A registered nurse is present on the premises to furnish or 
supervise the nursing services during at least the daytime shift, 7 days 
a week.
    (3) The hospital has in charge, on all tours of duty not covered by 
a registered nurse, a licensed practical (vocational) nurse.
    (4) The hospital complies with all requirements specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Temporary waiver for technical personnel. HCFA may waive 
technical personnel requirements, issued under section 1861(e)(9) of the 
Act, contained in the Conditions of Participation; Hospitals (part 482 
of this chapter). Such a waiver must take into account the availability 
of technical personnel and the educational opportunities for technical 
personnel in the area in which the hospital is located. HCFA may also 
limit the scope of services furnished by a hospital in conjunction with 
the waiver in order not to adversely affect the health and safety of the 
patients. In addition, the hospital must also comply with all 
requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 488.56  Temporary waivers applicable to skilled nursing facilities.

    (a) Waiver of 7-day registered nurse requirement. To the extent that 
Sec. 483.30 of this chapter requires any skilled nursing facility to 
engage the services of a registered nurse more than 40 hours a week, the 
Secretary may waive such requirement for such periods as he deems 
appropriate if, based upon documented findings of the State agency, he 
determines that:
    (1) Such facility is located in a rural area and the supply of 
skilled nursing facility services in such area is not sufficient to meet 
the needs of individual patients therein,
    (2) Such facility has at least one fulltime registered nurse who is 
regularly on duty at such facility 40 hours a week, and
    (3) Such facility (i) has only patients whose attending physicians 
have indicated (through physicians' orders or admission notes) that each 
such patient does not require the services of a registered nurse for a 
48-hour period, or (ii) has made arrangements for a registered nurse or 
a physician to spend such time at the facility as is determined 
necessary by the patient's attending physician to provide necessary 
services on days when the regular fulltime registered nurse is not on 
duty.
    (4) Such facility has made and continues to make a good faith effort 
to comply with the more than 40-hour registered nurse requirement, but 
such compliance is impeded by the unavailability of registered nurses in 
the area.
    (b) Waiver of medical director requirement. To the extent that 
Sec. 488.75(i) of this chapter requires any skilled nursing facility to 
engage the services of a medical director either part-time or full-time, 
the Secretary may waive such requirement for such periods as he deems 
appropriate if, based upon documented findings of the State agency, he 
determines that:
    (1) Such facility is located in an area where the supply of 
physicians is not sufficient to permit compliance with this requirement 
without seriously reducing the availability of physician services within 
the area, and
    (2) Such facility has made and continues to make a good faith effort 
to comply with Sec. 488.75(i) of this chapter, but such compliance is 
impeded by the unavailability of physicians in the area.

Sec. 488.60  Special procedures for approving end stage renal disease facilities.

    (a) Considerations for approval. An ESRD facility which wishes to be 
approved for coverage, or which wishes any expansion of dialysis 
services to be approved for coverage in accordance with subpart U of 
part 405, must secure the Secretary's determination thereunder. In 
addition to the certification by the State agency referred to in 
Sec. 488.12 of this part, data furnished by network organizations and 
recommendations of the Public Health Service, concerning the 
contribution of a facility to the furnishing of end-stage renal disease 
services in its network and concerning the facility's compliance with 
professional norms and standards (see subpart U of part 405), shall be 
considered by the Secretary in determining whether to approve a facility 
for coverage or for any expansion of services under the End-Stage Renal 
Disease Program. The facility will also be required to submit data 
pertaining to its qualifications for approval or for any expansion of 
services, for consideration in the Secretary's determination.
    (b) Determining compliance with minimal utilization rates: Time 
limitations--(1) Unconditional status. A facility which meets minimal 
utilization requirements will be assigned this status as long as it 
continues to meet these requirements.
    (2) Conditional status. A conditional status may be granted to a 
facility for not more than four consecutive calendar years and will not 
be renewable (see Sec. 405.2122(b) of this chapter). Its status may be 
examined each calendar year to ascertain its compliance with Subpart U.
    (3) Exception status. Under unusual circumstances (see Sec. 405.2122 
(b) of this chapter) the Secretary may grant a time-limited exception to 
a facility which is not in compliance with the minimal utilization 
rate(s) for either unconditional status or conditional status. This 
exception status may be granted, and may be renewed on an annual basis, 
under circumstances where rigid application of minimal utilization rate 
requirements would adversely affect the achievement of ESRD program 
objectives.
    (c) New applicant. A facility which has not previously participated 
in the ESRD program must submit a plan detailing how it expects to meet 
the conditional minimal utilization rate status by the end of the second 
calendar year of its operation under the program and meet the 
unconditional minimal utilization rate status by the end of the fourth 
calendar year of its operation under the program.
    (d) Notification. The Secretary will notify each facility and its 
network coordinating council of its initial and its subsequent minimal 
utilization rate classification.
    (e) Failure to meet minimal utilization rate. A facility failing to 
meet standards for unconditional status or conditional status, or if 
applicable, for exception status, will be so notified at the time of 
such classification.
    (f) Interim regulations participant. A facility previously 
participating under the interim regulations will not be approved under 
the program established by subpart U until it has demonstrated that it 
meets all the applicable requirements of this subpart, including the 
appropriate minimal utilization rate. It may continue under the interim 
program only for a period not to exceed 1 year from the effective date 
of these amendments (see Sec. 405.2100(c) of this chapter). During this 
period it may demonstrate its ability to meet the appropriate minimal 
utilization rate. Failure to qualify under this subpart will 
automatically terminate coverage of such facility's services under the 
ESRD program at the end of such year.

<R05>
Sec. 488.110  Procedural guidelines.

    SNF/ICF Survey Process. The purpose for implementing a new SNF/ICF 
survey process is to assess whether the quality of care, as intended by 
the law and regulations, and as needed by the resident, is actually 
being provided in nursing homes. Although the onsite review procedures 
have been changed, facilities must continue to meet all applicable 
Conditions/Standards, in order to participate in Medicare/Medicaid 
programs. That is, the methods used to compile information about 
compliance with law and regulations are changed; the law and regulations 
themselves are not changed. The new process differs from the traditional 
process, principally in terms of its emphasis on resident outcomes. In 
ascertaining whether residents grooming and personal hygiene needs are 
met, for example, surveyors will no longer routinely evaluate a 
facility's written policies and procedures. Instead, surveyors will 
observe residents in order to make that determination. In addition, 
surveyors will confirm, through interviews with residents and staff, 
that such needs are indeed met on a regular basis. In most reviews, 
then, surveyors will ascertain whether the facility is actually 
providing the required and needed care and services, rather than whether 
the facility is capable of providing the care and services.

 The Outcome-Oriented Survey Process--Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) 
                 and Intermediate Care Facilities (ICFs)

    (a) General.
    (b) The Survey Tasks.
    (c) Task 1--Entrance Conference.
    (d) Task 2--Resident Sample--Selection Methodology.
    (e) Task 3--Tour of the Facility.
    (f) Task 4--Observation/Interview/Medical Record Review (including 
drug regimen review).
    (g) Task 5--Drug Pass Observation.
    (h) Task 6--Dining Area and Eating Assistance Observation.
    (i) Task 7--Forming the Deficiency Statement.
    (j) Task 8--Exit Conference.
    (k) Plan of Correction.
    (l) Followup Surveys.
    (m) Role of Surveyor.
    (n) Confidentiality and Respect for Resident Privacy.
    (o) Team Composition.
    (p) Type of Facility-Application of SNF or ICF Regulations.
    (q) Use of Part A and Part B of the Survey Report.

    (a) General. A complete SNF/ICF facility survey consists of three 
components:
    <bullet> Life Safety Code requirements;
    <bullet> Administrative and structural requirements (Part A of the 
Survey Report, Form HCFA-525); and
    <bullet> Direct resident care requirements (Part B of the Survey 
Report, Form HCFA-519), along with the related worksheets (HCFA-520 
through 524).
    Use this survey process for all surveys of SNFs and ICFs--whether 
freestanding, distinct parts, or dually certified. Do not use this 
process for surveys of Intermediate Care Facilities for Mentally 
Retarded (ICFs/MR), swing-bed hospitals or skilled nursing sections of 
hospitals that are not separately certified as SNF distinct parts. Do 
not announce SNF/ICF surveys ahead of time.
    (b) The Survey Tasks. Listed below are the survey tasks for easy 
reference:
    <bullet> Task 1. Entrance Conference.
    <bullet> Task 2. Resident Sample--Selection Methodology.
    <bullet> Task 3. Tour of the Facility. Resident Needs. Physical 
Environment. Meeting with Resident Council Representatives. Tour 
Summation and Focus of Remaining Survey Activity.
    <bullet> Task 4. Observation/Interview/Medical Record. Review of 
Each Individual in the Resident Sample (including drug regimen review).
    <bullet> Task 5. Drug Pass Observation.
    <bullet> Task 6. Dining Area and Eating Assistance Observation.
    <bullet> Task 7. Forming the Deficiency Statement (if necessary).
    <bullet> Task 8. Exit Conference.
    (c) Task 1--Entrance Conference. Perform these activities during the 
entrance conference in every certification and recertification survey:
    <bullet> Introduce all members of the team to the facility staff, if 
possible, even though the whole team may not be present for the entire 
entrance conference. (All surveyors wear identification tags.)

[[Page 610]]

    <bullet> Explain the SNF/ICF survey process as resident centered in 
focus, and outline the basic steps.
    <bullet> Ask the facility for a list showing names of residents by 
room number with each of the following care needs/treatments identified 
for each resident to whom they apply:

--Decubitus care
--Restraints
--Catheters
--Injections
--Parenteral fluids
--Rehabilitation service
--Colostomy/ileostomy care
--Respiratory care
--Tracheostomy care
--Suctioning
--Tube feeding

    Use this list for selecting the resident sample.
    <bullet> Ask the facility to complete page 2 of Form HCFA-519 
(Resident Census) as soon as possible, so that the information can 
further orient you to the facility's population. In a survey of a SNF 
with a distinct part ICF, you may collect two sets of census data. 
However, consolidate the information when submitting it to the regional 
office. You may modify the Resident Census Form to include the numbers 
of licensed and certified beds, if necessary.
    <bullet> Ask the facility to post signs on readily viewed areas (at 
least one on each floor) announcing that State surveyors are in the 
facility performing an ``inspection,'' and are available to meet with 
residents in private. Also indicate the name and telephone number of the 
State agency. Hand-printed signs with legible, large letters are 
acceptable.
    <bullet> If the facility has a Resident Council, make mutually 
agreeable arrangements to meet privately with the president and officers 
and other individuals they might invite.
    <bullet> Inform the facility that interviews with residents and 
Resident Councils are conducted privately, unless they independently 
request otherwise, in order to enhance the development of rapport as 
well as to allay any resident anxiety. Tell the facility that 
information is gathered from interviews, the tour, observations, 
discussions, record review, and facility officials. Point out that the 
facility will be given an opportunity to respond to all findings.
    (d) Task 2--Resident Sample--Selection Methodology. This methodology 
is aimed at formulating a sample that reflects the actual distribution 
of care needs/treatments in the facility population.
    Primarily performed on a random basis, it also ensures 
representation in the sample of certain care needs and treatments that 
are assessed during the survey.
    (1) Sample Size. Calculate the size of the sample according to the 
following guide:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              Number of residents in
    Number of residents in facility                 sample\1\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0-60 residents.........................  25% of residents (minimum--10).
61-120 residents.......................  20% of residents (minimum--15).
121-200 residents......................  15% of residents (minimum--24).
201+ residents.........................  10% of residents (minimum--30).
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Maximum--50.

    Note that the calculation is based on the resident census, not beds. 
After determining the appropriate sample size, select residents for the 
sample in a random manner. You may, for example, select every fifth 
resident from the resident census, beginning at a random position on the 
list. For surveys of dually certified facilities or distinct part SNFs/
ICFs, first use the combined SNF/ICF population to calculate the size of 
the sample, and then select a sample that reflects the proportions of 
SNF and ICF residents in the facility's overall population.
    (2) Special Care Needs/Treatments. The survey form specifies several 
care needs/treatments that must always be reviewed when they apply to 
any facility residents. These include:

<bullet> Decubitus Care
<bullet> Restraints
<bullet> Catheters
<bullet> Injections, Parenteral Fluids, Colostomy/Ileostomy, Respiratory 
    Care, Tracheostomy Care, Suctioning, Tube Feeding
<bullet> Rehabilitative Services (physical therapy, speech pathology and 
    audiology services, occupational therapy)

    Due to the relatively low prevalence of these care needs/treatments, 
appropriate residents may be either under-

[[Page 611]]


represented or entirely omitted from the sample. Therefore, determine 
during the tour how many residents in the random selection fall into 
each of these care categories. Then, compare the number of such 
residents in the random selection with the total number of residents in 
the facility with each specified care need/treatment (based on either 
the resident census or other information provided by the facility).
    Review no less than 25 percent of the residents in each of these 
special care needs/treatments categories. For example, if the facility 
has 10 residents with decubitus ulcers, but only one of these residents 
is selected randomly, review two more residents with decubitis ulcers 
(25% of 10 equals 2.5, so review a total of 3). Or, if the facility has 
two residents who require tube feeding, neither of whom is in the random 
selection, review the care of at least one of the these residents. This 
can be accomplished in the following manner:
    Conduct in-depth reviews of the randomly selected residents and then 
perform limited reviews of additional residents as needed to cover the 
specified care categories. Such reviews are limited to the care and 
services related to the pertinent care areas only, e.g., catheters, 
restraints, or colostomy. Utilize those worksheets or portions of 
worksheets which are appropriate to the limited review. Refer to the 
Care Guidelines, as a resource document, when appropriate.
    Always keep in mind that neither the random selection approach nor 
the review of residents within the specified care categories precludes 
investigation of other resident care situations that you believe might 
pose a serious threat to a resident's health or safety. Add to the 
sample, as appropriate.
    (e) Task 3--Tour of the Facility. (1) Purpose. Conduct the tour in 
order to:
    <bullet> Develop an overall picture of the types and patterns of 
care delivery present within the facility;
    <bullet> View the physical environment; and
    <bullet> Ascertain whether randomly selected residents are 
communicative and willing to be interviewed.
    (2) Protocol. You may tour the entire facility as a team or 
separately, as long as all areas of the facility are examined by at 
least one team member. Success of the latter approach, however, is 
largely dependent on open intra-team communication and the ability of 
each team member to identify situations for further review by the team 
member of the appropriate discipline. You may conduct the tour with or 
without facility staff accompanying you, as you prefer. Facilities, 
however, vary in staff member availability. Record your notes on the 
Tour Notes Worksheet, Form HCFA-521.
    Allow approximately three hours for the tour. Converse with 
residents, family members/significant others (if present), and staff, 
asking open-ended questions in order to confirm observations, obtain 
additional information, or corroborate information, (e.g., accidents, 
odors, apparent inappropriate dress, adequacy and appropriateness of 
activities). Converse sufficiently with residents selected for in-depth 
review to ascertain whether they are willing to be interviewed and are 
communicative. Observe staff interactions with other staff members as 
well as with residents for insight into matters such as resident rights 
and assignments of staff responsibilities.
    Always knock and/or get permission before entering a room or 
interrupting privacy. If you wish to inspect a resident's skin, observe 
a treatment procedure, or observe a resident who is exposed, courteously 
ask permission from the resident if she/he comprehends, or ask 
permission from the staff nurse if the resident cannot communicate. Do 
not do ``hands-on'' monitoring such as removal of dressings; ask staff 
to remove a dressing or handle a resident.
    (3) Resident Needs. While touring, focus on the residents' needs--
physical, emotional, psychosocial, or spiritual--and whether those needs 
are being met. Refer to the following list as needed:

--Personal hygiene, grooming, and appropriate dress
--Position
--Assistive and other restorative devices
--Rehabilitation issues
--Functional limitations in ADL
--Functional limitations in gait, balance and coordination
--Hydration and nutritional status
--Resident rights

[[Page 612]]

--Activity for time of day (appropriate or inappropriate)
--Emotional status
--Level of orientation
--Awareness of surroundings
--Behaviors
--Cleanliness of immediate environment (wheelchair, bed, bedside table, 
    etc.)
--Odors
--Adequate clothing and care supplies as well as maintenance and 
    cleanliness of same

    (4) Review of the Physical Environment. As you tour each resident's 
room and auxiliary rooms, also examine them in connection with the 
physical environment requirements. You need not document physical 
environment on the Tour Notes Worksheet. Instead, you may note any 
negative findings directly on the Survey Report Form in the remarks 
section.
    (5) Meeting With Resident Council Representatives. If a facility has 
a Resident Council, one or more surveyors meet with the respresentatives 
in a private area. Facility staff members do not attend unless 
specifically requested by the Council. Explain the purpose of the survey 
and briefly outline the steps in the survey process, i.e., entrance 
conference * * * exit conference. Indicate your interest in learning 
about the strengths of the facility in addition to any complaints or 
shortcomings. State that this meeting is one part of the information 
gathering; the findings have not yet been completed nor the conclusions 
formulated. Explain further, however, that the official survey findings 
are usually available within three months after the completion of the 
survey, and give the telephone number of the State agency office.
    Use this meeting to ascertain strengths and/or problems, if any, 
from the consumer's perspective, as well as to develop additional 
information about aspects of care and services gleaned during the tour 
that were possibly substandard.
    Conduct the meeting in a manner that allows for comments about any 
aspect of the facility. (See the section on Interview Procedures.) Use 
open-ended questions such as:

    <bullet> ``What is best about this home?''
    <bullet> ``What is worst?''
    <bullet> ``What would you like to change?''

    In order to get more detail, use questions such as:

    <bullet> ``Can you be more specific?''
    <bullet> ``Can you give me an example?''
    <bullet> ``What can anyone else tell me about this?''

    If you wish to obtain information about a topic not raised by the 
residents, use an approach like the following:

    <bullet> ``Tell me what you think about the food/staff/cleanliness 
here.''
    <bullet> ``What would make it better?''
    <bullet> ``What don't you like? What do you like?''

    (6) Tour Summation and Focus of Remaining Survey Activity. When the 
tour is completed, review the resident census data provided by the 
facility. Determine if the care categories specified in the section on 
Resident Sample are sufficiently represented in the random selection, 
make adjustments as needed, and complete the listing of residents on the 
worksheet labeled ``Residents Selected for In-depth Review'', Form HCFA-
520.
    Transcribe notes of a negative nature onto the SRF in the 
``Remarks'' column under the appropriate rule. Findings from a later 
segment in the survey or gathered by another surveyor may combine to 
substantiate a deficiency. You need not check ``met'' or ``not met'' at 
this point in the survey. Discuss significant impressions/conclusions at 
the completion of each subsequent survey task, and transfer any negative 
findings onto the Survey Report Form in the Remarks section.
    (f) Task 4--Observation/Interview/Medical Record Review (including 
drug regimen review). Perform the in-depth review of each individual in 
the resident sample in order to ascertain whether the facility is 
meeting resident needs. Evaluate specific indicators for each resident, 
utilizing the front and back of the ``Observation/Interview/Record 
Review (OIRR)'' worksheet, Form HCFA-524. You may prefer to perform the 
record review first, complete resident/staff/family observations and 
interviews, and finally, return to the record for any final unresolved 
issues. On the other hand, you may prefer to do the

[[Page 613]]

interviews first. Either method is acceptable. Whenever possible, 
however, complete one resident's observation/interview/medical record 
review and document the OIRR before moving onto another resident. If 
because of the facility layout, it is more efficient to do more than one 
record review at a time, limit such record review to two or three 
residents so your familiarity with the particular resident and 
continuity of the OIRR are not compromised.
    (1) Observation. Conduct observations concurrently with interviews 
of residents, family/significant others, and discussions with direct 
care staff [of the various disciplines involved. In multi-facility 
operations, whenever possible, observe staff that is regularly assigned 
to the facility in order to gain an understanding of the care and 
services usually provided.] Maintain respect for resident privacy. 
Minimize disruption of the operations of the facility or impositions 
upon any resident as much as possible. Based upon your observations of 
the residents' needs, gather information about any of the following 
areas, as appropriate:

Bowel and bladder training
Catheter care
Restraints
Injections
Parenteral fluids
Tube feeding/gastrostomy
Colostomy/ileostomy
Respiratory therapy
Tracheostomy care
Suctioning

    (2) Interviews. Interview each resident in private unless he/she 
independently requests that a facility staff member or other individual 
be present. Conduct the in-depth interview in a nonthreatening and 
noninvasive fashion so as to decrease anxiety and defensiveness. The 
open-ended approach described in the section on the Resident Council is 
also appropriate for the in-depth interview. While prolonged time 
expenditure is not usually a worthwhile use of resources or the 
resident's time, do allow time initially to establish rapport.
    At each interview:

    <bullet> Introduce yourself.
    <bullet> Address the resident by name.
    <bullet> Explain in simple terms the reason for your visit (e.g., to 
assure that the care and services are adequate and appropriate for each 
resident).
    <bullet> Briefly outline the process--entrance conference, tour, 
interviews, observations, review of medical records, resident 
interviews, and exit conference.
    <bullet> Mention that the selection of a particular resident for an 
interview is not meant to imply that his/her care is substandard or that 
the facility provides substandard care. Also mention that most of those 
interviewed are selected randomly.
    <bullet> Assure that you will strive for anonymity for the resident 
and that the interview is used in addition to medical records, 
observations, discussions, etc., to capture an accurate picture of the 
treatment and care provided by the facility. Explain that the official 
findings of the survey are usually available to the public about three 
months after completion of the survey, but resident names are not given 
to the public.
    <bullet> When residents experience difficulty expressing themselves:

--Avoid pressuring residents to verbalize
--Accept and respond to all communication
--Ignore mistakes in word choice
--Allow time for recollection of words
--Encourage self-expression through any means available

    <bullet> When interviewing residents with decreased receptive 
capacity:

--Speak slowly and distinctly
--Speak at conversational voice level
--Sit within the resident's line of vision
<bullet> Listen to all resident information/allegations without 
    judgment. Information gathered subsequently may substantiate or 
    repudiate an allegation.

    The length of the interview varies, depending on the condition and 
wishes of the resident and the amount of information supplied. Expect 
the average interview, however, to last approximately 15 minutes. 
Courteously terminate an interview whenever the resident is unable or 
unwilling to continue, or is too confused or disoriented to continue. 
Do, however, perform the

[[Page 614]]

other activities of this task (observation and record review). If, in 
spite of your conversing during the tour, you find that less than 40 
percent of the residents in your sample are sufficiently alert and 
willing to be interviewed, try to select replacements so that a complete 
OIRR is performed for a group this size, if possible. There may be 
situations, however, where the resident population has a high percentage 
of confused individuals and this percentage is not achievable. Expect 
that the information from confused individuals can be, but is not 
necessarily, less reliable than that from more alert individuals.
    Include the following areas in the interview of each resident in the 
sample:

Activities of daily living
Grooming/hygiene
Nutrition/dietary
Restorative/rehabilitation care and services
Activities
Social services
Resident rights

    Refer to the Care Guidelines ``evaluation factors'' as a resource 
for possible elements to consider when focusing on particular aspects of 
care and resident needs.
    Document information obtained from the interviews/observations on 
the OIRR Worksheet. Record in the ``Notes'' section any additional 
information you may need in connection with substandard care or 
services. Unless the resident specifically requests that he/she be 
identified, do not reveal the source of the information gleaned from the 
interview.
    (3) Medical Record Review. The medical record review is a three-part 
process, which involves first reconciling the observation/interview 
findings with the record, then reconciling the record against itself, 
and lastly performing the drug regimen review.
    Document your findings on the OIRR Worksheet, as appropriate, and 
summarize on the Survey Report Form the findings that are indicative of 
problematic or substandard care. Be alert for repeated similar instances 
of substandard care developing as the number of completed OIRR 
Worksheets increases.

    Note: The problems related to a particular standard or condition 
could range from identical (e.g., meals not in accordance with dietary 
plan) to different but related (e.g., nursing services--lapse in care 
provided to residents with catheters, to residents with contractures, to 
residents needing assistance for personal hygiene and residents with 
improperly applied restraints).

    (i) Reconciling the observation/interview findings with the record. 
Determine if:

    <bullet> An assessment has been performed.
    <bullet> A plan with goals has been developed.
    <bullet> The interventions have been carried out.
    <bullet> The resident has been evaluated to determine the 
effectiveness of the interventions.

    For example, if a resident has developed a decubitus ulcer while in 
the facility, record review can validate staff and resident interviews 
regarding the facility's attempts at prevention. Use your own judgment; 
review as much of the record(s) as necessary to evaluate the care 
planning. Note that facilities need not establish specific areas in the 
record stating ``Assessment,'' ``Plan,'' ``Intervention,'' or 
``Evaluation'' in order for the documentation to be considered adequate.
    (ii) Reconciling the record with itself. Determine:

    <bullet> If the resident has been properly assessed for all his/her 
needs.
    <bullet> That normal and routine nursing practices such as periodic 
weights, temperatures, blood pressures, etc., are performed as required 
by the resident's conditions.

    (iii) Performing the drug regimen review. The purpose of the drug 
regimen review is to determine if the pharmacist has reviewed the drug 
regimen on a monthly basis. Follow the procedures in Part One of 
Appendix N, Surveyor Procedures for Pharmaceutical Service Requirements 
in Long-Term Care Facilities. Fill in the appropriate boxes on the top 
left hand corner of the reverse side of the OIRR Worksheet, Form HCFA-
524. Appendix N lists many irregularities that can occur. Review at 
least six different indicators on each survey. However, the same six 
indicators need not be reviewed on every survey.


[[Page 615]]


    Note:  If you detect irregularities and the documentation 
demonstrates that the pharmacist has notified the attending physician, 
do not cite a deficiency. Do, however, bring the irregularity to the 
attention of the medical director or other facility official, and note 
the official's name and date of notification on the Survey Report Form.
    (g) Task 5--Drug Pass Observation. The purpose of the drug pass 
observation is to observe the actual preparation and administration of 
medications to residents. With this approach, there is no doubt that the 
errors detected, if any, are errors in drug administration, not 
documentation. Follow the procedure in Part Two of Appendix N, Surveyor 
Procedures for Pharmaceutical Service Requirements in Long-Term Care 
Facilities, and complete the Drug Pass Worksheet, Form HCFA-522. Be as 
neutral and unobtrusive as possible during the drug pass observation. 
Whenever possible, select one surveyor, who is a Registered Nurse or a 
pharmacist, to observe the drug pass of approximately 20 residents. In 
facilities where fewer than 20 residents are receiving medications, 
review as many residents receiving medications as possible. Residents 
selected for the in-depth review need not be included in the group 
chosen for the drug pass; however, their whole or partial inclusion is 
acceptable. In order to get a balanced view of a facility's practices, 
observe more than one person administering a drug pass, if feasible. 
This might involve observing the morning pass one day in Wing A, for 
example, and the morning pass the next day in Wing B.
    Transfer findings noted on the ``Drug Pass'' worksheet to the SRF 
under the appropriate rule. If your team concludes that the facility's 
medication error rate is 5 percent or more, cite the deficiency under 
Nursing Services/Administration of Drugs. Report the error rate under 
F209. If the deficiency is at the standard level, cite it in Nursing 
Services, rather than Pharmacy.
    (h) Task 6--Dining Area and Eating Assistance Observation. The 
purpose of this task is to ascertain the extent to which the facility 
meets dietary needs, particularly for those who require eating 
assistance. This task also yields information about staff interaction 
with residents, promptness and appropriateness of assistance, adaptive 
equipment usage and availability, as well as appropriateness of dress 
and hygiene for meals.
    For this task, use the worksheet entitled ``Dining Area and Eating 
Assistance Observation'' (Form HCFA-523). Observe two meals; for a 
balanced view, try to observe meals at different times of the day. For 
example, try to observe a breakfast and a dinner rather than two 
breakfasts. Give particular care to performing observations as 
unobtrusively as possible. Chatting with residents and sitting down 
nearby may help alleviate resident anxiety over the observation process.
    Select a minimum of five residents for each meal observation and 
include residents who have their meals in their rooms. Residents 
selected for the in-depth review need not be included in the dining and 
eating assistance observation; however, their whole or partial inclusion 
is acceptable. Ascertain the extent to which the facility assesses, 
plans, and evaluates the nutritional care of residents and eating 
assistance needs by reviewing the sample of 10 or more residents. If you 
are unable to determine whether the facility meets the standards from 
the sample reviewed, expand the sample and focus on the specific area(s) 
in question, until you can formulate a conclusion about the extent of 
compliance. As with the other survey tasks, transfer the findings noted 
on the ``Dining & Eating Assistance Observation'' worksheet to the 
Survey Report Form.
    (i) Task 7--Forming the Deficiency Statement. (1) General. The 
Survey Report Form contains information about all of the negative 
findings of the survey. Be sure to transfer to the Survey Report Form 
data from the tour, drug pass observation, dining area and eating 
assistance observation, as well as in-depth review of the sample of 
residents. Transfer only those findings which could possibly contribute 
to a determination that the facility is deficient in a certain area.
    Meet as a group in a pre-exit conference to discuss the findings and 
make conclusions about the deficiencies, subject to information provided 
by facility officials that may further explain the situation. Review the 
summaries/conclusions from each task

[[Page 616]]

and decide whether any further information and/or documentation is 
necessary to substantiate a deficiency. As the facility for additional 
information for clarification about particular findings, if necessary. 
Always consider information provided by the facility. If the facility 
considers as acceptable, practices which you believe are not acceptable, 
ask the facility to backup its contention with suitable reference 
material or sources and submit them for your consideration.
    (2) Analysis. Analyze the findings on the Survey Report Form for the 
degree of severity, frequency of occurrence and impact on delivery of 
care or quality of life. The threshold at which the frequency of 
occurrences amounts to a deficiency varies from situation to situation. 
One occurrence directly related to a life-threatening or fatal outcome 
can be cited as a deficiency. On the other hand, a few sporadic 
occurrences may have so slight an impact on delivery of care or quality 
of life that they do not warrant a deficiency citation. Review carefully 
all the information gathered. What may appear during observation as a 
pattern, may or may not be corroborated by records, staff, and 
residents. For example, six of the 32 residents in the sample are 
dressed in mismatched, poorly buttoned clothes. A few of the six are 
wearing slippers without socks. A few others are wearing worn clothes. 
Six occurrences might well be indicative of a pattern of susbstandard 
care. Close scrutiny of records, discussions with staff, and interviews 
reveal, however, that the six residents are participating in dressing 
retraining programs. Those residents who are without socks, chose to do 
so. The worn clothing items were also chosen--they are favorites.
    Combinations of substandard care such as poor grooming of a number 
of residents, lack of ambulation of a number of residents, lack of 
attention to positioning, poor skin care, etc., can yield a deficiency 
in nursing services just as 10 out of 10 residents receiving substandard 
care for decubiti yields a deficiency.
    (3) Deficiencies Alleged by Staff or Residents. If staff or 
residents allege deficiencies, but records, interviews, and observation 
fail to confirm the situation, it is unlikely that a deficiency exists. 
Care and services that are indeed confirmed by the survey to be in 
compliance with the regulatory requirements, but considered deficient by 
residents or staff, cannot be cited as deficient for certification 
purposes. On the other hand, if an allegation is of a very serious 
nature (e.g., resident abuse) and the tools of record review and 
observation are not effective because the problem is concealed, obtain 
as much information as possible or necessary to ascertain compliance, 
and cite accordingly. Residents, family, or former employees may be 
helpful for information gathering.
    (4) Composing the Deficiency Statement. Write the deficiency 
statement in terms specific enough to allow a reasonably knowledgeable 
person to understand the aspect(s) of the requirement(s) that is (are) 
not met. Do not delve into the facility's policies and procedures to 
determine or speculate on the root cause of a deficiency, or sift 
through various alternatives in an effort to prescribe an acceptable 
remedy. Indicate the data prefix tag and regulatory citation, followed 
by a summary of the deficiency and supporting findings using resident 
identifiers, not resident names, as in the following example.

    F102 SNF 405.1123(b).--Each resident has not had a physician's visit 
at least once every 30 days for the first 90 days after admission. 
Resident <greek-i>1602 has not been seen by a physician since she was 
admitted 50 days ago. Her condition has deteriorated since that time 
(formulation of decubiti, infections).

    When the data prefix tag does not repeat the regulations, also 
include a short phrase that describes the prefix tag (e.g., F117 
decubitus ulcer care). List the data tags in numerical order, whenever 
possible.
    (j) Task 8--Exit Conference. The purpose of the exit conference is 
to inform the facility of survey findings and to arrange for a plan of 
correction, if needed. Keep the tone of the exit conference consistent 
with the character of the survey process--inspection and enforcement. 
Tactful, business-like,

[[Page 617]]

professional presentation of the findings is of paramount importance. 
Recognize that the facility may wish to respond to various findings. 
Although deficiency statements continue to depend, in part, on surveyor 
professional judgment, support your conclusions with resident-specific 
examples (identifiers other than names) whenever you can do so without 
compromising confidentiality. Before formally citing deficiencies, 
discuss any allegations or findings that could not be substantiated 
during earlier tasks in the process. For example, if information is 
gathered that suggests a newly hired R.N. is not currently licensed, ask 
the facility officials to present current licensure information for the 
nurse in question. Identify residents when the substandard care is 
readily observed or discerned through record review. Ensure that the 
facility improves the care provided to all affected residents, not only 
the identified residents. Make clear to the facility that during a 
follow-up visit the surveyors may review residents other than those with 
significant problems from the original sample, in order to see that the 
facility has corrected the problems overall. Do not disclose the source 
of information provided during interviews, unless the resident has 
specifically requested you to inform the facility of his/her comments or 
complaints. In accordance with your Agency's policy, present the 
Statement of Deficiencies, form HCFA-2567, on site or after supervisory 
review, no later than 10 calendar days following the survey.
    (k) Plan of Correction. Explain to the facility that your role is to 
identify care and services which are not consistent with the regulatory 
requirements, rather than to ascertain the root causes of deficiencies. 
Each facility is expected to review its own care delivery. Subsequent to 
the exit conference, each facility is required to submit a plan of 
correction that identifies necessary changes in operation that will 
assure correction of the cited deficiencies. In reviewing and accepting 
a proposed plan of correction, apply these criteria:

    <bullet> Does the facility have a reasonable approach for correcting 
the deficiencies?
    <bullet> Is there a high probability that the planned action will 
result in compliance?
    <bullet> Is compliance expected timely?

    Plans of correction specific to residents identified on the 
deficiency statement are acceptable only where the deficiency is 
determined to be unique to that resident and not indicative of a 
possible systemic problem. For example, as a result of an aide being 
absent, two residents are not ambulated three times that day as called 
for in their care plans. A plan of correction that says ``Ambulate John 
Jones and Mary Smith three times per day,'' is not acceptable. An 
acceptable plan of correction would explain changes made to the 
facility's staffing and scheduling in order to gurantee that staff is 
available to provide all necessary services for all residents.
    Acceptance of the plan of correction does not absolve the facility 
of the responsibility for compliance should the implementation not 
result in correction and compliance. Acceptance indicates the State 
agency's acknowledgement that the facility indicated a willingness and 
ability to make corrections adequately and timely.
    Allow the facility up to 10 days to prepare and submit the plan of 
correction to the State agency, however, follow your SA policy if the 
timeframe is shorter. Retain the various survey worksheets as well as 
the Survey Report Form at the State agency. Forward the deficiency 
statement to the HCFA regional office.
    (l) Follow-up Surveys. The purpose of the follow-up survey is to re-
evaluate the specific types of care or care delivery patterns that were 
cited as deficient during the original survey. Ascertain the corrective 
status of all deficiencies cited on the HCFA-2567. Because this survey 
process focuses on the actual provision of care and services, revisits 
are almost always necessary to ascertain whether the deficienicies have 
indeed been corrected. The nature of the deficiencies dictates the scope 
of the follow-up visit. Use as many tasks or portions of the Survey 
Report Form(s) as needed to ascertain compliance status. For example, 
you need not perform another drug pass if no drug related deficiencies

[[Page 618]]

were cited on the initial survey. Similarly, you need not repeat the 
dining area and eating assistance observations if no related problems 
were identified. All or some of the aspects of the observation/
interview/medical record review, however, are likely to be appropriate 
for the follow-up survey.
    When selecting the resident sample for the follow-up, determine the 
sample size using the same formula as used earlier in the survey, with 
the following exceptions:

    <bullet> The maximum sample size is 30 residents, rather than 50.
    <bullet> The minimum sample size of 10 residents does not apply if 
only one care category was cited as deficient and the total number of 
residents in the facility in that category was less than 10 (e.g., 
deficiency cited under catheter care and only five residents have 
catheters).

    Include in the sample those residents who, in your judgment, are 
appropriate for reviewing vis-a-vis the cited substandard care. If 
possible, include some residents identified as receiving substandard 
care during the initial survey. If after completing the follow-up 
activities you determine that the cited deficiencies were not corrected, 
initiate adverse action procedures, as appropriate.
    (m) Role of Surveyor. The survey and certification process is 
intended to determine whether providers and suppliers meet program 
participation requirements. The primary role of the surveyor, then, is 
to assess the quality of care and services and to relate those findings 
to statutory and regulatory requirements for program participation.
    When you find substandard care or services in the course of a 
survey, carefully document your findings. Explain the deficiency in 
sufficient detail so that the facility officials understand your 
rationale. If the cause of the deficiency is obvious, share the 
information with the provider. For example, if you cite a deficiency for 
restraints (F118), indicate that restraints were applied backwards on 
residents 1621, 1634, 1646, etc.
    In those instances where the cause is not obvious, do not delve into 
the facility's policies and procedures to determine the root cause of 
any deficiency. Do not recommend or prescribe an acceptable remedy. The 
provider is responsible for deciding on and implementing the action(s) 
necessary for achieving compliance. For the restraint situation in the 
example above, you would not ascertain whether the improper application 
was due to improper training or lack of training, nor would you attempt 
to identify the staff member who applied the restraints. It is the 
provider's responsibility to make the necessary changes or corrections 
to ensure that the restriants are applied properly.
    A secondary role for the surveyor is to provide general consultation 
to the provider/consumer community. This includes meeting with provider/
consumer associations and other groups as well as participating in 
seminars. It also includes informational activities, whereby you respond 
to oral or written inquiries about required outcomes in care and 
services.
    (n) Confidentiality and Respect for Resident Privacy. Conduct the 
survey in a manner that allows for the greatest degree of 
confidentiality for residents, particularly regarding the information 
gathered during the in-depth interviews. When recording observations 
about care and resident conditions, protect the privacy of all 
residents. Use a code such as resident identifier number rather than 
names on worksheets whenever possible. Never use a resident's name on 
the Deficiency Statement, Form HCFA-2567. Block out resident names, if 
any, from any document that is disclosed to the facility, individual or 
organization.
    When communicating to the facility about substandard care, fully 
identify the resident(s) by name if the situation was identified through 
observation or record review. Improperly applied restraints, expired 
medication, cold food, gloves not worn for a sterile procedure, and diet 
inconsistent with order, are examples of problems which can be 
identified to the facility by resident name. Information about injuries 
due to broken equipment, prolonged use of restraints, and opened mail is 
less likely to be obtained through observation or record review. Do not 
reveal the source of information unless actually

[[Page 619]]

observed, discovered in the record review, or requested by the resident 
or family.
    (o) Team Composition. Whenever possible, use the following survey 
team model:

                        SNF/ICF Survey Team Model

    In facilities with 200 beds or less, the team size may range from 2 
to 4 members. If the team size is:

    <bullet> 2 members: The team has at least one RN plus another RN or 
a dietitian or a pharmacist.
    <bullet> 3-4 member: In addition to the composition described above, 
the team has one or two members of any discipline such as a social 
worker, sanitarian, etc.

    If the facility has over 200 beds and the survey will last more than 
2 days, the team size may be greater than 4 members. Select additional 
disciplines as appropriate to the facility's compliance history.
    Average onsite time per survey: 60 person hours (Number of surveyors 
multiplied by the number of hours on site)
    Preferably, team members have gerontological training and 
experience. Any member may serve as the team leader, consistent with 
State agency procedures. In followup surveys, select disciplines based 
on major areas of correction. Include a social worker, for example, if 
the survey revealed major psychosocial problems. This model does not 
consider integrated survey and Inspection of Care review teams, which 
typically would be larger.
    (p) Type of Facility--Application of SNF or ICF Regulations. Apply 
the regulations to the various types of facilities in the following 
manner:

<bullet> Freestanding Skilled  Apply SNF regulations.
 Nursing Facility (SNF)
<bullet> Freestanding          Apply ICF regulations.
 Intermediate Care Facility
 (ICF)
<bullet> SNF Distinct Part of  Apply SNF regulations.
 a Hospital
<bullet> ICF Distinct Part of  Apply ICF regulations.
 a Hospital
<bullet> Dually Certified SNF/ Apply SNF regulations and 442.346(b).

                               If the deficiency occurs in the ICF part
                                only, cite only the ICF regulation.
 

    (q) Use of Part A and Part B of the Survey Report. (1) Use of Part A 
(HCFA-525).--Use Part A for initial certification surveys only, except 
under the following circumstances:

    <bullet> When a terminated facility requests program participation 
60 days or more after termination. Treat this situation as a request for 
initial certification and complete Part A of the survey report in 
addition to Part B.
    <bullet> If an ICF with a favorable compliance history requests to 
covert a number of beds to SNF level, complete both Part A and Part B 
for compliance with the SNF requirements. If distinct part status is at 
issue, also examine whether it meets the criteria for certification as a 
distinct part.

    (i) Addendum for Outpatient Physical Therapy (OPT) or Speech 
Pathology Services. Use the Outpatient Physical Therapy--Speech 
Pathology SRF (HCFA-1893) as an addendum to Part A.
    (ii) Resurvey of Participating Facilities. Do not use Part A for 
resurveys of participating SNFs and ICFs. A determination of compliance, 
based on documented examination of the written policies and procedures 
and other pertinent documents during the initial survey, establishes the 
facility's compliance status with Part A requirements. This does not 
preclude citing deficiencies if they pertain to administrative or 
structural requirements from Part A that are uncovered incidental to a 
Part B survey. As an assurance measure, however, each facility at the 
time of recertification must complete an affidavit (on the HCFA-1516) 
attesting that no substantive changes have occurred that would affect 
compliance. Each facility must also agree to notify

[[Page 620]]

the State agency immediately of any upcoming changes in its organization 
or management which may affect its compliance status. If a new 
administrator is unable to complete the affidavit, proceed with the 
survey using the Part B form and worksheets; do not use the Part A form. 
The survey cannot be considered complete, however, until the affidavit 
is signed. If the facility fails to complete the affidavit, it cannot 
participate in the program.
    (iii) Substantial Changes in a Facility's Organization and 
Management. If you receive such information, review the changes to 
ensure compliance with the regulations. Request copies of the 
appropriate documents (e.g., written policies and procedures, personnel 
qualifications, or agreements) if they were not submitted. If the 
changes have made continued compliance seem doubtful, determine through 
a Part B survey whether deficiencies have resulted. Cite any 
deficiencies on the HCFA-2567 and follow the usual procedures.
    (2) Use of Part B (HCFA-519). Use Part B and the worksheets for all 
types of SNF and ICF surveys--initials, recertifications, followup, 
complaints, etc.
    The worksheets are:

<bullet> HCFA-520--Residents Selected for Indepth Review
<bullet> HCFA-521--Tour Notes Worksheet
<bullet> HCFA-522--Drug Pass Worksheet
<bullet> HCFA-523--Dining Area and Eating Assistance Worksheet
<bullet> HCFA-5245--Observation/Interview/Record Review Worksheet

    For complaint investigations, perform a full or partial Part B 
survey based on the extent of the allegations. If the complaint alleges 
substandard care in a general fashion or in a variety of services and 
care areas, perform several tasks or a full Part B survey, as needed. If 
the complaint is of a more specific nature, such as an allegation of 
improper medications, perform an appropriate partial Part B survey, such 
as a drug pass review and a review of selected medical records.

complexity of the problem when survey agencies are found to have 
notified a SNF or NF through their scheduling or procedural policies. 
Sanctions for inadequate survey performance are in accordance with 
Sec. 488.320.
    (c) Civil money penalties. An individual who notifies a SNF or NF, 
or causes a SNF or NF to be notified, of the time or date on which a 
standard survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a Federal 
civil money penalty not to exceed $2,000.


<R05>
Sec. 488.308  Survey frequency.

    (a) Basic period. The survey agency must conduct a standard survey 
of each SNF and NF not later than 15 months after the last day of the 
previous standard survey.
    (b) Statewide average interval. (1) The statewide average interval 
between standard surveys must be 12 months or less, computed in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) HCFA takes corrective action in accordance with the nature of 
the State survey agency's failure to ensure that the 12-month statewide 
average interval requirement is met. HCFA's corrective action is in 
accordance with Sec. 488.320.
    (c) Other surveys. The survey agency may conduct a survey as 
frequently as necessary to--
    (1) Determine whether a facility complies with the participation 
requirements; and
    (2) Confirm that the facility has corrected deficiencies previously 
cited.
    (d) Computation of statewide average interval. The statewide average 
interval is computed at the end of each Federal fiscal year by comparing 
the last day of the most recent standard survey for each participating 
facility to the last day of each facility's previous standard survey.
    (e) Special surveys. (1) The survey agency may conduct a standard or 
an abbreviated standard survey to determine whether certain changes have 
caused a decline in the quality of care furnished by a SNF or a NF,

Sec. 488.318  Inadequate survey performance.

    (a) HCFA considers survey performance to be inadequate if the State 
survey agency--
    (1) Indicates a pattern of failure to--
    (i) Identify deficiencies and the failure cannot be explained by 
changed conditions in the facility or other case specific factors;
    (ii) Cite only valid deficiencies;
    (iii) Conduct surveys in accordance with the requirements of this 
subpart; or
    (iv) Use Federal standards, protocols, and the forms, methods and 
procedures specified by HCFA in manual instructions; or
    (2) Fails to identify an immediate jeopardy situation.
    (b) Inadequate survey performance does not--
    (1) Relieve a SNF or NF of its obligation to meet all requirements 
for program participation; or
    (2) Invalidate adequately documented deficiencies.


<R05>
Sec. 488.320  Sanctions for inadequate survey performance.

    (a) Annual assessment of survey performance. HCFA assesses the 
performance of the State's survey and certification program annually.
    (b) Sanctions for inadequate survey performance. When a State 
demonstrates inadequate survey performance, as specified in 
Sec. 488.318, HCFA notifies the survey agency of the inadequacy and 
takes action in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Medicaid facilities. (1) For a pattern of failure to identify 
deficiencies in Medicaid facilities, HCFA--
    (i) Reduces FFP, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, and 
if appropriate;
    (ii) Provides for training of survey teams.
    (2) For other survey inadequacies in Medicaid facilities, HCFA 
provides for training of survey teams.

    (5) Initiates action to terminate the agreement between the 
Secretary and the State under section 1864 of the Act, either in whole 
or in part.
    (e) Reduction of FFP. In reducing FFP for inadequate survey 
performance, HCFA uses the formula specified in section 1919(g)(3)(C) of 
the Act, that is 33 percent multiplied by a fraction--
    (1) The numerator of which is equal to the total number of residents 
in the NFs that HCFA found to be noncompliant during validation surveys 
for that quarter; and
    (2) The denominator of which is equal to the total number of 
residents in the NFs in which HCFA conducted validation surveys during 
that quarter.
    (f) Appeal of FFP reduction. When a State is dissatisfied with 
HCFA's determination to reduce FFP, the State may appeal the 
determination to the Departmental Appeals Board, using the procedures 
specified in 45 CFR part 16.

<R05>
Sec. 488.330  Certification of compliance or noncompliance.

    (a) General rules--(1) Responsibility for certification. (i) The 
State survey agency surveys all facilities for compliance or 
noncompliance with requirements for long term care facilities. The 
survey by the State survey agency may be followed by a Federal 
validation survey.

[[Page 765]]

    (A) The State certifies the compliance or noncompliance of non-State 
operated NFs. Regardless of the State entity doing the certification, it 
is final, except in the case of a complaint or validation survey 
conducted by HCFA, or HCFA review of the State's findings.
    (B) HCFA certifies the compliance or noncompliance of all State-
operated facilities.
    (C) The State survey agency certifies the compliance or 
noncompliance of a non-State operated SNF, subject to the approval of 
HCFA.
    (D) The State survey agency certifies compliance or noncompliance 
for a dually participating SNF/NF. In the case of a disagreement between 
HCFA and the State survey agency, a finding of noncompliance takes 
precedence over that of compliance.
    (ii) In the case of a validation survey, the Secretary's 
determination as to the facility's noncompliance is binding, and takes 
precedence over a certification of compliance resulting from the State 
survey.
    (2) Basis for certification. (i) Certification by the State is based 
on the survey agency findings.
    (ii) Certification by HCFA is based on either the survey agency 
findings (in the case of State-operated facilities), or, in the case of 
a validation survey, on HCFA's own survey findings.
    (b) Effect of certification--(1) Certification of compliance. A 
certification of compliance constitutes a determination that the 
facility is in substantial compliance and is eligible to participate in 
Medicaid as a NF, or in Medicare as a SNF, or in Medicare and Medicaid 
as a dually participating facility.
    (2) Certification of noncompliance. A certification of noncompliance 
requires denial of participation for prospective providers and 
enforcement action for current providers in accordance with subpart F of 
this part. Enforcement action must include one of the following:
    (i) Termination of any Medicare or Medicaid provider agreements that 
are in effect.
    (ii) Application of alternative remedies instead of, or in addition 
to, termination procedures.
    (c) Notice of certification of noncompliance and resulting action. 
The notice of certification of noncompliance is sent in accordance with 
the timeframes specified in Sec. 488.402(f), and resulting action is 
issued by HCFA, except when the State is taking the action for a non-
State operated NF.
    (d) Content of notice of certification of noncompliance. The notice 
of certification of noncompliance is sent in accordance with the 
timeframes specified in Sec. 488.402(f) and includes information on all 
of the following:
    (1) Nature of noncompliance.
    (2) Any alternative remedies to be imposed under subpart F of this 
part.
    (3) Any termination or denial of participation action to be taken 
under this part.
    (4) The appeal rights available to the facility under this part.
    (5) Timeframes to be met by the provider and certifying agency with 
regard to each of the enforcement actions or appeal procedures addressed 
in the notice.
    (e) Appeals. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, the 
State must impose remedies promptly on any provider of services 
participating in the Medicaid program--
    (i) After promptly notifying the facility of the deficiencies and 
impending remedy or remedies; and
    (ii) Except for civil money penalties, during any pending hearing 
that may be requested by the provider of services.
    (2) HCFA imposes remedies promptly on any provider of services 
participating in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any provider of 
services participating in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs--
    (i) After promptly notifying the facility of the deficiencies and 
impending remedy or remedies; and
    (ii) Except for civil money penalties, during any pending hearing 
that may be requested by the provider of services.
    (3) The provisions of part 498 of this chapter apply when the 
following providers request a hearing on a denial of participation, or 
certification of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy 
(including termination of the provider agreement), except State 
monitoring:
    (i) All State-operated facilities;

[[Page 766]]

    (ii) SNFs and dually participating SNF/NFs; and
    (iii) Any other facilities subject to a HCFA validation survey or 
HCFA review of the State's findings.
    (4) The provisions of part 431 of this chapter apply when a non-
State operated Medicaid NF, which has not received a HCFA validation 
survey or HCFA review of the State's findings, requests a hearing on the 
State's denial of participation, termination of provider agreement, or 
certification of noncompliance leading to an alternative remedy, except 
State monitoring.
    (f) Provider agreements. HCFA or the Medicaid agency may execute a 
provider agreement when a prospective provider is in substantial 
compliance with all the requirements for participation for a SNF or NF, 
respectively.
    (g) Special rules for Federal validation surveys. (1) HCFA may make 
independent certifications of a NF's, SNF's, or dually participating 
facility's noncompliance based on a HCFA validation survey.
    (2) HCFA issues the notice of actions affecting facilities for which 
HCFA did validation surveys.
    (3) For non-State-operated NFs and non-State-operated dually 
participating facilities, any disagreement between HCFA and the State 
regarding the timing and choice of remedies is resolved in accordance 
with Sec. 488.452.
    (4) Either HCFA or the survey agency, at HCFA's option, may revisit 
the facility to ensure that corrections are made.

<R05>
Sec. 488.331  Informal dispute resolution.

    (a) Opportunity to refute survey findings. (1) For non-Federal 
surveys, the State must offer a facility an informal opportunity, at the 
facility's request, to dispute survey findings upon the facility's 
receipt of the official statement of deficiencies.
    (2) For Federal surveys, HCFA offers a facility an informal 
opportunity, at the facility's request, to dispute survey findings upon 
the facility's receipt of the official statement of deficiencies.
    (b)(1) Failure of the State or HCFA, as appropriate, to complete 
informal dispute resolution timely cannot delay the effective date of 
any enforcement action against the facility.
    (2) A facility may not seek a delay of any enforcement action 
against it on the grounds that informal dispute resolution has not been 
completed before the effective date of the enforcement action.
    (c) If a provider is subsequently successful, during the informal 
dispute resolution process, at demonstrating that deficiencies should 
not have been cited, the deficiencies are removed from the statement of 
deficiencies and any enforcement actions imposed solely as a result of 
those cited deficiencies are rescinded.
    (d) Notification. Upon request, HCFA does and the State must provide 
the facility with written notification of the informal dispute 
resolution process.


<R05>
Sec. 488.332  Investigation of complaints of violations and monitoring of compliance.

    (a) Investigation of complaints. (1) The State survey agency must 
establish procedures and maintain adequate staff to investigate 
complaints of violations of participation requirements.
    (2) The State survey agency takes appropriate precautions to protect 
a complainant's anonymity and privacy, if possible.
    (3) If arrangements have been made with other State components for 
investigation of complaints, the State must have a means of 
communicating information among appropriate entities, and the State 
survey agency retains responsibility for the investigation process.
    (4) If, after investigating a complaint, the State has reason to 
believe that an identifiable individual neglected or abused a resident, 
or misappropriated a resident's property, the State survey agency must 
act on the complaint in accordance with Sec. 488.335.
    (b) On-site monitoring. The State survey agency conducts on-site 
monitoring on an as necessary basis when--
    (1) A facility is not in substantial compliance with the 
requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies;

[[Page 767]]

    (2) A facility has corrected deficiencies and verification of 
continued substantial compliance is needed; or
    (3) The survey agency has reason to question the substantial 
compliance of the facility with a requirement of participation.
    (c) Composition of the investigative team. A State may use a 
specialized team, which may include an attorney, auditor and appropriate 
health professionals, to identify, survey, gather and preserve evidence, 
and administer remedies to noncompliant facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 488.334  Educational programs.

    A State must conduct periodic educational programs for the staff and 
residents (and their representatives) of SNFs and NFs in order to 
present current regulations, procedures, and policies on the survey, 
certification and enforcement process under this subpart and subpart F 
of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 488.335  Action on complaints of resident neglect and abuse, and misappropriation of resident property.

    (a) Investigation. (1) The State must review all allegations of 
resident neglect and abuse, and misappropriation of resident property 
and follow procedures specified in Sec. 488.332.
    (2) If there is reason to believe, either through oral or written 
evidence that an individual used by a facility to provide services to 
residents could have abused or neglected a resident or misappropriated a 
resident's property, the State must investigate the allegation.
    (3) The State must have written procedures for the timely review and 
investigation of allegations of resident abuse and neglect, and 
misappropriation of resident property.
    (b) Source of complaints. The State must review all allegations 
regardless of the source.
    (c) Notification--(1) Individuals to be notified. If the State makes 
a preliminary determination, based on oral or written evidence and its

occurred, it must notify in writing--
    (i) The individuals implicated in the investigation; and
    (ii) The current administrator of the facility in which the incident 
occurred.
    (2) Timing of the notice. The State must notify the individuals 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in writing within 10

the individual has had the opportunity for a hearing, to the nurse aide 
registry or appropriate licensure authority;
    (v) Fact that the individual's failure to request a hearing in 
writing within 30 days from the date of the notice will result in 
reporting the substantiated findings to the nurse aide registry or 
appropriate licensure authority.
    (vi) Consequences of waiving the right to a hearing;
    (vii) Consequences of a finding through the hearing process that the 
alleged resident abuse or neglect, or misappropriation of resident 
property did occur; and
    (viii) Fact that the individual has the right to be represented by 
an attorney at the individual's own expense.
    (d) Conduct of hearing. (1) The State must complete the hearing and 
the hearing record within 120 days from the day it receives the request 
for a hearing.
    (2) The State must hold the hearing at a reasonable place and time 
convenient for the individual.
    (e) Factors beyond the individual's control. A State must not make a 
finding that an individual has neglected a resident if the individual 
demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control 
of the individual.
    (f) Report of findings. If the finding is that the individual has 
neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property or 
if the individual waives the right to a hearing, the State must report 
the findings in writing within 10 working days to--

Subpart F--Enforcement of Compliance for Long-Term Care Facilities with 
                              Deficiencies

    Source: 59 FR 56243, Nov. 10, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 488.400  Statutory basis.

    Sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act specify remedies that may be 
used by the Secretary or the State respectively when a SNF or a NF is 
not in substantial compliance with the requirements for participation in 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These sections also provide for 
ensuring prompt compliance and specify that these remedies are in 
addition to any others available under State or Federal law, and, except 
for civil money penalties, are imposed prior to the conduct of a 
hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 488.401  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    New admission means a resident who is admitted to the facility on or 
after the effective date of a denial of payment remedy and, if 
previously admitted, has been discharged before that effective date. 
Residents admitted before the effective date of the denial of payment, 
and taking temporary leave, are not considered new admissions, nor 
subject to the denial of payment.
    Plan of correction means a plan developed by the facility and 
approved by HCFA or the survey agency that describes the actions the 
facility will take to correct deficiencies and specifies the date by 
which those deficiencies will be corrected.

[59 FR 56243, Nov. 10, 1994; 60 FR 50118, Sept. 28, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 488.402  General provisions.

    (a) Purpose of remedies. The purpose of remedies is to ensure prompt 
compliance with program requirements.
    (b) Basis for imposition and duration of remedies. When HCFA or the 
State chooses to apply one or more remedies specified in Sec. 488.406, 
the remedies are applied on the basis of noncompliance found during 
surveys conducted by HCFA or by the survey agency.
    (c) Number of remedies. HCFA or the State may apply one or more 
remedies for each deficiency constituting noncompliance or for all 
deficiencies constituting noncompliance.
    (d) Plan of correction requirement. (1) Except as specified in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, regardless of which remedy is applied, 
each facility that has deficiencies with respect to program requirements 
must submit a plan of correction for approval by HCFA or the survey 
agency.
    (2) Isolated deficiencies. A facility is not required to submit a 
plan of correction when it has deficiencies that are isolated and have a 
potential for minimal harm, but no actual harm has occurred.

[[Page 769]]

    (e) Disagreement regarding remedies. If the State and HCFA disagree 
on the decision to impose a remedy, the disagreement is resolved in 
accordance with Sec. 488.452.
    (f) Notification requirements--(1) Except when the State is taking 
action against a non-State operated NF, HCFA or the State (as authorized 
by HCFA) gives the provider notice of the remedy, including the--
    (i) Nature of the noncompliance;
    (ii) Which remedy is imposed;
    (iii) Effective date of the remedy; and
    (iv) Right to appeal the determination leading to the remedy.
    (2) When a State is taking action against a non-State operated NF, 
the State's notice must include the same information required by HCFA in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
    (3) Immediate jeopardy--2 day notice. Except for civil money 
penalties and State monitoring imposed when there is immediate jeopardy, 
for all remedies specified in Sec. 488.406 imposed when there is 
immediate jeopardy, the notice must be given at least 2 calendar days 
before the effective date of the enforcement action.
    (4) No immediate jeopardy--15 day notice. Except for civil money 
penalties and State monitoring, notice must be given at least 15 
calendar days before the effective date of the enforcement action in 
situations in which there is no immediate jeopardy.
    (5) Latest date of enforcement action. The 2 and 15-day notice 
periods begin when the facility receives the notice, but, in no event 
will the effective date of the enforcement action be later than 20 
calendar days after the notice is sent.
    (6) Civil money penalties. For civil money penalties, the notices 
must be given in accordance with the provisions of Secs. 488.434 and 
488.440.
    (7) State monitoring. For State monitoring, no prior notice is 
required.

<R05>
Sec. 488.404  Factors to be considered in selecting remedies.

    (a) Initial assessment. In order to select the appropriate remedy, 
if any, to apply to a facility with deficiencies, HCFA and the State 
determine the seriousness of the deficiencies.
    (b) Determining seriousness of deficiencies. To determine the 
seriousness of the deficiency, HCFA considers and the State must 
consider at least the following factors:
    (1) Whether a facility's deficiencies constitute--
    (i) No actual harm with a potential for minimal harm;
    (ii) No actual harm with a potential for more than minimal harm, but 
not immediate jeopardy;
    (iii) Actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy; or
    (iv) Immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety.
    (2) Whether the deficiencies--
    (i) Are isolated;
    (ii) Constitute a pattern; or
    (iii) Are widespread.
    (c) Other factors which may be considered in choosing a remedy 
within a remedy category. Following the initial assessment, HCFA and the 
State may consider other factors, which may include, but are not limited 
to the following:
    (1) The relationship of the one deficiency to other deficiencies 
resulting in noncompliance.
    (2) The facility's prior history of noncompliance in general and 
specifically with reference to the cited deficiencies.

noncompliance that are either additional or alternative to those 
specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, it must--
    (1) Specify those remedies in the State plan; and
    (2) Demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that those remedies are as 
effective as the remedies listed in paragraph (a) of this section, for 
deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies.
    (d) State remedies in dually participating facilities. If the 
State's remedy is unique to the State plan and has been approved by 
HCFA, then that remedy, as imposed by the State under its Medicaid 
authority, may be imposed by HCFA against the Medicare provider 
agreement of a dually participating facility.

<R05>
Sec. 488.410  Action when there is immediate jeopardy.

    (a) If there is immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety, the 
State must (and HCFA does) either terminate the provider agreement 
within 23 calendar days of the last date of the survey or appoint a 
temporary manager to remove the immediate jeopardy. The rules for 
appointment of a temporary manager in an immediate jeopardy situation 
are as follows:
    (1) HCFA does and the State must notify the facility that a 
temporary manager is being appointed.
    (2) If the facility fails to relinquish control to the temporary 
manager, HCFA does and the State must terminate the provider agreement 
within 23 calendar days of the last day of the survey, if the immediate 
jeopardy is not removed. In these cases, State monitoring may be imposed 
pending termination.
    (3) If the facility relinquishes control to the temporary manager, 
the State must (and HCFA does) notify the facility that, unless it 
removes the immediate jeopardy, its provider agreement will be 
terminated within 23 calendar days of the last day of the survey.
    (4) HCFA does and the State must terminate the provider agreement 
within 23 calendar days of the last day of survey if the immediate 
jeopardy has not been removed.
    (b) HCFA or the State may also impose other remedies, as 
appropriate.
    (c)(1) In a NF or dually participating facility, if either HCFA or 
the State finds that a facility's noncompliance poses immediate jeopardy 
to resident health or safety, HCFA or the State must notify the other of 
such a finding.
    (2) HCFA will or the State must do one or both of the following:
    (i) Take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the 
noncompliance through temporary management.
    (ii) Terminate the facility's participation under the State plan. If 
this is done, HCFA will also terminate the facility's participation in 
Medicare if it is a dually participating facility.
    (d) The State must provide for the safe and orderly transfer of 
residents when the facility is terminated.
    (e) If the immediate jeopardy is also substandard quality of care, 
the State survey agency must notify attending physicians and the State 
board responsible for licensing the facility administrator of the 
finding of substandard quality of care, as specified in Sec. 488.325(h).

<R05>
Sec. 488.412  Action when there is no immediate jeopardy.

    (a) If a facility's deficiencies do not pose immediate jeopardy to 
residents' health or safety, and the facility is not in substantial 
compliance, HCFA or the State may terminate the facility's provider 
agreement or may allow the facility to continue to participate for no 
longer than 6 months from the last day of the survey if--
    (1) The State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to 
impose alternative remedies than to terminate the facility's provider 
agreement;
    (2) The State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective 
action approved by HCFA; and
    (3) The facility in the case of a Medicare SNF or the State in the 
case of a Medicaid NF agrees to repay to the Federal government payments 
received after the last day of the survey that first identified the 
deficiencies if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the 
approved plan of correction.
    (b) If a facility does not meet the criteria for continuation of 
payment under paragraph (a) of this section, HCFA will and the State 
must terminate the facility's provider agreement.
    (c) HCFA does and the State must deny payment for new admissions 
when a facility is not in substantial compliance 3 months after the last 
day of the survey.
    (d) HCFA terminates the provider agreement for SNFs and NFs, and 
stops FFP to a State for a NF for which participation was continued 
under paragraph (a) of this section, if the facility is not in 
substantial compliance within 6 months of the last day of the survey.

<R05>
Sec. 488.414  Action when there is repeated substandard quality of care.

    (a) General. If a facility has been found to have provided 
substandard quality of care on the last three consecutive standard 
surveys, as defined in Sec. 488.305, regardless of other remedies 
provided--
    (1) HCFA imposes denial of payment for all new admissions, as 
specified in Sec. 488.417, or denial of all payments, as specified in 
Sec. 488.418;
    (2) The State must impose denial of payment for all new admissions, 
as specified in Sec. 488.417; and
    (3) HCFA does and the State survey agency must impose State 
monitoring, as specified in Sec. 488.422, until the facility has 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State, that it is in 
substantial compliance with all requirements and will remain in 
substantial compliance with all requirements.
    (b) Repeated noncompliance. For purposes of this section, repeated 
noncompliance is based on the repeated finding of substandard quality of 
care and not on the basis that the substance of the deficiency or the 
exact tag number for the deficiency was repeated.
    (c) Standard surveys to which this provision applies. Standard 
surveys completed by the State survey agency on or after October 1, 
1990, are used to determine whether the threshold of three consecutive 
standard surveys is met.
    (d) Program participation. (1) The determination that a certified 
facility has repeated instances of substandard quality of care is made 
without regard to any variances in the facility's program participation 
(that is, any standard survey completed for Medicare, Medicaid or both 
programs will be considered).
    (2) Termination would allow the count of repeated substandard 
quality of care surveys to start over.
    (3) Change of ownership. (i) A facility may not avoid a remedy on 
the basis that it underwent a change of ownership.
    (ii) In a facility that has undergone a change of ownership, HCFA 
does not and the State may not restart the count of repeated substandard 
quality of care surveys unless the new owner can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of HCFA or the State that the poor past performance no 
longer is a factor due to the change in ownership.
    (e) Facility alleges corrections or achieves compliance after 
repeated substandard quality of care is identified. (1) If a penalty is 
imposed for repeated substandard quality of care, it will continue until 
the facility has demonstrated to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State 
that it is in substantial compliance with the requirements and

[[Page 773]]

that it will remain in substantial compliance with the requirements for 
a period of time specified by HCFA or the State.
    (2) A facility will not avoid the imposition of remedies or the 
obligation to demonstrate that it will remain in compliance when it--
    (i) Alleges correction of the deficiencies cited in the most recent 
standard survey; or
    (ii) Achieves compliance before the effective date of the remedies.


<R05>
Sec. 488.415  Temporary management.

    (a) Definition. Temporary management means the temporary appointment 
by HCFA or the State of a substitute facility manager or administrator 
with authority to hire, terminate or reassign staff, obligate facility 
funds, alter facility procedures, and manage the facility to correct 
deficiencies identified in the facility's operation.
    (b) Qualifications. The temporary manager must--
    (1) Be qualified to oversee correction of deficiencies on the basis 
of experience and education, as determined by the State;
    (2) Not have been found guilty of misconduct by any licensing board 
or professional society in any State;
    (3) Have, or a member of his or her immediate family have, no 
financial ownership interest in the facility; and
    (4) Not currently serve or, within the past 2 years, have served as 
a member of the staff of the facility.

    (1) Is paid directly by the facility while the temporary manager is 
assigned to that facility; and
    (2) Must be at least equivalent to the sum of the following--
    (i) The prevailing salary paid by providers for positions of this 
type in what the State considers to be the facility's geographic area;
    (ii) Additional costs that would have reasonably been incurred by 
the provider if such person had been in an employment relationship; and
    (iii) Any other costs incurred by such a person in furnishing 
services under such an arrangement or as otherwise set by the State.
    (3) May exceed the amount specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section if the State is otherwise unable to attract a qualified 
temporary manager.
    (d) Failure to relinquish authority to temporary management--(1) 
Termination of provider agreement. If a facility fails to relinquish 
authority to the temporary manager as described in this section, HCFA 
will or the State must terminate the provider agreement in accordance 
with Sec. 488.456.
    (2) Failure to pay salary of temporary manager. A facility's failure 
to pay the salary of the temporary manager is considered a failure to 
relinquish authority to temporary management.
    (e) Duration of temporary management. Temporary management ends when 
the facility meets any of the conditions specified in Sec. 488.454(c).


<R05>
Sec. 488.417  Denial of payment for all new admissions.

Sec. 488.401, 3 months after the last day of the survey identifying the 
noncompliance; or
    (2) The State survey agency has cited a facility with substandard 
quality of care on the last three consecutive standard surveys.
    (c) Resumption of payments: Repeated instances of substandard 
quality of care. When a facility has repeated instances of substandard 
quality of care, payments to the facility or, under Medicaid, HCFA 
payments to the State on

[[Page 774]]

behalf of the facility, resume on the date that--
    (1) The facility achieves substantial compliance as indicated by a 
revisit or written credible evidence acceptable to HCFA (for all 
facilities except non-State operated NFs against which HCFA is imposing 
no remedies) or the State (for non-State operated NFs against which HCFA 
is imposing no remedies); and
    (2) HCFA (for all facilities except non-State operated NFs against 
which HCFA is imposing no remedies) or the State (for non-State operated 
NFs against which HCFA is imposing no remedies) believes that the 
facility is capable of remaining in substantial compliance.
    (d) Resumption of payments: No repeated instances of substandard 
quality of care. When a facility does not have repeated instances of 
substandard quality of care, payments to the facility or, under

prospectively on the date that the facility achieves substantial 
compliance, as indicated by a revisit or written credible evidence 
acceptable to HCFA (under Medicare) or the State (under Medicaid).
    (e) Restriction. No payments to a facility or, under Medicaid, HCFA 
payments to the State on behalf of the facility, are made for the period

    (a) HCFA option to deny all payment. If a facility has not met a 
requirement, in addition to the authority to deny payment for all new 
admissions as specified in Sec. 488.417, HCFA may deny any further 
payment for all Medicare residents in the facility and to the State for 
all Medicaid residents in the facility.
    (b) Prospective resumption of payment. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, if the facility achieves 
substantial compliance, HCFA resumes payment prospectively from the date 
that it verifies as the date that the facility achieved substantial 
compliance.
    (c) Restriction on payment after denial of payment is imposed. If 
payment to the facility or to the State resumes after denial of payment 
for all residents, no payment is made for the period between the date 
that--
    (1) Denial of payment was imposed; and
    (2) HCFA verifies as the date that the facility achieved substantial 
compliance.
    (d) Retroactive resumption of payment. Except when a facility has 
repeated instances of substandard quality of care, as specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section, when HCFA or the State finds that the 
facility was in substantial compliance before the date of the revisit, 
or before HCFA or the survey agency received credible evidence of such 
compliance, payment is resumed on the date that substantial compliance 
was achieved, as determined by HCFA.
    (e) Resumption of payment--repeated instances of substandard care. 
When HCFA denies payment for all Medicare residents for repeated 
instances of substandard quality of care, payment is resumed when--
    (1) The facility achieved substantial compliance, as indicated by a 
revisit or written credible evidence acceptable to HCFA; and
    (2) HCFA believes that the facility will remain in substantial 
compliance.

noncompliance which, after imposition of a lower level penalty amount, 
becomes sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy.
    (2) HCFA does and the State must increase the penalty amount for any 
repeated deficiencies for which a lower level penalty amount was 
previously imposed, regardless of whether the increased penalty amount 
would exceed the range otherwise reserved for nonimmediate jeopardy 
deficiencies.
    (3) Repeated deficiencies are deficiencies in the same regulatory 
grouping of requirements found at the last survey, subsequently 
corrected, and found again at the next survey.
    (e) Review of the penalty. When an administrative law judge or State 
hearing officer (or higher administrative review authority) finds that 
the basis for imposing a civil money penalty exists, as specified in 
Sec. 488.430, the administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or 
higher administrative review authority) may not--
    (1) Set a penalty of zero or reduce a penalty to zero;
    (2) Review the exercise of discretion by HCFA or the State to impose 
a civil money penalty; and
    (3) Consider any factors in reviewing the amount of the penalty 
other than those specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Factors affecting the amount of penalty. In determining the 
amount of penalty, HCFA does or the State must take into account the 
following factors:
    (1) The facility's history of noncompliance, including repeated 
deficiencies.
    (2) The facility's financial condition.
    (3) The factors specified in Sec. 488.404.
    (4) The facility's degree of culpability. Culpability for purposes 
of this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, neglect, 
indifference, or disregard for resident care, comfort or safety. The 
absence of culpability is not a mitigating circumstance in reducing the 
amount of the penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 488.440  Civil money penalties: Effective date and duration of penalty.

    (a) When penalty begins to accrue. The civil money penalty may start 
accruing as early as the date that the facility was first out of 
compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State.
    (b) Duration of penalty. The civil money penalty is computed and 
collectible, as specified in Secs. 488.432 and 488.442, for the number 
of days of noncompliance until the date the facility achieves 
substantial compliance, or, if applicable, the date of termination 
when--
    (1) HCFA's or the State's decision of noncompliance is upheld after 
a final administrative decision;
    (2) The facility waives its right to a hearing in accordance with 
Sec. 488.436; or
    (3) The time for requesting a hearing has expired and HCFA or the 
State has not received a hearing request from the facility.
    (c) The entire accrued penalty is due and collectible, as specified 
in the notice sent to the provider under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section.
    (d) When a facility achieves substantial compliance, HCFA does or 
the State must send a separate notice to the facility containing--
    (1) The amount of penalty per day;
    (2) The number of days involved;
    (3) The total amount due;
    (4) The due date of the penalty; and
    (5) The rate of interest assessed on the unpaid balance beginning on 
the due date, as provided in Sec. 488.442.
    (e) In the case of a terminated facility, HCFA does or the State 
must send this penalty information after the--
    (1) Final administrative decision is made;
    (2) Facility has waived its right to a hearing in accordance with 
Sec. 488.436; or
    (3) Time for requesting a hearing has expired and HCFA or the state 
has not received a hearing request from the facility.
    (f) Accrual of penalties when there is no immediate jeopardy. (1) In 
the case of noncompliance that does not pose immediate jeopardy, the 
daily accrual of civil money penalties is imposed for

[[Page 778]]

the days of noncompliance prior to the notice specified in Sec. 488.434 
and an additional period of no longer than 6 months following the last 
day of the survey.
    (2) After the period specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, 
if the facility has not achieved substantial compliance, HCFA terminates 
the provider agreement and the State may terminate the provider 
agreement.
    (g) Accrual of penalties when there is immediate jeopardy. (1) When 
a facility has deficiencies that pose immediate jeopardy, HCFA does or 
the State must terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days 
after the last day of the survey if the immediate jeopardy remains.
    (2) The accrual of the civil money penalty stops on the day the 
provider agreement is terminated.
    (h) Documenting substantial compliance. (1) If an on-site revisit is 
necessary to confirm substantial compliance and the provider can supply 
documentation acceptable to HCFA or the State agency that substantial 
compliance was achieved on a date preceding the revisit, penalties only 
accrue until that date of correction for which there is written credible 
evidence.
    (2) If an on-site revisit is not necessary to confirm substantial 
compliance, penalties only accrue until the date of correction for which 
HCFA or the State receives and accepts written credible evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 488.442  Civil money penalties: Due date for payment of penalty.

    (a) When payments are due--(1) After a final administrative 
decision. A civil money penalty payment is due 15 days after a final 
administrative decision is made when--
    (i) The facility achieves substantial compliance before the final 
administrative decision; or
    (ii) The effective date of termination occurs before the final 
administrative decision.
    (2) When no hearing was requested. A civil money penalty payment is 
due 15 days after the time period for requesting a hearing has expired 
and a hearing request was not received when--
    (i) The facility achieved substantial compliance before the hearing 
request was due; or
    (ii) The effective date of termination occurs before the hearing 
request was due.
    (3) After a request to waive a hearing. A civil money penalty 
payment is due 15 days after receipt of the written request to waive a 
hearing when--
    (i) The facility achieved substantial compliance before HCFA or the 
State received the written waiver of hearing; or
    (ii) The effective date of termination occurs before HCFA or the 
State received the written waiver of hearing.
    (4) After substantial compliance is achieved. A civil money penalty 
payment is due 15 days after substantial compliance is achieved when--
    (i) The final administrative decision is made before the facility 
came into substantial compliance;
    (ii) The facility did not file a timely hearing request before it 
came into substantial compliance; or
    (iii) The facility waived its right to a hearing before it came into 
substantial compliance;
    (5) After the effective date of termination. A civil money penalty 
payment is due 15 days after the effective date of termination, if 
before the effective date of termination--
    (i) The final administrative decision was made;
    (ii) The time for requesting a hearing has expired and the facility 
did not request a hearing; or
    (iii) The facility waived its right to a hearing.
    (6) In the cases specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 
period of noncompliance may not extend beyond 6 months from the last day 
of the survey.
    (b) Deduction of penalty from amount owed. The amount of the 
penalty, when determined, may be deducted from any sum then or later 
owing by HCFA or the State to the facility.
    (c) Interest--(1) Assessment. Interest is assessed on the unpaid 
balance of the penalty, beginning on the due date.
    (2) Medicare interest. Medicare rate of interest is the higher of--

[[Page 779]]

    (i) The rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking 
into consideration private consumer rates of interest prevailing on the 
date of the notice of the penalty amount due (published quarterly in the 
Federal Register by HHS under 45 CFR 30.13(a)); or
    (ii) The current value of funds (published annually in the Federal 
Register by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to quarterly 
revisions).
    (3) Medicaid interest. The interest rate for Medicaid is determined 
by the State.
    (d) Penalties collected by HCFA. Civil money penalties and 
corresponding interest collected by HCFA from--
    (1) Medicare-participating facilities are deposited as miscellaneous 
receipts of the United States Treasury; and
    (2) Medicaid-participating facilities are returned to the State.
    (e) Collection from dually participating facilities. Civil money 
penalties collected from dually participating facilities are deposited 
as miscellaneous receipts of the United States Treasury and returned to 
the State in proportion commensurate with the relative proportions of 
Medicare and Medicaid beds at the facility actually in use by residents 
covered by the respective programs on the date the civil money penalty 
begins to accrue.
    (f) Penalties collected by the State. Civil money penalties 
collected by the State must be applied to the protection of the health 
or property of residents of facilities that the State or HCFA finds 
noncompliant, such as--
    (1) Payment for the cost of relocating residents to other 
facilities;
    (2) State costs related to the operation of a facility pending 
correction of deficiencies or closure; and
    (3) Reimbursement of residents for personal funds or property lost 
at a facility as a result of actions by the facility or by individuals 
used by the facility to provide services to residents.

<R05>
Sec. 488.444  Civil money penalties: Settlement of penalties.

    (a) HCFA has authority to settle cases at any time prior to a final 
administrative decision for Medicare-only SNFs, State-operated 
facilities, or other facilities for which HCFA's enforcement action 
prevails, in accordance with Sec. 488.330.
    (b) The State has the authority to settle cases at any time prior to 
the evidentiary hearing decision for all cases in which the State's 
enforcement action prevails.


<R05>
Sec. 488.450  Continuation of payments to a facility with deficiencies.

    (a) Criteria. (1) HCFA may continue payments to a facility not in 
substantial compliance for the periods specified in paragraph (c) of 
this section if the following criteria are met:
    (i) The State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to 
impose alternative remedies than to terminate the facility;
    (ii) The State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective 
action approved by HCFA; and
    (iii) The facility, in the case of a Medicare SNF, or the State, in 
the case of a Medicaid NF, agrees to repay the Federal government 
payments received under this provision if corrective action is not taken 
in accordance with the approved plan and timetable for corrective 
action.
    (2) HCFA or the State may terminate the SNF or NF agreement before 
the end of the correction period if the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section are not met.
    (b) Cessation of payments. If termination is not sought, either by 
itself or along with another remedy or remedies, or any of the criteria 
set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not met or agreed to 
by either the facility or the State, the facility or State will receive 
no Medicare or Federal Medicaid payments, as applicable, from the last 
day of the survey.
    (c) Period of continued payments. If the conditions in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section are met, HCFA may continue payments to a Medicare 
facility or to the State for a Medicaid facility with noncompliance that 
does not constitute immediate jeopardy for up to 6 months from the last 
day of the survey.
    (d) Failure to achieve substantial compliance. If the facility does 
not achieve substantial compliance by the end of

[[Page 780]]

the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section,
    (1) HCFA will--
    (i) Terminate the provider agreement of the Medicare SNF in 
accordance with Sec. 488.456; or
    (ii) Discontinue Federal funding to the SNF for Medicare; and
    (iii) Discontinue FFP to the State for the Medicaid NF.
    (2) The State may terminate the provider agreement for the NF.

[59 FR 56243, Nov. 10, 1994; 60 FR 50119, Sept. 28, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 488.452  State and Federal disagreements involving findings not in agreement in non-State operated NFs and dually participating facilities when there is no 
          immediate jeopardy.

    The following rules apply when HCFA and the State disagree over 
findings of noncompliance or application of remedies in a non-State 
operated NF or dually participating facility:
    (a) Disagreement over whether facility has met requirements. (1) The 
State's finding of noncompliance takes precedence when--
    (i) HCFA finds that a NF or a dually participating facility is in 
substantial compliance with the participation requirements; and
    (ii) The State finds that a NF or dually participating facility has 
not achieved substantial compliance.
    (2) HCFA's findings of noncompliance take precedence when--
    (i) HCFA finds that a NF or a dually participating facility has not 
achieved substantial compliance; and
    (ii) The State finds that a NF or a dually participating facility is 
in substantial compliance with the participation requirements.
    (3) When HCFA's survey findings take precedence, HCFA may--
    (i) Impose any of the alternative remedies specified in 
Sec. 488.406;
    (ii) Terminate the provider agreement subject to the applicable 
conditions of Sec. 488.450; and
    (iii) Stop FFP to the State for a NF.
    (b) Disagreement over decision to terminate. (1) HCFA's decision to 
terminate the participation of a facility takes precedence when--
    (i) Both HCFA and the State find that the facility has not achieved 
substantial compliance; and
    (ii) HCFA, but not the State, finds that the facility's 
participation should be terminated. HCFA will permit continuation of 
payment during the period prior to the effective date of termination not 
to exceed 6 months, if the applicable conditions of Sec. 488.450 are 
met.
    (2) The State's decision to terminate a facility's participation and 
the procedures for appealing such termination, as specified in 
Sec. 431.153(c) of this chapter, takes precedence when--
    (i) The State, but not HCFA, finds that a NF's participation should 
be terminated; and
    (ii) The State's effective date for the termination of the NF's 
provider agreement is no later than 6 months after the last day of 
survey.
    (c) Disagreement over timing of termination of facility. The State's 
timing of termination takes precedence if it does not occur later than 6 
months after the last day of the survey when both HCFA and the State 
find that--
    (1) A facility is not in substantial compliance; and
    (2) The facility's participation should be terminated.
    (d) Disagreement over remedies. (1) When HCFA or the State, but not 
both, establishes one or more remedies, in addition to or as an 
alternative to termination, the additional or alternative remedies will 
also apply when--
    (i) Both HCFA and the State find that a facility has not achieved 
substantial compliance; and
    (ii) Both HCFA and the State find that no immediate jeopardy exists.
    (2) Overlap of remedies. When HCFA and the State establish one or 
more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination, only 
the HCFA remedies apply when both HCFA and the State find that a 
facility has not achieved substantial compliance.
    (e) Regardless of whether HCFA's or the State's decision controls, 
only one noncompliance and enforcement decision is applied to the 
Medicaid agreement, and for a dually participating facility, that same 
decision will apply to the Medicare agreement.

[[Page 781]]


<R05>
Sec. 488.454  Duration of remedies.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, 
alternative remedies continue until--
    (1) The facility has achieved substantial compliance, as determined 
by HCFA or the State based upon a revisit or after an examination of 
credible written evidence that it can verify without an on-site visit; 
or
    (2) HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement.
    (b) In the cases of State monitoring and denial of payment imposed 
for repeated substandard quality of care, remedies continue until--
    (1) HCFA or the State determines that the facility has achieved 
substantial compliance and is capable of remaining in substantial 
compliance; or
    (2) HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement.
    (c) In the case of temporary management, the remedy continues 
until--
    (1) HCFA or the State determines that the facility has achieved 
substantial compliance and is capable of remaining in substantial 
compliance;
    (2) HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement; or
    (3) The facility which has not achieved substantial compliance 
reassumes management control. In this case, HCFA or the State initiates 
termination of the provider agreement and may impose additional 
remedies.
    (d) If the facility can supply documentation acceptable to HCFA or 
the State survey agency that it was in substantial compliance, and was 
capable of remaining in substantial compliance, if necessary, on a date 
preceding that of the revisit, the remedies terminate on the date that 
HCFA or the State can verify as the date that substantial compliance was 
achieved and the facility demonstrated that it could maintain 
substantial compliance, if necessary.

[59 FR 56243, Nov. 10, 1994; 60 FR 50119, Sept. 28, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 488.456  Termination of provider agreement.

    (a) Effect of termination. Termination of the provider agreement 
ends--
    (1) Payment to the facility; and
    (2) Any alternative remedy.
    (b) Basis for termination. (1) HCFA and the State may terminate a 
facility's provider agreement if a facility--
    (i) Is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of 
participation, regardless of whether or not immediate jeopardy is 
present; or
    (ii) Fails to submit an acceptable plan of correction within the 
timeframe specified by HCFA or the State.
    (2) HCFA and the State terminate a facility's provider agreement if 
a facility--
    (i) Fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, if that 
remedy is imposed by HCFA or the State; or
    (ii) Does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of 
payment as set forth in Sec. 488.412(a)(1).
    (c) Notice of termination. Before terminating a provider agreement, 
HCFA does and the State must notify the facility and the public--
    (1) At least 2 calendar days before the effective date of 
termination for a facility with immediate jeopardy deficiencies; and
    (2) At least 15 calendar days before the effective date of 
termination for a facility with non-immediate jeopardy deficiencies that 
constitute noncompliance.
    (d) Procedures for termination. (1) HCFA terminates the provider 
agreement in accordance with procedures set forth in Sec. 489.53 of this 
chapter; and
    (2) The State must terminate the provider agreement of a NF in 
accordance with procedures specified in parts 431 and 442 of this 
chapter.

official, to HCFA, together with a written statement indicating whether 
it has been adjudged insolvent or bankrupt in any State or Federal 
court, or whether any insolvency or bankruptcy actions are pending.

assurance of compliance with the requirements of title XVIII of the Act.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 489.13  Effective date of agreement or approval.

    (a) Applicability--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, this section applies to Medicare provider 
agreements with, and supplier approval of, entities that, as a basis for 
participation in Medicare--
    (i) Are subject to survey and certification by HCFA or the State 
survey agency; or
    (ii) Are deemed to meet Federal requirements on the basis of 
accreditation by an accrediting organization whose program has HCFA 
approval at the time of accreditation survey and accreditation decision.
    (2) Exceptions. (i) For an agreement with a community mental health 
center (CMHC) or a Federally qualified health center (FQHC), the 
effective date is the date on which HCFA accepts a signed agreement 
which assures that the CMHC or FQHC meets all Federal requirements.
    (ii) A Medicare supplier approval of a laboratory is effective only 
while the laboratory has in effect a valid CLIA certificate issued under 
part 493 of this chapter, and only for the specialty and

[[Page 785]]

subspecialty tests it is authorized to perform.
    (b) All Federal requirements are met on the date of survey. The 
agreement or approval is effective on the date the survey (including the 
Life Safety Code survey, if applicable) is completed, if on that date 
the provider or supplier meets all applicable Federal requirements as 
set forth in this chapter. (If the agreement or approval is time-
limited, the new agreement or approval is effective on the day following 
expiration of the current agreement or approval.)
    (c) All Federal requirements are not met on the date of survey. If 
on the date the survey is completed the provider or supplier fails to 
meet any of the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the following rules apply:
    (1) For an agreement with an SNF, the effective date is the date on 
which--
    (i) The SNF is in substantial compliance (as defined in Sec. 488.301 
of this chapter) with the requirements for participation; and
    (ii) HCFA or the State survey agency receives from the SNF, if 
applicable, an approvable waiver request.
    (2) For an agreement with, or an approval of, any other provider or 
supplier, (except those specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), 
the effective date is the earlier of the following:
    (i) The date on which the provider or supplier meets all 
requirements.
    (ii) The date on which a provider or supplier is found to meet all 
conditions of participation or coverage, but has lower level 
deficiencies, and HCFA or the State survey agency receives an acceptable 
plan of correction for the lower level deficiencies, or an approvable 
waiver request, or both. (The date of receipt is the effective date 
regardless of when HCFA approves the plan of correction or the waiver 
request, or both.)
    (d) Accredited provider or supplier requests participation in the 
Medicare program--(1) General rule. If the provider or supplier is 
currently accredited by a national accrediting organization whose 
program had HCFA approval at the time of accreditation survey and 
accreditation decision, and on the basis of accreditation, HCFA has 
deemed the provider or supplier to meet Federal requirements, the 
effective date depends on whether the provider or supplier is subject to 
requirements in addition to those included in the accrediting 
organization's approved program.
    (i) Provider or supplier subject to additional requirements. If the 
provider or supplier is subject to additional requirements, the 
effective date of the agreement or approval is the date on which the 
provider or supplier meets all requirements, including the additional 
requirements.
    (ii) Provider or supplier not subject to additional requirements. 
For a provider or supplier that is not subject to additional 
requirements, the effective date is the date of the provider's or 
supplier's initial request for participation if on that date the 
provider or supplier met all Federal requirements.
    (2) Special rule: Retroactive effective date. If a provider or 
supplier meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(1)(i) or 
(d)(1)(ii) of this section, the effective date may be retroactive for up 
to one year to encompass dates on which the provider or supplier 
furnished, to a Medicare beneficiary, covered services for which it has 
not been paid.

<R05>
Sec. 489.18  Change of ownership or leasing: Effect on provider agreement.

    (a) What constitutes change of ownership--(1) Partnership. In the 
case of a partnership, the removal, addition, or substitution of a 
partner, unless the partners expressly agree otherwise, as permitted by 
applicable State law, constitutes change of ownership.
    (2) Unincorporated sole proprietorship. Transfer of title and 
property to another party constitutes change of ownership.
    (3) Corporation. The merger of the provider corporation into another 
corporation, or the consolidation of two or more corporations, resulting 
in the creation of a new corporation constitutes change of ownership. 
Transfer of corporate stock or the merger of another corporation into 
the provider corporation does not constitute change of ownership.

[[Page 786]]

    (4) Leasing. The lease of all or part of a provider facility 
constitutes change of ownership of the leased portion.
    (b) Notice to HCFA. A provider who is contemplating or negotiating a 
change of ownership must notify HCFA.
    (c) Assignment of agreement. When there is a change of ownership as 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the existing provider 
agreement will automatically be assigned to the new owner.
    (d) Conditions that apply to assigned agreements. An assigned 
agreement is subject to all applicable statutes and regulations and to 
the terms and conditions under which it was originally issued including, 
but not limited to, the following:
    (1) Any existing plan of correction.
    (2) Compliance with applicable health and safety standards.
    (3) Compliance with the ownership and financial interest disclosure 
requirements of part 420, subpart C, of this chapter.
    (4) Compliance with civil rights requirements set forth in 45 CFR 
Parts 80, 84, and 90.
    (e) Effect of leasing. The provider agreement will be assigned to 
the lessee only to the extent of the leased portion of the facility.

    (f) To maintain a system that, during the admission process, 
identifies any primary payers other than Medicare, so that incorrect

can show that--
    (A) It failed to file a proper claim solely because the beneficiary, 
for any reason other than mental or physical incapacity, failed to give 
the provider the necessary information; or
    (B) The beneficiary, who was responsible for filing a proper claim,

    (j) In the State of Oregon, because of a court decision, and in the 
absence of a reversal on appeal or a statutory clarification overturning 
the decision, hospitals may bill liability insurers first. However, if 
the liability insurer does not pay ``promptly'', as defined in 
Sec. 411.50 of this chapter, the hospital must withdraw its claim or 
lien and bill Medicare for covered services.

Sec. 489.21  Specific limitations on charges.

    Except as specified in subpart C of this part, the provider agrees 
not to charge a beneficiary for any of the following:
    (a) Services for which the beneficiary is entitled to have payment 
made under Medicare.
    (b) Services for which the beneficiary would be entitled to have 
payment made if the provider--

review of long stay cases so that a limitation on days of service has 
not been imposed under section 1866(d) of the Act (see subpart K of part

and
    (4) Had obtained, from the beneficiary or a person acting on his or 
her behalf, a written request for payment to be made to the provider, 
and had properly filed that request. (If the beneficiary or person on 
his or her behalf refuses to execute a written request, the provider may 
charge the beneficiary for all services furnished to him or her.)
    (c) Inpatient hospital services furnished to a beneficiary who 
exhausted his or her Part A benefits, if HCFA reimburses the provider 
for those services.
    (d) Custodial care and services not reasonable and necessary for the 
diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury, if--
    (1) The beneficiary was without fault in incurring the expenses; and
    (2) The determination that payment was incorrect was not made until 
after the third year following the year in which the payment notice was 
sent to the beneficiary.
    (e) Inpatient hospital services for which a beneficiary would be 
entitled to have payment made under Part A of

physicians' services as described in Sec. 415.102(a) of this chapter or 
the services of an anesthetist as described in Sec. 405.553(b)(4) of 
this chapter) for which Medicare payment would be made if furnished by 
the hospital or by other providers or suppliers under arrangements made 
with them by the hospital. For this purpose, a charge by another 
provider or supplier for such an item or service is treated as a charge 
by the hospital for the item or service, and is also prohibited.
    (g) Items and services furnished in connection with the implantation 
of cardiac pacemakers or pacemaker leads when HCFA denies payment for 
those devices under Sec. 409.19 or Sec. 410.64 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 489.22  Special provisions applicable to prepayment requirements.

    (a) A provider may not require an individual entitled to hospital 
insurance benefits to prepay in part or in whole for inpatient services 
as a condition of admittance as an inpatient, except where it is clear 
upon admission that payment under Medicare, Part A cannot be made.
    (b) A provider may not deny covered inpatient services to an 
individual entitled to have payment made for those services on the 
ground of inability or failure to pay a requested amount at or before 
admission.
    (c) A provider may not evict, or threaten to evict, an individual 
for inability to pay a deductible or a coinsurance amount required under 
Medicare.
    (d) A provider may not charge an individual for (1) its agreement to 
admit or readmit the individual on some specified future date for 
covered impatient services; or (2) for failure to remain an inpatient 
for any agreed-upon length of time or for failure to give advance notice 
of departure from the provider's facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 489.23  Specific limitation on charges for services provided to certain enrollees of fee-for-service FEHB plans.

    A provider that furnishes inpatient hospital services to a retired 
Federal worker age 65 or older who is enrolled in a fee-for-service FEHB 
plan and who is not covered under Medicare Part A, must accept, as 
payment in full, an amount that approximates as closely as possible the 
Medicare inpatient hospital prospective payment system (PPS) rate 
established under part 412. The payment to the provider is composed of a 
payment from the FEHB plan and a payment from the enrollee. This 
combined payment approximates the Medicare PPS rate. The payment from 
the FEHB plan approximates, as closely as possible, the Medicare PPS 
rate minus any applicable enrollee deductible, coinsurance, or copayment 
amount. The payment from the enrollee is equal to the applicable 
deductible, coinsurance, or copayment amount.

<R05>
Sec. 489.24  Special responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases.

    (a) General. In the case of a hospital that has an emergency 
department, if any individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare 
benefits and regardless of ability to pay) comes by him or herself or 
with another person to the emergency department and a request is made on 
the individual's behalf for examination or treatment of a medical 
condition by qualified medical personnel (as determined by the hospital 
in its rules and regulations), the hospital must provide for an 
appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the 
hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely 
available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an 
emergency medical condition exists. The examinations must be conducted 
by individuals determined qualified by hospital by-laws or rules and 
regulations and who meet the requirements of Sec. 482.55 concerning 
emergency services personnel and direction.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subpart--

[[Page 790]]

    Capacity means the ability of the hospital to accommodate the 
individual requesting examination or treatment of the transferred 
individual. Capacity encompasses such things as numbers and availability 
of qualified staff, beds and equipment and the hospital's past practices 
of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits.
    Comes to the emergency department means, with respect to an 
individual requesting examination or treatment, that the individual is 
on the hospital property (property includes ambulances owned and 
operated by the hospital, even if the ambulance is not on hospital 
grounds). An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital 
property is considered to have come to the hospital's emergency 
department. An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance off hospital 
property is not considered to have come to the hospital's emergency 
department, even if a member of the ambulance staff contacts the 
hospital by telephone or telemetry communications and informs the 
hospital that they want to transport the individual to the hospital for 
examination and treatment. In such situations, the hospital may deny 
access if it is in ``diversionary status,'' that is, it does not have 
the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients. If, 
however, the ambulance staff disregards the hospital's instructions and 
transports the individual on to hospital property, the individual is 
considered to have come to the emergency department.
    Emergency medical condition means--
    (i) A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of 
sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances 
and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate 
medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in--
    (A) Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a 
pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious 
jeopardy;
    (B) Serious impairment to bodily functions; or
    (C) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or
    (ii) With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions--
    (A) That there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to 
another hospital before delivery; or
    (B) That transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the 
woman or the unborn child.
    Hospital includes a critical access hospital as defined in section 
1861(mm)(1) of the Act.
    Hospital with an emergency department means a hospital that offers 
services for emergency medical conditions (as defined in this paragraph) 
within its capability to do so.
    Labor means the process of childbirth beginning with the latent or 
early phase of labor and continuing through the delivery of the 
placenta. A woman experiencing contractions is in true labor unless a 
physician certifies that, after a reasonable time of observation, the 
woman is in false labor.
    Participating hospital means (i) a hospital or (ii) a critical 
access hospital as defined in section 1861(mm)(1) of the Act that has 
entered into a Medicare provider agreement under section 1866 of the 
Act.
    Stabilized means, with respect to an ``emergency medical condition'' 
as defined in this section under paragraph (i) of that definition, that 
no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable 
medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer of the 
individual from a facility or, with respect to an ``emergency medical 
condition'' as defined in this section under paragraph (ii) of that 
definition, that the woman has delivered the child and the placenta.
    To stabilize means, with respect to an ``emergency medical 
condition'' as defined in this section under paragraph (i) of that 
definition, to provide such medical treatment of the condition necessary 
to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material 
deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during 
the transfer of the individual from a facility or that, with respect to 
an ``emergency medical condition'' as defined in this section under 
paragraph (ii) of that definition, the woman has delivered the child and 
the placenta.

[[Page 791]]

    Transfer means the movement (including the discharge) of an 
individual outside a hospital's facilities at the direction of any 
person employed by (or affiliated or associated, directly or indirectly, 
with) the hospital, but does not include such a movement of an 
individual who (i) has been declared dead, or (ii) leaves the facility 
without the permission of any such person.
    (c) Necessary stabilizing treatment for emergency medical 
conditions--(1) General. If any individual (whether or not eligible for 
Medicare benefits) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that 
the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must 
provide either--
    (i) Within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available at 
the hospital, for further medical examination and treatment as required 
to stabilize the medical condition; or
    (ii) For transfer of the individual to another medical facility in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Refusal to consent to treatment. A hospital meets the 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section with respect to an 
individual if the hospital offers the individual the further medical 
examination and treatment described in that paragraph and informs the 
individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) of the risks 
and benefits to the individual of the examination and treatment, but the 
individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) refuses to 
consent to the examination and treatment. The medical record must 
contain a description of the examination, treatment, or both if 
applicable, that was refused by or on behalf of the individual. The 
hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's 
written informed refusal (or that of the person acting on his or her 
behalf). The written document should indicate that the person has been 
informed of the risks and benefits of the examination or treatment, or 
both.
    (3) Delay in examination or treatment. A participating hospital may 
not delay providing an appropriate medical screening examination 
required under paragraph (a) of this section or further medical 
examination and treatment required under paragraph (c) in order to 
inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance status.
    (4) Refusal to consent to transfer. A hospital meets the 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to an 
individual if the hospital offers to transfer the individual to another 
medical facility in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and 
informs the individual (or a person acting on his or her behalf) of the 
risks and benefits to the individual of the transfer, but the individual 
(or a person acting on the individual's behalf) refuses to consent to 
the transfer. The hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the 
individual's written informed refusal (or that of a person acting on his 
or her behalf). The written document must indicate the person has been 
informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer and state the reasons 
for the individual's refusal. The medical record must contain a 
description of the proposed transfer that was refused by or on behalf of 
the individual.
    (d) Restricting transfer until the individual is stabilized--(1) 
General. If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical 
condition that has not been stabilized (as defined in paragraph (b) of 
this section), the hospital may not transfer the individual unless--
    (i) The transfer is an appropriate transfer (within the meaning of 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section); and
    (ii)(A) The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on 
the individual's behalf) requests the transfer, after being informed of 
the hospital's obligations under this section and of the risk of 
transfer. The request must be in writing and indicate the reasons for 
the request as well as indicate that he or she is aware of the risks and 
benefits of the transfer;
    (B) A physician (within the meaning of section 1861(r)(1) of the 
Act) has signed a certification that, based upon the information 
available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably 
expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another 
medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or, in 
the case of a woman in labor, to the woman or the unborn child, from 
being transferred. The certification must

[[Page 792]]

contain a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based; or
    (C) If a physician is not physically present in the emergency 
department at the time an individual is transferred, a qualified medical 
person (as determined by the hospital in its by-laws or rules and 
regulations) has signed a certification described in paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section after a physician (as defined in section 
1861(r)(1) of the Act) in consultation with the qualified medical 
person, agrees with the certification and subsequently countersigns the 
certification. The certification must contain a summary of the risks and 
benefits upon which it is based.
    (2) A transfer to another medical facility will be appropriate only 
in those cases in which--
    (i) The transferring hospital provides medical treatment within its 
capacity that minimizes the risks to the individual's health and, in the 
case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child;
    (ii) The receiving facility--
    (A) Has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of 
the individual; and
    (B) Has agreed to accept transfer of the individual and to provide 
appropriate medical treatment;
    (iii) The transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all 
medical records (or copies thereof) related to the emergency condition 
which the individual has presented that are available at the time of the 
transfer, including available history, records related to the 
individual's emergency medical condition, observations of signs or 
symptoms, preliminary diagnosis, results of diagnostic studies or 
telephone reports of the studies, treatment provided, results of any 
tests and the informed written consent or certification (or copy 
thereof) required under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, and the 
name and address of any on-call physician (described in paragraph (f) of 
this section) who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable 
time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment. Other records (e.g., 
test results not yet available or historical records not readily 
available from the hospital's files) must be sent as soon as practicable 
after transfer; and
    (iv) The transfer is effected through qualified personnel and 
transportation equipment, as required, including the use of necessary 
and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer.
    (3) A participating hospital may not penalize or take adverse action 
against a physician or a qualified medical person described in paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section because the physician or qualified medical 
person refuses to authorize the transfer of an individual with an 
emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized, or against any 
hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of a 
requirement of this section.
    (e) Recipient hospital responsibilities. A participating hospital 
that has specialized capabilities or facilities (including, but not 
limited to, facilities such as burn units, shock-trauma units, neonatal 
intensive care units, or (with respect to rural areas) regional referral 
centers) may not refuse to accept from a referring hospital within the 
boundaries of the United States an appropriate transfer of an individual 
who requires such specialized capabilities or facilities if the 
receiving hospital has the capacity to treat the individual.
    (f) Termination of provider agreement. If a hospital fails to meet 
the requirements of paragraph (a) through (e) of this section, HCFA may 
terminate the provider agreement in accordance with Sec. 489.53.
    (g) Consultation with Peer Review Organizations (PROs)--(1) General. 
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, in cases where a 
medical opinion is necessary to determine a physician's or hospital's 
liability under section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, HCFA requests the 
appropriate PRO (with a contract under Part B of title XI of the Act) to 
review the alleged section 1867(d) violation and provide a report on its 
findings in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(iv) and (v) of this 
section. HCFA provides to the PRO all information relevant to the case 
and within its possession or control. HCFA, in consultation with the 
OIG, also provides to the PRO a list of relevant questions

[[Page 793]]

to which the PRO must respond in its report.
    (2) Notice of review and opportunity for discussion and additional 
information. The PRO shall provide the physician and hospital reasonable 
notice of its review, a reasonable opportunity for discussion, and an 
opportunity for the physician and hospital to submit additional 
information before issuing its report. When a PRO receives a request for 
consultation under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the following 
provisions apply--
    (i) The PRO reviews the case before the 15th calendar day and makes 
its tentative findings.
    (ii) Within 15 calendar days of receiving the case, the PRO gives 
written notice, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the 
physician or the hospital (or both if applicable).
    (iii)(A) The written notice must contain the following information:
    (1) The name of each individual who may have been the subject of the 
alleged violation.
    (2) The date on which each alleged violation occurred.
    (3) An invitation to meet, either by telephone or in person, to 
discuss the case with the PRO, and to submit additional information to 
the PRO within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice, and a 
statement that these rights will be waived if the invitation is not 
accepted. The PRO must receive the information and hold the meeting 
within the 30-day period.
    (4) A copy of the regulations at 42 CFR 489.24.
    (B) For purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the 
date of receipt is presumed to be 5 days after the certified mail date 
on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
    (iv) The physician or hospital (or both where applicable) may 
request a meeting with the PRO. This meeting is not designed to be a 
formal adversarial hearing or a mechanism for discovery by the physician 
or hospital. The meeting is intended to afford the physician and/or the 
hospital a full and fair opportunity to present the views of the 
physician and/or hospital regarding the case. The following provisions 
apply to that meeting:
    (A) The physician and/or hospital has the right to have legal 
counsel present during that meeting. However, the PRO may control the 
scope, extent, and manner of any questioning or any other presentation 
by the attorney. The PRO may also have legal counsel present.
    (B) The PRO makes arrangements so that, if requested by HCFA or the 
OIG, a verbatim transcript of the meeting may be generated. If HCFA or 
OIG requests a transcript, the affected physician and/or the affected 
hospital may request that HCFA provide a copy of the transcript.
    (C) The PRO affords the physician and/or the hospital an opportunity 
to present, with the assistance of counsel, expert testimony in either 
oral or written form on the medical issues presented. However, the PRO 
may reasonably limit the number of witnesses and length of such 
testimony if such testimony is irrelevant or repetitive. The physician 
and/or hospital, directly or through counsel, may disclose patient 
records to potential expert witnesses without violating any non-
disclosure requirements set forth in part 476 of this chapter.
    (D) The PRO is not obligated to consider any additional information 
provided by the physician and/or the hospital after the meeting, unless, 
before the end of the meeting, the PRO requests that the physician and/
or hospital submit additional information to support the claims. The PRO 
then allows the physician and/or the hospital an additional period of 
time, not to exceed 5 calendar days from the meeting, to submit the 
relevant information to the PRO.
    (v) Within 60 calendar days of receiving the case, the PRO must 
submit to HCFA a report on the PRO's findings. HCFA provides copies to 
the OIG and to the affected physician and/or the affected hospital. The 
report must contain the name of the physician and/or the hospital, the 
name of the individual, and the dates and times the individual arrived 
at and was transferred (or discharged) from the hospital. The report 
provides expert medical opinion

[[Page 794]]

regarding whether the individual involved had an emergency medical 
condition, whether the individual's emergency medical condition was 
stabilized, whether the individual was transferred appropriately, and 
whether there were any medical utilization or quality of care issues 
involved in the case.
    (vi) The report required under paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section 
should not state an opinion or conclusion as to whether section 1867 of 
the Act or Sec. 489.24 has been violated.
    (3) If a delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals 
or when there was no screening examination, the PRO review described in 
this section is not required before the OIG may impose civil monetary 
penalties or an exclusion in accordance with section 1867(d)(1) of the 
Act and 42 CFR part 1003 of this title.
    (4) If the PRO determines after a preliminary review that there was 
an appropriate medical screening examination and the individual did not 
have an emergency medical condition, as defined by paragraph (b) of this 
section, then the PRO may, at its discretion, return the case to HCFA 
and not meet the requirements of paragraph (g) except for those in 
paragraph (g)(2)(v).
    (h) Release of PRO assessments. Upon request, HCFA may release a PRO 
assessment to the physician and/or hospital, or the affected individual, 
or his or her representative. The PRO physician's identity is 
confidential unless he or she consents to its release. (See 
Secs. 476.132 and 476.133 of this chapter.)

timely notice during the course of the hospital stay. For purposes of 
this paragraph, the course of the hospital stay may begin with the 
provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission 
testing and registration for a planned hospital admission. The hospital 
must be able to demonstrate compliance with this requirement.

[61 FR 46225, Aug. 30, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 46037, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 489.28  Special capitalization requirements for HHAs.

    (a) Basic rule. An HHA entering the Medicare program on or after 
January 1, 1998, including a new HHA as a result

[[Page 795]]

of a change of ownership, if the change of ownership results in a new 
provider number being issued, must have available sufficient funds, 
which we term ``initial reserve operating funds,'' to operate the HHA 
for the three month period after its Medicare provider agreement becomes 
effective, exclusive of actual or projected accounts receivable from 
Medicare or other health care insurers.
    (b) Standard. Initial reserve operating funds are sufficient to meet 
the requirement of this section if the total amount of such funds is 
equal to or greater than the product of the actual average cost per 
visit of three or more similarly situated HHAs in their first year of 
operation (selected by HCFA for comparative purposes) multiplied by the 
number of visits projected by the HHA for its first three months of 
operation--or 22.5 percent (one fourth of 90 percent) of the average 
number of visits reported by the comparison HHAs--whichever is greater.
    (c) Method. HCFA, through the intermediary, will determine the 
amount of the initial reserve operating funds using reported cost and 
visit data from submitted cost reports for the first full year of 
operation from at least three HHAs that the intermediary serves that are 
comparable to the HHA that is seeking to enter the Medicare program, 
considering such factors as geographic location and urban/rural status, 
number of visits, provider-based versus free-standing, and proprietary 
versus non-proprietary status. The determination of the adequacy of the 
required initial reserve operating funds is based on the average cost 
per visit of the comparable HHAs, by dividing the sum of total reported 
costs of the HHAs in their first year of operation by the sum of the 
HHAs' total reported visits. The resulting average cost per visit is 
then multiplied by the projected visits for the first three months of 
operation of the HHA seeking to enter the program, but not less than 90 
percent of average visits for a three month period for the HHAs used in 
determining the average cost per visit.
    (d) Required proof of availability of initial reserve operating 
funds. The HHA must provide HCFA with adequate proof of the availability 
of initial reserve operating funds. Such proof, at a minimum, will 
include a copy of the statement(s) of the HHA's savings, checking, or 
other account(s) that contains the funds, accompanied by an attestation 
from an officer of the bank or other financial institution that the 
funds are in the account(s) and that the funds are immediately available 
to the HHA. In some cases, an HHA may have all or part of the initial 
reserve operating funds in cash equivalents. For the purpose of this 
section, cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that present 
insignificant risk of changes in value. A cash equivalent that is not 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash as needed during the 
initial three month period for which the initial reserve operating funds 
are required does not qualify in meeting the initial reserve operating 
funds requirement. Examples of cash equivalents for the purpose of this 
section are Treasury bills, commercial paper, and money market funds. As 
with funds in a checking, savings, or other account, the HHA also must 
be able to document the availability of any cash equivalents. HCFA later 
may require the HHA to furnish another attestation from the financial 
institution that the funds remain available, or, if applicable, 
documentation from the HHA that any cash equivalents remain available, 
until a date when the HHA will have been surveyed by the State agency or 
by an approved accrediting organization. The officer of the HHA who will 
be certifying the accuracy of the information on the HHA's cost report 
must certify what portion of the required initial reserve operating 
funds is non-borrowed funds, including funds invested in the business by 
the owner. That amount must be at least 50 percent of the required 
initial reserve operating funds. The remainder of the reserve operating 
funds may be secured through borrowing or line of credit from an 
unrelated lender.
    (e) Borrowed funds. If borrowed funds are not in the same account(s) 
as the HHA's own non-borrowed funds, the HHA also must provide proof 
that the borrowed funds are available for use in operating the HHA, by 
providing, at a

[[Page 796]]

minimum, a copy of the statement(s) of the HHA's savings, checking, or 
other account(s) containing the borrowed funds, accompanied by an 
attestation from an officer of the bank or other financial institution 
that the funds are in the account(s) and are immediately available to 
the HHA. As with the HHA's own (that is, non-borrowed) funds, HCFA later 
may require the HHA to establish the current availability of such 
borrowed funds, including furnishing an attestation from a financial 
institution or other source, as may be appropriate, and to establish 
that such funds will remain available until a date when the HHA will 
have been surveyed by the State agency or by an approved accrediting 
organization.
    (f) Line of credit. If the HHA chooses to support the availability 
of a portion of the initial reserve operating funds with a line of 
credit, it must provide HCFA with a letter of credit from the lender. 
HCFA later may require the HHA to furnish an attestation from the lender 
that the HHA, upon its certification into the Medicare program, 
continues to be approved to borrow the amount specified in the letter of 
credit.
    (g) Provider agreement. HCFA does not enter into a provider 
agreement with an HHA unless the HHA meets the initial reserve operating 
funds requirement of this section.

actual charges for the services;
    (2) The amount of inpatient hospital coinsurance applicable for each 
day the individual is furnished inpatient hospital services after the 
60th day, during a benefit period; and
    (3) The posthospital SNF care coinsurance amount.
    (4) In the case of durable medical equipment (DME) furnished as a 
home health service, 20 percent of the customary charge for the service.

charges are the $75 deductible and 20 percent of the customary (insofar 
as reasonable) charges in excess of that deductible.
    (2) For hospital outpatient services, the allowable deductible 
charges depend on whether the hospital can determine the beneficiary's 
deductible status.
    (i) If the hospital is unable to determine the deductible status, it 
may charge the beneficiary its full customary charges up to $75.
    (ii) If the beneficiary provides official information as to

deductible.
    (3) In either of the cases discussed in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the hospital is required to file with the intermediary, on a 
form prescribed by HCFA, information as to the services, charges, and 
amounts collected.
    (4) The intermediary must reimburse the beneficiary if reimbursement 
is authorized and credit the expenses to the beneficiary's deductible if 
the deductible has not yet been met.
    (5) In the case of DME furnished as a home health service under 
Medicare Part B, the coinsurance is 20 percent of the customary (insofar 
as reasonable) charge for the services, with the following exception: If 
the DME is used DME purchased by or on behalf of the beneficiary at a 
price at least 25 percent less than the reasonable charge for comparable 
new equipment, no coinsurance is required.

Sec. 489.32  Allowable charges: Noncovered and partially covered services.

    (a) Services requested by beneficiary. If services furnished at the 
request of a beneficiary (or his or her representative) are more 
expensive than, or in excess of, services covered under Medicare--
    (1) A provider may charge the beneficiary an amount that does not 
exceed the difference between--
    (i) The provider's customary charges for the services furnished; and
    (ii) The provider's customary charges for the kinds and amounts of 
services that are covered under Medicare.
    (2) A provider may not charge for the services unless they have been 
requested by the beneficiary (or his or her representative) nor require 
a beneficiary to request services as a condition of admission.
    (3) To avoid misunderstanding and disputes, a provider must inform 
any beneficiary who requests a service for which a charge will be made 
that there will be a specified charge for that service.
    (b) Services not requested by the beneficiary. For special 
provisions that apply when a provider customarily furnishes more 
expensive services, see Sec. 413.35 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 489.40  Definition of incorrect collection.

    (a) As used in this subpart, ``incorrect collections'' means any 
amounts collected from a beneficiary (or someone on his or her behalf) 
that are not authorized under subpart C of this part.
    (b) A payment properly made to a provider by an individual not 
considered entitled to Medicare benefits will be deemed to be an 
``incorrect collection'' when the individual is found to be 
retroactively entitled to benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 489.41  Timing and methods of handling.

    (a) Refund. Prompt refund to the beneficiary or other person is the 
preferred method of handling incorrect collections.
    (b) Setting aside. If the provider cannot refund within 60 days from 
the date on the notice of incorrect collection, it must set aside an 
amount, equal to the amount incorrectly collected, in a separate account 
identified as to the individual to whom the payment is due. This amount 
incorrectly collected must be carried on the provider's records in this 
manner until final disposition is made in accordance with the applicable 
State law.
    (c) Notice to, and action by, intermediary. (1) The provider must 
notify

[[Page 798]]

the intermediary of the refund or setting aside required under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (2) If the provider fails to refund or set aside the required 
amounts, they may be offset against amounts otherwise due the provider.


<R05>
Sec. 489.42  Payment of offset amounts to beneficiary or other person.

    (a) In order to carry out the commitment to refund amounts 
incorrectly collected, HCFA may determine that amounts offset in 
accordance with Sec. 489.41 are to be paid directly to the beneficiary 
or other person from whom the provider received the incorrect 
collection, if:
    (1) HCFA finds that the provider has failed, following written 
request, to refund the amount of the incorrect collection to the 
beneficiary or other person; and
    (2) The provider agreement has been terminated in accordance with 
the provisions of subpart E of this part.
    (b) Before making a determination to make payment under paragraph 
(a) of this section, HCFA will give written notice to the provider (1) 
explaining that an incorrect collection was made and the amount; (2) 
requesting the provider to refund the incorrect collection to the 
beneficiary or other person; and (3) advising of HCFA's intention to 
make a determination under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The notice will afford an authorized official of the provider an 
opportunity to submit, within 20 days from the date on the notice, 
written statement or evidence with respect to the incorrect collection 
and/or offset amounts. HCFA will consider any written statement or 
evidence in making a determination.
    (d) Payment to a beneficiary or other person under the provisions of 
paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Will not exceed the amount of the incorrect collection; and
    (2) May be considered as payment made to the provider.


<R04>
 Subpart E--Termination of Agreement and Reinstatement After Termination


<R05>
Sec. 489.52  Termination by the provider.

    (a) Notice to HCFA. (1) A provider that wishes to terminate its 
agreement must send HCFA written notice of its intent.
    (2) The notice may state the intended date of termination which must 
be the first day of a month.
    (b) Termination date. (1) If the notice does not specify a date, or 
the date is not acceptable to HCFA, HCFA may set a date that will not be 
more than 6 months from the date on the provider's notice of intent.
    (2) HCFA may accept a termination date that is less than 6 months 
after the date on the provider's notice if it determines that to do so 
would not unduly disrupt services to the community or otherwise 
interfere with the effective and efficient administration of the 
Medicare program.
    (3) A cessation of business is deemed to be a termination by the 
provider, effective with the date on which it stopped providing services 
to the community.
    (c) Public notice. (1) The provider must give notice to the public 
at least 15 days before the effective date of termination.
    (2) The notice must be published in one or more local newspapers and 
must--
    (i) Specify the termination date; and
    (ii) Explain to what extent services may continue after that date, 
in accordance with the exceptions set forth in Sec. 489.55.


<R05>
Sec. 489.53  Termination by HCFA.

    (a) Basis for termination of agreement with any provider. HCFA may 
terminate the agreement with any provider if HCFA finds that any of the 
following failings is attributable to that provider:
    (1) It is not complying with the provisions of title XVIII and the 
applicable regulations of this chapter or with the provisions of the 
agreement.

[[Page 799]]

    (2) It places restrictions on the persons it will accept for 
treatment and it fails either to exempt Medicare beneficiaries from 
those restrictions or to apply them to Medicare beneficiaries the same 
as to all other persons seeking care.
    (3) It no longer meets the appropriate conditions of participation 
or requirements (for SNFs and NFs) set forth elsewhere in this chapter.
    (4) It fails to furnish information that HCFA finds necessary for a 
determination as to whether payments are or were due under Medicare and 
the amounts due.
    (5) It refuses to permit examination of its fiscal or other records 
by, or on behalf of HCFA, as necessary for verification of information 
furnished as a basis for payment under Medicare.
    (6) It failed to furnish information on business transactions as 
required in Sec. 420.205 of this chapter.
    (7) It failed at the time the agreement was entered into or renewed 
to disclose information on convicted individuals as required in 
Sec. 420.204 of this chapter.
    (8) It failed to furnish ownership information as required in 
Sec. 420.206 of this chapter.
    (9) It failed to comply with civil rights requirements set forth in 
45 CFR parts 80, 84, and 90.
    (10) In the case of a hospital or a critical access hospital as 
defined in section 1861(mm)(1) of the Act that has reason to believe it 
may have received an individual transferred by another hospital in 
violation of Sec. 489.24(d), the hospital failed to report the incident 
to HCFA or the State survey agency.
    (11) In the case of a hospital requested to furnish inpatient 
services to CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA beneficiaries or to veterans, it failed 
to comply with Sec. 489.25 or Sec. 489.26, respectively.
    (12) It failed to furnish the notice of discharge rights as required 
by Sec. 489.27.
    (13) It refuses to permit photocopying of any records or other 
information by, or on behalf of HCFA, as necessary to determine or 
verify compliance with participation requirements.
    (14) The hospital knowingly and willfully fails to accept, on a 
repeated basis, an amount that approximates the Medicare rate 
established under the inpatient hospital prospective payment system, 
minus any enrollee deductibles or copayments, as payment in full from a 
fee-for-service FEHB plan for inpatient hospital services provided to a 
retired Federal enrollee of a fee-for-service FEHB plan, age 65 or 
older, who does not have Medicare Part A benefits.
    (b) Termination of agreements with certain hospitals. In the case of 
a hospital or critical access hospital that has an emergency department, 
as defined in Sec. 489.24(b), HCFA may terminate the provider agreement 
if--
    (1) The hospital fails to comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 489.24 (a) through (e), which require the hospital to examine, 
treat, or transfer emergency medical condition cases appropriately, and 
require that hospitals with specialized capabilities or facilities 
accept an appropriate transfer; or
    (2) The hospital fails to comply with Sec. 489.20(m), (q), and (r), 
which require the hospital to report suspected violations of 
Sec. 489.24(d), to post conspicuously in emergency departments or in a 
place or places likely to be noticed by all individuals entering the 
emergency departments, as well as those individuals waiting for 
examination and treatment in areas other than traditional emergency 
departments, (that is, entrance, admitting area, waiting room, treatment 
area), signs specifying rights of individuals under this subpart, to 
post conspicuously information indicating whether or not the hospital 
participates in the Medicaid program, and to maintain medical and other 
records related to transferred individuals for a period of 5 years, a 
list of on-call physicians for individuals with emergency medical 
conditions, and a central log on each individual who comes to the 
emergency department seeking assistance.
    (c) Notice of termination--(1) Timing: Basic rule. Except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, HCFA gives the provider 
notice of termination at least 15 days before the effective date of 
termination of the provider agreement.
    (2) Timing exceptions: Immediate jeopardy situations--(i) Hospital 
with emergency department. If HCFA finds that a

[[Page 800]]

hospital with an emergency department is in violation of Sec. 489.24, 
paragraphs (a) through (e), and HCFA determines that the violation poses 
immediate jeopardy to the health or safety of individuals who present 
themselves to the hospital for emergency services, HCFA--
    (A) Gives the hospital a preliminary notice indicating that its 
provider agreement will be terminated in 23 days if it does not correct 
the identified deficiencies or refute the finding; and
    (B) Gives a final notice of termination, and concurrent notice to 
the public, at least 2 , but not more than 4, days before the effective 
date of termination of the provider agreement.
    (ii) Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). For an SNF with deficiencies 
that pose immediate jeopardy to the health or safety of residents, HCFA 
gives notice at least 2 days before the effective date of termination of 
the provider agreement.
    (3) Content of notice. The notice states the reasons for, and the 
effective date of, the termination, and explains the extent to which 
services may continue after that date, in accordance with Sec. 489.55.
    (4) Notice to public. HCFA concurrently gives notice of the 
termination to the public.
    (d) Appeal by the provider. A provider may appeal the termination of 
its provider agreement by HCFA in accordance with part 498 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 489.54  Termination by the OIG.

    (a) Basis for termination. (1) The OIG may terminate the agreement 
of any provider if the OIG finds that any of the following failings can 
be attributed to that provider.
    (i) It has knowingly and willfully made, or caused to be made, any 
false statement or representation of a material fact for use in an 
application or request for payment under Medicare.
    (ii) It has submitted, or caused to be submitted, requests for 
Medicare payment of amounts that substantially exceed the costs it 
incurred in furnishing the services for which payment is requested.
    (iii) It has furnished services that the OIG has determined to be 
substantially in excess of the needs of individuals or of a quality that 
fails to meet professionally recognized standards of health care. The 
OIG will not terminate a provider agreement under paragraph (a) if HCFA 
has waived a disallowance with respect to the services in question on 
the grounds that the provider and the beneficiary could not reasonably 
be expected to know that payment would not be made. (The rules for 
determining such lack of knowledge are set forth in Secs. 405.330 
through 405.334 of this chapter.)
    (b) Notice of termination. The OIG will give the provider notice of 
termination at least 15 days before the effective date of termination of 
the agreement, and will concurrently give notice of termination to the 
public.
    (c) Appeal by the provider. A provider may appeal a termination of 
its agreement by the OIG in accordance with subpart O of part 405 of 
this chapter.
    (d) Other applicable rules. The termination of a provider agreement 
by the OIG is subject to the additional procedures specified in 
Secs. 1001.105 through 1001.109 of this title for notice and appeals.

<R05>
Sec. 489.55  Exceptions to effective date of termination.

    Payment is available for up to 30 days after the effective date of 
termination for--
    (a) Inpatient hospital services (including inpatient psychiatric 
hospital services) and posthospital extended care services furnished to 
a beneficiary who was admitted before the effective date of termination; 
and
    (b) Home health services and hospice care furnished under a plan 
established

[[Page 801]]

before the effective date of termination.<SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For termination before July 18, 1984, payment was available 
through the calendar year in which the termination was effective.

[50 FR 37376, Sept. 13, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 489.57  Reinstatement after termination.

    When a provider agreement has been terminated by HCFA under 
Sec. 489.53, or by the OIG under Sec. 489.54, a new agreement with that 
provider will not be accepted unless HCFA or the OIG, as appropriate, 
finds--
    (a) That the reason for termination of the previous agreement has 
been removed and there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur; 
and
    (b) That the provider has fulfilled, or has made satisfactory 
arrangements to fulfill, all of the statutory and regulatory 
responsibilities of its previous agreement.

              Subpart F--Surety Bond Requirements for HHAs

    Source:  63 FR 313, Jan. 5, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 489.60  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart unless the context indicates otherwise--
    Assessment means a sum certain that HCFA may assess against an HHA 
in lieu of damages under Titles XI, XVIII, or XXI of the Social Security 
Act or under regulations in this chapter.
    Assets includes but is not limited to any listing that identifies 
Medicare beneficiaries to whom home health services were furnished by a 
participating or formerly participating HHA.
    Civil money penalty means a sum certain that HCFA has the authority 
to impose on an HHA as a penalty under Titles XI, XVIII, or XXI of the 
Social Security Act or under regulations in this chapter.
    Participating home health agency means a ``home health agency'' 
(HHA), as that term is defined by section 1861(o) of the Social Security 
Act, that also meets the definition of a ``provider'' set forth at 
Sec. 400.202 of this chapter.
    Rider means a notice issued by a Surety that a change in the bond 
has occurred or will occur.
    Surety bond means one or more bonds issued by one or more surety 
companies under 31 U.S.C. 9304 to 9308 and 31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 
225, provided the bond otherwise meets the requirements of this section.
    Unpaid civil money penalty or assessment means a civil money penalty 
or assessment imposed by HCFA on an HHA under Titles XI, XVIII, or XXI 
of the Social Security Act, plus accrued interest, that, after the HHA 
or Surety has exhausted all administrative appeals, remains unpaid 
(because the civil money penalty or assessment has not been paid to, or 
offset or compromised by, HCFA) and is not the subject of a written 
arrangement, acceptable to HCFA, for payment by the HHA. In the event a 
written arrangement for payment, acceptable to HCFA, is made, an unpaid 
civil money penalty or assessment also means such civil money penalty or 
assessment, plus accrued interest, that remains due 60 days after the 
HHA's default on such arrangement.
    Unpaid claim means a Medicare overpayment for which the HHA is 
responsible, plus accrued interest, that, 90 days after the date of the 
agency's notice to the HHA of the overpayment, remains due (because the 
overpayment has not been paid to, or recouped or compromised by, HCFA) 
and is not the subject of a written arrangement, acceptable to HCFA, for 
payment by the HHA. In the event a written arrangement for payment, 
acceptable to HCFA, is made, an unpaid claim also means a Medicare 
overpayment for which the HHA is responsible, plus accrued interest, 
that remains due 60 days after the HHA's default on such arrangement.

[63 FR 313, Jan. 5, 1998, as amended at 63 FR 29655, June 1, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 489.61  Basic requirement for surety bonds.

    Except as provided in Sec. 489.62, each HHA that is a Medicare 
participating HHA, or that seeks to become a Medicare participating HHA, 
must obtain a

[[Page 802]]

surety bond (and furnish to HCFA a copy of such surety bond) that meets 
the requirements of this subpart F and HCFA's instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 489.62  Requirement waived for Government-operated HHAs.

    An HHA operated by a Federal, State, local, or tribal government 
agency is deemed to have provided HCFA with a comparable surety bond 
under State law, and HCFA therefore waives the requirements of this 
subpart with respect to such an HHA if, during the preceding 5 years the 
HHA has--
    (a) Not had any unpaid claims or unpaid civil money penalties or 
assessments; and
    (b) Not had any of its claims referred by HCFA to the Department of 
Justice or the General Accounting Office in accordance with part 401 of 
this chapter.

[63 FR 313, Jan. 5, 1998, as amended at 63 FR 29655, June 1, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 489.63  Parties to the bond.

    The surety bond must name the HHA as Principal, HCFA as Obligee, and 
the surety company (and its heirs, executors, administrators, successors 
and assignees, jointly and severally) as Surety.


<R05>
Sec. 489.64  Authorized Surety and exclusion of surety companies.

    (a) An HHA may obtain a surety bond required under Sec. 489.61 only 
from an authorized Surety.
    (b) An authorized Surety is a surety company that--
    (1) Has been issued a Certificate of Authority by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9304 to 9308 and 
31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 225 as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds 
and the Certificate has neither expired nor been revoked; and
    (2) Has not been determined by HCFA to be an unauthorized Surety for 
the purpose of an HHA obtaining a surety bond under this section.
    (c) HCFA determines that a surety company is an unauthorized Surety 
under this section--
    (1) If, upon request by HCFA, the surety company fails to furnish 
timely confirmation of the issuance of, and the validity and accuracy of 
information appearing on, a surety bond an HHA presents to HCFA that 
shows the surety company as Surety on the bond;
    (2) If, upon presentation by HCFA to the surety company of a request 
for payment on a surety bond and of sufficient evidence to establish the 
surety company's liability on the bond, the surety company fails to 
timely pay HCFA in full the amount requested, up to the face amount of 
the bond; or
    (3) For other good cause.
    (d) Any determination HCFA makes under paragraph (c) of this section 
is effective immediately when notice of the determination is published 
in the Federal Register and remains in effect until a notice of 
reinstatement is published in the Federal Register.
    (e) Any determination HCFA makes under paragraph (c) of this section 
does not affect the Surety's liability under any surety bond issued by a 
surety company to an HHA before notice of such determination is 
published in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) A determination by HCFA that a surety company is an unauthorized 
Surety under this section is not a debarment, suspension, or exclusion 
for the purposes of Executive Order No. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 comp., p. 
189).


<R05>
Sec. 489.65  Amount of the bond.

    (a) Basic rule. The amount of the surety bond must be $50,000 or 15 
percent of the Medicare payments made by HCFA to the HHA in the HHA's 
most recent fiscal year for which a cost report has been accepted by 
HCFA, whichever is greater.
    (b) Computation of the 15 percent: Participating HHA.
    The 15 percent is computed as follows:
    (1) For the initial bond--on the basis of Medicare payments made by 
HCFA to the HHA in the HHA's most recent fiscal year as shown in the 
HHA's most recent cost report that has been accepted by HCFA. If the 
initial bond will cover less than a full fiscal year, the computation of 
the 15 percent will be based on the number of months of the fiscal year 
that the bond will cover.
    (2) For subsequent bonds--on the basis of Medicare payments made by 
HCFA in the most recent fiscal year for

[[Page 803]]

which a cost report has been accepted. However, if payments in the first 
six months of the current fiscal year differ from such an amount by more 
than 25 percent, then the amount of the bond is 15 percent of such 
payments projected on an annualized basis.
    (c) Computation of 15 percent: An HHA that seeks to become a 
participating HHA by obtaining assets or ownership interest. For an HHA 
that seeks to become a participating HHA by purchasing the assets or the 
ownership interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA, the 
15 percent is computed on the basis of Medicare payments made by HCFA to 
the participating or formerly participating HHA in the most recent 
fiscal year that a cost report has been accepted.
    (d) Change of ownership. For an HHA that undergoes a change of 
ownership the 15 percent is computed on the basis of Medicare payments 
made by HCFA to the HHA for the most recently accepted cost report.
    (e) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA without 
obtaining assets or ownership interest. For an HHA that seeks to become 
a participating HHA without purchasing the assets or the ownership 
interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA, the 15 
percent computation does not apply.
    (f) Exception to the basic rule. If an HHA's overpayment in the most 
recently accepted cost report exceeds 15 percent of annual payments, 
HCFA may require the HHA to secure a bond in an amount up to or equal to 
the amount of overpayment, provided the amount of the bond is not less 
than $50,000.
    (g) Expiration of the 15 percent provision. For an annual surety 
bond, or for a rider on a continuous surety bond, that is required to be 
submitted on or after June 1, 2005, notwithstanding any reference in 
this subpart to 15 percent as a basis for determining the amount of the 
bond, the amount of the bond or rider, as applicable, must be $50,000 or 
such amount as HCFA specifies in accordance with paragraph (f) of this 
section, whichever amount is greater.

<R05>
Sec. 489.66  Additional requirements of the surety bond.

    The surety bond that an HHA obtains under this subpart must meet the 
following additional requirements:
    (a) The bond must guarantee that within 30 days of receiving written 
notice from HCFA of an unpaid claim or unpaid civil money penalty or 
assessment, which notice contains sufficient evidence to establish the 
Surety's liability under the bond, the Surety will pay HCFA, up to the 
stated amount of the bond--
    (1) The full amount of any unpaid claim, plus accrued interest, for 
which the HHA is responsible; and
    (2) The full amount of any unpaid civil money penalty or assessment 
imposed by HCFA on the HHA, plus accrued interest.
    (b) The bond must provide the following:
    (1) The Surety is liable for unpaid claims, unpaid civil money 
penalties, and unpaid assessments that are discovered when the surety 
bond is in effect, regardless of when the payment, overpayment, or other 
event giving rise to the claim, civil money penalty, or assessment 
occurred, provided HCFA makes a written demand for payment from the 
Surety during, or within 90 days after, the term of the bond.
    (2) If the HHA fails to furnish a bond meeting the requirements of 
this subpart F for the year following expiration of the term of an 
annual bond, or if the HHA fails to submit a rider when a rider is 
required to be submitted under this subpart, or if the HHA's provider 
agreement is terminated, the last bond or rider, as applicable, 
submitted by the HHA to HCFA, which bond or applicable rider meets the 
requirements of this subpart, remains effective and the Surety remains 
liable for unpaid claims, civil money penalties, and assessments that--
    (i) HCFA determines or imposes on or asserts against the HHA based 
on overpayments or other events that took place during or prior to the 
term of the last bond or rider; and
    (ii) Were determined or imposed during the 2 years following the 
date the

[[Page 804]]

HHA failed to submit a bond or required rider or the date the HHA's 
provider agreement is terminated, whichever is later.
    (c) The bond must provide that the Surety's liability to HCFA under 
the bond is not extinguished by any action of the HHA, the Surety, or 
HCFA, including but not necessarily limited to any of the following 
actions:
    (1) Action by the HHA or the Surety to terminate or limit the scope 
or term of the bond. The Surety's liability may be extinguished, 
however, when--
    (i) The Surety furnishes HCFA with notice of such action not later 
than 10 days after receiving notice from the HHA of action by the HHA to 
terminate or limit the scope of the bond, or not later than 60 days 
before the effective date of such action by the Surety; or
    (ii) The HHA furnishes HCFA with a new bond that meets the 
requirements of this subpart.
    (2) The Surety's failure to continue to meet the requirements of 
Sec. 489.64(a) or HCFA's determination that the surety company is an 
unauthorized Surety under Sec. 489.64(b).
    (3) Termination of the HHA's provider agreement.
    (4) Any action by HCFA to suspend, offset, or otherwise recover 
payments to the HHA.
    (5) Any action by the HHA to--
    (i) Cease operation;
    (ii) Sell or transfer any asset or ownership interest;
    (iii) File for bankruptcy; or
    (iv) Fail to pay the Surety.
    (6) Any fraud, misrepresentation, or negligence by the HHA in 
obtaining the surety bond or by the Surety (or by the Surety's agent, if 
any) in issuing the surety bond, except that any fraud, 
misrepresentation, or negligence by the HHA in identifying to the Surety 
(or to the Surety's agent) the amount of Medicare payments upon which 
the amount of the surety bond is determined will not cause the Surety's 
liability to HCFA to exceed the amount of the bond.
    (7) The HHA's failure to exercise available appeal rights under 
Medicare or to assign such rights to the Surety.
    (d) The bond must provide that actions under the bond may be brought 
by HCFA or by HCFA's fiscal intermediaries.
    (e) The bond must provide the Surety's name, street address or post

Sec. 489.67  Term and type of bond.

    (a) Each participating HHA that does not meet the criteria for 
waiver under Sec. 489.62 must submit to HCFA in a form as HCFA may 
specify, a surety bond for a term beginning January 1, 1998. If an 
annual bond is submitted for the initial term, it must be effective 
through the end of the HHA's current fiscal year.
    (b) Type of bond. The type of bond required to be submitted by an 
HHA under this subpart may be either--
    (1) An annual bond (that is, a bond that specifies an effective 
annual period corresponding to the HHA's fiscal year); or
    (2) A continuous bond (that is, a bond that remains in full force 
and effect from term to term unless it is terminated or canceled as 
provided for in the bond or as otherwise provided by law) that is 
updated by the Surety, via the issuance of a rider, for a particular 
fiscal year for which the bond amount has changed or will change.
    (c) HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA.
    (1) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA must submit a 
surety bond with its enrollment application (Form HCFA-855, OMB number 
0938-0685). The term of the initial surety bond must be effective from 
the effective date of provider agreement as specified in Sec. 489.13 of 
this part. However, if the effective date of the provider agreement is 
less than 30 days before the end of the HHA's current fiscal year, the 
HHA may obtain a bond effective through the end of the next fiscal year, 
provided the amount of the bond is the greater of $75,000 or 20 percent 
of the amount determined from the computation specified in 
Sec. 489.65(c) as applicable.
    (2) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA through the 
purchase or transfer of assets or ownership

[[Page 805]]

interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA must also 
ensure that the surety bond is effective from the date of such purchase 
or transfer.
    (d) Change of ownership. An HHA that undergoes a change of ownership 
must submit the surety bond to HCFA not later than the effective date of 
the change of ownership and the bond must be effective from the 
effective date of the change of ownership through the remainder of the 
HHA's fiscal year.
    (e) Government-operated HHA that loses its waiver. A government-
operated HHA that, as of January 1, 1998, meets the criteria for waiver 
under Sec. 489.62 but thereafter is determined by HCFA to not meet such 
criteria, must submit a surety bond to HCFA within 60 days after it 
receives notice from HCFA that it no longer meets the criteria for 
waiver.
    (f) Change of Surety. An HHA that obtains a replacement surety bond 
from a different Surety to cover the remaining term of a previously 
obtained bond must submit the new surety bond to HCFA within 30 days of 
obtaining the bond from the new Surety.

<R05>
Sec. 489.68  Effect of failure to obtain, maintain, and timely file a surety bond.

    (a) The failure of a participating HHA to obtain, file timely, and 
maintain a surety bond in accordance with this subpart F and HCFA's 
instructions is sufficient under Sec. 489.53(a)(1) for HCFA to terminate 
the HHA's provider agreement.
    (b) The failure of an HHA seeking to become a participating HHA to 
obtain and file timely a surety bond in accordance with this Subpart F 
and HCFA's instructions is sufficient under Sec. 489.12(a)(3) for HCFA 
to refuse to enter into a provider agreement with the HHA.


<R05>
Sec. 489.69  Evidence of compliance.

    (a) HCFA may at any time require an HHA to make a specific showing 
of being in compliance with the requirements of this Subpart F and may 
require the HHA to submit such additional evidence as HCFA considers 
sufficient to demonstrate the HHA's compliance.
    (b) If requested by HCFA to do so, the failure of an HHA to timely 
furnish sufficient evidence to HCFA to demonstrate compliance with the 
requirements of this Subpart F is sufficient for HCFA to terminate the 
HHA's provider agreement under Sec. 489.53(a)(1) or to refuse to enter 
into a provider agreement with the HHA under Sec. 489.12(a)(3), as 
applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 489.70  Effect of payment by the Surety.

    A Surety's payment to HCFA under a bond for an unpaid claim or an 
unpaid civil money penalty or assessment, constitutes--
    (a) Collection of the unpaid claim or unpaid civil money penalty or 
assessment (to the extent the Surety's payment on the bond covers such 
unpaid claim, civil money penalty, or assessment); and
    (b) A basis for termination of the HHA's provider agreement under 
Sec. 489.53(a)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 489.71  Surety's standing to appeal Medicare determinations.

    A Surety has standing to appeal any matter that the HHA could 
appeal, provided the Surety satisfies all jurisdictional and procedural 
requirements that would otherwise have applied to the HHA, and provided 
the HHA is not, itself, actively pursuing its appeal rights under this 
chapter, and provided further that, with respect to unpaid claims, the 
Surety has paid HCFA all amounts owed to HCFA by the HHA on such unpaid 
claims, up to the amount of the bond.

[63 FR 29656, June 1, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 489.72  Effect of review reversing determination.

    In the event a Surety has paid HCFA on the basis of liability 
incurred under a bond obtained by an HHA under this subpart F, and to 
the extent the HHA that obtained such bond (or the Surety under 
Sec. 489.71) is subsequently successful in appealing the determination 
that was the basis of the unpaid claim or

[[Page 806]]

unpaid civil money penalty or assessment that caused the Surety to pay 
HCFA under the bond, HCFA will refund to the Surety the amount the 
Surety paid to HCFA to the extent such amount relates to the matter that 
was successfully appealed by the HHA (or by the Surety), provided all 
review, including judicial review, has been completed on such matter. 
Any additional amounts owing as a result of the appeal will be paid to 
the HHA.


<R05>
Sec. 489.73  Effect of conditions of payment.

    If a Surety has paid an amount to HCFA on the basis of liability 
incurred under a bond obtained by an HHA under this subpart F, and HCFA 
subsequently collects from the HHA, in whole or in part, on such unpaid 
claim, civil money penalty, or assessment that was the basis for the 
Surety's liability, HCFA reimburses the Surety such amount as HCFA 
collected from the HHA, up to the amount paid by the Surety to HCFA, 
provided the Surety has no other liability to HCFA under the bond.

(Authority: Secs. 1102 and 1871 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.

                      Subpart I--Advance Directives

    Source: 57 FR 8203, Mar. 6, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 489.100  Definition.

    For purposes of this part, advance directive means a written 
instruction, such as a living will or durable power of attorney for 
health care, recognized under State law (whether statutory or as 
recognized by the courts of the State), relating to the provision of 
health care when the individual is incapacitated.


<R05>
Sec. 489.102  Requirements for providers.

    (a) Hospitals, critical access hospitals, skilled nursing 
facilities, nursing facilities, home health agencies, providers of home 
health care (and for Medicaid purposes, providers of personal care 
services), and hospices must maintain written policies and procedures 
concerning advance directives with respect to all adult individuals 
receiving medical care by or through the provider and are required to:
    (1) Provide written information to such individuals concerning--
    (i) An individual's rights under State law (whether statutory or 
recognized by the courts of the State) to make decisions concerning such 
medical care, including the right to accept or refuse medical or 
surgical treatment and the right to formulate, at the individual's 
option, advance directives. Providers are permitted to contract with 
other entities to furnish this information but are still legally 
responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this section are met. 
Providers are to update and disseminate amended information as soon as 
possible, but no later than 90 days from the effective date of the 
changes to State law; and
    (ii) The written policies of the provider or organization respecting 
the implementation of such rights, including a clear and precise 
statement of limitation if the provider cannot implement an advance 
directive on the basis of conscience. At a minimum, a provider's 
statement of limitation should:
    (A) Clarify any differences between institution-wide conscience 
objections and those that may be raised by individual physicians;
    (B) Identify the state legal authority permitting such objection; 
and
    (C) Describe the range of medical conditions or procedures affected 
by the conscience objection.
    (2) Document in the individual's medical record whether or not the 
individual has executed an advance directive;
    (3) Not condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate 
against an individual based on whether or not

[[Page 807]]

the individual has executed an advance directive;
    (4) Ensure compliance with requirements of State law (whether 
statutory or recognized by the courts of the State) regarding advance 
directives. The provider must inform individuals that complaints 
concerning the advance directive requirements may be filed with the 
State survey and certification agency;
    (5) Provide for education of staff concerning its policies and 
procedures on advance directives; and
    (6) Provide for community education regarding issues concerning 
advance directives that may include material required in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, either directly or in concert with other 
providers and organizations. Separate community education materials may 
be developed and used, at the discretion of providers. The same written 
materials do not have to be provided in all settings, but the material 
should define what constitutes an advance directive, emphasizing that an 
advance directive is designed to enhance an incapacitated individual's 
control over medical treatment, and describe applicable State law 
concerning advance directives. A provider must be able to document its 
community education efforts.
    (b) The information specified in paragraph (a) of this section is 
furnished:
    (1) In the case of a hospital, at the time of the individual's 
admission as an inpatient.
    (2) In the case of a skilled nursing facility at the time of the 
individual's admission as a resident.
    (3)(i) In the case of a home health agency, in advance of the 
individual coming under the care of the agency. The HHA may furnish 
advance directives information to a patient at the time of the first 
home visit, as long as the information is furnished before care is 
provided.
    (ii) In the case of personal care services, in advance of the 
individual coming under the care of the personal care services provider. 
The personal care provider may furnish advance directives information to 
a patient at the time of the first home visit, as long as the 
information is furnished before care is provided.
    (4) In the case of a hospice program, at the time of initial receipt 
of hospice care by the individual from the program.
    (c) The providers listed in paragraph (a) of this section--
    (1) Are not required to provide care that conflicts with an advance 
directive.
    (2) Are not required to implement an advance directive if, as a 
matter of conscience, the provider cannot implement an advance directive 
and State law allows any health care provider or any agent of such 
provider to conscientiously object.
    (d) Prepaid or eligible organizations (as specified in sections 
1833(a)(1)(A) and 1876(b) of the Act) must meet the requirements 
specified in Sec. 417.436 of this chapter.
    (e) If an adult individual is incapacitated at the time of admission 
or at the start of care and is unable to receive information (due to the 
incapacitating conditions or a mental disorder) or articulate whether or 
not he or she has executed an advance directive, then the provider may 
give advance directive information to the individual's family or 
surrogate in the same manner that it issues other materials about 
policies and procedures to the family of the incapacitated individual or 
to a surrogate or other concerned persons in accordance with State law. 
The provider is not relieved of its obligation to provide this 
information to the individual once he or she is no longer incapacitated 
or unable to receive such information. Follow-up procedures must be in 
place to provide the information to the individual directly at the 
appropriate time.

Sec. 493.1  Basis and scope.

    This part sets forth the conditions that all laboratories must meet 
to be certified to perform testing on human specimens under the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). It implements sections 
1861 (e) and (j), the sentence following section 1861(s)(13), and 
1902(a)(9) of the Social Security Act, and section 353 of the Public 
Health Service Act. This part applies to all laboratories as defined 
under ``laboratory'' in Sec. 493.2 of this part. This part also applies 
to laboratories seeking payment under the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs. The requirements are the same for Medicare approval as for 
CLIA certification.


<R05>

laboratory after an inspection that finds the laboratory to be in 
compliance with all applicable condition level requirements, or reissued 
before the expiration date, pending an appeal, in accordance with 
Sec. 493.49, when an inspection has found the laboratory to be out of 
compliance with one or more condition level requirements.
    (2) Certificate for provider-performed microscopy (PPM) procedures 
means a certificate issued or reissued before the expiration date, 
pending an appeal, in accordance with Sec. 493.47, to a laboratory in 
which a physician, midlevel practitioner or dentist performs no tests 
other than PPM procedures and, if desired, waived tests listed in 
Sec. 493.15(c).
    (3) Certificate of accreditation means a certificate issued on the 
basis of the laboratory's accreditation by an accreditation organization 
approved by HCFA (indicating that the laboratory is deemed to meet 
applicable CLIA requirements) or reissued before the expiration date,

    Dentist means a doctor of dental medicine or doctor of dental 
surgery licensed by the State to practice dentistry within the State in 
which the laboratory is located.
    Equivalency means that an accreditation organization's or a State 
laboratory program's requirements, taken as a whole, are equal to or 
more stringent than the CLIA requirements established by HCFA, taken as 
whole. It is acceptable for an accreditation organization's or State 
laboratory program's requirements to be organized differently or 
otherwise vary from the CLIA requirements, as long as (1) all of the 
requirements taken as a whole would provide at least the same protection 
as the CLIA requirements taken as a whole; and (2) a finding of 
noncompliance with respect to CLIA requirements taken as a whole would 
be matched by a finding of noncompliance with the accreditation or State 
requirements taken as a whole.
    HCFA agent means an entity with which HCFA arranges to inspect 
laboratories and assess laboratory activities against CLIA requirements 
and may be a State survey agency, a private, nonprofit organization 
other than an approved accreditation organization, a component of HHS, 
or any other governmental component HCFA approves for this purpose. In 
those instances where all of the laboratories in a State are exempt from 
CLIA requirements, based on the approval of a State's exemption request, 
the State survey agency is not the HCFA agent.
    HHS means the Department of Health and Human Services, or its 
designee.
    Immediate jeopardy means a situation in which immediate corrective 
action is necessary because the laboratory's noncompliance with one or 
more condition level requirements has already caused, is causing, or is 
likely to cause, at any time, serious injury or harm, or death, to 
individuals served by the laboratory or to the health or safety of the 
general public. This term is synonymous with imminent and serious risk 
to human health and significant hazard to the public health.
    Intentional violation means knowing and willful noncompliance with 
any CLIA condition.
    Kit means all components of a test that are packaged together.
    Laboratory means a facility for the biological, microbiological, 
serological, chemical, immunohematological, hematological, biophysical, 
cytological, pathological, or other examination of materials derived 
from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the 
diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or 
the assessment of the health of, human beings. These examinations also 
include procedures to determine, measure, or otherwise describe the 
presence or absence of various substances or organisms in the body. 
Facilities only collecting or preparing specimens (or both) or only 
serving as a mailing service and not performing testing are not 
considered laboratories.
    Midlevel practitioner means a nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, or 
physician assistant, licensed by the State within which the individual 
practices, if such licensing is required in the State in which the 
laboratory is located.
    Operator means the individual or group of individuals who oversee 
all facets of the operation of a laboratory and who bear primary 
responsibility for the safety and reliability of the results of all 
specimen testing performed in that laboratory. The term includes--
    (1) A director of the laboratory if he or she meets the stated 
criteria; and
    (2) The members of the board of directors and the officers of a 
laboratory that is a small corporation under subchapter S of the 
Internal Revenue Code.
    Owner means any person who owns any interest in a laboratory except 
for an interest in a laboratory whose stock and/or securities are 
publicly traded. (That is e.g., the purchase of shares of stock or 
securities on the New York

[[Page 820]]

Stock Exchange in a corporation owning a laboratory would not make a 
person an owner for the purpose of this regulation.)
    Party means a laboratory affected by any of the enforcement 
procedures set forth in this subpart, by HCFA or the OIG, as 
appropriate.
    Performance characteristic means a property of a test that is used 
to describe its quality, e.g., accuracy, precision, analytical 
sensitivity, analytical specificity, reportable range, reference range, 
etc.
    Performance specification means a value or range of values for a 
performance characteristic, established or verified by the laboratory, 
that is used to describe the quality of patient test results.
    Physician means an individual with a doctor of medicine, doctor of 
osteopathy, or doctor of podiatric medicine degree who is licensed by 
the State to practice medicine, osteopathy, or podiatry within the State 
in which the laboratory is located.
    Principal sanction means the suspension, limitation, or revocation 
of any type of CLIA certificate or the cancellation of the laboratory's 
approval to receive Medicare payment for its services.
    Prospective laboratory means a laboratory that is operating under a 
registration certificate or is seeking any of the three other types of 
CLIA certificates.
    Rate of disparity means the percentage of sample validation 
inspections for a specific accreditation organization or State where 
HCFA, the State survey agency or other HCFA agent finds noncompliance 
with one or more condition level requirements but no comparable 
deficiencies were cited by the accreditation organization or the State, 
and it is reasonable to conclude that the deficiencies were present at 
the time of the most recent accreditation organization or State 
licensure inspection.

    Example: Assume the State survey agency, HCFA or other HCFA agent 
performs 200 sample validation inspections for laboratories accredited 
by a single accreditation organization or licensed in an exempt State 
during a validation review period and finds that 60 of the 200 
laboratories had one or more condition level requirements out of 
compliance. HCFA reviews the validation and accreditation organization's 
or State's inspections of the validated laboratories and determines that 
the State or accreditation organization found comparable deficiencies in 
22 of the 60 laboratories and it is reasonable to conclude that 
deficiencies were present in the remaining 38 laboratories at the time 
of the accreditation organization's or State's inspection. Thirty-eight 
divided by 200 equals a 19 percent rate of disparity.

    Referee laboratory means a laboratory currently in compliance with 
applicable CLIA requirements, that has had a record of satisfactory 
proficiency testing performance for all testing events for at least one 
year for a specific test, analyte, subspecialty, or specialty and has 
been designated by an HHS approved proficiency testing program as a 
referee laboratory for analyzing proficiency testing specimens for the 
purpose of determining the correct response for the specimens in a 
testing event for that specific test, analyte, subspecialty, or 
specialty.
    Reference range means the range of test values expected for a 
designated population of individuals, e.g., 95 percent of individuals 
that are presumed to be healthy (or normal).
    Sample in proficiency testing means the material contained in a 
vial, on a slide, or other unit that contains material to be tested by 
proficiency testing program participants. When possible, samples are of 
human origin.
    State includes, for purposes of this part, each of the 50 States, 
the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin 
Islands and a political subdivision of a State where the State, acting 
pursuant to State law, has expressly delegated powers to the political 
subdivision sufficient to authorize the political subdivision to act for 
the State in enforcing requirements equal to or more stringent than CLIA 
requirements.
    State licensure means the issuance of a license to, or the approval 
of, a laboratory by a State laboratory program as meeting standards for 
licensing or approval established under State law.
    State licensure program means a State laboratory licensure or 
approval program.
    State survey agency means the State health agency or other 
appropriate State or local agency that has an

[[Page 821]]

agreement under section 1864 of the Social Security Act and is used by 
HCFA to perform surveys and inspections.
    Substantial allegation of noncompliance means a complaint from any 
of a variety of sources (including complaints submitted in person, by 
telephone, through written correspondence, or in newspaper or magazine 
articles) that, if substantiated, would have an impact on the health and 
safety of the general public or of individuals served by a laboratory 
and raises doubts as to a laboratory's compliance with any condition 
level requirement.
    Target value for quantitative tests means either the mean of all 
participant responses after removal of outliers (those responses greater 
than 3 standard deviations from the original mean) or the mean 
established by definitive or reference methods acceptable for use in the 
National Reference System for the Clinical Laboratory (NRSCL) by the 
National Committee for the Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). In 
instances where definitive or reference methods are not available or a 
specific method's results demonstrate bias that is not observed with 
actual patient specimens, as determined by a defensible scientific 
protocol, a comparative method or a method group (``peer'' group) may be 
used. If the method group is less than 10 participants, ``target value'' 
means the overall mean after outlier removal (as defined above) unless 
acceptable scientific reasons are available to indicate that such an 
evaluation is not appropriate.
    Unsatisfactory proficiency testing performance means failure to 
attain the minimum satisfactory score for an analyte, test, 
subspecialty, or specialty for a testing event.
    Unsuccessful participation in proficiency testing means any of the 
following:
    (1) Unsatisfactory performance for the same analyte in two 
consecutive or two out of three testing events.
    (2) Repeated unsatisfactory overall testing event scores for two 
consecutive or two out of three testing events for the same specialty or 
subspecialty.
    (3) An unsatisfactory testing event score for those subspecialties 
not graded by analyte (that is, bacteriology, mycobacteriology, 
virology, parasitology, mycology, blood compatibility, immunohematology, 
or syphilis serology) for the same subspecialty for two consecutive or 
two out of three testing events.
    (4) Failure of a laboratory performing gynecologic cytology to meet 
the standard at Sec. 493.855.
    Unsuccessful proficiency testing performance means a failure to 
attain the minimum satisfactory score for an analyte, test, 
subspecialty, or specialty for two consecutive or two of three 
consecutive testing events.
    Validation review period means the one year time period during which 
HCFA conducts validation inspections and evaluates the results of the 
most recent surveys performed by an accreditation organization or State 
laboratory program.

<R05>
Sec. 493.17  Test categorization.

    (a) Categorization by criteria. Notices will be published in the 
Federal Register which list each specific test system, assay, and 
examination categorized by complexity. Using the seven criteria 
specified in this paragraph for categorizing tests of moderate or high 
complexity, each specific laboratory test system, assay, and examination 
will be graded for level of complexity by assigning scores of 1, 2, or 3 
within each criteria. The score of ``1'' indicates the lowest level of 
complexity, and the score of ``3'' indicates the highest level. These 
scores will be totaled. Test systems, assays or examinations receiving 
scores of 12 or less will be categorized as moderate complexity, while 
those receiving scores above 12 will be categorized as high complexity.

    Note: A score of ``2'' will be assigned to a criteria heading when 
the characteristics for a particular test are intermediate between the 
descriptions listed for scores of ``1'' and ``3.''

    (1) Knowledge.
    (i) Score 1. (A) Minimal scientific and technical knowledge is 
required to perform the test; and
    (B) Knowledge required to perform the test may be obtained through 
on-the-job instruction.
    (ii) Score 3. Specialized scientific and technical knowledge is 
essential to perform preanalytic, analytic or postanalytic phases of the 
testing.
    (2) Training and experience.
    (i) Score 1. (A) Minimal training is required for preanalytic, 
analytic and postanalytic phases of the testing process; and
    (B) Limited experience is required to perform the test.
    (ii) Score 3. (A) Specialized training is essential to perform the 
preanalytic, analytic or postanalytic testing process; or
    (B) Substantial experience may be necessary for analytic test 
performance.
    (3) Reagents and materials preparation.
    (i) Score 1. (A) Reagents and materials are generally stable and 
reliable; and
    (B) Reagents and materials are prepackaged, or premeasured, or 
require no special handling, precautions or storage conditions.
    (ii) Score 3. (A) Reagents and materials may be labile and may 
require special handling to assure reliability; or
    (B) Reagents and materials preparation may include manual steps such 
as gravimetric or volumetric measurements.
    (4) Characteristics of operational steps. (i) Score 1. Operational 
steps are either automatically executed (such as pipetting, temperature 
monitoring, or timing of steps), or are easily controlled.
    (ii) Score 3. Operational steps in the testing process require close 
monitoring or control, and may require special specimen preparation, 
precise temperature control or timing of procedural steps, accurate 
pipetting, or extensive calculations.
    (5) Calibration, quality control, and proficiency testing materials.
    (i) Score 1. (A) Calibration materials are stable and readily 
available;
    (B) Quality control materials are stable and readily available; and
    (C) External proficiency testing materials, when available, are 
stable.
    (ii) Score 3. (A) Calibration materials, if available, may be 
labile;
    (B) Quality control materials may be labile, or not available; or
    (C) External proficiency testing materials, if available, may be 
labile.
    (6) Test system troubleshooting and equipment maintenance.
    (i) Score 1. (A) Test system troubleshooting is automatic or self-
correcting, or clearly described or requires minimal judgment; and
    (B) Equipment maintenance is provided by the manufacturer, is seldom 
needed, or can easily be performed.
    (ii) Score 3. (A) Troubleshooting is not automatic and requires 
decision-making and direct intervention to resolve most problems; or
    (B) Maintenance requires special knowledge, skills, and abilities.
    (7) Interpretation and judgment. (i) Score 1. (A) Minimal 
interpretation and judgment are required to perform preanalytic, 
analytic and postanalytic processes; and

[[Page 824]]

    (B) Resolution of problems requires limited independent 
interpretation and judgment; and
    (ii) Score 3. (A) Extensive independent interpretation and judgment 
are required to perform the preanalytic, analytic or postanalytic 
processes; and
    (B) Resolution of problems requires extensive interpretation and 
judgment.
    (b) Revisions to the criteria for categorization. The Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee, as defined in subpart T of 
this part, will conduct reviews upon request of HHS and recommend to HHS 
revisions to the criteria for categorization of tests.
    (c) Process for device/test categorization utilizing the scoring 
system under Sec. 493.17(a). (1)(i) For new commercial test systems, 
assays, or examinations, the manufacturer, as part of its 510(k) and PMA 
application to FDA, will submit supporting data for device/test 
categorization. FDA will determine the complexity category, notify the 
manufacturers directly, and will simultaneously inform both HCFA and CDC 
of the device/test category. FDA will consult with CDC concerning test 
categorization in the following three situations:
    (A) When categorizing previously uncategorized new technology;
    (B) When FDA determines it to be necessary in cases involving a 
request for a change in categorization; and
    (C) If a manufacturer requests review of a categorization decision 
by FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 10.75.
    (ii) Test categorization will be effective as of the notification to 
the applicant.
    (2) For test systems, assays, or examinations not commercially 
available, a laboratory or professional group may submit a written 
request for categorization to PHS. These requests will be forwarded to 
CDC for evaluation; CDC will determine complexity category and notify 
the applicant, HCFA, and FDA of the categorization decision. In the case 
of request for a change of category or for previously uncategorized new 
technology, PHS will receive the request application and forward it to 
CDC for categorization.
    (3) A request for recategorization will be accepted for review if it 
is based on new information not previously submitted in a request for 
categorization or recategorization by the same applicant and will not be 
considered more frequently than once per year.
    (4) If a laboratory test system, assay or examination does not 
appear on the lists of tests in the Federal Register notices, it is

<R05>
Sec. 493.551  General requirements for laboratories.

    (a) Applicability. HCFA may deem a laboratory to meet all applicable 
CLIA program requirements through accreditation by a private nonprofit 
accreditation program (that is, grant deemed status), or may exempt from 
CLIA program requirements all State licensed or approved laboratories in 
a State that has a State licensure program established by law, if the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) The requirements of the accreditation organization or State 
licensure program are equal to, or more stringent than, the CLIA 
condition-level requirements specified in this part, and the laboratory 
would meet the condition-level requirements if it were inspected against 
these requirements.
    (2) The accreditation program or the State licensure program meets 
the requirements of this subpart and is approved by HCFA.
    (3) The laboratory authorizes the approved accreditation 
organization or State licensure program to release to HCFA all records 
and information required and permits inspections as outlined in this 
part.
    (b) Meeting CLIA requirements by accreditation. A laboratory seeking 
to meet CLIA requirements through accreditation by an approved 
accreditation organization must do the following:
    (1) Obtain a certificate of accreditation as required in subpart D 
of this part.

this part.
    (4) Authorize its PT organization to furnish to its accreditation 
organization the results of the laboratory's participation in an 
approved PT program for the purpose of monitoring the laboratory's PT 
and for making the annual PT results, along with explanatory information 
required to interpret the PT results, available on a reasonable basis, 
upon request of any person. A laboratory that refuses to authorize 
release of its PT results is no longer deemed to meet the condition-
level requirements and is subject to a full review by HCFA, in 
accordance with subpart Q of this part, and may be subject to the 
suspension or revocation of its certificate of accreditation under 
Sec. 493.1840.
    (5) Authorize its accreditation organization to release to HCFA or a 
HCFA agent the laboratory's PT results that constitute unsuccessful 
participation in an approved PT program, in accordance with the 
definition of ``unsuccessful participation in an approved PT program,'' 
as specified in Sec. 493.2 of this part, when the laboratory has failed 
to achieve successful participation in an approved PT program.
    (6) Authorize its accreditation organization to release to HCFA a 
notification of the actions taken by the organization as a result of the 
unsuccessful participation in a PT program within 30 days of the 
initiation of the action. Based on this notification, HCFA may

[[Page 835]]

take an adverse action against a laboratory that fails to participate 
successfully in an approved PT program.
    (c) Withdrawal of laboratory accreditation. After an accreditation 
organization has withdrawn or revoked its accreditation of a laboratory, 
the laboratory retains its certificate of accreditation for 45 days 
after the laboratory receives notice of the withdrawal or revocation of 
the accreditation, or the effective date of any action taken by HCFA, 
whichever is earlier.

Sec. 493.565  Selection for validation inspection--laboratory responsibilities.

    A laboratory selected for a validation inspection must do the 
following:
    (a) Authorize its accreditation organization or State licensure 
program, as applicable, to release to HCFA or a HCFA agent, on a 
confidential basis, a copy of the laboratory's most recent full, and any 
subsequent partial inspection.
    (b) Authorize HCFA or a HCFA agent to conduct a validation 
inspection.
    (c) Provide HCFA or a HCFA agent with access to all facilities, 
equipment, materials, records, and information that HCFA or a HCFA agent 
determines have a bearing on whether the laboratory is being operated in 
accordance with the requirements of this part, and permit HCFA or a HCFA 
agent to copy material or require the laboratory to submit material.
    (d) If the laboratory possesses a valid certificate of 
accreditation, authorize HCFA or a HCFA agent to monitor the correction 
of any deficiencies found through the validation inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 493.567  Refusal to cooperate with validation inspection.

    (a) Laboratory with a certificate of accreditation. (1) A laboratory 
with a certificate of accreditation that refuses to cooperate with a 
validation inspection by failing to comply with the requirements in

<R05>
Sec. 493.569  Consequences of a finding of noncompliance as a result of a validation inspection.

    (a) Laboratory with a certificate of accreditation. If a validation 
inspection results in a finding that the accredited laboratory is out of 
compliance with one or more condition-level requirements, the laboratory 
is subject to--
    (1) The same requirements and survey and enforcement processes 
applied to laboratories that are not accredited and that are found out 
of compliance following an inspection under this part; and
    (2) Full review by HCFA, in accordance with this part; that is, the 
laboratory is subject to the principal and alternative sanctions in 
Sec. 493.1806.
    (b) CLIA-exempt laboratory. If a validation inspection results in a 
finding that a CLIA-exempt laboratory is out of compliance with one or 
more condition-level requirements, HCFA directs the State to take 
appropriate enforcement action.


<R05>
Sec. 493.571  Disclosure of accreditation, State and HCFA validation inspection results.

    (a) Accreditation organization inspection results. HCFA may disclose 
accreditation organization inspection results to the public only if the 
results are related to an enforcement action taken by the Secretary.

is the responsibility of the approved State licensure program, in 
accordance with State law.
    (c) HCFA validation inspection results. HCFA may disclose the 
results of all validation inspections conducted by HCFA or its agent.


<R05>
Sec. 493.573  Continuing Federal oversight of private nonprofit accreditation organizations and approved State licensure programs.

    (a) Comparability review. In addition to the initial review for 
determining equivalency of specified organization or State requirements 
to the comparable condition-level requirements, HCFA reviews the 
equivalency of requirements in the following cases:
    (1) When HCFA promulgates new condition-level requirements.
    (2) When HCFA identifies an accreditation organization or a State 
licensure program whose requirements are no longer equal to, or more 
stringent than, condition-level requirements.
    (3) When an accreditation organization or State licensure program 
adopts new requirements.
    (4) When an accreditation organization or State licensure program 
adopts changes to its inspection process, as required by 
Sec. 493.575(b)(1), as applicable.
    (5) Every 6 years, or sooner if HCFA determines an earlier review is 
required.
    (b) Validation review. Following the end of a validation review 
period, HCFA evaluates the validation inspection results for each 
approved accreditation organization and State licensure program.
    (c) Reapplication procedures. (1) Every 6 years, or sooner, as 
determined by HCFA, an approved accreditation organization must reapply 
for continued approval of deeming authority and a State licensure 
program must reapply for continued approval of a CLIA exemption. HCFA 
provides notice of the materials that must be submitted as part of the 
reapplication procedure.
    (2) An accreditation organization or State licensure program that 
does not meet the requirements of this subpart, as determined through a 
comparability or validation review, must furnish HCFA, upon request, 
with the reapplication materials HCFA requests. HCFA establishes a 
deadline by which the materials must be submitted.
    (d) Notice. (1) HCFA provides written notice, as appropriate, to the 
following:
    (i) An accreditation organization indicating that its approval may 
be in jeopardy if a comparability or validation review reveals that it 
is not meeting the requirements of this subpart and HCFA is initiating a 
review of the accreditation organization's deeming authority.
    (ii) A State licensure program indicating that its CLIA exemption 
may be in jeopardy if a comparability or validation review reveals that 
it is not meeting the requirements of this subpart and that a review is 
being initiated of the CLIA exemption of the State's laboratories.

[[Page 841]]

    (2) The notice contains the following information:
    (i) A statement of the discrepancies that were found as well as 
other related documentation.
    (ii) An explanation of HCFA's review process on which the final 
determination is based and a description of the possible actions, as 
specified in Sec. 493.575, that HCFA may impose based on the findings 
from the comparability or validation review.
    (iii) A description of the procedures available if the accreditation 
organization or State licensure program, as applicable, desires an 
opportunity to explain or justify the findings made during the 
comparability or validation review.
    (iv) The reapplication materials that the accreditation organization 
or State licensure program must submit and the deadline for that 
submission.


<R05>
Sec. 493.575  Removal of deeming authority or CLIA exemption and final determination review.

    (a) HCFA review. HCFA conducts a review of the following:
    (1) A deeming authority review of an accreditation organization's 
program if the comparability or validation review produces findings, as 
described at Sec. 493.573. HCFA reviews, as appropriate, the criteria 
described in Secs. 493.555 and 493.557(a) to reevaluate whether the 
accreditation organization continues to meet all these criteria.
    (2) An exemption review of a State's licensure program if the 
comparability or validation review produces findings, as described at 
Sec. 493.573. HCFA reviews, as appropriate, the criteria described in 
Secs. 493.555 and 493.557(b) to reevaluate whether the licensure program 
continues to meet all these criteria.
    (3) A review of an accreditation organization or State licensure 
program, at HCFA's discretion, if validation review findings, 
irrespective of the rate of disparity, indicate widespread or systematic 
problems in the organization's accreditation or State's licensure 
process that provide evidence that the requirements, taken as a whole, 
are no longer equivalent to CLIA requirements, taken as a whole.
    (4) A review of the accreditation organization or State licensure 
program whenever validation inspection results indicate a rate of 
disparity of 20 percent or more between the findings of the organization 
or State and those of HCFA or a HCFA agent for the following periods:
    (i) One year for accreditation organizations.
    (ii) Two years for State licensure programs.
    (b) HCFA action after review. Following the review, HCFA may take 
the following action:
    (1) If HCFA determines that the accreditation organization or State 
has failed to adopt requirements equal to, or more stringent than, CLIA 
requirements, HCFA may give a conditional approval for a probationary 
period of its deeming authority to an organization 30 days following the 
date of HCFA's determination, or exempt status to a State within 30 days 
of HCFA's determination, both not to exceed 1 year, to afford the 
organization or State an opportunity to adopt equal or more stringent 
requirements.
    (2) If HCFA determines that there are widespread or systematic 
problems in the organization's or State's inspection process, HCFA may 
give conditional approval during a probationary period, not to exceed 1 
year, effective 30 days following the date of the determination.
    (c) Final determination. HCFA makes a final determination as to 
whether the organization or State continues to meet the criteria 
described in this subpart and issues a notice that includes the reasons 
for the determination to the organization or State within 60 days after 
the end of any probationary period. This determination is based on an 
evaluation of any of the following:
    (1) The most recent validation inspection and review findings. To 
continue to be approved, the organization or State must meet the 
criteria of this subpart.
    (2) Facility-specific data, as well as other related information.
    (3) The organization's or State's inspection procedures, surveyors' 
qualifications, ongoing education, training, and composition of 
inspection teams.
    (4) The organization's accreditation requirements, or the State's 
licensure or approval requirements.

[[Page 842]]

    (d) Date of withdrawal of approval. HCFA may withdraw its approval 
of the accreditation organization or State licensure program, effective 
30 days from the date of written notice to the organization or State of 
this proposed action, if improvements acceptable to HCFA have not been 
made during the probationary period.
    (e) Continuation of validation inspections. The existence of any 
validation review, probationary status, or any other action, such as a 
deeming authority review, by HCFA does not affect or limit the conduct 
of any validation inspection.
    (f) Federal Register notice. HCFA publishes a notice in the Federal 
Register containing a justification for removing the deeming authority 
from an accreditation organization, or the CLIA-exempt status of a State 
licensure program.
    (g) Withdrawal of approval-effect on laboratory status--(1) 
Accredited laboratory. After HCFA withdraws approval of an accreditation 
organization's deeming authority, the certificate of accreditation of 
each affected laboratory continues in effect for 60 days after it 
receives notification of the withdrawal of approval.
    (2) CLIA-exempt laboratory. After HCFA withdraws approval of a State 
licensure program, the exempt status of each licensed or approved 
laboratory in the State continues in effect for 60 days after a 
laboratory receives notification from the State of the withdrawal of 
HCFA's approval of the program.
    (3) Extension. After HCFA withdraws approval of an accreditation 
organization or State licensure program, HCFA may extend the period for 
an additional 60 days for a laboratory if it determines that the 
laboratory submitted an application for accreditation to an approved 
accreditation organization or an application for the appropriate 
certificate to HCFA or a HCFA agent before the initial 60-day period 
ends.
    (h) Immediate jeopardy to patients. (1) If at any time HCFA 
determines that the continued approval of deeming authority of any 
accreditation organization poses immediate jeopardy to the patients of 
the laboratories accredited by the organization, or continued approval 
otherwise constitutes a significant hazard to the public health, HCFA 
may immediately withdraw the approval of deeming authority for that 
accreditation organization.
    (2) If at any time HCFA determines that the continued approval of a 
State licensure program poses immediate jeopardy to the patients of the 
laboratories in that State, or continued approval otherwise constitutes 
a significant hazard to the public health, HCFA may immediately withdraw 
the approval of that State licensure program.
    (i) Failure to pay fees. HCFA withdraws the approval of a State 
licensure program if the State fails to pay the applicable fees, as 
specified in Secs. 493.645(a) and 493.646(b).
    (j) State refusal to take enforcement action. (1) HCFA may withdraw 
approval of a State licensure program if the State refuses to take 
enforcement action against a laboratory in that State when HCFA 
determines it to be necessary.
    (2) A laboratory that is in a State in which HCFA has withdrawn 
program approval is subject to the same requirements and survey and 
enforcement processes that are applied to a laboratory that is not 
exempt from CLIA requirements.
    (k) Request for reconsideration. Any accreditation organization or 
State that is dissatisfied with a determination to withdraw approval of 
its deeming authority or remove approval of its State licensure program, 
as applicable, may request that HCFA reconsider the determination, in 
accordance with subpart D of part 488.

<R05>
Sec. 493.602  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the methodology for determining the amount 
of the fees for issuing the appropriate certificate, and for determining 
compliance with the applicable standards of the Public Health Service 
Act (the PHS

[[Page 843]]

Act) and the Federal validation of accredited laboratories and of CLIA-
exempt laboratories.

[60 FR 20047, Apr. 24, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 493.606  Applicability of subpart.

    The rules of this subpart are applicable to those laboratories 
specified in Sec. 493.3.

[58 FR 5212, Jan. 19, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 493.638  Certificate fees.

    (a) Basic rule. Laboratories must pay a fee for the issuance of a 
registration certificate, certificate for PPM procedures, certificate of 
waiver, certificate of accreditation, or a certificate of compliance, as 
applicable. Laboratories must also pay a fee to reapply for a 
certificate for PPM procedures, certificate of waiver, certificate of 
accreditation, or a certificate of compliance. The total of fees 
collected by HHS under the laboratory program must be sufficient to 
cover the general costs of administering the laboratory certification 
program under section 353 of the PHS Act.
    (1) For registration certificates and certificates of compliance, 
the costs include issuing the certificates, collecting the fees, 
evaluating and monitoring proficiency testing programs, evaluating which 
procedures, tests or examinations meet the criteria for inclusion in the 
appropriate complexity category, and implementing section 353 of the PHS 
Act.
    (2) For a certificate of waiver, the costs include issuing the 
certificate, collecting the fees, determining if a certificate of waiver 
should be issued, evaluating which tests qualify for inclusion in the 
waived category, and other direct administrative costs.
    (3) For a certificate for PPM procedures, the costs include issuing 
the certificate, collecting the fees, determining if a certificate for 
PPM procedures should be issued, evaluating which procedures meet the 
criteria for inclusion in the subcategory of PPM procedures, and other 
direct administrative costs.
    (4) For a certificate of accreditation, the costs include issuing 
the certificate, collecting the fees, evaluating the programs of 
accrediting bodies, and other direct administrative costs.
    (b) Fee amount. The fee amount is set annually by HHS on a calendar 
year basis and is based on the category of test complexity, or on the 
category of test complexity and schedules or ranges of annual laboratory 
test volume (excluding waived tests and tests performed for quality 
control, quality assurance, and proficiency testing purposes) and 
specialties tested, with the amounts of the fees in each schedule being 
a function of the costs for all aspects of general administration of 
CLIA as set forth in Sec. 493.649 (b) and (c). This fee is assessed and 
payable at least biennially. The methodology used to determine the 
amount of the fee is found in Sec. 493.649. The amount of the fee 
applicable to the issuance of the registration certificate or the 
issuance or renewal of the certificate for PPM procedures, certificate 
of waiver, certificate of accreditation, or certificate of compliance is 
the amount in effect at the time the application is received. Upon 
receipt of an application for a certificate, HHS or its designee 
notifies the laboratory of the amount of the required fee for the 
requested certificate.

<R05>
Sec. 493.639  Fee for revised certificate.

    (a) If, after a laboratory is issued a registration certificate, it 
changes its name or location, the laboratory must pay a fee to cover the 
cost of issuing a revised registration certificate. The fee for the 
revised registration certificate is based on the cost to issue the 
revised certificate to the laboratory.
    (b) A laboratory must pay a fee to cover the cost of issuing a 
revised certificate in any of the following circumstances:
    (1) The fee for issuing an appropriate revised certificate is based 
on the cost to issue the revised certificate to the laboratory as 
follows:
    (i) If a laboratory with a certificate of waiver wishes to perform 
tests in addition to those listed in Sec. 493.15(c) as waived tests, it 
must, as set forth in Sec. 493.638, pay an additional fee for the 
appropriate certificate to cover the additional testing.
    (ii) If a laboratory with a certificate for PPM procedures wishes to 
perform tests in addition to those specified as PPM procedures or listed 
in Sec. 493.15(c)

[[Page 844]]

as waived tests, it must, as set forth in Sec. 493.638, pay an 
additional fee for the appropriate certificate to cover the additional 
testing.
    (2) A laboratory must pay a fee to cover the cost of issuing a 
revised certificate when--
    (i) A laboratory changes its name, location, or its director; or
    (ii) A laboratory deletes services or wishes to add services and 
requests that its certificate be changed. (An additional fee is also 
required under Sec. 493.643(d) if it is necessary to determine 
compliance with additional requirements.)

[57 FR 7213, Feb. 28, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 20047, Apr, 24, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 493.643  Fee for determination of program compliance.

    (a) Fee requirement. In addition to the fee required under 
Sec. 493.638, a laboratory subject to routine inspections must pay a fee 
to cover the cost of determining program compliance. Laboratories issued 
a certificate for PPM procedures, certificate of waiver, or a 
certificate of accreditation are not subject to this fee for routine 
inspections.
    (b) Costs included in the fee. Included in the fee for determining 
program compliance is the cost of evaluating qualifications of 
personnel; monitoring proficiency testing; conducting onsite 
inspections; documenting deficiencies; evaluating laboratories' plans to 
correct deficiencies; and necessary administrative costs. HHS sets the 
fee amounts annually on a calendar year basis. Laboratories are 
inspected biennially; therefore, fees are assessed and payable 
biennially. If additional expenses are incurred to conduct follow up 
visits to verify correction of deficiencies, to impose sanctions, and/or 
for surveyor preparation for and attendance at ALJ hearings, HHS 
assesses an additional fee to include these costs. The additional fee is 
based on the actual resources and time necessary to perform the 
activities.
    (c) Classification of laboratories that require inspection for 
purpose of determining amount of fee. (1) There are ten classifications 
(schedules) of laboratories for the purpose of determining the fee 
amount a laboratory is assessed. Each laboratory is placed into one of 
the ten following schedules based on the laboratory's scope and volume 
of testing (excluding tests performed for quality control, quality 
assurance, and proficiency testing purposes).
    (i) (A) Schedule A Low Volume. The laboratory performs not more than 
2,000 laboratory tests annually.
    (B) Schedule A. The laboratory performs tests in no more than 3 
specialties of service with a total annual volume of more than 2,000 but 
not more than 10,000 laboratory tests.
    (ii) Schedule B. The laboratory performs tests in at least 4 
specialties of service with a total annual volume of not more than 
10,000 laboratory tests.
    (iii) Schedule C. The laboratory performs tests in no more 3 
specialties of service with a total annual volume of more than 10,000 
but not more than 25,000 laboratory tests.
    (iv) Schedule D. The laboratory performs tests in at least 4 
specialties with a total annual volume of more than 10,000 but not more 
than 25,000 laboratory tests.
    (v) Schedule E. The laboratory performs more than 25,000 but not 
more than 50,000 laboratory tests annually.
    (vi) Schedule F. The laboratory performs more than 50,000 but not 
more than 75,000 laboratory tests annually.
    (vii) Schedule G. The laboratory performs more than 75,000 but not 
more than 100,000 laboratory tests annually.
    (viii) Schedule H. The laboratory performs more than 100,000 but not 
more than 500,000 laboratory tests annually.
    (ix) Schedule I. The laboratory performs more than 500,000 but not 
more than 1,000,000 laboratory tests annually.
    (x) Schedule J. The laboratory performs more than 1,000,000 
laboratory tests annually.
    (2) For purposes of determining a laboratory's classification under 
this section, a test is a procedure or examination for a single analyte. 
(Tests performed for quality control, quality assurance, and proficiency 
testing are excluded from the laboratory's total annual volume). Each 
profile (that is, group of tests) is counted as the number of separate 
procedures or examinations; for example, a chemistry profile consisting 
of 18 tests is counted as 18 separate procedures or tests.

[[Page 845]]

    (3) For purposes of determining a laboratory's classification under 
this section, the specialties and subspecialties of service for 
inclusion are:
    (i) The specialty of Microbiology, which includes one or more of the 
following subspecialties:
    (A) Bacteriology.
    (B) Mycobacteriology.
    (C) Mycology.
    (D) Parasitology.
    (E) Virology.
    (ii) The specialty of Serology, which includes one or more of the 
following subspecialties:
    (A) Syphilis Serology.
    (B) General immunology
    (iii) The specialty of Chemistry, which includes one or more of the 
following subspecialties:
    (A) Routine chemistry.
    (B) Endocrinology.
    (C) Toxicology.
    (D) Urinalysis.
    (iv) The specialty of Hematology.
    (v) The specialty of Immunohematology, which includes one or more of 
the following subspecialties:
    (A) ABO grouping and Rh typing.
    (B) Unexpected antibody detection.
    (C) Compatibility testing.
    (D) Unexpected antibody identification.
    (vi) The specialty of Pathology, which includes the following 
subspecialties:
    (A) Cytology.
    (B) Histopathology.
    (C) Oral pathology.
    (vii) The specialty of Radiobioassay.
    (viii) The specialty of Histocompatibility.
    (ix) The specialty of Cytogenetics.
    (d) Additional fees. (1) If after a certificate of compliance is 
issued, a laboratory adds services and requests that its certificate be 
upgraded, the laboratory must pay an additional fee if, in order to 
determine compliance with additional requirements, it is necessary to 
conduct an inspection, evaluate personnel, or monitor proficiency 
testing performance. The additional fee is based on the actual resources 
and time necessary to perform the activities. HHS revokes the 
laboratory's certificate for failure to pay the compliance determination 
fee.
    (2) If it is necessary to conduct a complaint investigation, impose 
sanctions, or conduct a hearing, HHS assesses the laboratory holding a 
certificate of compliance a fee to cover the cost of these activities. 
If a complaint investigation results in a complaint being 
unsubstantiated, or if an HHS adverse action is overturned at the 
conclusion of the administrative appeals process, the government's costs 
of these activities are not imposed upon the laboratory. Costs for these 
activities are based on the actual resources and time necessary to 
perform the activities and are not assessed until after the laboratory 
concedes the existence of deficiencies or an ALJ rules in favor of HHS. 
HHS revokes the laboratory's certificate of compliance for failure to 
pay the assessed costs.

[57 FR 7138 and 7213, Feb. 28, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 20047, Apr. 24, 
1995]


<R05>
Sec. 493.645  Additional fee(s) applicable to approved State laboratory programs and laboratories issued a certificate of accreditation, certificate of waiver, 
          or certificate for PPM procedures.

    (a) Approved State laboratory programs. State laboratory programs 
approved by HHS are assessed a fee for the following:
    (1) Costs of Federal inspections of laboratories in that State (that 
is, CLIA-exempt laboratories) to verify that standards are being 
enforced in an appropriate manner.
    (2) Costs incurred for investigations of complaints against the 
State's CLIA-exempt laboratories if the complaint is substantiated.
    (3) Costs of the State's prorata share of general overhead to 
develop and implement CLIA.
    (b) Accredited laboratories. (1) In addition to the certificate fee, 
a laboratory that is issued a certificate of accreditation is also 
assessed a fee to cover the cost of evaluating individual laboratories 
to determine overall whether an accreditation organization's standards 
and inspection policies are equivalent to the Federal program. All 
accredited laboratories share in the cost of these inspections. These 
costs are the same as those that are incurred when inspecting 
nonaccredited laboratories.

[[Page 846]]

    (2) If a laboratory issued a certificate of accreditation has been 
inspected and followup visits are necessary because of identified 
deficiencies, HHS assesses the laboratory a fee to cover the cost of 
these visits. The fee is based on the actual resources and time 
necessary to perform the followup visits. HHS revokes the laboratory's 
certificate of accreditation for failure to pay the assessed fee.
    (c) If, in the case of a laboratory that has been issued a 
certificate of accreditation, certificate of waiver, or certificate for 
PPM procedures, it is necessary to conduct a complaint investigation, 
impose sanctions, or conduct a hearing, HHS assesses that laboratory a 
fee to cover the cost of these activities. Costs are based on the actual 
resources and time necessary to perform the activities and are not 
assessed until after the laboratory concedes the existence of 
deficiencies or an ALJ rules in favor of HHS. HHS revokes the 
laboratory's certificate for failure to pay the assessed costs. If a 
complaint investigation results in a complaint being unsubstantiated, or 
if an HHS adverse action is overturned at the conclusion of the 
administrative appeals process, the costs of these activities are not 
imposed upon the laboratory.

<R05>
Sec. 493.646  Payment of fees.

    (a) Except for CLIA-exempt laboratories, all laboratories are 
notified in writing by HHS or its designee of the appropriate fee(s) and 
instructions for submitting the fee(s), including the due date for 
payment and where to make payment. The appropriate certificate is not 
issued until the applicable fees have been paid.
    (b) For State-exempt laboratories, HHS estimates the cost of 
conducting validation surveys within the State for a 2-year period. HHS 
or its designee notifies the State by mail of the appropriate fees, 
including the due date for payment and the address of the United States 
Department of Treasury designated commercial bank to which payment must 
be made. In addition, if complaint investigations are conducted in 
laboratories within these States and are substantiated, HHS bills the 
State(s) the costs of the complaint investigations.

1995]


<R05>
Sec. 493.649  Methodology for determining fee amount.

    (a) General rule. The amount of the fee in each schedule for 
compliance determination inspections is based on the average hourly rate 
(which includes the costs to perform the required activities and 
necessary administration costs) multiplied by the average number of 
hours required or, if activities are performed by more than one of the 
entities listed in paragraph (b) of this section, the sum of the 
products of the applicable hourly rates multiplied by the average number 
of hours required by the entity to perform the activity. The fee for 
issuance of the registration certificate or certificate of compliance is 
based on the laboratory's scope and volume of testing.
    (b) Determining average hourly rates used in fee schedules. Three 
different entities perform activities related to the issuance or 
reissuance of any certificate. HHS determines the average hourly rates 
for the activities of each of these entities.
    (1) State survey agencies. The following costs are included in 
determining an average hourly rate for the activities performed by State 
survey agencies:
    (i) The costs incurred by the State survey agencies in evaluating 
personnel qualifications and monitoring each laboratory's participation 
in an approved proficiency testing program. The cost of onsite 
inspections and monitoring activities is the hourly rate derived as a 
result of an annual budget negotiation process with each State. The 
hourly rate encompasses salary costs (as determined by each State's 
civil service pay scale) and fringe benefit costs to support the 
required number of State inspectors, management and direct support 
staff.
    (ii) Travel costs necessary to comply with each State's 
administrative requirements and other direct costs such as equipment, 
printing, and supplies. These costs are established based on historical 
State requirements.

[[Page 847]]

    (iii) Indirect costs as negotiated by HHS.
    (2) Federal agencies. The hourly rate for activities performed by 
Federal agencies is the most recent average hourly cost to HHS to staff 
and support a full time equivalent employee. Included in this cost are 
salary and fringe benefit costs, necessary administrative costs, such as 
printing, training, postage, express mail, supplies, equipment, computer 
system and building service charges associated with support services 
provided by organizational components such as a computer center, and any 
other oversight activities necessary to support the program.
    (3) HHS contractors. The hourly rate for activities performed by HHS 
contractors is the average hourly rate established for contractor 
assistance based on an independent government cost estimate for the 
required workload. This rate includes the cost of contractor support to 
provide proficiency testing programs to laboratories that do not 
participate in an approved proficiency testing program, provide 
specialized assistance in the evaluation of laboratory performance in an 
approved proficiency testing program, perform assessments of cytology 
testing laboratories, conduct special studies, bill and collect fees, 
issue certificates, establish accounting, monitoring and reporting 
systems, and assist with necessary surveyor training.
    (c) Determining number of hours. The average number of hours used to 
determine the overall fee in each schedule is HHS's estimate, based on 
historical experience, of the average time needed by each entity to 
perform the activities for which it is responsible.

Subpart G--[Reserved]


<R04>
    Subpart H--Participation in Proficiency Testing for Laboratories 
  Performing Tests of Moderate Complexity (Including the Subcategory), 
           High Complexity, or Any Combination of These Tests

    Source: 57 FR 7146, Feb. 28, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 493.801  Condition: Enrollment and testing of samples.

    Each laboratory must enroll in a proficiency testing (PT) program 
that meets the criteria in subpart I of this part and is approved by 
HHS. The laboratory must enroll in an approved program or programs for 
each of the specialties and subspecialties for which it seeks 
certification. The laboratory must test the samples in the same manner 
as patients' specimens. For laboratories subject to 42 CFR part 493 
published on March 14, 1990 (55 FR 9538) prior to September 1, 1992, the 
rules of this subpart are effective on September 1, 1992. For all other 
laboratories, the rules of this subpart are effective January 1, 1994.
    (a) Standard; Enrollment. The laboratory must--
    (1) Notify HHS of the approved program or programs in which it 
chooses to participate to meet proficiency testing requirements of this 
subpart.
    (2)(i) Designate the program(s) to be used for each specialty, 
subspecialty, and analyte or test to determine compliance with this 
subpart if the laboratory participates in more than one proficiency 
testing program approved by HCFA; and
    (ii) For those tests performed by the laboratory that are not 
included in subpart I of this part, a laboratory must establish and 
maintain the accuracy of its testing procedures, in accordance with 
Sec. 493.1709.
    (3) For each specialty, subspecialty and analyte or test, 
participate in one approved proficiency testing program

[[Page 848]]

or programs, for one year before designating a different program and 
must notify HCFA before any change in designation; and
    (4) Authorize the proficiency testing program to release to HHS all 
data required to--
    (i) Determine the laboratory's compliance with this subpart; and
    (ii) Make PT results available to the public as required in section 
353(f)(3)(F) of the Public Health Service Act.
    (b) Standard; Testing of proficiency testing samples. The laboratory 
must examine or test, as applicable, the proficiency testing samples it 
receives from the proficiency testing program in the same manner as it 
tests patient specimens.
    (1) The samples must be examined or tested with the laboratory's 
regular patient workload by personnel who routinely perform the testing 
in the laboratory, using the laboratory's routine methods. The 
individual testing or examining the samples and the laboratory director 
must attest to the routine integration of the samples into the patient 
workload using the laboratory's routine methods.
    (2) The laboratory must test samples the same number of times that 
it routinely tests patient samples.
    (3) Laboratories that perform tests on proficiency testing samples 
must not engage in any inter-laboratory communications pertaining to the 
results of proficiency testing sample(s) until after the date by which 
the laboratory must report proficiency testing results to the program 
for the testing event in which the samples were sent. Laboratories with 
multiple testing sites or separate locations must not participate in any 
communications or discussions across sites/locations concerning 
proficiency testing sample results until after the date by which the 
laboratory must report proficiency testing results to the program.
    (4) The laboratory must not send PT samples or portions of samples 
to another laboratory for any analysis which it is certified to perform 
in its own laboratory. Any laboratory that HCFA determines intentionally 
referred its proficiency testing samples to another laboratory for 
analysis will have its certification revoked for at least one year. Any 
laboratory that receives proficiency testing samples from another 
laboratory for testing must notify HCFA of the receipt of those samples.
    (5) The laboratory must document the handling, preparation, 
processing, examination, and each step in the testing and reporting of 
results for all proficiency testing samples. The laboratory must 
maintain a copy of all records, including a copy of the proficiency 
testing program report forms used by the laboratory to record 
proficiency testing results including the attestation statement provided 
by the PT program, signed by the analyst and the laboratory director, 
documenting that proficiency testing samples were tested in the same 
manner as patient specimens, for a minimum of two years from the date of 
the proficiency testing event.
    (6) PT is required for only the test system, assay, or examination 
used as the primary method for patient testing during the PT event.

Sec. 493.803  Condition: Successful participation.

    (a) Each laboratory performing tests of moderate complexity 
(including the subcategory) and/or high complexity must successfully 
participate in a proficiency testing program approved by HCFA, if 
applicable, as described in subpart I of this part for each specialty, 
subspecialty, and analyte or test in which the laboratory is certified 
under CLIA.
    (b) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a 
laboratory fails to participate successfully in proficiency testing for 
a given specialty, subspecialty, analyte or test, as defined in this 
section, or fails to take remedial action when an individual fails 
gynecologic cytology, HCFA imposes sanctions, as specified in subpart R 
of this part.
    (c) If a laboratory fails to perform successfully in a HCFA-approved 
proficiency testing program, for the initial unsuccessful performance, 
HCFA may direct the laboratory to undertake training of its personnel or 
to obtain technical assistance, or both, rather

[[Page 849]]

than imposing alternative or principle sanctions except when one or more 
of the following conditions exists:
    (1) There is immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.
    (2) The laboratory fails to provide HCFA or a HCFA agent with 
satisfactory evidence that it has taken steps to correct the problem 
identified by the unsuccessful proficiency testing performance.
    (3) The laboratory has a poor compliance history.

<R05>
Sec. 493.807  Condition: Reinstatement of laboratories performing tests of moderate complexity (including the subcategory), high complexity, or any combination 
          of these tests, after failure to participate successfully.

    (a) If a laboratory's certificate is suspended or limited or its 
Medicare or Medicaid approval is cancelled or its Medicare or Medicaid 
payments are suspended because it fails to participate successfully in 
proficiency testing for one or more specialties, subspecialties, analyte 
or test, or voluntarily withdraws its certification under CLIA for the 
failed specialty, subspecialty, or analyte, the laboratory must then 
demonstrate sustained satisfactory performance on two consecutive 
proficiency testing events, one of which may be on site, before HCFA 
will consider it for reinstatement for certification and Medicare or 
Medicaid approval in that specialty, subspecialty, analyte or test.
    (b) The cancellation period for Medicare and Medicaid approval or 
period for suspension of Medicare or Medicaid payments or suspension or 
limitation of certification under CLIA for the failed specialty, 
subspecialty, or analyte or test is for a period of not less than six 
months from the date of cancellation, limitation or suspension of the 
CLIA certificate.

performance.


<R05>
Sec. 493.853  Condition: Pathology.

    The specialty of pathology includes, for purposes of proficiency 
testing, the subspecialty of cytology limited to gynecologic 
examinations.


<R05>
Sec. 493.855  Standard; Cytology: gynecologic examinations.

    To participate successfully in a cytology proficiency testing 
program for gynecologic examinations (Pap smears), the laboratory must 
meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
    (a) The laboratory must ensure that each individual engaged in the 
examination of gynecologic preparations is enrolled in a proficiency 
testing program approved by HCFA by January 1, 1995, if available in the 
State in which he or she is employed. The laboratory must ensure that 
each individual is tested at least once per year and obtains a passing 
score. To ensure this annual testing of individuals, an announced or 
unannounced testing event will be conducted on-site in each laboratory 
at least once each year. Laboratories will be notified of the time of 
each announced on-site testing event at least 30 days prior to each 
event. Additional testing events will be conducted as necessary in each 
State or region for the purpose of testing individuals who miss the on-
site testing event and for retesting individuals as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The laboratory must ensure that each individual participates in 
an annual testing event that involves the examination of a 10-slide test 
set as described in Sec. 493.945. Individuals who fail this testing 
event are retested with another 10-slide test set as described in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. Individuals who fail this 
second test are subsequently retested with a 20-slide test set as 
described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. Individuals 
are given not more than 2 hours to complete a 10-slide test and not more 
than 4 hours to complete a 20-slide test. Unexcused failure to appear by 
an individual for a retest will result in test failure with resulting 
remediation and limitations on slide examinations as specified in 
(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section.
    (1) An individual is determined to have failed the annual testing 
event if he or she scores less than 90 percent on a 10-slide test set. 
For an individual who fails an annual proficiency testing event, the 
laboratory must schedule a retesting event which must take place not 
more than 45 days after receipt of the notification of failure.
    (2) An individual is determined to have failed the second testing 
event if he or she scores less than 90 percent on a 10-slide test set. 
For an individual who fails a second testing event, the laboratory must 
provide him or her with documented, remedial training and education in 
the area of failure, and must assure that all gynecologic slides 
evaluated subsequent to the notice of failure are reexamined until the 
individual is again retested with a 20-slide test set and scores at 
least 90 percent. Reexamination of slides must be documented.
    (3) An individual is determined to have failed the third testing 
event if he or she scores less than 90 percent on a 20-slide test set. 
An individual who fails the third testing event must cease examining 
gynecologic slide preparations immediately upon notification of test 
failure and may not resume examining gynecologic slides until the 
laboratory assures that the individual obtains at least 35 hours of 
documented, formally structured, continuing education in diagnostic 
cytopathology that focuses on the examination of gynecologic 
preparations, and until he or she is retested with a 20-slide test set 
and scores at least 90 percent.
    (c) If a laboratory fails to ensure that individuals are tested or 
those who fail a testing event are retested, or fails to take required 
remedial actions as described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of 
this section, HCFA will initiate intermediate sanctions or limit the 
laboratory's certificate to exclude gynecologic cytology testing under 
CLIA, and, if applicable, suspend the laboratory's Medicare and Medicaid 
payments for gynecologic cytology

<R05>
Sec. 493.901  Approval of proficiency testing programs.

    In order for a proficiency testing program to receive HHS approval, 
the program must be offered by a private nonprofit organization or a 
Federal or State agency, or entity acting as a designated agent for the 
State. An organization, Federal, or State program seeking approval or 
reapproval for its program for the next calendar year must submit an 
application providing the required information by July 1 of the current 
year. The organization, Federal, or State program must provide technical 
assistance to laboratories seeking to qualify under the program, and 
must, for each specialty, subspecialty, and analyte or test for which it 
provides testing--
    (a) Assure the quality of test samples, appropriately evaluate and 
score the testing results, and identify performance problems in a timely 
manner;
    (b) Demonstrate to HHS that it has--
    (1) The technical ability required to--
    (i) Prepare or purchase samples from manufacturers who prepare the 
samples in conformance with the appropriate good manufacturing practices 
required in 21 CFR parts 606, 640, and 820; and
    (ii) Distribute the samples, using rigorous quality control to 
assure that samples mimic actual patient specimens when possible and 
that samples are homogeneous, except for specific subspecialties such as 
cytology, and will be stable within the time frame for analysis by 
proficiency testing participants;

       Proficiency Testing Programs by Specialty and Subspecialty


<R05>
Sec. 493.909  Microbiology.

    The subspecialties under the specialty of microbiology for which a 
program may offer proficiency testing are bacteriology, 
mycobacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology. Specific criteria 
for these subspecialties are found at Secs. 493.911 through 493.919.


<R05>
Sec. 493.911  Bacteriology.

    (a) Types of services offered by laboratories. In bacteriology, for 
proficiency testing purposes, there are five types of laboratories:
    (1) Those that interpret Gram stains or perform primary inoculation, 
or both; and refer cultures to another laboratory appropriately 
certified for the subspecialty of bacteriology for identification;
    (2) Those that use direct antigen techniques to detect an organism 
and may also interpret Gram stains or perform primary inoculation, or 
perform any combination of these;
    (3) Those that, in addition to interpreting Gram stains, performing 
primary inoculations, and using direct antigen tests, also isolate and 
identify aerobic bacteria from throat, urine, cervical, or urethral 
discharge specimens to the genus level and may also perform 
antimicrobial susceptibility tests on selected isolated microorganisms;
    (4) Those that perform the services in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section and also isolate and identify aerobic bacteria from any source 
to the species level and may also perform antimicrobial susceptibility 
tests; and
    (5) Those that perform the services in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section and also isolate and identify anaerobic bacteria from any 
source.
    (b) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing for bacteriology, the

[[Page 860]]

annual program must provide a minimum of five samples per testing event. 
There must be at least three testing events at approximately equal 
intervals per year. The samples may be provided to the laboratory 
through mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, may be provided to HHS or 
its designee for on-site testing. For the types of laboratories 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, an annual program must 
include samples that contain organisms that are representative of the 
six major groups of bacteria: anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae, gram-
positive bacilli, gram-positive cocci, gram-negative cocci, and 
miscellaneous gram-negative bacteria, as appropriate. The specific 
organisms included in the samples may vary from year to year. The annual 
program must include samples for bacterial antigen detection, bacterial 
isolation and identification, Gram stain, and antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing.
    (1) An approved program must furnish HHS with a description of 
samples that it plans to include in its annual program no later than six 
months before each calendar year. At least 50 percent of the samples 
must be mixtures of the principal organism and appropriate normal flora. 
The program must include other important emerging pathogens (as 
determined by HHS) and either organisms commonly occurring in patient 
specimens or opportunistic pathogens. The program must include the 
following two types of samples; each type of sample must meet the 50 
percent mixed culture criterion:
    (i) Samples that require laboratories to report only organisms that 
the testing laboratory considers to be a principal pathogen that is 
clearly responsible for a described illness (excluding immuno-
compromised patients). The program determines the reportable isolates, 
including antimicrobial susceptibility for any designated isolate; and
    (ii) Samples that require laboratories to report all organisms 
present. Samples must contain multiple organisms frequently found in 
specimens such as urine, blood, abscesses, and aspirates where multiple 
isolates are clearly significant or where specimens are derived from 
immuno-compromised patients. The program determines the reportable 
isolates.
    (2) An approved program may vary over time. For example, the types 
of organisms that might be included in an approved program over time 
are--

Anaerobes:
    Bacteroides fragilis group
    Clostridium perfringens
    Peptostreptococcus anaerobius
    Enterobacteriaceae
    Citrobacter freundii
    Enterobacter aerogenes
    Escherichia coli
    Klebsiella pneumoniae
    Proteus mirabilis
    Salmonella typhimurium
    Serratia marcescens
    Shigella sonnei
    Yersinia enterocolitica
Gram-positive bacilli:
    Listeria monocytogenes
    Corynebacterium species CDC Group JK
Gram-positive cocci:
    Staphylococcus aureus
    Streptococcus Group A
    Streptococcus Group B
    Streptococcus Group D (S. bovis and enterococcus)
    Streptococcus pneumoniae
Gram-negative cocci:
    Branhamella catarrhalis
    Neisseria gonorrhoeae
    Neisseria meningitidis
Miscellaneous Gram-negative bacteria:
    Campylobacter jejuni
    Haemophilis influenza, Type B
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa

    (3) For antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the program must 
provide at least one sample per testing event that includes gram-
positive or gram-negative strains that have a predetermined pattern of 
sensitivity or resistance to the common antimicrobial agents.
    (c) Evaluation of a laboratory's performance. HHS approves only 
those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's responses in 
accordance with paragraphs (c) (1) through (7) of this section.
    (1) The program determines staining characteristics to be 
interpreted by Gram stain. The program determines the reportable 
bacteria to be detected by direct antigen techniques or isolation. To 
determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for Gram stain 
interpretation, direct antigen detection, identification, or 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the program

[[Page 861]]

must compare the laboratory's response for each sample with the response 
which reflects agreement of either 90 percent of ten or more referee 
laboratories or 90 percent or more of all participating laboratories.
    (2) To evaluate a laboratory's response for a particular sample, the 
program must determine a laboratory's type of service in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. A laboratory must isolate and identify 
the organisms to the same extent it performs these procedures on patient 
specimens. A laboratory's performance will be evaluated on the basis of 
its final answer, for example, a laboratory specified in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section will be evaluated on the basis of the average of 
its scores for paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(6) as determined in 
paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
    (3) Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of 
organisms in addition to the correctly identified principal organism(s), 
the grading system must provide a means of deducting credit for 
additional erroneous organisms that are reported. Therefore, the total 
number of correct responses for organism isolation and identification 
submitted by the laboratory divided by the number of organisms present 
plus the number of incorrect organisms reported by the laboratory must 
be multiplied by 100 to establish a score for each sample in each 
testing event. For example, if a sample contained one principal organism 
and the laboratory reported it correctly but reported the presence of an 
additional organism, which was not considered reportable, the sample 
grade would be 1/(1+1) x 100=50 percent.
    (4) For antimicrobial susceptibility testing, a laboratory must 
indicate which drugs are routinely included in its test panel when 
testing patient samples. A laboratory's performance will be evaluated 
for only those antibiotics for which service is offered. A correct 
response for each antibiotic will be determined as described in 
Secs. 493.911(c) (1) using criteria such as the guidelines established 
by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Grading is 
based on the number of correct susceptibility responses reported by the 
laboratory divided by the actual number of correct susceptibility 
responses determined by the program, multiplied by 100. For example, if 
a laboratory offers susceptibility testing for Enterobacteriaceae using 
amikacin, cephalothin, and tobramycin, and the organism in the 
proficiency testing sample is an Enterobacteriaceae, and the laboratory 
reports correct responses for two of three antimicrobial agents, the 
laboratory's grade would be 2/3 x 100=67 percent.
    (5) The performance criterion for qualitative antigen tests is the 
presence or absence of the bacterial antigen. The score for antigen 
tests is the number of correct responses divided by the number of 
samples to be tested for the antigen, multiplied by 100.
    (6) The performance criteria for Gram stain is staining reaction, 
i.e., gram positive or gram negative. The score for Gram stain is the 
number of correct responses divided by the number of challenges to be 
tested, multiplied by 100.
    (7) The score for a testing event in bacteriology is the average of 
the scores determined under paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(6) of this 
section kbased on the type of service offered by the laboratory.

Sec. 493.913  Mycobacteriology.

    (a) Types of services offered by laboratories. In mycobacteriology, 
there are five types of laboratories for proficiency testing purposes:
    (1) Those that interpret acid-fast stains and refer specimen to 
another laboratory appropriately certified in the subspecialty of 
mycobacteriology;
    (2) Those that interpret acid-fast stains, perform primary 
inoculation, and refer cultures to another laboratory appropriately 
certified in the subspecialty of mycobacteriology for identification;
    (3) Those that interpret acid-fast stains, isolate and perform 
identification and/or antimycobacterial susceptibility of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis, but refer other mycobacteria species to another laboratory 
appropriately certified in the subspecialty of

[[Page 862]]

mycobacteriology for identification and/or susceptibility tests;
    (4) Those that interpret acid-fast stains, isolate and identify all 
mycobacteria to the extent required for correct clinical diagnosis, but 
refer antimycobacterial susceptibility tests to another laboratory 
appropriately certified in the subspecialty of mycobacteriology; and
    (5) Those that interpret acid-fast stains, isolate and identify all 
mycobacteria to the extent required for correct clinical diagnosis, and 
perform antimycobacterial susceptibility tests on the organisms 
isolated.
    (b) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing for mycobacteriology, the annual program must 
provide a minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at 
least two testing events per year. The samples may be provided through 
mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, provided to HHS or its designee for 
on-site testing events. For types of laboratories specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a) (3) through (5) of this section, an annual 
program must include samples that contain species that are 
representative of the 5 major groups (complexes) of mycobacteria 
encountered in human specimens. The specific mycobacteria included in 
the samples may vary from year to year.
    (1) An approved program must furnish HHS and its agents with a 
description of samples that it plans to include in its annual program no 
later than six months before each calendar year. At least 50 percent of 
the samples must be mixtures of the principal mycobacteria and 
appropriate normal flora. The program must include mycobacteria commonly 
occurring in patient specimens and other important emerging mycobacteria 
(as determined by HHS). The program determines the reportable isolates 
and correct responses for antimycobacterial susceptibility for any 
designated isolate.
    (2) An approved program may vary over time. For example, the types 
of mycobacteria that might be included in an approved program over time 
are--

TB
    Mycobacterium tuberculosis
    Mycobacterium bovis
Group I
    Mycobacterium kansasii
Group II
    Mycobacterium szulgai
Group III
    Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare
    Mycobacterium terrae
Group IV
    Mycobacterium fortuitum

    (3) For antimycobacterial susceptibility testing, the program must 
provide at least one sample per testing event that includes 
mycobacterium tuberculosis that has a predetermined pattern of 
sensitivity or resistance to the common antimycobacterial agents.
    (4) For laboratories specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the 
program must provide at least five samples per testing event that 
includes challenges that are acid-fast and challenges which do not 
contain acid-fast organisms.
    (c) Evaluation of a laboratory's performance. HHS approves only 
those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's response in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.
    (1) The program determines the reportable mycobacteria to be 
detected by acid-fast stain, for isolation and identification, and for 
antimycobacterial susceptibility. To determine the accuracy of a 
laboratory's response, the program must compare the laboratory's 
response for each sample with the response that reflects agreement of 
either 90 percent of ten or more referee laboratories or 90 percent or 
more of all participating laboratories.
    (2) To evaluate a laboratory's response for a particular sample, the 
program must determine a laboratory's type of service in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. A laboratory must interpret acid-fast 
stains and isolate and identify the organisms to the same extent it 
performs these procedures on patient specimens. A laboratory's 
performance will be evaluated on the basis of the average of its scores 
as determined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
    (3) Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of 
organisms in addition to the correctly identified principal organism(s), 
the grading system must provide a means of deducting

[[Page 863]]

credit for additional erroneous organisms reported. Therefore, the total 
number of correct responses submitted by the laboratory divided by the 
number of organisms present plus the number of incorrect organisms 
reported by the laboratory must be multiplied by 100 to establish a 
score for each sample in each testing event. For example, if a sample 
contained one principal organism and the laboratory reported it 
correctly but reported the presence of an additional organism, which was 
not present, the sample grade would be

1/(1+1) x 100=50 percent
    (4) For antimycobacterial susceptibility testing, a laboratory must 
indicate which drugs are routinely included in its test panel when 
testing patient samples. A laboratory's performance will be evaluated 
for only those antibiotics for which susceptibility testing is routinely 
performed on patient specimens. A correct response for each antibiotic 
will be determined as described in Sec. 493.913(c)(1). Grading is based 
on the number of correct susceptibility responses reported by the 
laboratory divided by the actual number of correct susceptibility 
responses as determined by the program, multiplied by 100. For example, 
if a laboratory offers susceptibility testing using three 
antimycobacterial agents and the laboratory reports correct response for 
two of the three antimycobacterial agents, the laboratory's grade would 
be \2/3\ x 100=67 percent.
    (5) The performance criterion for qualitative tests is the presence 
or absence of acid-fast organisms. The score for acid-fast organism 
detection is the number of correct responses divided by the number of 
samples to be tested, multiplied by 100.
    (6) The score for a testing event in mycobacteriology is the average 
of the scores determined under paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of this 
section based on the type of service offered by the laboratory.

Sec. 493.915  Mycology.

    (a) Types of services offered by laboratories. In mycology, there 
are four types of laboratories for proficiency testing purposes that may 
perform different levels of service for yeasts, dimorphic fungi, 
dermatophytes, and aerobic actinomycetes:
    (1) Those that isolate and identify only yeasts and/or dermatophytes 
to the genus level;
    (2) Those that isolate and identify yeasts and/or dermatophytes to 
the species level;
    (3) Those that isolate and perform identification of all organisms 
to the genus level; and
    (4) Those that isolate and perform identification of all organisms 
to the species level.
    (b) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing for mycology, the annual program must provide a 
minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three 
testing events at approximately equal intervals per year. The samples 
may be provided through mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, may be 
provided to HHS or its designee for on-site testing. An annual program 
must include samples that contain organisms that are representative of 
five major groups of fungi: Yeast or yeast-like fungi; dimorphic fungi; 
dematiaceous fungi; dermatophytes; and saprophytes, including 
opportunistic fungi. The specific fungi included in the samples may vary 
from year to year.
    (1) An approved program must, before each calendar year, furnish HHS 
with a description of samples that it plans to include in its annual 
program no later than six months before each calendar year. At least 50 
percent of the samples must be mixtures of the principal organism and 
appropriate normal background flora. Other important emerging pathogens 
(as determined by HHS) and organisms commonly occurring in patient 
specimens must be included periodically in the program.
    (2) An approved program may vary over time. As an example, the types 
of organisms that might be included in an approved program over time 
are--

Candida albicans
Candida (other species)
Cryptococcus neoformans
Sporothrix schenckii
Exophiala jeanselmei
Fonsecaea pedrosoi
Microsporum sp.
Acremonium sp.

[[Page 864]]

Trichophvton sp.
Aspergillus fumigatus
Nocardia sp.
Blastomyces dermatitidis \1\
Zygomycetes sp.
    Note: \1\ Provided as a nonviable sample.

    (c) Evaluation of a laboratory's performance. HHS approves only 
those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's response, in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) The program determines the reportable organisms. To determine 
the accuracy of a laboratory's response, the program must compare the 
laboratory's response for each sample with the response that reflects 
agreement of either 90 percent of ten or more referee laboratories or 90 
percent or more of all participating laboratories.
    (2) To evaluate a laboratory's response for a particular sample, the 
program must determine a laboratory's type of service in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. A laboratory must isolate and identify 
the organisms to the same extent it performs these procedures on patient 
specimens.
    (3) Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of 
organisms in addition to the correctly identified principal organism(s), 
the grading system must deduct credit for additional erroneous organisms 
reported. Therefore, the total number of correct responses submitted by 
the laboratory divided by the number of organisms present plus the 
number of incorrect organisms reported by the laboratory must be 
multiplied by 100 to establish a score for each sample in each shipment 
or testing event. For example, if a sample contained one principal 
organism and the laboratory reported it correctly but reported the 
presence of an additional organism, which was not present, the sample 
grade would be 1/(1+1)x100=50 percent.
    (4) The score for the antigen tests is the number of correct 
responses divided by the number of samples to be tested for the antigen, 
multiplied by 100.
    (5) The score for a testing event is the average of the sample 
scores as determined under paragraph (c)(3) or (c)(4), or both, of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 493.917  Parasitology.

    (a) Types of services offered by laboratories. In parasitology there 
are two types of laboratories for proficiency testing purposes--
    (1) Those that determine the presence or absence of parasites by 
direct observation (wet mount) and/or pinworm preparations and, if 
necessary, refer specimens to another laboratory appropriately certified 
in the subspecialty of parasitology for identification;
    (2) Those that identify parasites using concentration preparations 
and/or permanent stains.
    (b) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing in parasitology, a program must provide a minimum of 
five samples per testing event. There must be at least three testing 
events at approximately equal intervals per year. The samples may be 
provided through mailed shipments or, at HHS's option, may be provided 
to HHS or its designee for on-site testing. An annual program must 
include samples that contain parasites that are commonly encountered in 
the United States as well as those recently introduced into the United 
States. Other important emerging pathogens (as determined by HHS) and 
parasites commonly occurring in patient specimens must be included 
periodically in the program.
    (1) An approved program must, before each calendar year furnish HHS 
with a description of samples that it plans to include in its annual 
program no later than six months before each calendar year. Samples must 
include both formalinized specimens and PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) fixed 
specimens as well as blood smears, as appropriate for a particular 
parasite and stage of the parasite. The majority of samples must contain 
protozoa or helminths or a combination of parasites. Some samples must 
be devoid of parasites.
    (2) An approved program may vary over time. As an example, the types 
of parasites that might be included in an approved program over time 
are--


[[Page 865]]


Enterobius vermicularis
Entamoeba histolytica
Entamoeba coli
Giardia lamblia
Endolimax nana
Dientamoeba fragilis
Iodamoeba butschli
Chilomastix mesnili
Hookworm
Ascaris lumbricoides
Strongyloides stercoralis
Trichuris trichiura
Diphyllobothrium latum
Cryptosporidium sp.
Plasmodium falciparum

    (3) For laboratories specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
the program must provide at least five samples per testing event that 
include challenges which contain parasites and challenges that are 
devoid of parasites.
    (c) Evaluation of a laboratory's performance. HHS approves only 
those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's responses in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.
    (1) The program must determine the reportable parasites. It may 
elect to establish a minimum number of parasites to be identified in 
samples before they are reported. Parasites found in rare numbers by 
referee laboratories are not considered in scoring a laboratory's 
performance; such findings are neutral. To determine the accuracy of a 
laboratory's response, the program must compare the laboratory's 
response with the response that reflects agreement of either 90 percent 
of ten or more referee laboratories or 90 percent or more of all 
participating laboratories.
    (2) To evaluate a laboratory's response for a particular sample, the 
program must determine a laboratory's type of service in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. A laboratory must determine the presence 
or absence of a parasite(s) or concentrate and identify the parasites to 
the same extent it performs these procedures on patient specimens.
    (3) Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of 
parasites in addition to the correctly identified principal parasite(s), 
the grading system must deduct credit for these additional erroneous 
parasites reported and not found in rare numbers by the program's 
referencing process. Therefore, the total number of correct responses 
submitted by the laboratory divided by the number of parasites present 
plus the number of incorrect parasites reported by the laboratory must 
be multiplied by 100 to establish a score for each sample in each 
testing event. For example, if a sample contained one principal parasite 
and the laboratory reported it correctly but reported the presence of an 
additional parasite, which was not present, the sample grade would be

1/(1+1) x 100=50 percent.
    (4) The criterion for acceptable performance for qualitative 
parasitology examinations is presence or absence of a parasite(s).
    (5) The score for parasitology is the number of correct responses 
divided by the number of samples to be tested, multiplied by 100.
    (6) The score for a testing event is the average of the sample 
scores as determined under paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 493.919  Virology.

    (a) Types of services offered by laboratories. In virology, there 
are two types of laboratories for proficiency testing purposes--
    (1) Those that only perform tests that directly detect viral 
antigens or structures, either in cells derived from infected tissues or 
free in fluid specimens; and
    (2) Those that are able to isolate and identify viruses and use 
direct antigen techniques.
    (b) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing in virology, a program must provide a minimum of 
five samples per testing event. There must be at least three testing 
events at approximately equal intervals per year. The samples may be 
provided to the laboratory through mailed shipments or, at HHS's option, 
may be provided to HHS or its designee for on-site testing. An annual 
program must include viral species that are the more commonly identified 
viruses. The specific organisms found in the samples may vary from year 
to year. The annual program must include samples for viral antigen 
detection and viral isolation and identification.

[[Page 866]]

    (1) An approved program must furnish HHS with a description of 
samples that it plans to include in its annual program no later than six 
months before each calendar year. The program must include other 
important emerging viruses (as determined by HHS) and viruses commonly 
occurring in patient specimens.
    (2) An approved program may vary over time. For example, the types 
of viruses that might be included in an approved program over time are 
the more commonly identified viruses such as Herpes simplex, respiratory 
syncytial virus, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and cytomegaloviruses.
    (c) Evaluation of laboratory's performance. HHS approves only those 
programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's response in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) The program determines the reportable viruses to be detected by 
direct antigen techniques or isolated by laboratories that perform viral 
isolation procedures. To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's 
response, the program must compare the laboratory's response for each 
sample with the response that reflects agreement of either 90 percent of 
ten or more referee laboratories or 90 percent or more of all 
participating laboratories.
    (2) To evaluate a laboratory's response for a particular sample, the 
program must determine a laboratory's type of service in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. A laboratory must isolate and identify 
the viruses to the same extent it performs these procedures on patient 
specimens.
    (3) Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of 
viruses in addition to the correctly identified principal virus, the 
grading system must provide a means of deducting credit for additional 
erroneous viruses reported. Therefore, the total number of correct 
responses determined by virus culture techniques submitted by the 
laboratory divided by the number of viruses present plus the number of 
incorrect viruses reported by the laboratory must be multiplied by 100 
to establish a score for each sample in each testing event. For example, 
if a sample contained one principal virus and the laboratory reported it 
correctly but reported the presence of an additional virus, which was 
not present, the sample grade would be 1/(1+1) x 100=50 percent.
    (4) The performance criterion for qualitative antigen tests is 
presence or absence of the viral antigen. The score for the antigen 
tests is the number of correct responses divided by the number of 
samples to be tested for the antigen, multiplied by 100.
    (5) The score for a testing event is the average of the sample 
scores as determined under paragraph (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 493.921  Diagnostic immunology.

    The subspecialties under the specialty of immunology for which a 
program may offer proficiency testing are syphilis serology and general 
immunology. Specific criteria for these subspecialties are found at 
Secs. 493.923 and 493.927.


<R05>
Sec. 493.923  Syphilis serology.

    (a) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing in syphilis serology, a program must provide a 
minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three 
testing events at approximately equal intervals per year. The samples 
may be provided through mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, may be 
provided to HHS or its designee for on-site testing. An annual program 
must include samples that cover the full range of reactivity from highly 
reactive to non-reactive.
    (b) Evaluation of test performance. HHS approves only those programs 
that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's responses in accordance with 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for 
qualitative and quantitative syphilis tests, the program must compare 
the laboratory's response with the response that reflects agreement of 
either 90 percent of ten or more referee laboratories or 90 percent or 
more of all participating laboratories. The proficiency testing program 
must indicate the minimum concentration, by method, that will be

[[Page 867]]

considered as indicating a positive response. The score for a sample in 
syphilis serology is the average of scores determined under paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
    (2) For quantitative syphilis tests, the program must determine the 
correct response for each method by the distance of the response from 
the target value. After the target value has been established for each 
response, the appropriateness of the response must be determined by 
using fixed criteria. The criterion for acceptable performance for 
quantitative syphilis serology tests is the target value <SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 
1 dilution.
    (3) The criterion for acceptable performance for qualitative 
syphilis serology tests is reactive or nonreactive.
    (4) To determine the overall testing event score, the number of 
correct responses must be averaged using the following formula:

 
  Number of acceptable responses for all
                challenges
-------------------------------------------   x 100=Testing event score
      Total number of all challenges

<R05>
Sec. 493.927  General immunology.

    (a) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing for immunology, the annual program must provide a 
minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three 
testing events at approximately equal intervals per year. The annual 
program must provide samples that cover the full range of reactivity 
from highly reactive to nonreactive. The samples may be provided through 
mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, may be provided to HHS or its 
designee for on-site testing.
    (b) Challenges per testing event. The minimum number of challenges 
per testing event the program must provide for each analyte or test 
procedure is five. Analytes or tests for which laboratory performance is 
to be evaluated include:

                        Analyte or Test Procedure

Alpha-l antitrypsin
Alpha-fetoprotein (tumor marker)
Antinuclear antibody
Antistreptolysin O
Anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Complement C3
Complement C4
Hepatitis markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBeAg)
IgA
IgG
IgE
IgM
Infectious mononucleosis
Rheumatoid factor
Rubella

    (c) Evaluation of a laboratory's analyte or test performance. HHS 
approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's 
responses in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this 
section.
    (1) To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for 
quantitative and qualitative immunology tests or analytes, the program 
must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the 
response that reflects agreement of either 90 percent of ten or more 
referee laboratories or 90 percent or more of all participating 
laboratories. The proficiency testing program must indicate the minimum 
concentration that will be considered as indicating a positive response. 
The score for a sample in general immunology is either the score 
determined under paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section.
    (2) For quantitative immunology analytes or tests, the program must 
determine the correct response for each analyte by the distance of the 
response from the target value. After the target value has been 
established for each response, the appropriateness of the response must 
be determined by using either fixed criteria or the number of standard 
deviations (SDs) the response differs from the target value.

                   Criteria for Acceptable Performance

    The criteria for acceptable performance are--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Criteria for acceptable

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The criterion for acceptable performance for qualitative general 
immunology tests is positive or negative.
    (4) To determine the analyte testing event score, the number of 
acceptable analyte responses must be averaged using the following 
formula:

 
  Number of acceptable responses for the
                  analyte                    x 100=Analyte score for the

Sec. 493.929  Chemistry.

    The subspecialties under the specialty of chemistry for which a 
proficiency testing program may offer proficiency testing are routine 
chemistry, endocrinology, and toxicology. Specific criteria for these 
subspecialties are listed in Secs. 493.931 through 493.939.


<R05>
Sec. 493.931  Routine chemistry.

    (a) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing for routine chemistry, a program must provide a 
minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three 
testing events at approximately equal intervals per year. The annual 
program must provide samples that cover the clinically relevant range of 
values that would be expected in patient specimens. The specimens may be 
provided through mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, may be provided to 
HHS or its designee for on-site testing.
    (b) Challenges per testing event. The minimum number of challenges 
per testing event a program must provide for each analyte or test 
procedure listed below is five serum, plasma or blood samples.

    (c) Evaluation of a laboratory's analyte or test performance. HHS 
approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's 
responses in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this 
section.
    (1) To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for 
qualitative and quantitative chemistry tests or analytes, the program 
must compare the laboratory's response for each

[[Page 869]]

analyte with the response that reflects agreement of either 90 percent 
of ten or more referee laboratories or 90 percent or more of all 
participating laboratories. The score for a sample in routine chemistry 
is either the score determined under paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this 
section.
    (2) For quantitative chemistry tests or analytes, the program must 
determine the correct response for each analyte by the distance of the 
response from the target value. After the target value has been 
established for each response, the appropriateness of the response must 
be determined by using either fixed criteria based on the percentage 
difference from the target value or the number of standard deviations 
(SDs) the response differs from the target value.

                   Criteria for Acceptable Performance

    The criteria for acceptable performance are--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Criteria for acceptable
              Analyte or test                        performance

Sec. 493.933  Endocrinology.

    (a) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing for endocrinology, a program must provide a minimum 
of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three testing 
events at approximately equal intervals per year. The annual program 
must provide samples that cover the clinically relevant range of values 
that would be expected in patient specimens. The samples may be provided 
through mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, may be provided to HHS or 
its designee for on-site testing.
    (b) Challenges per testing event. The minimum number of challenges 
per testing event a program must provide for each analyte or test 
procedure is five serum, plasma, blood, or urine samples.

    (c) Evaluation of a laboratory's analyte or test performance. HHS 
approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's 
responses in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this 
section.
    (1) To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for 
qualitative and quantitative endocrinology tests or analytes, a program 
must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the 
response that reflects agreement of either 90 percent of ten or more 
referee laboratories or 90 percent or more of all participating 
laboratories. The score for a sample in endocrinology is either the 
score determined under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) For quantitative endocrinology tests or analytes, the program 
must determine the correct response for each analyte by the distance of 
the response from the target value. After the target value has been 
established for each response, the appropriateness of the response must 
be determined by using either fixed criteria based on the percentage 
difference from the target value or the number of standard deviations 
(SDs) the response differs from the target value.

    (c) Evaluation of a laboratory's analyte or test performance. HHS 
approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's 
responses in accordance with paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this 
section.
    (1) To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's responses for 
qualitative and quantitative hematology tests or analytes, the program 
must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the 
response that reflects agreement of either 90 percent of ten or more 
referee laboratories or 90 percent or more of all participating 
laboratories. The score for a sample in hematology is either the score 
determined under paragraph (c) (2) or (3) of this section.
    (2) For quantitative hematology tests or analytes, the program must 
determine the correct response for each analyte by the distance of the 
response from the target value. After the target value has been 
established for each response, the appropriateness of the response is 
determined using either fixed criteria based on the percentage 
difference from the target value or the number of standard deviations 
(SDs) the response differs from the target value.

                   Criteria for Acceptable Performance

    The criteria for acceptable performance are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Criteria for acceptable
              Analyte or test                        performance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The criterion for acceptable performance for the qualitative 
hematology test is correct cell identification.
    (4) To determine the analyte testing event score, the number of 
acceptable analyte responses must be averaged using the following 
formula:

 
  Number of acceptable responses for the
                  analyte                       x 100=Analyte score for
-------------------------------------------       the testing event

Sec. 493.945  Cytology; gynecologic examinations.

    (a) Program content and frequency of challenge. (1) To be approved 
for proficiency testing for gynecologic examinations (Pap smears) in 
cytology, a program must provide test sets composed of 10- and 20-glass 
slides. Proficiency testing programs may obtain slides for test sets 
from cytology laboratories, provided the slides have been retained by 
the laboratory for the required period specified in Sec. 493.1257. If 
slide preparations are still subject to retention by the laboratory, 
they may be loaned to a proficiency testing program if the program 
provides the laboratory with documentation of the loan of the slides and 
ensures that slides loaned to it are retrievable upon request. Each test 
set must include at least one slide representing each of the

[[Page 873]]

response categories described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section, and test sets should be comparable so that equitable testing is 
achieved within and between proficiency testing providers.
    (2) To be approved for proficiency testing in gynecologic cytology, 
a program must provide announced and unannounced on-site testing for 
each individual at least once per year and must provide an initial 
retesting event for each individual within 45 days after notification of 
test failure and subsequent retesting events within 45 days after 
completion of remedial action described in Sec. 493.855.
    (b) Evaluation of an individual's performance. HHS approves only 
those programs that assess the accuracy of each individual's responses 
on both 10- and 20-slide test sets in which the slides have been 
referenced as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (1) To determine the accuracy of an individual's response on a 
particular challenge (slide), the program must compare the individual's 
response for each slide preparation with the response that reflects the 
predetermined consensus agreement or confirmation on the diagnostic 
category, as described in the table in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section. For all slide preparations, a 100% consensus agreement among a 
minimum of three physicians certified in anatomic pathology is required. 
In addition, for premalignant and malignant slide preparations, 
confirmation by tissue biopsy is required either by comparison of the 
reported biopsy results or reevaluation of biopsy slide material by a 
physician certified in anatomic pathology.
    (2) An individual qualified as a technical supervisor under 
Sec. 493.1449 (b) or (k) who routinely interprets gynecologic slide 
preparations only after they have been examined by a cytotechnologist 
can either be tested using a test set that has been screened by a 
cytotechnologist in the same laboratory or using a test set that has not 
been screened. A technical supervisor who screens and interprets slide 
preparations that have not been previously examined must be tested using 
a test set that has not been previously screened.
    (3) The criteria for acceptable performance are determined by using 
the scoring system in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Each slide set must contain 10 or 20 slides with point values 
established for each slide preparation based on the significance of the 
relationship of the interpretation of the slide to a clinical condition 
and whether the participant in the testing event is a cytotechnologist 
qualified under Secs. 493.1469 or 493.1483 or functioning as a technical 
supervisor in cytology qualified under Sec. 493.1449 (b) or (k) of this 
part.
    (ii) The scoring system rewards or penalizes the participants in 
proportion to the distance of their answers from the correct response or 
target diagnosis and the penalty or reward is weighted in proportion to 
the severity of the lesion.
    (A) The four response categories for reporting proficiency testing 
results and their descriptions are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) In accordance with the criteria for the scoring system, the 
charts in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section, for 
technical supervisors and cytotechnologists, respectively, provide a 
maximum of 10 points for a correct response and a maximum of minus five 
(-5) points for an incorrect response on a 10-slide test set. For 
example, if the correct response on a slide is ``high grade squamous 
intraepithelial lesion'' (category ``D'' on the scoring system chart) 
and an examinee calls it ``normal or negative'' (category ``B'' on the 
scoring system chart), then the examinee's point value on that slide is 
calculated as minus five (-5). Each slide is scored individually in the 
same manner. The individual's score for the testing event is determined 
by adding the point value achieved for each slide preparation, dividing 
by the total points for the testing event and multiplying by 100.

Sec. 493.959  Immunohematology.

    (a) Types of services offered by laboratories. In immunohematology, 
there are four types of laboratories for proficiency testing purposes--
    (1) Those that perform ABO group and/or D (Rho) typing;
    (2) Those that perform ABO group and/or D (Rho) typing, and 
unexpected antibody detection;
    (3) Those that in addition to paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
perform compatibility testing; and
    (4) Those that perform in addition to paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section antibody identification.
    (b) Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for 
proficiency testing for immunohematology, a program must provide a 
minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three 
testing events at approximately equal intervals per year. The annual 
program must provide samples that cover the full range of interpretation 
that would be expected in patient specimens. The samples may be provided 
through mailed shipments or, at

[[Page 875]]

HHS' option, may be provided to HHS or its designee for on-site testing.
    (c) Challenges per testing event. The minimum number of challenges 
per testing event a program must provide for each analyte or test 
procedure is five.

                        Analyte or Test Procedure

ABO group (excluding subgroups)
D (Rho) typing
Unexpected antibody detection
Compatibility testing
Antibody identification

    (d) Evaluation of a laboratory's analyte or test performance. HHS 
approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's 
response in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this 
section.
    (1) To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response, a program 
must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the 
response that reflects agreement of either 100 percent of ten or more 
referee laboratories or 95 percent or more of all participating 
laboratories except for unexpected antibody detection and antibody 
identification. To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for 
unexpected antibody detection and antibody identification, a program 
must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the 
response that reflects agreement of either 95 percent of ten or more 
referee laboratories or 95 percent or more of all participating 
laboratories. The score for a sample in immunohematology is either the 
score determined under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section.
    (2) Criteria for acceptable performance. The criteria for acceptable 
performance are--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Criteria for acceptable
              Analyte or test                        performance
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABO group.................................  100% accuracy.
D (Rho) typing............................  100% accuracy.
Unexpected antibody detection.............  80% accuracy.
Compatibility testing.....................  100% accuracy.
Antibody identification...................  80% accuracy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The criterion for acceptable performance for qualitative 
immunohematology tests is positive or negative.
    (4) To determine the analyte testing event score, the number of 
acceptable analyte responses must be averaged using the following 
formula:


 
 Number of acceptable responses for the analyte x 100=Analyte score for
                            the testing event
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Total number of challenges for the analyte
 

    (5) To determine the overall testing event score, the number of 
correct responses for all analytes must be averaged using the following 
formula:


 
  Number of acceptable responses for all challenges x 100=Testing event
                                  score
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Total number of all challenges

Sec. 493.1217  Standard; Calibration and calibration verification procedures.

    Calibration and calibration verification procedures are required to 
substantiate the continued accuracy of the test method throughout the 
laboratory's reportable range for patient test rests. Calibration is the 
process of testing and adjusting an instrument, kit, or test system to 
provide a known relationship between the measurement response and the 
value of the substance that is being measured by the test procedure. 
Calibration verification is the assaying of calibration materials in the 
same manner as patient samples to confirm that the calibration of the 
instrument, kit, or test system has remained stable throughout the 
laboratory's reportable range for patient test results. The reportable 
range of patient test results is the range of test result values over 
which the laboratory can establish or verify the accuracy of the 
instrument, kit or test system measurement response. Calibration and 
calibration verification must be performed and documented as required in 
this section unless otherwise specified in Secs. 493.1223 through 
493.1285.
    (a) For laboratory test procedures that are performed using 
instruments, kits, or test systems that have been cleared by the FDA as 
meeting certain CLIA requirements for quality control, the laboratory 
must, at a minimum, follow the manufacturer's instructions for 
calibration and calibration verification procedures using calibration 
materials specified by the manufacturer.
    (b) For each method or device, as specified in either Sec. 493.1202 
(a) or (b) or Sec. 493.1203(a), the laboratory must--
    (1) Perform calibration procedures--
    (i) At a minimum, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, if 
provided, using calibration materials provided or specified, as 
appropriate, and with at least the frequency recommended by the 
manufacturer; and
    (ii) In accordance with criteria established by the laboratory, as 
required under Sec. 493.1213(b)(2)(i)--
    (A) Including the number, type and concentration of calibration 
materials, acceptable limits for calibration, and the frequency of 
calibration; and
    (B) Using calibration materials appropriate for the methodology and, 
if possible, traceable to a reference method or reference material of 
known value; and
    (iii) Whenever calibration verification fails to meet the 
laboratory's acceptable limits for calibration verification; and
    (2) Perform calibration verification procedures--
    (i) In accordance with the manufacturer's calibration verification 
instructions when they meet or exceed the requirements specified in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section; or
    (ii) In accordance with criteria established by the laboratory--
    (A) Including the number, type, and concentration of calibration 
materials, acceptable limits for calibration verification and frequency 
of calibration verification;
    (B) Using calibration materials appropriate for--
    (1) The methodology and, if possible, traceable to a reference 
method or reference material of known value; and

[[Page 883]]

    (2) Verifying the laboratory's established reportable range of 
patient test results, which must include at least a minimal (or zero) 
value, a mid-point value, and a maximum value at the upper limit of that 
range; and
    (C) At least once every six months and whenever any of the following 
occur:
    (1) A complete change of reagents for a procedure is introduced, 
unless the laboratory can demonstrate that changing reagent lot numbers 
does not affect the range used to report patient test results, and 
control values are not adversely affected by reagent lot number changes;

    Note: If reagents are obtained from a manufacturer and all of the 
reagents for a test are packaged together, the laboratory is not 
required to perform calibration verification for each package of 
reagents, provided the packages of reagents are received in the same 
shipment and contain the same lot number.

    (2) There is major preventive maintenance or replacement of critical 
parts that may influence test performance;
    (3) Controls reflect an unusual trend or shift or are outside of the 
laboratory's acceptable limits and other means of assessing and 
correcting unacceptable control values have failed to identify and 
correct the problem; or
    (4) The laboratory's established schedule for verifying the 
reportable range for patient test results requires more frequent 
calibration verification than specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(C) (1), 
(2), or (3) of this section; and
    (3) Document all calibration and calibration verification procedures 
performed.

Sec. 493.1218  Standard; Control procedures.

    Control procedures are performed on a routine basis to monitor the 
stability of the method or test system; control and calibration 
materials provide a means to indirectly assess the accuracy and 
precision of patient test results. Control procedures must be performed 
as defined in this section unless otherwise specified in Secs. 493.1223 
through 493.1285 of this subpart.
    (a) For each device cleared by the FDA as meeting certain CLIA 
requirements for quality control, the laboratory must, at a minimum, 
follow the manufacturer's instructions for control procedures. In 
addition, the laboratory must meet the requirements under paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section and, as applicable, paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (b) For each device, as specified in either Sec. 493.1202 (a) or (b) 
or Sec. 493.1203(a), the laboratory must evaluate instrument and reagent 
stability and operator variance in determining the number, type, and 
frequency of testing calibration or control materials and establish 
criteria for acceptability used to monitor test performance during a run 
of patient specimen(s). A run is an interval within which the accuracy 
and precision of a testing system is expected to be stable, but cannot 
be greater than 24 hours or less than the frequency recommended by the 
manufacturer. For each procedure, the laboratory must monitor test 
performance using calibration materials or control materials or a 
combination thereof.
    (1) For qualitative tests, the laboratory must include a positive 
and negative control with each run of patient specimens.
    (2) For quantitative tests, the laboratory must include at least two 
samples of different concentrations of either calibration materials, 
control materials, or a combination thereof with the frequency 
determined in Sec. 493.1218(b), but not less frequently than once each 
run of patient specimens.
    (3) For electrophoretic determinations--
    (i) At least one control sample must be used in each electrophoretic 
cell; and
    (ii) The control sample must contain fractions representative of 
those routinely reported in patient specimens.
    (4) Each day of use, the laboratory must evaluate the detection 
phase of direct antigen systems using an appropriate positive and 
negative control material (organism or antigen extract). When direct 
antigen systems include an extraction phase, the system must be checked 
each day of use using a positive organism.

[[Page 884]]

    (5) If calibration materials and control materials are not 
available, the laboratory must have an alternative mechanism to assure 
the validity of patient test results.
    (c) Control samples must be tested in the same manner as patient 
specimens.
    (d) When calibration or control materials are used, statistical 
parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation) for each lot number of 
calibration material and each lot of control material must be determined 
through repetitive testing.
    (1) The stated values of an assayed control material may be used as 
the target values provided the stated values correspond to the 
methodology and instrumentation employed by the laboratory and are 
verified by the laboratory.
    (2) Statistical parameters for unassayed materials must be 
established over time by the laboratory through concurrent testing with 
calibration materials or control materials having previously determined 
statistical parameters.
    (e) Control results must meet the laboratory's criteria for 
acceptability prior to reporting patient test results.
    (f) Reagent and supply checks. (1) The laboratory must check each 
batch or shipment of reagents, discs, stains, antisera and 
identification systems (systems using two or more substrates) when 
prepared or opened for positive and negative reactivity, as well as 
graded reactivity if applicable.
    (2) Each day of use (unless otherwise specified in this subpart), 
the laboratory must test staining materials for intended reactivity to 
ensure predictable staining characteristics.
    (3) The laboratory must check fluorescent stains for positive and 
negative reactivity each time of use (unless otherwise specified in this 
subpart).
    (4) The laboratory must check each batch or shipment of media for 
sterility, if it is intended to be sterile, and sterility is required 
for testing. Media must also be checked for its ability to support 
growth, and as appropriate, selectivity/inhibition and/or biochemical 
response. The laboratory may use manufacturer's control checks of media 
provided the manufacturer's product insert specifies that the 
manufacturer's quality control checks meet the National Committee for 
Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) for media quality control. The 
laboratory must document that the physical characteristics of the media 
are not compromised and report any deterioration in the media to the 
manufacturer. The laboratory must follow the manufacturer's 
specifications for using the media and be responsible for the test 
results.

    Note: A batch of media (solid, semi-solid, or liquid) consists of 
all tubes, plates, or containers of the same medium prepared at the same 
time and in the same laboratory; or, if received from an outside source 
or commercial supplier, consists of all of the plates, tubes or 
containers of the same medium that have the same lot numbers and are 
received in a single shipment.

reportable range of patient test results; and
    (3) The determination that the laboratory's reference range for a 
test procedure is inappropriate for the laboratory's patient population.
    (b) Results of control and calibration materials fail to meet the 
laboratory's established criteria for acceptability. All patient test 
results obtained in the unacceptable test run or since the last 
acceptable test run must be evaluated to determine if patient test 
results have been adversely affected and the

[[Page 885]]

laboratory must take the remedial action necessary to ensure the 
reporting of accurate and reliable patient test results;
    (c) The laboratory cannot report patient test results within its 
established time frames. The laboratory must determine, based on the 
urgency of the patient test(s) requested, the need to notify the 
appropriate individual of the delayed testing; and
    (d) Errors in the reported patient test results are detected. The 
laboratory must--
    (1) Promptly notify the authorized person ordering or individual 
utilizing the test results of reporting errors;

    (3) The slide examination performance of each cytotechnologist is 
evaluated and documented, including performance evaluation through the 
re-examination of normal and negative cases and feedback on the 
reactive, reparative, atypical, malignant or premalignant cases as 
defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
    (4) A maximum number of slides, not to exceed the maximum workload 
limit described in paragraph (b) of this section is established by the 
technical supervisor for each individual examining slide preparations by 
nonautomated microscopic technique.
    (i) The actual workload limit must be documented for each individual 
and established in accordance with the individual's capability based on 
the performance evaluation as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section.

of slides from at least 10 percent of the gynecologic cases interpreted 
to be negative for reactive, reparative, atypical, premalignant or 
malignant conditions as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section that 
are examined by each individual not qualified under Secs. 493.1449 (b) 
or (k). This review must be done by a technical supervisor in cytology, 
a cytology general supervisor qualified under Sec. 493.1469, or a

reports with the histopathology report, if available in the laboratory 
(either on-site or in storage), and determine the causes of any 
discrepancies.
    (3) For each patient with a current high grade intraepithelial 
lesion or above (moderate dysplasia or CIN-2 or above), the laboratory 
must review all normal or negative gynecologic specimens received within 
the previous five years, if available in the laboratory (either on-site 
or in storage). If significant discrepancies are found that would affect 
patient care, the laboratory must notify the patient's physician and 
issue an amended report.
    (4) The laboratory must establish and document an annual statistical 
evaluation of the number of cytology cases examined, number of specimens 
processed by specimen type, volume of patient cases reported by 
diagnosis (including the number reported as unsatisfactory for 
diagnostic interpretation), number of gynecologic cases where cytology 
and available histology are discrepant, the number of gynecologic cases 
where any rescreen of a normal or negative specimen results in 
reclassification as malignant or premalignant, as defined in paragraph 
(c)(1) of the section, and the number of gynecologic cases for which 
histology results were unavailable to compare with malignant or 
premalignant cytology cases as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.
    (5) The laboratory must evaluate the case reviews of each individual 
examining slides against the laboratory's overall statistical values, 
document any discrepancies, including reasons for the deviation, and

    (1) Clearly distinguish specimens or smears, or both, that are 
unsatisfactory for diagnostic interpretation; and
    (2) Contain narrative descriptive nomenclature for all results.
    (f) Corrected reports issued by the laboratory must indicate the 
basis for correction.
    (g) The laboratory must retain all slide preparations for five years 
from the date of examination, or slides may be loaned to proficiency 
testing programs, in lieu of maintaining them for this time period, 
provided the laboratory receives written acknowledgment of the receipt 
of slides by the proficiency testing program and maintains the 
acknowledgment to document the loan of such slides. Documentation for 
slides loaned or referred for purposes other than proficiency testing 
must also be maintained. All slides must be retrievable upon request.

    (i) Establishes requirements for all laboratories that perform 
clinical diagnostic tests on human specimens;
    (ii) Requires a Federal certification scheme to be applied to all 
such laboratories; and
    (iii) Grants the Secretary broad enforcement authority, including--
    (A) Use of intermediate sanctions;
    (B) Suspension, limitation, or revocation of the certificate of a 
laboratory that is out of compliance with one or more requirements for a 
certificate; and
    (C) Civil suit to enjoin any laboratory activity that constitutes a 
significant hazard to the public health.
    (3) Section 353 also--
    (i) Provides for imprisonment or fine for any person convicted of 
intentional violation of CLIA requirements;
    (ii) Specifies the administrative hearing and judicial review rights 
of a laboratory that is sanctioned under CLIA; and
    (iii) Requires the Secretary to publish annually a list of all 
laboratories that have been sanctioned during the preceding year.
    (b) Scope and applicability. This subpart sets forth--
    (1) The policies and procedures that HCFA follows to enforce the 
requirements applicable to laboratories under CLIA and under section 
1846 of the Act; and
    (2) The appeal rights of laboratories on which HCFA imposes 
sanctions.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1804  General considerations.

    (a) Purpose. The enforcement mechanisms set forth in this subpart 
have the following purposes:
    (1) To protect all individuals served by laboratories against 
substandard testing of specimens.
    (2) To safeguard the general public against health and safety 
hazards that might result from laboratory activities.
    (3) To motivate laboratories to comply with CLIA requirements so 
that they can provide accurate and reliable test results.
    (b) Basis for decision to impose sanctions. (1) HCFA's decision to 
impose sanctions is based on one or more of the following:
    (i) Deficiencies found by HCFA or its agents in the conduct of 
inspections to certify or validate compliance with Federal requirements, 
or through review of materials submitted by the laboratory (e.g., 
personnel qualifications).
    (ii) Unsuccessful participation in proficiency testing.
    (2) HCFA imposes one or more of the alternative or principal 
sanctions specified in Secs. 493.1806 and 493.1807 when HCFA or HCFA's 
agent finds that a laboratory has condition-level deficiencies.
    (c) Imposition of alternative sanctions. (1) HCFA may impose 
alternative sanctions in lieu of, or in addition to principal sanctions, 
(HCFA does not impose alternative sanctions on laboratories

[[Page 924]]

that have certificates of waiver because those laboratories are not 
inspected for compliance with condition-level requirements.)
    (2) HCFA may impose alternative sanctions other than a civil money 
penalty after the laboratory has had an opportunity to respond, but 
before the hearing specified in Sec. 493.1844.
    (d) Choice of sanction: Factors considered. HCFA bases its choice of 
sanction or sanctions on consideration of one or more factors that 
include, but are not limited to, the following, as assessed by the State 
or by HCFA, or its agents:
    (1) Whether the deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.
    (2) The nature, incidence, severity, and duration of the 
deficiencies or noncompliance.
    (3) Whether the same condition level deficiencies have been 
identified repeatedly.
    (4) The accuracy and extent of laboratory records (e.g., of remedial 
action) in regard to the noncompliance, and their availability to the 
State, to other HCFA agents, and to HCFA.
    (5) The relationship of one deficiency or group of deficiencies to 
other deficiencies.
    (6) The overall compliance history of the laboratory including but 
not limited to any period of noncompliance that occurred between 
certifications of compliance.
    (7) The corrective and long-term compliance outcomes that HCFA hopes 
to achieve through application of the sanction.
    (8) Whether the laboratory has made any progress toward improvement 
following a reasonable opportunity to correct deficiencies.
    (9) Any recommendation by the State agency as to which sanction 
would be appropriate.
    (e) Number of alternative sanctions. HCFA may impose a separate 
sanction for each condition level deficiency or a single sanction for 
all condition level deficiencies that are interrelated and subject to 
correction by a single course of action.
    (f) Appeal rights. The appeal rights of laboratories dissatisfied 
with the imposition of a sanction are set forth in Sec. 493.1844.

<R05>
Sec. 493.1806  Available sanctions: All laboratories.

    (a) Applicability. HCFA may impose one or more of the sanctions 
specified in this section on a laboratory that is out of compliance with 
one or more CLIA conditions.
    (b) Principal sanction. HCFA may impose any of the three principal 
CLIA sanctions, which are suspension, limitation, or revocation of any 
type of CLIA certificate.
    (c) Alternative sanctions. HCFA may impose one or more of the 
following alternative sanctions in lieu of or in addition to imposing a 
principal sanction, except on a laboratory that has a certificate of 
waiver.
    (1) Directed plan of correction, as set forth at Sec. 493.1832.
    (2) State onsite monitoring as set forth at Sec. 493.1836.
    (3) Civil money penalty, as set forth at Sec. 493.1834.
    (d) Civil suit. HCFA may bring suit in the appropriate U.S. District 
Court to enjoin continuation of any activity of any laboratory 
(including a CLIA-exempt laboratory that has been found with 
deficiencies during a validation survey), if HCFA has reason to believe 
that continuation of the activity would constitute a significant hazard 
to the public health.
    (e) Criminal sanctions. Under section 353(1) of the PHS Act, an 
individual who is convicted of intentionally violating any CLIA 
requirement may be imprisoned or fined.

<R05>
Sec. 493.1807  Additional sanctions: Laboratories that participate in Medicare.

    The following additional sanctions are available for laboratories 
that are out of compliance with one or more CLIA conditions and that 
have approval to receive Medicare payment for their services.
    (a) Principal sanction. Cancellation of the laboratory's approval to 
receive Medicare payment for its services.

[[Page 925]]

    (b) Alternative sanctions. (1) Suspension of payment for tests in 
one or more specific specialties or subspecialties, performed on or

<R05>
Sec. 493.1808  Adverse action on any type of CLIA certificate: Effect on Medicare approval.

    (a) Suspension or revocation of any type of CLIA certificate. When 
HCFA suspends or revokes any type of CLIA certificate, HCFA concurrently 
cancels the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for its 
services.
    (b) Limitation of any type of CLIA certificate. When HCFA limits any 
type of CLIA certificate, HCFA concurrently limits Medicare approval to 
only those specialties or subspecialties that are authorized by the 
laboratory's limited certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1809  Limitation on Medicaid payment.

    As provided in section 1902(a)(9)(C) of the Act, payment for 
laboratory services may be made under the State plan only if those 
services are furnished by a laboratory that has a CLIA certificate or is 
licensed by a State whose licensure program has been approved by the 
Secretary under this part.

<R05>
Sec. 493.1810  Imposition and lifting of alternative sanctions.

    (a) Notice of noncompliance and of proposed sanction: Content. If 
HCFA or its agency identifies condition level noncompliance in a 
laboratory, HCFA or its agent gives the laboratory written notice of the 
following:
    (1) The condition level noncompliance that it has identified.
    (2) The sanction or sanctions that HCFA or its agent proposes to 
impose against the laboratory.
    (3) The rationale for the proposed sanction or sanctions.
    (4) The projected effective date and duration of the proposed 
sanction or sanctions.
    (5) The authority for the proposed sanction or sanctions.
    (6) The time allowed (at least 10 days) for the laboratory to 
respond to the notice.
    (b) Opportunity to respond. During the period specified in paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section, the laboratory may submit to HCFA or its agent 
written evidence or other information against the imposition of the 
proposed sanction or sanctions.
    (c) Notice of imposition of sanction--(1) Content. HCFA gives the 
laboratory written notice that acknowledges any evidence or information 
received from the laboratory and specifies the following:
    (i) The sanction or sanctions to be imposed against the laboratory.
    (ii) The authority and rationale for the imposing sanction or 
sanctions.
    (iii) The effective date and duration of sanction.
    (2) Timing. (i) If HCFA or its agent determines that the 
deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy, HCFA provides notice at least 5 
days before the effective date of sanction.
    (ii) If HCFA or its agent determines that the deficiencies do not 
pose immediate jeopardy, HCFA provides notice at least 15 days before 
the effective date of the sanction.
    (d) Duration of alternative sanctions. An alternative sanction 
continues until the earlier of the following occurs:
    (1) The laboratory corrects all condition level deficiencies.
    (2) HCFA's suspension, limitation, or revocation of the laboratory's 
CLIA certificate becomes effective.
    (e) Lifting of alternative sanctions--(1) General rule. Alternative 
sanctions are not lifted until a laboratory's compliance with all 
condition level requirements is verified.
    (2) Credible allegation of compliance. When a sanctioned laboratory 
submits a credible allegation of compliance, HCFA's agent determines 
whether--
    (i) It can certify compliance on the basis of the evidence presented 
by the laboratory in its allegation; or
    (ii) It must revisit to verify whether the laboratory has, in fact, 
achieved compliance.

[[Page 926]]

    (3) Compliance achieved before the date of revisit. If during a 
revisit, the laboratory presents credible evidence (as determined by 
HCFA or its agent) that it achieved compliance before the date of 
revisit, sanctions are lifted as of that earlier date.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1812  Action when deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.

    If a laboratory's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy, the 
following rules apply:
    (a) HCFA requires the laboratory to take immediate action to remove 
the jeopardy and may impose one or more alternative sanctions to help 
bring the laboratory into compliance.
    (b) If the findings of a revisit indicate that a laboratory has not 
eliminated the jeopardy, HCFA suspends or limits the laboratory's CLIA 
certificate no earlier than 5 days after the date of notice of 
suspension or limitation. HCFA may later revoke the certificate.
    (c) In addition, if HCFA has reason to believe that the continuation 
of any activity by any laboratory (either the entire laboratory 
operation or any specialty or subspecialty of testing) would constitute 
a significant hazard to the public health, HCFA may bring suit and seek 
a temporary injunction or restraining order against continuation of that 
activity by the laboratory, regardless of the type of CLIA certificate 
the laboratory has and of whether it is State-exempt.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1814  Action when deficiencies are at the condition level but do not pose immediate jeopardy.

    If a laboratory has condition level deficiencies that do not pose 
immediate jeopardy, the following rules apply:
    (a) Initial action. (1) HCFA may cancel the laboratory's approval to 
receive Medicare payment for its services.
    (2) HCFA may suspend, limit, or revoke the laboratory's CLIA 
certificate.
    (3) If HCFA does not impose a principal sanction under paragraph 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, it imposes one or more alternative 
sanctions. In the case of unsuccessful participation in proficiency 
testing, HCFA may impose the training and technical assistance 
requirement set forth at Sec. 493.1838 in lieu of, or in addition to, 
one or more alternative sanctions.
    (b) Failure to correct condition level deficiencies. If HCFA imposes 
alternative sanctions for condition level deficiencies that do not pose 
immediate jeopardy, and the laboratory does not correct the condition 
level deficiencies within 12 months after the last day of inspection, 
HCFA--
    (1) Cancels the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment 
for its services, and discontinues the Medicare payment sanctions as of 
the day cancellation is effective.
    (2) Following a revisit which indicates that the laboratory has not 
corrected its condition level deficiencies, notifies the laboratory that 
it proposes to suspend, limit, or revoke the certificate, as specified 
in Sec. 493.1816(b), and the laboratory's right to hearing; and
    (3) May impose (or continue, if already imposed) any alternative 
sanctions that do not pertain to Medicare payments. (Sanctions imposed 
under the authority of section 353 of the PHS Act may continue for more 
than 12 months from the last date of inspection, while a hearing on the 
proposed suspension, limitation, or revocation of the certificate of 
compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or 
certificate for PPM procedures is pending.)
    (c) Action after hearing. If a hearing decision upholds a proposed 
suspension, limitation, or revocation of a laboratory's CLIA 
certificate, HCFA discontinues any alternative sanctions as of the day 
it makes the suspension, limitation, or revocation effective.

[57 FR 7237, Feb. 28, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 20051, Apr. 24, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 493.1816  Action when deficiencies are not at the condition level.

    If a laboratory has deficiencies, that are not at the condition 
level, the following rules apply:
    (a) Initial action. The laboratory must submit a plan of correction 
that is acceptable to HCFA in content and time frames.
    (b) Failure to correct deficiencies. If, on revisit, it is found 
that the laboratory has not corrected the deficiencies within 12 months 
after the last day of inspection, the following rules apply:

[[Page 927]]

    (1) HCFA cancels the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare 
payment for its services.
    (2) HCFA notifies the laboratory of its intent to suspend, limit, or 
revoke the laboratory's CLIA certificate and of the laboratory's right 
to a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1820  Ensuring timely correction of deficiencies.

    (a) Timing of visits. HCFA, the State survey agency or other HCFA 
agent may visit the laboratory at any time to evaluate progress, and at 
the end of the period to determine whether all corrections have been 
made.
    (b) Deficiencies corrected before a visit. If during a visit, a 
laboratory produces credible evidence that it achieved compliance before 
the visit, the sanctions are lifted as of that earlier date.
    (c) Failure to correct deficiencies. If during a visit it is found 
that the laboratory has not corrected its deficiencies, HCFA may propose 
to suspend, limit, or revoke the laboratory's CLIA certificate.
    (d) Additional time for correcting lower level deficiencies not at 
the condition level. If at the end of the plan of correction period all 
condition level deficiencies have been corrected, and there are 
deficiencies, that are not at the condition level, HCFA may request a 
revised plan of correction. The revised plan may not extend beyond 12 
months from the last day of the inspection that originally identified 
the cited deficiencies.
    (e) Persistence of deficiencies. If at the end of the period covered 
by the plan of correction, the laboratory still has deficiencies, the 
rules of Secs. 493.1814 and 493.1816 apply.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1826  Suspension of part of Medicare payments.

    (a) Application. (1) HCFA may impose this sanction if a laboratory--
    (i) Is found to have condition level deficiencies with respect to 
one or more specialties or subspecialties of tests; and
    (ii) Agrees (in return for not having its Medicare approval 
cancelled immediately) not to charge Medicare beneficiaries or their 
private insurance carriers for the services for which Medicare payment 
is suspended.
    (2) HCFA suspends Medicare payment for those specialities or 
subspecialties of tests for which the laboratory is out of compliance 
with Federal requirements.
    (b) Procedures. Before imposing this sanction, HCFA provides notice 
of sanction and opportunity to respond in accordance with Sec. 493.1810.
    (c) Duration and effect of sanction. This sanction continues until 
the laboratory corrects the condition level deficiencies or HCFA cancels 
the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for its services, 
but in no event longer than 12 months.
    (1) If the laboratory corrects all condition level deficiencies, 
HCFA resumes Medicare payment effective for all services furnished on or 
after the date the deficiencies are corrected.
    (2) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 493.1828  Suspension of all Medicare payments.

    (a) Application. (1) HCFA may suspend payment for all Medicare-
approved laboratory services when the laboratory has condition level 
deficiencies.
    (2) HCFA suspends payment for all Medicare covered laboratory 
services when the following conditions are met:
    (i) Either--
    (A) The laboratory has not corrected its condition level 
deficiencies included in the plan of correction within 3 months from the 
last date of inspection; or
    (B) The laboratory has been found to have the same condition level 
deficiencies during three consecutive inspections; and
    (ii) The laboratory has chosen (in return for not having its 
Medicare approval immediately cancelled), to not charge Medicare 
beneficiaries or their private insurance carriers for services for which 
Medicare payment is suspended.
    (3) HCFA suspends payment for services furnished on and after the 
effective date of sanction.
    (b) Procedures. Before imposing this sanction, HCFA provides notice 
of sanction and opportunity to respond in accordance with Sec. 493.1810.

[[Page 928]]

    (c) Duration and effect of sanction. (1) Suspension of payment 
continues until all condition level deficiencies are corrected, but 
never beyond twelve months.
    (2) If all the deficiencies are not corrected by the end of the 12 
month period, HCFA cancels the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare 
payment for its services.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1832  Directed plan of correction and directed portion of a plan of correction.

    (a) Application. HCFA may impose a directed plan of correction as an 
alternative sanction for any laboratory that has condition level 
deficiencies. If HCFA does not impose a directed plan of correction as 
an alternative sanction for a laboratory that has condition level 
deficiencies, it at least imposes a directed portion of a plan of 
correction when it imposes any of the following alternative sanctions:
    (1) State onsite monitoring.
    (2) Civil money penalty.
    (3) Suspension of all or part of Medicare payments.
    (b) Procedures--(1) Directed plan of correction. When imposing this 
sanction, HCFA--
    (i) Gives the laboratory prior notice of the sanction and 
opportunity to respond in accordance with Sec. 493.1810;
    (ii) Directs the laboratory to take specific corrective action 
within specific time frames in order to achieve compliance; and
    (iii) May direct the laboratory to submit the names of laboratory 
clients for notification purposes, as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section.
    (2) Directed portion of a plan of correction. HCFA may decide to 
notify clients of a sanctioned laboratory, because of the seriousness of 
the noncompliance (e.g., the existence of immediate jeopardy) or for 
other reasons. When imposing this sanction, HCFA takes the following 
steps--
    (i) Directs the laboratory to submit to HCFA, the State survey 
agency, or other HCFA agent, within 10 calendar days after the notice of 
the alternative sanction, a list of names and addresses of all 
physicians, providers, suppliers, and other clients who have used some 
or all of the services of the laboratory since the last certification 
inspection or within any other timeframe specified by HCFA.
    (ii) Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the information, may send 
to each laboratory client, via the State survey agency, a notice 
containing the name and address of the laboratory, the nature of the 
laboratory's noncompliance, and the kind and effective date of the 
alternative sanction.
    (iii) Sends to each laboratory client, via the State survey agency, 
notice of the recission of an adverse action within 30 days of the 
rescission.
    (3) Notice of imposition of a principal sanction following the 
imposition of an alternative sanction. If HCFA imposes a principal 
sanction following the imposition of an alternative sanction, and for 
which HCFA has already obtained a list of laboratory clients, HCFA may 
use that list to notify the clients of the imposition of the principal 
sanction.
    (c) Duration of a directed plan of correction. If HCFA imposes a 
directed plan of correction, and on revisit it is found that the 
laboratory has not corrected the deficiencies within 12 months from the 
last day of inspection, the following rules apply:
    (1) HCFA cancels the laboratory's approval for Medicare payment of 
its services, and notifies the laboratory of HCFA's intent to suspend, 
limit, or revoke the laboratory's CLIA certificate.
    (2) The directed plan of correction continues in effect until the 
day suspension, limitation, or revocation of the laboratory's CLIA 
certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1834  Civil money penalty.

    (a) Statutory basis. Sections 1846 of the Act and 353(h)(2)(B) of 
the PHS Act authorize the Secretary to impose civil money penalties on 
laboratories. Section 1846(b)(3) of the Act specifically provides that 
incrementally more severe fines may be imposed for repeated or 
uncorrected deficiencies.
    (b) Scope. This section sets forth the procedures that HCFA follows 
to impose a civil money penalty in lieu of, or in addition to, 
suspending, limiting, or revoking the certificate of compliance, 
registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate 
for PPM procedures of a laboratory that is

[[Page 929]]

found to have condition level deficiencies.
    (c) Basis for imposing a civil money penalty. HCFA may impose a 
civil money penalty against any laboratory determined to have condition 
level deficiencies regardless of whether those deficiencies pose 
immediate jeopardy.
    (d) Amount of penalty--(1) Factors considered. In determining the 
amount of the penalty, HCFA takes into account the following factors:
    (i) The nature, scope, severity, and duration of the noncompliance.
    (ii) Whether the same condition level deficiencies have been 
identified during three consecutive inspections.
    (iii) The laboratory's overall compliance history including but not 
limited to any period of noncompliance that occurred between 
certifications of compliance.
    (iv) The laboratory's intent or reason for noncompliance.
    (v) The accuracy and extent of laboratory records and their 
availability to HCFA, the State survey agency, or other HCFA agent.
    (2) Range of penalty amount.
    (i) For a condition level deficiency that poses immediate jeopardy, 
the range is $3,050-$10,000 per day of noncompliance or per violation.
    (ii) For a condition level deficiency that does not pose immediate 
jeopardy, the range is $50-$3,000 per day of noncompliance or per 
violation.
    (3) Decreased penalty amounts. If the immediate jeopardy is removed, 
but the deficiency continues, HCFA shifts the penalty amount to the 
lower range.
    (4) Increased penalty amounts. HCFA may, before the hearing, propose 
to increase the penalty amount for a laboratory that has deficiencies 
which, after imposition of a lower level penalty amount, become 
sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy.
    (e) Procedures for imposition of civil money penalty--(1) Notice of 
intent. (i) HCFA sends the laboratory written notice, of HCFA's intent 
to impose a civil money penalty.
    (ii) The notice includes the following information:
    (A) The statutory basis for the penalty.
    (B) The proposed daily or per violation amount of the penalty.
    (C) The factors (as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) 
that HCFA considered.
    (D) The opportunity for responding to the notice in accordance with 
Sec. 493.1810(c).
    (E) A specific statement regarding the laboratory's appeal rights.
    (2) Appeal rights. (i) The laboratory has 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the notice of intent to impose a civil money penalty to 
request a hearing in accordance with Sec. 493.1844(g).
    (ii) If the laboratory requests a hearing, all other pertinent 
provisions of Sec. 493.1844 apply.
    (iii) If the laboratory does not request a hearing, HCFA may reduce 
the proposed penalty amount by 35 percent.
    (f) Accrual and duration of penalty--(1) Accrual of penalty. The 
civil money penalty begins accruing as follows:
    (i) 5 days after notice of intent if there is immediate jeopardy.
    (ii) 15 days after notice of intent if there is not immediate 
jeopardy.
    (2) Duration of penalty. The civil money penalty continues to accrue 
until the earliest of the following occurs:
    (i) The laboratory's compliance with condition level requirements is 
verified on the basis of the evidence presented by the laboratory in its 
credible allegation of compliance or at the time or revisit.
    (ii) Based on credible evidence presented by the laboratory at the 
time of revisit, HCFA determines that compliance was achieved before the 
revisit. (In this situation, the money penalty stops accruing as of the 
date of compliance.)
    (iii) HCFA suspends, limits, or revokes the laboratory's certificate 
of compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, 
or certificate for PPM procedures.
    (g) Computation and notice of total penalty amount--(1) Computation. 
HCFA computes the total penalty amount after the laboratory's compliance 
is verified or HCFA suspends, limits, or revokes the laboratory's CLIA 
certificate but in no event before--
    (i) The 60 day period for requesting a hearing has expired without a 
request or the laboratory has explicitly waived its right to a hearing; 
or

[[Page 930]]

    (ii) Following a hearing requested by the laboratory, the ALJ issues 
a decision that upholds imposition of the penalty.
    (2) Notice of penalty amount and due date of penalty. The notice 
includes the following information:
    (i) Daily or per violation penalty amount.
    (ii) Number of days or violations for which the penalty is imposed.
    (iii) Total penalty amount.
    (iv) Due date for payment of the penalty.
    (h) Due date for payment of penalty. (1) Payment of a civil money 
penalty is due 15 days from the date of the notice specified in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (2) HCFA may approve a plan for a laboratory to pay a civil money 
penalty, plus interest, over a period of up to one year from the 
original due date.
    (i) Collection and settlement--(1) Collection of penalty amounts. 
(i) The determined penalty amount may be deducted from any sums then or 
later owing by the United States to the laboratory subject to the 
penalty.
    (ii) Interest accrues on the unpaid balance of the penalty, 
beginning on the due date. Interest is computed at the rate specified in 
Sec. 405.378(d) of this chapter.
    (2) Settlement. HCFA has authority to settle any case at any time 
before the ALJ issues a hearing decision.

<R05>
Sec. 493.1836  State onsite monitoring.

    (a) Application. (1) HCFA may require continuous or intermittent 
monitoring of a plan of correction by the State survey agency to ensure 
that the laboratory makes the improvements necessary to bring it into 
compliance with the condition level requirements. (The State monitor 
does not have management authority, that is, cannot hire or fire staff, 
obligate funds, or otherwise dictate how the laboratory operates. The 
monitor's responsibility is to oversee whether corrections are made.)
    (2) The laboratory must pay the costs of onsite monitoring by the 
State survey agency.
    (i) The costs are computed by multiplying the number of hours of 
onsite monitoring in the laboratory by the hourly rate negotiated by 
HCFA and the State.
    (ii) The hourly rate includes salary, fringe benefits, travel, and 
other direct and indirect costs approved by HCFA.
    (b) Procedures. Before imposing this sanction, HCFA provides notice 
of sanction and opportunity to respond in accordance with Sec. 493.1810.
    (c) Duration of sanction. (1) If HCFA imposes onsite monitoring, the 
sanction continues until HCFA determines that the laboratory has the 
capability to ensure compliance with all condition level requirements.
    (2) If the laboratory does not correct all deficiencies within 12 
months, and a revisit indicates that deficiencies remain, HCFA cancels 
the laboratory's approval for Medicare payment for its services and 
notifies the laboratory of its intent to suspend, limit, or revoke the 
laboratory's certificate of compliance, registration certificate, 
certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM procedures.
    (3) If the laboratory still does not correct its deficiencies, the 
Medicare sanction continues until the suspension, limitation, or 
revocation of the laboratory's certificate of compliance, registration 
certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM 
procedures is effective.

<R05>
Sec. 493.1838  Training and technical assistance for unsuccessful participation in proficiency testing.

    If a laboratory's participation in proficiency testing is 
unsuccessful, HCFA may require the laboratory to undertake training of 
its personnel, or to obtain necessary technical assistance, or both, in 
order to meet the requirements of the proficiency testing program. This 
requirement is separate from the principal and alternative sanctions set 
forth in Secs. 493.1806 and 493.1807.

[[Page 931]]


<R05>
Sec. 493.1840  Suspension, limitation, or revocation of any type of CLIA certificate.

    (a) Adverse action based on actions of the laboratory's owner, 
operator or employees. HCFA may initiate adverse action to suspend, 
limit or revoke any CLIA certificate if HCFA finds that a laboratory's 
owner or operator or one of its employees has--
    (1) Been guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining a CLIA 
certificate;
    (2) Performed, or represented the laboratory as entitled to perform, 
a laboratory examination or other procedure that is not within a 
category of laboratory examinations or other procedures authorized by 
its CLIA certificate;
    (3) Failed to comply with the certificate requirements and 
performance standards;
    (4) Failed to comply with reasonable requests by HCFA for any 
information or work on materials that HCFA concludes is necessary to 
determine the laboratory's continued eligibility for its CLIA 
certificate or continued compliance with performance standards set by 
HCFA;
    (5) Refused a reasonable request by HCFA or its agent for permission 
to inspect the laboratory and its operation and pertinent records during 
the hours that the laboratory is in operation;
    (6) Violated or aided and abetted in the violation of any provisions 
of CLIA and its implementing regulations;
    (7) Failed to comply with an alternative sanction imposed under this 
subpart; or
    (8) Within the preceding two-year period, owned or operated a 
laboratory that had its CLIA certificate revoked. (This provision 
applies only to the owner or operator, not to all of the laboratory's 
employees.)
    (b) Adverse action based on improper referrals in proficiency 
testing. If HCFA determines that a laboratory has intentionally referred 
its proficiency testing samples to another laboratory for analysis, HCFA 
revokes the laboratory's CLIA certificate for at least one year, and may 
also impose a civil money penalty.
    (c) Adverse action based on exclusion from Medicare. If the OIG 
excludes a laboratory from participation in Medicare, HCFA suspends the 
laboratory's CLIA certificate for the period during which the laboratory 
is excluded.
    (d) Procedures for suspension or limitation--(1) Basic rule. Except 
as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, HCFA does not suspend 
or limit a CLIA certificate until after an ALJ hearing decision (as 
provided in Sec. 493.1844) that upholds suspension or limitation.
    (2) Exceptions. HCFA may suspend or limit a CLIA certificate before 
the ALJ hearing in any of the following circumstances:
    (i) The laboratory's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy.
    (ii) The laboratory has refused a reasonable request for information 
or work on materials.
    (iii) The laboratory has refused permission for HCFA or a HCFA agent 
to inspect the laboratory or its operation.
    (e) Procedures for revocation. (1) HCFA does not revoke any type of 
CLIA certificate until after an ALJ hearing that upholds revocation.
    (2) HCFA may revoke a CLIA certificate after the hearing decision 
even if it had not previously suspended or limited that certificate.
    (f) Notice to the OIG. HCFA notifies the OIG of any violations under 
paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(6), and (b) of this section within 30 
days of the determination of the violation.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1842  Cancellation of Medicare approval.

    (a) Basis for cancellation. (1) HCFA always cancels a laboratory's 
approval to receive Medicare payment for its services if HCFA suspends 
or revokes the laboratory's CLIA certificate.
    (2) HCFA may cancel the laboratory's approval under any of the 
following circumstances:
    (i) The laboratory is out of compliance with a condition level 
requirement.
    (ii) The laboratory fails to submit a plan of correction 
satisfactory to HCFA.
    (iii) The laboratory fails to correct all its deficiencies within 
the time frames specified in the plan of correction.
    (b) Notice and opportunity to respond. Before canceling a 
laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for

[[Page 932]]

its services, HCFA gives the laboratory--
    (1) Written notice of the rationale for, effective date, and effect 
of, cancellation;
    (2) Opportunity to submit written evidence or other information 
against cancellation of the laboratory's approval.
    This sanction may be imposed before the hearing that may be 
requested by a laboratory, in accordance with the appeals procedures set 
forth in Sec. 493.1844.
    (c) Effect of cancellation. Cancellation of Medicare approval 
terminates any Medicare payment sanctions regardless of the time frames 
originally specified.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1844  Appeals procedures.

    (a) General rules. (1) The provisions of this section apply to all 
laboratories and prospective laboratories that are dissatisfied with any 
initial determination under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Hearings are conducted in accordance with procedures set forth 
in subpart D of part 498 of this chapter, except that the authority to 
conduct hearings and issue decisions may be exercised by ALJs assigned 
to, or detailed to, the Departmental Appeals Board.
    (3) Any party dissatisfied with a hearing decision is entitled to 
request review of the decision as specified in subpart E of part 498 of 
this chapter, except that the authority to review the decision may be 
exercised by the Departmental Appeals Board.
    (4) When more than one of the actions specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section are carried out concurrently, the laboratory has a right to 
only one hearing on all matters at issue.
    (b) Actions that are initial determinations. The following actions 
are initial determinations and therefore are subject to appeal in 
accordance with this section:
    (1) The suspension, limitation, or revocation of the laboratory's 
CLIA certificate by HCFA because of noncompliance with CLIA 
requirements.
    (2) The denial of a CLIA certificate.
    (3) The imposition of alternative sanctions under this subpart (but 
not the determination as to which alternative sanction or sanctions to 
impose).
    (4) The denial or cancellation of the laboratory's approval to 
receive Medicare payment for its services.
    (c) Actions that are not initial determinations. Actions that are 
not listed in paragraph (b) of this section are not initial 
determinations and therefore are not subject to appeal under this 
section. They include, but are not necessarily limited to, the 
following:
    (1) The finding that a laboratory accredited by a HCFA-approved 
accreditation organization is no longer deemed to meet the conditions 
set forth in subparts H, J, K, M, P, and Q of this part. However, the 
suspension, limitation or revocation of a certificate of accreditation 
is an initial determination and is appealable.
    (2) The finding that a laboratory determined to be in compliance 
with condition-level requirements but has deficiencies that are not at 
the condition level.
    (3) The determination not to reinstate a suspended CLIA certificate 
because the reason for the suspension has not been removed or there is 
insufficient assurance that the reason will not recur.
    (4) The determination as to which alternative sanction or sanctions 
to impose, including the amount of a civil money penalty to impose per 
day or per violation.
    (5) The denial of approval for Medicare payment for the services of 
a laboratory that does not have in effect a valid CLIA certificate.
    (6) The determination that a laboratory's deficiencies pose 
immediate jeopardy.
    (7) The amount of the civil money penalty assessed per day or for 
each violation of Federal requirements.
    (d) Effect of pending appeals--(1) Alternative sanctions. The 
effective date of an alternative sanction (other than a civil money 
penalty) is not delayed because the laboratory has appealed and the 
hearing or the hearing decision is pending.
    (2) Suspension, limitation, or revocation of a laboratory's CLIA 
certificate--(i) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section, suspension, limitation, or revocation of a

[[Page 933]]

CLIA certificate is not effective until after a hearing decision by an 
ALJ is issued.
    (ii) Exceptions. (A) If HCFA determines that conditions at a 
laboratory pose immediate jeopardy, the effective date of the suspension 
or limitation of a CLIA certificate is not delayed because the 
laboratory has appealed and the hearing or the hearing decision is 
pending.
    (B) HCFA may suspend or limit a laboratory's CLIA certificate before 
an ALJ hearing or hearing decision if the laboratory has refused a 
reasonable request for information (including but not limited to billing 
information), or for work on materials, or has refused permission for 
HCFA or a HCFA agent to inspect the laboratory or its operation.
    (3) Cancellation of Medicare approval. The effective date of the 
cancellation of a laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for 
its services is not delayed because the laboratory has appealed and the 
hearing or hearing decision is pending.
    (4) Effect of ALJ decision. (i) An ALJ decision is final unless, as 
provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, one of the parties 
requests review by the Departmental Appeals Board within 60 days, and 
the Board reviews the case and issues a revised decision.
    (ii) If an ALJ decision upholds a suspension imposed because of 
immediate jeopardy, that suspension becomes a revocation.
    (e) Appeal rights for prospective laboratories--(1) Reconsideration. 
Any prospective laboratory dissatisfied with a denial of a CLIA 
certificate, or of approval for Medicare payment for its services, may 
initiate the appeals process by requesting reconsideration in accordance 
with Secs. 498.22 through 498.25 of this chapter.
    (2) Notice of reopening. If HCFA reopens an initial or reconsidered 
determination, HCFA gives the prospective laboratory notice of the 
revised determination in accordance with Sec. 498.32 of this chapter.
    (3) ALJ hearing. Any prospective laboratory dissatisfied with a 
reconsidered determination under paragraph (e)(1) of this section or a 
revised reconsidered determination under Sec. 498.30 of this chapter is 
entitled to a hearing before an ALJ, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (4) Review of ALJ hearing decisions. Any prospective laboratory that 
is dissatisfied with an ALJ's hearing decision or dismissal of a request 
for hearing may file a written request for review by the Departmental 
Appeals Board as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (f) Appeal rights of laboratories--(1) ALJ hearing. Any laboratory 
dissatisfied with the suspension, limitation, or revocation of its CLIA 
certificate, with the imposition of an alternative sanction under this 
subpart, or with cancellation of the approval to receive Medicare 
payment for its services, is entitled to a hearing before an ALJ as 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and has 60 days from the 
notice of sanction to request a hearing.
    (2) Review of ALJ hearing decisions. Any laboratory that is 
dissatisfied with an ALJ's hearing decision or dismissal of a request 
for hearing may file a written request for review by the Departmental 
Appeals Board, as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (3) Judicial review. Any laboratory dissatisfied with the decision 
to impose a civil money penalty or to suspend, limit, or revoke its CLIA 
certificate may, within 60 days after the decision becomes final, file 
with the U.S. Court of Appeals of the circuit in which the laboratory 
has its principal place of business, a petition for judicial review.
    (g) Notice of adverse action. (1) If HCFA suspends, limits, or 
revokes a laboratory's CLIA certificate or cancels the approval to 
receive Medicare payment for its services, HCFA gives notice to the 
laboratory, and may give notice to physicians, providers, suppliers, and 
other laboratory clients, according to the procedures set forth at 
Sec. 493.1832. In addition, HCFA notifies the general public each time 
one of these principal sanctions is imposed.
    (2) The notice to the laboratory--
    (i) Sets forth the reasons for the adverse action, the effective 
date and effect of that action, and the appeal rights if any; and
    (ii) When the certificate is limited, specifies the specialties or 
subspecialties of tests that the laboratory is no

[[Page 934]]

longer authorized to perform, and that are no longer covered under 
Medicare.
    (3) The notice to other entities includes the same information 
except the information about the laboratory's appeal rights.
    (h) Effective date of adverse action. (1) When the laboratory's 
deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy, the effective date of the adverse 
action is at least 5 days after the date of the notice.
    (2) When HCFA determines that the laboratory's deficiencies do not 
pose immediate jeopardy, the effective date of the adverse action is at 
least 15 days after the date of the notice.

<R05>
Sec. 493.1846  Civil action.

    If HCFA has reason to believe that continuation of the activities of 
any laboratory, including a State-exempt laboratory, would constitute a 
significant hazard to the public health, HCFA may bring suit in a U.S. 
District Court to enjoin continuation of the specific activity that is 
causing the hazard or to enjoin the continued operation of the 
laboratory if HCFA deems it necessary. Upon proper showing, the court 
shall issue a temporary injunction or restraining order without bond 
against continuation of the activity.


<R05>
Sec. 493.1850  Laboratory registry.

    (a) Once a year HCFA makes available to physicians and to the 
general public specific information (including information provided to 
HCFA by the OIG) that is useful in evaluating the performance of 
laboratories, including the following:
    (1) A list of laboratories that have been convicted, under Federal 
or State laws relating to fraud and abuse, false billing, or kickbacks.
    (2) A list of laboratories that have had their CLIA certificates 
suspended, limited, or revoked, and the reason for the adverse actions.

Sec. 493.1846 and the reasons for those actions.
    (8) A list of laboratories that have been excluded from 
participation in Medicare or Medicaid and the reasons for the exclusion.
    (b) The laboratory registry is compiled for the calendar year 
preceding the date the information is made available and includes 
appropriate explanatory information to aid in the interpretation of the 
data. It also contains corrections of any erroneous statements or 
information that appeared in the previous registry.

    On his or her own motion, or on the motion of a party to the 
hearing, the ALJ may dismiss a hearing request either entirely or as to 
any stated issue, under any of the following circumstances:

decision with respect to the rights of the same affected party on the 
same facts and law pertinent to the same issue or issues which has 
become final either by judicial affirmance or, without judicial 
consideration, because the affected party did not timely request 
reconsideration, hearing, or review, or commence a civil action with 
respect to that determination or decision.
    (b) No right to hearing. The party requesting a hearing is not a 
proper party or does not otherwise have a right to a hearing.

file a hearing request timely and the time for filing has not been 
extended.

Board may review that revised decision at the request of either party or 
on its own motion.


<R05>
Sec. 498.103  Notice and effect of revised decision.

    (a) No exclusion imposed in accordance with Sec. 1001.101 will be 
for less than 5 years.
    (b) Any of the following factors may be considered to be aggravating 
and a basis for lengthening the period of exclusion--
    (1) The acts resulting in the conviction, or similar acts, resulted 
in financial loss to a government program or to one or more entities of 
$1,500 or more. (The entire amount of financial loss to such programs or 
entities, including any amounts resulting from similar acts not 
adjudicated, will be considered regardless of whether full or partial 
restitution has been made);

continuing pattern or behavior, or consisted of non-consensual sexual 
acts;

    (6) Whether the individual or entity has a documented history of 
criminal, civil or administrative wrongdoing;
    (7) The individual or entity has at any time been overpaid a total

besides those which formed the basis for the exclusion, or has been the 
subject of any other adverse action by any Federal, State or local 
government agency or board, if the adverse action is based on the same 
set of circumstances that serves as the basis for imposition of the 
exclusion.
    (c) Only if any of the aggravating factors set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section justifies an exclusion longer than 5 years, may 
mitigating factors be considered as a basis for reducing the period of 
exclusion to no less than 5 years. Only the following factors may be 
considered mitigating--
    (1) The individual or entity was convicted of 3 or fewer misdemeanor 
offenses, and the entire amount of financial loss to Medicare and the 
State health care programs due to the acts that resulted in the 
conviction, and similar acts, is less than $1,500;
    (2) The record in the criminal proceedings, including sentencing 
documents, demonstrates that the court determined that the individual 
had a mental, emotional or physical condition before or during the 
commission of the offense that reduced the individual's culpability; or
    (3) The individual's or entity's cooperation with Federal or State 
officials resulted in--

[[Page 960]]

the appropriate law enforcement agency identifying program

    (1) Had a license to provide health care revoked or suspended by any

performance or financial integrity; or
    (2) Has surrendered such a license while a formal disciplinary 
proceeding concerning the individual's or entity's professional 
competence, professional performance or financial integrity was pending 
before a State licensing authority.
    (b) Length of exclusion. (1) An exclusion imposed in accordance with 
this section will not be for a period of time less than the period 
during which an individual's or entity's license is revoked, suspended 
or otherwise not in effect as a result of, or in connection with, a 
State licensing agency action.
    (2) Any of the following factors may be considered aggravating and a 
basis for lengthening the period of exclusion--

the individual's or entity's license to provide health care had or could 
have had a significant adverse physical, emotional or financial impact 
on one or more program beneficiaries or other individuals;
    (ii) Whether the individual or entity has a documented history of

vulnerabilities or weaknesses; or
    (ii) Alternative sources of the type of health care items or

section, the OIG will consider a request for reinstatement in accordance 
with Sec. 1001.3001 if the individual or entity obtains a valid license 
in the State where the license was originally revoked, suspended, 
surrendered or otherwise lost.
    (c) Exceptions--(1) Length of exclusion. If, prior to the notice of 
exclusion by the OIG, the licensing authority of a State (other than the 
one in which the individual's or entity's license had been revoked, 
suspended, surrendered or otherwise lost), being fully apprised of all 
of the circumstances surrounding the prior action by the licensing board 
of the first State, grants the individual or entity a license or takes 
no significant adverse action as to a currently held license, an 
exclusion imposed in accordance with this section may be for a period of 
time less than that prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (2) Consideration of early reinstatement. If an individual or entity 
that has been excluded in accordance with this section fully and 
accurately discloses the circumstances surrounding this action to a 
licensing authority of a different State, and that State grants the 
individual or entity a new license or takes no significant adverse 
action as to a currently held license, the OIG will consider a request 
for early reinstatement.

voluntarily withdraws from a program to avoid a formal sanction.
    (b) Length of exclusion. (1) An exclusion imposed in accordance with 
this section will not be for a period of time less than the period 
during which the individual or entity is excluded or suspended from a 
Federal or State health care program.
    (2) Any of the following factors may be considered aggravating and a 
basis for lengthening the period of exclusion--
    (i) The acts that resulted in the exclusion, suspension or other 
sanction under Medicare, Medicaid and all other Federal health care 
programs had, or could have had, a significant adverse impact on Federal

a period not less than that set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. Only the following factors may be considered mitigating--

    (4) If the individual or entity is eligible to apply for 
reinstatement in accordance with Sec. 1001.3001 of this part, and the 
sole reason for the State denying reinstatement is the existing Medicare 
exclusion imposed by the OIG as a result of the original State action, 
the OIG will consider a request for reinstatement.

Sec. 1001.952  Exceptions.

    The following payment practices shall not be treated as a criminal 
offense under section 1128B of the Act and shall not serve as the basis 
for an exclusion:
    (a) Investment Interests. As used in section 1128B of the Act, 
``remuneration'' does not include any payment that is a return on an 
investment interest, such as a dividend or interest income, made to an 
investor as long as all of the applicable standards are met within one 
of the following two categories of entities:
    (1) If, within the previous fiscal year or previous 12 month period, 
the entity possesses more than $50,000,000 in undepreciated net tangible 
assets

[[Page 970]]

(based on the net acquisition cost of purchasing such assets from an 
unrelated entity) related to the furnishing of items and services, all 
of the following five applicable standards must be met--
    (i) With respect to an investment interest that is an equity 
security, the equity security must be registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under 15 U.S.C. 781 (b) or (g).
    (ii) The investment interest of an investor in a position to make or 
influence referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise 
generate business for the entity must be obtained on terms equally 
available to the public through trading on a registered national 
securities exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the American 
Stock Exchange, or on the National Association of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotation System.
    (iii) The entity or any investor must not market or furnish the 
entity's items or services (or those of another entity as part of a 
cross referral agreement) to passive investors differently than to non-
investors.
    (iv) The entity must not loan funds to or guarantee a loan for an 
investor who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish 
items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity if 
the investor uses any part of such loan to obtain the investment 
interest.
    (v) The amount of payment to an investor in return for the 
investment interest must be directly proportional to the amount of the 
capital investment of that investor.
    (2) If the entity possesses investment interests that are held by 
either active or passive investors, all of the following eight 
applicable standards must be met--
    (i) No more than 40 percent of the value of the investment interests 
of each class of investments may be held in the previous fiscal year or 
previous 12 month period by investors who are in a position to make or 
influence referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise 
generate business for the entity.
    (ii) The terms on which an investment interest is offered to a 
passive investor, if any, who is in a position to make or influence 
referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate 
business for the entity must be no different from the terms offered to 
other passive investors.
    (iii) The terms on which an investment interest is offered to an 
investor who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish 
items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity must 
not be related to the previous or expected volume of referrals, items or 
services furnished, or the amount of business otherwise generated from 
that investor to the entity.
    (iv) There is no requirement that a passive investor, if any, make 
referrals to, be in a position to make or influence referrals to, 
furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the 
entity as a condition for remaining as an investor.
    (v) The entity or any investor must not market or furnish the 
entity's items or services (or those of another entity as part of a 
cross referral agreement) to passive investors differently than to non-
investors.
    (vi) No more than 40 percent of the gross revenue of the entity in 
the previous fiscal year or previous 12 month period may come from 
referrals, items or services furnished, or business otherwise generated 
from investors.
    (vii) The entity must not loan funds to or guarantee a loan for an 
investor who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish 
items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity if 
the investor uses any part of such loan to obtain the investment 
interest.
    (viii) The amount of payment to an investor in return for the 
investment interest must be directly proportional to the amount of the 
capital investment (including the fair market value of any pre-
operational services rendered) of that investor.
    For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following terms 
apply. Active investor means an investor either who is responsible for 
the day-to-day management of the entity and is a bona fide general 
partner in a partnership under the Uniform Partnership Act or who agrees 
in writing to undertake liability for the actions of the entity's agents 
acting within the scope of

[[Page 971]]

their agency. Investment interest means a security issued by an entity, 
and may include the following classes of investments: shares in a 
corporation, interests or units of a partnership, bonds, debentures, 
notes, or other debt instruments. Investor means an individual or entity 
either who directly holds an investment interest in an entity, or who 
holds such investment interest indirectly by, including but not limited 
to, such means as having a family member hold such investment interest 
or holding a legal or beneficial interest in another entity (such as a 
trust or holding company) that holds such investment interest. Passive 
investor means an investor who is not an active investor, such as a 
limited partner in a partnership under the Uniform Partnership Act, a 
shareholder in a corporation, or a holder of a debt security.
    (b) Space Rental. As used in section 1128B of the Act, 
``remuneration'' does not include any payment made by a lessee to a

standards are met--
    (1) The lease agreement is set out in writing and signed by the 
parties.
    (2) The lease specifies the premises covered by the lease.
    (3) If the lease is intended to provide the lessee with access to

basis for the term of the lease, the lease specifies exactly the 
schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact rent for 
such intervals.
    (4) The term of the lease is for not less than one year.
    (5) The aggregate rental charge is set in advance, is consistent 
with fair market value in arms-length transactions and is not determined 
in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals 
or business otherwise generated between the parties for which payment 
may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care 
program.
    For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term fair market 
value means the value of the rental property for general commercial 
purposes, but shall not be adjusted to reflect the additional value that 
one party (either the prospective lessee or lessor) would attribute to 
the property as a result of its proximity or convenience to sources of 
referrals or business otherwise generated for which payment may be made 
in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program.
    (c) Equipment rental. As used in section 1128B of the Act,

as long as all of the following five standards are met--
    (1) The lease agreement is set out in writing and signed by the 
parties.
    (2) The lease specifies the equipment covered by the lease.
    (3) If the lease is intended to provide the lessee with use of the 
equipment for periodic intervals of time, rather than on a full-time 
basis for the term of the lease, the lease specifies exactly the 
schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact rent for 
such interval.
    (4) The term of the lease is for not less than one year.
    (5) The aggregate rental charge is set in advance, is consistent 
with fair market value in arms-length transactions and is not determined 
in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals 
or business otherwise generated between the parties for which payment 
may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care 
program.
    For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term fair market 
value means the value of the equipment when obtained from a manufacturer 
or professional distributor, but shall not be adjusted to reflect the 
additional value one party (either the prospective lessee or lessor) 
would attribute to the equipment as a result of its proximity or 
convenience to sources of referrals or business otherwise generated for 
which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State 
health care program.
    (d) Personal services and management contracts. As used in section 
1128B of the Act, ``remuneration'' does not include any payment made by 
a principal to an agent as compensation for the services of the agent,

parties.
    (2) The agency agreement specifies the services to be provided by

exactly the schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the 
exact charge for such intervals.
    (4) The term of the agreement is for not less than one year.
    (5) The aggregate compensation paid to the agent over the term of 
the agreement is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value in 
arms-length transactions and is not determined in a manner that takes 
into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise 
generated between the parties for which payment may be made in whole or 
in part under Medicare or a State health care program.
    (6) The services performed under the agreement do not involve the 
counselling or promotion of a business arrangement or other activity 
that violates any State or Federal law.
    For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, an agent of a 
principal is any person, other than a bona fide employee of the 
principal, who has an agreement to perform services for, or on behalf 
of, the principal.
    (e) Sale of practice. As used in section 1128B of the Act, 
``remuneration'' does not include any payment made to a practitioner by 
another practitioner where the former practitioner is selling his or her 
practice to the latter practitioner, as long as both of the following 
two standards are met--
    (1) The period from the date of the first agreement pertaining to 
the sale to the completion of the sale is not more than one year.
    (2) The practitioner who is selling his or her practice will not be

business for, the purchasing practitioner for which payment may be made 
in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program after 
one year from the date of the first agreement pertaining to the sale.
    (f) Referral services. As used in section 1128B of the Act,

all of the following four standards are met--
    (1) The referral service does not exclude as a participant in the 
referral service any individual or entity who meets the qualifications 
for participation.
    (2) Any payment the participant makes to the referral service is 
assessed equally against and collected equally from all participants, 
and is only based on the cost of operating the referral service, and not 
on the volume or value of any referrals to or business otherwise 
generated by the participants for the referral service for which payment 
may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care 
program.
    (3) The referral service imposes no requirements on the manner in 
which the participant provides services to a referred person, except 
that the referral service may require that the participant charge the 
person referred at the same rate as it charges other persons not 
referred by the referral service, or that these services be furnished 
free of charge or at reduced charge.
    (4) The referral service makes the following five disclosures to 
each person seeking a referral, with each such disclosure maintained by 
the referral service in a written record certifying such disclosure and 
signed by either such person seeking a referral or by the individual 
making the disclosure on behalf of the referral service--
    (i) The manner in which it selects the group of participants in the 
referral service to which it could make a referral;

item, as long as the buyer complies with all of the following standards 
in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section and the manufacturer or 
supplier complies with all of the following standards in paragraphs 
(g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section--

payment filed with the Department or a State agency.
    (2) The buyer must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State

to the buyer, and inform the buyer of its obligations under paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Where the amount of the price reduction is not known at the 
time of sale, the manufacturer or supplier must fully and accurately 
report the existence of a warranty on the invoice or statement, inform 
the buyer of its obligations under paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this 
section, and, when the price reduction becomes known, provide the buyer 
with documentation of the calculation of the price reduction resulting 
from the warranty.
    (4) The manufacturer or supplier must not pay any remuneration to 
any individual (other than a beneficiary) or entity for any medical, 
surgical, or hospital expense incurred by a beneficiary other than for 
the cost of the item itself.
    For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, the term warranty 
means either an agreement made in accordance with the provisions of 15 
U.S.C. 2301(6), or a manufacturer's or supplier's agreement to replace 
another manufacturer's or supplier's defective item (which is covered by 
an agreement made in accordance with this statutory provision), on terms 
equal to the agreement that it replaces.
    (h) Discounts. As used in section 1128B of the Act, ``remuneration'' 
does not include a discount, as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this 
section, on a good or service received by a buyer, which submits a claim

or service bought within a single fiscal year of the buyer;
    (B) The buyer must claim the benefit of the discount in the fiscal 
year in which the discount is earned or the following year;
    (C) The buyer must fully and accurately report the discount in the 
applicable cost report; and
    (D) The buyer must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State 
agency, information provided by the seller as specified in paragraph 
(h)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) If the buyer is an entity which is a health maintenance 
organization or competitive medical plan acting in accordance with a 
risk contract under

[[Page 974]]

section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, or under another State health 
care program, it need not report the discount except as otherwise may be 
required under the risk contract.
    (iii) If the buyer is not an entity described in paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii) of this section, it must comply with all of the 
following three standards--
    (A) The discount must be made at the time of the original sale of 
the good or service;
    (B) Where an item or service is separately claimed for payment with 
the Department or a State agency, the buyer must fully and accurately 
report the discount on that item or service; and
    (C) The buyer must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State 
agency, information provided by the seller as specified in paragraph 
(h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (2) With respect to either of the following two categories of 
buyers, the seller must comply with all of the applicable standards 
within each category--
    (i) If the buyer is an entity described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the seller need not report the discount to the buyer for 
purposes of this provision.
    (ii) If the buyer is any other individual or entity, the seller must 
comply with either of the following two standards--
    (A) Where a discount is required to be reported to the Department or 
a State agency under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the seller must 
fully and accurately report such discount on the invoice or statement 
submitted to the buyer, and inform the buyer of its obligations to 
report such discount; or
    (B) Where the value of the discount is not known at the time of 
sale, the seller must fully and accurately report the existence of a 
discount program on the invoice or statement submitted to the buyer, 
inform the buyer of its obligations under paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section and, when the value of the discount becomes known, provide the 
buyer with documentation of the calculation of the discount identifying 
the specific goods or services purchased to which the discount will be 
applied.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph, the term discount means a 
reduction in the amount a seller charges a buyer (who buys either 
directly or through a wholesaler or a group purchasing organization) for 
a good or service based on an arms length transaction. The term discount 
may include a rebate check, credit or coupon directly redeemable from 
the seller only to the extent that such reductions in price are 
attributable to the original good or service that was purchased or 
furnished. The term discount does not include--
    (i) Cash payment;
    (ii) Furnishing one good or service without charge or at a reduced 
charge in exchange for any agreement to buy a different good or service;
    (iii) A reduction in price applicable to one payor but not to 
Medicare or a State health care program;
    (iv) A reduction in price offered to a beneficiary (such as a 
routine reduction or waiver of any coinsurance or deductible amount owed 
by a program beneficiary);
    (v) Warranties;
    (vi) Services provided in accordance with a personal or management 
services contract; or
    (vii) Other remuneration in cash or in kind not explicitly described 
in this paragraph.
    (i) Employees. As used in section 1128B of the Act, ``remuneration'' 
does not include any amount paid by an employer to an employee, who has 
a bona fide employment relationship with the employer, for employment in 
the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in 
whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program. For 
purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, the term employee has the 
same meaning as it does for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(2).
    (j) Group purchasing organizations. As used in section 1128B of the 
Act, ``remuneration'' does not include any payment by a vendor of goods 
or services to a group purchasing organization (GPO), as part of an 
agreement to furnish such goods or services to an individual or entity 
as long as both of the following two standards are met--
    (1) The GPO must have a written agreement with each individual or 
entity, for which items or services are

[[Page 975]]

furnished, that provides for either of the following--
    (i) The agreement states that participating vendors from which the 
individual or entity will purchase goods or services will pay a fee to 
the GPO of 3 percent or less of the purchase price of the goods or 
services provided by that vendor.
    (ii) In the event the fee paid to the GPO is not fixed at 3 percent 
or less of the purchase price of the goods or services, the agreement 
specifies the amount (or if not known, the maximum amount) the GPO will 
be paid by each vendor (where such amount may be a fixed sum or a fixed 
percentage of the value of purchases made from the vendor by the members 
of the group under the contract between the vendor and the GPO).
    (2) Where the entity which receives the goods or service from the 
vendor is a health care provider of services, the GPO must disclose in 
writing to the entity at least annually, and to the Secretary upon 
request, the amount received from each vendor with respect to purchases 
made by or on behalf of the entity.
    For purposes of paragraph (j) of this section, the term group 
purchasing organization (GPO) means an entity authorized to act as a 
purchasing agent for a group of individuals or entities who are 
furnishing services for which payment may be made in whole or in part 
under Medicare or a State health care program, and who are neither 
wholly-owned by the GPO nor subsidiaries of a parent corporation that 
wholly owns the GPO (either directly or through another wholly-owned 
entity).
    (k) Waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts. As 
used in section 1128B of the Act, ``remuneration'' does not include any 
reduction or waiver of a Medicare or a State health care program 
beneficiary's obligation to pay coinsurance or deductible amounts as 
long as all of the standards are met within either of the following two 
categories of health care providers:
    (1) If the coinsurance or deductible amounts are owed to a hospital 
for inpatient hospital services for which Medicare pays under the 
prospective payment system, the hospital must comply with all of the 
following three standards--
    (i) The hospital must not later claim the amount reduced or waived 
as a bad debt for payment purposes under Medicare or otherwise shift the 
burden of the reduction or waiver onto Medicare, a State health care 
program, other payers, or individuals.
    (ii) The hospital must offer to reduce or waive the coinsurance or 
deductible amounts without regard to the reason for admission, the 
length of stay of the beneficiary, or the diagnostic related group for 
which the claim for Medicare reimbursement is filed.
    (iii) The hospital's offer to reduce or waive the coinsurance or 
deductible amounts must not be made as part of a price reduction 
agreement between a hospital and a third-party payer (including a health 
plan as defined in paragraph (l)(2) of this section), unless the 
agreement is part of a contract for the furnishing of items or services 
to a beneficiary of a Medicare supplemental policy issued under the 
terms of section 1882(t)(1) of the Act.
    (2) If the coinsurance or deductible amounts are owed by an 
individual who qualifies for subsidized services under a provision of 
the Public Health Services Act or under titles V or XIX of the Act to a 
federally qualified health care center or other health care facility 
under any Public Health Services Act grant program or under title V of 
the Act, the health care center or facility may reduce or waive the 
coinsurance or deductible amounts for items or services for which 
payment may be made in whole or in part under part B of Medicare or a 
State health care program.
    (l) Increased coverage, reduced cost-sharing amounts, or reduced 
premium amounts offered by health plans. (1) As used in section 1128B of 
the Act, ``remuneration'' does not include the additional coverage of 
any item or service offered by a health plan to an enrollee or the 
reduction of some or all of the enrollee's obligation to pay the health 
plan or a contract health care provider for cost-sharing amounts (such 
as coinsurance, deductible, or copayment amounts) or for premium amounts 
attributable to items or services covered by the health plan, the 
Medicare program, or a State health care program,

[[Page 976]]

as long as the health plan complies with all of the standards within one 
of the following two categories of health plans:
    (i) If the health plan is a risk-based health maintenance 
organization, competitive medical plan, prepaid health plan, or other 
health plan under contract with HCFA or a State health care program and 
operating in accordance with section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, 
under a Federal statutory demonstration authority, or under other 
Federal statutory or regulatory authority, it must offer the same 
increased coverage or reduced cost-sharing or premium amounts to all 
Medicare or State health care program enrollees covered by the contract 
unless otherwise approved by HCFA or by a State health care program.
    (ii) If the health plan is a health maintenance organization, 
competitive medical plan, health care prepayment plan, prepaid health 
plan or other health plan that has executed a contract or agreement with 
HCFA or with a State health care program to receive payment for 
enrollees on a reasonable cost or similar basis, it must comply with 
both of the following two standards--
    (A) The health plan must offer the same increased coverage or 
reduced cost-sharing or premium amounts to all Medicare or State health 
care program enrollees covered by the contract or agreement unless 
otherwise approved by HCFA or by a State health care program; and
    (B) The health plan must not claim the costs of the increased 
coverage or the reduced cost-sharing or premium amounts as a bad debt 
for payment purposes under Medicare or a State health care program or 
otherwise shift the burden of the increased coverage or reduced cost-
sharing or premium amounts to the extent that increased payments are 
claimed from Medicare or a State health care program.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (l) of this section, the terms--
    Contract health care provider means an individual or entity under 
contract with a health plan to furnish items or services to enrollees 
who are covered by the health plan, Medicare, or a State health care 
program.
    Enrollee means an individual who has entered into a contractual 
relationship with a health plan (or on whose behalf an employer, or 
other private or governmental entity has entered into such a 
relationship) under which the individual is entitled to receive 
specified health care items and services, or insurance coverage for such 
items and services, in return for payment of a premium or a fee.
    Health plan means an entity that furnishes or arranges under 
agreement with contract health care providers for the furnishing of 
items or services to enrollees, or furnishes insurance coverage for the 
provision of such items and services, in exchange for a premium or a 
fee, where such entity:
    (i) Operates in accordance with a contract, agreement or statutory 
demonstration authority approved by HCFA or a State health care program;
    (ii) Charges a premium and its premium structure is regulated under 
a State insurance statute or a State enabling statute governing health 
maintenance organizations or preferred provider organizations;
    (iii) Is an employer, if the enrollees of the plan are current or 
retired employees, or is a union welfare fund, if the enrollees of the 
plan are union members; or
    (iv) Is licensed in the State, is under contract with an employer, 
union welfare fund, or a company furnishing health insurance coverage as 
described in conditions (ii) and (iii) of this definition, and is paid a 
fee for the administration of the plan which reflects the fair market 
value of those services.
    (m) Price reductions offered to health plans. (1) As used in section 
1128B of the Act, ``remuneration'' does not include a reduction in price 
a contract health care provider offers to a health plan in accordance 
with the terms of a written agreement between the contract health care 
provider and the health plan for the sole purpose of furnishing to 
enrollees items or services that are covered by the health plan, 
Medicare, or a State health care program, as long as both the health 
plan and contract health care provider comply with all of the applicable 
standards within one of the following four categories of health plans:

[[Page 977]]

    (i) If the health plan is a risk-based health maintenance 
organization, competitive medical plan, or prepaid health plan under 
contract with HCFA or a State agency and operating in accordance with

demonstration authority, or under other Federal statutory or regulatory 
authority, the contract health care provider must not claim payment in 
any form from the Department or the State agency for items or services 
furnished in accordance with the agreement except as approved by HCFA or 
the State health care program, or otherwise shift the burden of such an 
agreement to the extent that increased payments are claimed from 
Medicare or a State health care program.
    (ii) If the health plan is a health maintenance organization, 
competitive medical plan, health care prepayment plan, prepaid health

with HCFA or a State health care program to receive payment for 
enrollees on a reasonable cost or similar basis, the health plan and

services furnished to enrollees; and
    (D) The contract health care provider must not claim payment in any 
form from the Department or the State health care program for items or

    (C) The fee schedule contained in the agreement between the health

    (C) Has been excluded from participation in Medicare or any of the 
State health care programs, and
    (ii) Such a person--
    (A) Has a direct or indirect ownership interest (or any combination 
thereof) of 5 percent or more in the entity;
    (B) Is the owner of a whole or part interest in any mortgage, deed 
of trust, note or other obligation secured (in whole or in part) by the 
entity or any of the property or assets thereof, in which whole or part 
interest is equal to or exceeds 5 percent of the total property and 
assets of the entity;

organized as a corporation;
    (D) Is a partner in the entity, if the entity is organized as a

operations of the entity or part thereof.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term:
    Agent means any person who has express or implied authority to 
obligate or act on behalf of an entity.
    Indirect ownership interest includes an ownership interest through 
any other entities that ultimately have an ownership interest in the 
entity in issue. (For example, an individual has a 10 percent ownership 
interest in the entity at issue if he or she has a 20 percent ownership 
interest in a corporation that wholly owns a subsidiary that is a 50 
percent owner of the entity in issue.)
    Ownership interest means an interest in:
    (i) The capital, the stock or the profits of the entity, or
    (ii) Any mortgage, deed, trust or note, or other obligation secured 
in whole or in part by the property or assets of the entity.
    (b) Length of exclusion. (1) Except as provided in

period as that of the individual whose relationship with the entity is 
the basis for this exclusion, if the individual has been or is being 
excluded.
    (2) If the individual was not excluded, the length of the entity's 
exclusion will be determined by considering the factors that would have 
been considered if the individual had been excluded.
    (3) An entity excluded under this section may apply for 
reinstatement at any time in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 1001.3001(a)(2).

who--
    (1) Has a direct or indirect ownership or control interest in a

    (c) Length of exclusion. (1) If the entity has been excluded, the 
length of the individual's exclusion will be for the same period as that 
of the sanctioned entity with which the individual has the prohibited

exclusion will be determined by considering the factors that would have 
been considered if the entity had been excluded.

reinstatement in accordance with the procedures set forth in

the length of the period in which immediate access was not granted will 
be measured from the time the request is made, or from the time by which 
access was required to be granted, whichever is later.
    (c) The exclusion will be effective as of the date immediate access 
was not granted.

               Subpart D--Waivers and Effect of Exclusion


<R05>
Sec. 1001.1801  Waivers of exclusions.

    (a) The OIG has the authority to grant or deny a request from a 
State health care program that an exclusion from that program be waived 
with respect to an individual or entity, except that no waiver may be 
granted with respect to an exclusion under Sec. 1001.101(b). The request 
must be in writing and from an individual directly responsible for 
administering the State health care program.
    (b) With respect to exclusions under Sec. 1001.101(a), a request 
from a State health care program for a waiver of the exclusion will only 
be considered if the individual or entity is the sole community 
physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a 
community.
    (c) With respect to exclusions imposed under subpart C of this part, 
a request for waiver will only be granted if the OIG determines that 
imposition of the exclusion would not be in the public interest.
    (d) If the basis for the waiver ceases to exist, the waiver will be 
rescinded, and the individual or entity will be excluded for the period 
remaining on the exclusion, measured from the time the exclusion would 
have been imposed if the waiver had not been granted.
    (e) In the event a waiver is granted, it is applicable only to the 
program(s) for which waiver is requested.
    (f) The decision to grant, deny or rescind a request for a waiver is 
not subject to administrative or judicial review.
    (g) The Inspector General may waive the exclusion of an individual 
or entity from participation in the Medicare program in conjunction with 
granting a waiver requested by a State health care program. If a State 
program waiver is rescinded, the derivative waiver of the exclusion from 
Medicare is automatically rescinded.


<R05>
Sec. 1001.1901  Scope and effect of exclusion.

    (a) Scope of exclusion. Exclusions of individuals and entities under 
this title will be from Medicare, State health care programs, and all 
other Executive

[[Page 985]]

Branch procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities. The OIG 
will exclude the individual or entity from the Medicare program and 
direct State agency administering a State health care program to exclude 
the individual or entity for the same period. In the case of an 
individual or entity not eligible to participate in Medicare, the 
exclusion will still be effective on the date, and for the period, 
established by the OIG.
    (b) Effect of exclusion on excluded individuals and entities. (1) 
Unless and until an individual or entity is reinstated into the Medicare 
program in accordance with subpart F of this part, no payment will be 
made by Medicare, Medicaid and all other Federal health care programs 
for any item or service furnished, on or after the effective date 
specified in the notice period, by an excluded individual or entity, or 
at the medical direction or on the prescription of a physician or other 
authorized individual who is excluded when the individual or entity 
furnishing such item or service knew, or had reason to know, of the 
exclusion. This section applies regardless of whether an individual or 
entity has obtained a program provider number or equivalent, either as 
an individual or as a member of a group, prior to being reinstated.
    (2) An excluded individual or entity may not take assignment of an 
enrollee's claim on or after the effective date of exclusion.
    (3) An excluded individual or entity that submits, or causes to be 
submitted, claims for items or services furnished during the exclusion 
period is subject to civil money penalty liability under section 
1128A(a)(1)(D) of the Act, and criminal liability under section 
1128B(a)(3) of the Act and other provisions. In addition, submitting 
claims, or causing claims to be submitted or payments to be made for 
items or services furnished, ordered or prescribed, including 
administrative and management services or salary, may serve as the basis 
for denying reinstatement to the programs.
    (c) Exceptions to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) If an 
enrollee of Part B of Medicare submits an otherwise payable claim for 
items or services furnished by an excluded individual or entity, or 
under the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded 
physician or other authorized individual after the effective date of 
exclusion, HCFA will pay the first claim submitted by the enrollee and 
immediately notify the enrollee of the exclusion.
    (2) HCFA will not pay an enrollee for items or services furnished by 
an excluded individual or entity, or under the medical direction or on 
the prescription of an excluded physician or other authorized individual 
more than 15 days after the date on the notice to the enrollee, or after 
the effective date of the exclusion, whichever is later.
    (3) Unless the Secretary determines that the health and safety of 
beneficiaries receiving services under Medicare or a State health care 
program warrants the exclusion taking effect earlier, payment may be 
made under such program for up to 30 days after the effective date of 
the exclusion for--
    (i) Inpatient institutional services furnished to an individual who 
was admitted to an excluded institution before the date of the 
exclusion,
    (ii) Home health services and hospice care furnished to an 
individual under a plan of care established before the effective date of 
the exclusion, and
    (iii) Any health care items that are ordered by a practitioner, 
provider or supplier from an excluded manufacturer before the effective 
date of the exclusion and delivered within 30 days of the effective date 
of such exclusion. (For the period October 2, 1998, to October 4, 1999, 
payment may be made under Medicare or a State health care program for up 
to 60 days after the effective date of the exclusion for any health care 
items that are ordered by a practitioner, provider or supplier from an 
excluded manufacturer before the effective date of such exclusion and 
delivered within 60 days of the effect of the exclusion.)
    (4) HCFA will not pay any claims submitted by, or for items or 
services ordered or prescribed by, an excluded provider for dates of 
service 15 days or more after the notice of the provider's exclusion was 
mailed to the supplier.
    (5)(i) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, payment 
may be made under Medicare or a State health care program for certain 
emergency

[[Page 986]]

items or services furnished by an excluded individual or entity, or at 
the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded physician or 
other authorized individual during the period of exclusion. To be 
payable, a claim for such emergency items or services must be 
accompanied by a sworn statement of the person furnishing the items or 
services specifying the nature of the emergency and why the items or 
services could not have been furnished by an individual or entity 
eligible to furnish or order such items or services.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, no claim 
for emergency items or services will be payable if such items or 
services were provided by an excluded individual who, through an 
employment, contractual or any other arrangement, routinely provides 
emergency health care items or services.

<R05>
Sec. 1001.2003  Notice of proposal to exclude.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if the OIG 
proposes to exclude an individual or entity in accordance with 
Secs. 1001.901, 1001.951, 1001.1601 or 1001.1701, it will send written 
notice of this decision to the affected individual or entity. The 
written notice will provide the same information set forth in 
Sec. 1001.2002(c). If an entity has a provider agreement under section 
1866 of the Act, and the OIG also proposes to terminate that agreement 
in accordance with section 1866(b)(2)(C) of the Act, the notice will so 
indicate. The exclusion will be effective 60 days after the receipt of 
the notice (as defined in Sec. 1005.2 of this chapter) unless, within 
that period, the individual or entity files a written request for a 
hearing in accordance with part 1005 of this chapter. Such request must 
set forth--
    (1) The specific issues or statements in the notice with which the 
individual or entity disagrees;
    (2) The basis for that disagreement;
    (3) The defenses on which reliance is intended;

[[Page 988]]

    (4) Any reasons why the proposed length of exclusion should be 
modified; and
    (5) Reasons why the health or safety of individuals receiving 
services under Medicare or any of the State health care programs does 
not warrant the exclusion going into effect prior to the completion of 
an administrative law judge (ALJ) proceeding in accordance with part 
1005 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) If the individual or entity does not make a written request 
for a hearing as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the OIG 
will send a notice of exclusion as described in Sec. 1001.2002.
    (2) If the individual or entity makes a timely written request for a 
hearing and the OIG determines that the health or safety of individuals 
receiving services under Medicare or any of the State health care 
programs does not warrant an immediate exclusion, an exclusion will not 
go into effect unless an ALJ upholds the decision to exclude.
    (c) If, prior to issuing a notice of proposal to exclude under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the OIG determines that the health or 
safety of individuals receiving services under Medicare or any of the 
State health care programs warrants the exclusion taking place prior to 
the completion of an ALJ proceeding in accordance with part 1005 of this 
chapter, the OIG will proceed under Secs. 1001.2001 and 1001.2002.

    (2) Submitting claims or causing claims to be submitted or payments 
to be made by the programs for items or services furnished, ordered or 
prescribed, including administrative and management services or salary, 
may serve as the basis for denying reinstatement. This section applies 
regardless of whether an individual or entity has obtained a program

a group, prior to being reinstated.
    (b) In making the reinstatement determination, the OIG will 
consider--
    (1) Conduct of the individual or entity occurring prior to the date 
of the notice of exclusion, if not known to the OIG at the time of the 
exclusion;

complies with, or has made satisfactory arrangements to fulfill, all of 
the applicable conditions of participation or supplier conditions for 
coverage under the statutes and regulations.
    (5) For purposes of individuals or entities excluded under part 1004 
of this chapter only, the individual's or entity's willingness and 
ability to provide health care that meets professionally recognized 
standards.
    (c) If the OIG determines that the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) 
and (iii) of this section have been met, an entity excluded in 
accordance with Sec. 1001.1001 will be reinstated upon a determination 
by the OIG that the individual whose conviction, exclusion or civil 
money penalty was the basis for the entity's exclusion--
    (1) Has reduced his or her ownership or control interest in the 
entity below 5 percent;
    (2) Is no longer an officer, director, agent or managing employee of 
the entity; or
    (3) Has been reinstated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section or Sec. 1001.3005.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1002.1  Scope and purpose.

    The regulations in this part specify certain bases upon which 
individuals and entities may, or in some cases must, be excluded from 
participation in the Medicaid program. These regulations specifically 
address the authority of State agencies to exclude on their own 
initiative, regardless of whether the OIG has excluded an individual or 
entity under part 1001 of this chapter. These regulations also delineate 
the States' obligation to inform the OIG of certain Medicaid-related 
convictions.


<R05>
Sec. 1002.2  General authority.

    (a) In addition to any other authority it may have, a State may 
exclude an individual or entity from participation in the Medicaid 
program for any reason for which the Secretary could exclude that 
individual or entity from participation in the Medicare program under 
sections 1128, 1128A or 1866(b)(2) of the Social Security Act.
    (b) Nothing contained in this part should be construed to limit a 
State's own authority to exclude an individual or entity from Medicaid 
for any reason or period authorized by State law.


<R05>
Sec. 1002.3  Disclosure by providers and State Medicaid agencies.

    (a) Information that must be disclosed. Before the Medicaid agency 
enters into or renews a provider agreement, or at any time upon written 
request by the Medicaid agency, the provider must disclose to the 
Medicaid agency the identity of any person described in 
Sec. 1001.1001(a)(1) of this chapter.

[[Page 993]]

    (b) Notification to Inspector General. (1) The Medicaid agency must 
notify the Inspector General of any disclosures made under paragraph (a) 
of this section within 20 working days from the date it receives the 
information.
    (2) The agency must promptly notify the Inspector General of any 
action it takes on the provider's application for participation in the 
program.
    (3) The agency must also promptly notify the Inspector General of 
any action it takes to limit the ability of an individual or entity to 
participate in its program, regardless of what such an action is called. 
This includes, but is not limited to, suspension actions, settlement 
agreements and situations where an individual or entity voluntarily 
withdraws from the program to avoid a formal sanction.
    (c) Denial or termination of provider participation. (1) The 
Medicaid agency may refuse to enter into or renew an agreement with a 
provider if any person who has ownership or control interest in the 
provider, or who is an agent or managing employee of the provider, has 
been convicted of a criminal offense related to that person's 
involvement in any program established under Medicare, Medicaid or the 
title XX Services program.
    (2) The Medicaid agency may refuse to enter into, or terminate, a 
provider agreement if it determines that the provider did not fully and 
accurately make any disclosure required under paragraph (a) of this 
section.

Sec. 1003.104  Amount of assessment.

    A person subject to a penalty determined under Sec. 1003.102(a) may 
be subject, in addition, to an assessment of not more than twice the

penalty. The assessment is in lieu of damages sustained by the 
Department or a State agency because of that claim.


<R05>
Sec. 1003.105  Exclusion from participation in Medicare and State health care programs.

    (a)(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
following persons may be subject, in lieu of or in addition to any 
penalty or assessment, to an exclusion from participation in Medicare 
for a period of time determined under Sec. 1003.107. The OIG will also 
direct each appropriate State agency to exclude the person from each 
health care program for the same period of time--
    (i) Any person who is subject to a penalty or assessment under 
Sec. 1003.102 (a) or (b)(1) through (b)(4).
    (ii) Any responsible physician who--
    (A) Knowingly violates section 1867 of the Act or Sec. 489.24 of 
this title on or after December 22, 1987, but before July 1, 1990;
    (B) Knowingly and willfully, or negligently, violates section 1867 
of the Act or Sec. 489.24 of this title on or after July 1, 1990 but 
before May 1, 1991; or
    (C) Commits a gross and flagrant, or repeated, violation of section 
1867 of the Act or Sec. 489.24 of this title on or after May 1, 1991. 
For purposes of this section, a gross and flagrant violation is one that 
presents an imminent danger to the health, safety or well-being of the 
individual who seeks emergency examination and treatment or places that 
individual unnecessarily in a high-risk situation.
    (2) Nothing in this section will be construed to limit the 
Department's authority to impose an exclusion without imposing a 
penalty.
    (b)(1) With respect to determinations under Sec. 1003.102 (b)(2) or 
(b)(3), or with respect to violations occurring on or after December 22, 
1987 and before July 1, 1990 under Sec. 1003.105(a)(1)(ii), a physician 
may not be excluded if the OIG determines that he or she is the sole 
community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services 
in a community.
    (2)(i) With respect to any exclusion based on liability for a 
penalty or assessment under Sec. 1003.102 (a), (b)(1), or (b)(4), the 
OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the 
person is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential 
specialized services in a community. With respect to any exclusion 
imposed under Sec. 1003.105(a)(1)(ii), the OIG will consider an 
application from a State agency for a waiver if the physician's 
exclusion from the State health care program would deny beneficiaries 
access to medical care or would otherwise cause hardship to 
beneficiaries.
    (ii) If a waiver is granted, it is applicable only to the State 
health care program for which the State requested the waiver.
    (iii) If the OIG subsequently obtains information that the basis for 
a waiver

[[Page 1003]]

no longer exists, or the State agency submits evidence that the basis 
for the waiver no longer exists, the waiver will cease and the person 
will be excluded from the State health care program for the remainder of 
the period that the person is excluded from Medicare.
    (iv) The OIG notifies the State agency whether its request for a 
waiver has been granted or denied.
    (v) The decision to deny a waiver is not subject to administrative 
or judicial review.
    (3) For purposes of this section, the definitions contained in 
Sec. 1001.2 of this chapter for ``sole community physician'' and ``sole 
source of essential specialized services in a community'' apply.
    (c) When the Inspector General proposes to exclude a nursing 
facility from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, he or she will, at the 
same time he or she notifies the respondent, notify the appropriate 
State licensing authority, the State Office of Aging, the long-term care 
ombudsman, and the State Medicaid agency of the Inspector General's 
intention to exclude the facility.

    (ii) The degree of culpability of the person in failing to provide 
timely and complete malpractice payment data or in improperly 
disclosing, using or permitting access to information;
    (iii) The materiality, or significance of omission, of the 
information to be reported with regard to medical malpractice judgments 
or settlements, or the materiality of the improper disclosure of, or use

deceive members of the public;
    (B) The degree of culpability of the individual, organization or 
entity in the use of the prohibited words, letters, symbols or emblems;
    (C) The frequency and scope of the violation, and whether a specific 
segment of the population was targeted;
    (D) The prior history of the individual, organization or entity in 
its willingness or refusal to comply with informal requests to correct 
violations;
    (E) The history of prior offenses of the individual, organization or 
entity in its misuse of Departmental and program words, letters, symbols 
and emblems;
    (F) The financial condition of the individual, organization or

[[Page 1004]]

    (ii) The use of a disclaimer of affiliation with the United States 
Government, the Department or its programs will not be considered as a 
mitigating factor in determining the amount of penalty in accordance 
with Sec. 1003.102(b)(7).
    (4) In determining the amount of any penalty in accordance with 
Sec. 1003.102(c), the OIG takes into account--
    (i) The degree of culpability of the respondent;
    (ii) The seriousness of the condition of the individual seeking 
emergency medical treatment;
    (iii) The prior history of offenses of the respondent in failing to

    (iii) The seriousness of the adverse effect that resulted or could 
have resulted from the failure to provide required medically necessary 
care;
    (iv) The harm which resulted or could have resulted from the 
provision of care by a person that the contracting organization is 
expressly prohibited, under section 1876(i)(6) or section 1903(p)(2) of 
the Act, from contracting with or employing;
    (v) The harm which resulted or could have resulted from the 
contracting organization's expulsion or refusal to re-enroll a Medicare

furnished by the contracting organization to the Secretary, State, 
enrollee or other entity under section 1876 or section 1903(m) of the 
Act;
    (vii) The extent to which the failure to provide medically necessary 
services could be attributed to a prohibited inducement to reduce or 
limit services under a physician incentive plan and the harm to the 
enrollee which resulted or could have resulted from such failure. It 
would be considered an aggravating factor if the contracting 
organization knowingly or routinely engaged in any prohibited practice 
which acted as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary 
services provided with respect to a specific enrollee in the 
organization;
    (viii) The history of prior offenses by the contracting organization 
or principals of the contracting organization, including whether, at any 
time prior to determination of the current violation or violations, the 
contracting organization or any of its principals were convicted of a 
criminal charge or were held liable for civil or administrative 
sanctions in connection with a program covered by this part or any other 
public or private program of payment for medical services; and
    (ix) Such other matters as justice may require.
    (b) Determining the amount of the penalty or assessment. As 
guidelines for taking into account the factors listed in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, the following circumstances are to be 
considered--
    (1) Nature and circumstances of the incident. It should be 
considered a mitigating circumstance if all the items or services or 
incidents subject to a determination under Sec. 1003.102 included in the 
action brought under this part were of the same type and occurred within 
a short period of time, there were few such items or services or 
incidents, and the total amount claimed or requested for such items or 
services was less than $1,000. It should be considered an aggravating 
circumstance if--
    (i) Such items or services or incidents were of several types, 
occurred over a lengthy period of time;
    (ii) There were many such items or services or incidents (or the 
nature and circumstances indicate a pattern of claims or requests for 
payment for

[[Page 1005]]

such items or services or a pattern of incidents);
    (iii) The amount claimed or requested for such items or services was 
substantial; or
    (iv) The false or misleading information given resulted in harm to 
the patient, a premature discharge or a need for additional services or 
subsequent hospital admission.
    (2) Degree of culpability. It should be considered a mitigating 
circumstance if the claim or request for payment for the item or service 
was the result of an unintentional and unrecognized error in the process 
respondent followed in presenting claims or requesting payment, and 
corrective steps were taken promptly after the error was discovered. It 
should be considered an aggravating circumstance if--
    (i) The respondent knew the item or service was not provided as 
claimed or if the respondent knew that the claim was false or 
fraudulent;
    (ii) The respondent knew that the items or services were furnished 
during a period that he or she had been excluded from participation and 
that no payment could be made as specified in Sec. 1003.102(a)(3) or 
because payment would violate the terms of an assignment or an agreement 
with a State agency or other agreement or limitation on payment under 
Sec. 1003.102(b); or
    (iii) The respondent knew that the information could reasonably be 
expected to influence the decision of when to discharge a patient from a 
hospital.
    (3) Prior offenses. It should be considered an aggravating 
circumstance if at any time prior to the incident or presentation of any 
claim or request for payment which included an item or service subject 
to a determination under Sec. 1003.102, the respondent was held liable 
for criminal, civil or administrative sanctions in connection with a 
program covered by this part or any other public or private program of 
reimbursement for medical services.
    (4) Other wrongful conduct. It should be considered an aggravating 
circumstance if there is proof that a respondent engaged in wrongful 
conduct, other than the specific conduct upon which liability is based, 
relating to government programs or in connection with the delivery of a 
health care item or service. The statute of limitations governing civil 
money penalty proceedings will not apply to proof of other wrongful 
conduct as an aggravating circumstance.
    (5) Financial condition. It should be considered a mitigating 
circumstance if imposition of the penalty or assessment without 
reduction will jeopardize the ability of the respondent to continue as a 
health care provider. In all cases, the resources available to the 
respondent will be considered when determining the amount of the penalty 
and assessment.
    (6) Other matters as justice may require. Other circumstances of an 
aggravating or mitigating nature should be taken into account if, in the 
interests of justice, they require either a reduction of the penalty or 
assessment or an increase in order to assure the achievement of the 
purposes of this part.
    (c) In determining the amount of the penalty and assessment to be 
imposed for every item or service or incident subject to a determination 
under Secs. 1003.102(a) and (b)(1) through (b)(4)--
    (1) If there are substantial or several mitigating circumstances, 
the aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should be set at an 
amount sufficiently below the maximium permitted by Secs. 1003.103(a) 
and 1003.104, to reflect that fact.
    (2) If there are substantial or several aggravating circumstances, 
the aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should be set at an 
amount sufficiently close or at the maximum permitted by 
Secs. 1003.103(a) and 1003.104, to reflect that fact.
    (3) Unless there are extraordinary mitigating circumstances, the 
aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should never be less than 
double the approximate amount of damages and costs (as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section) sustained by the United States, or any 
State, as a result of claims or incidents subject to a determination 
under Secs. 1003.102(a) and (b)(1) through (b)(4).
    (d) In considering the factors listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, for violations subject to a determination

[[Page 1006]]

under Sec. 1003.103(e), the following circumstances are to be 
considered, as appropriate, in determining the amount of any penalty--
    (1) Nature and circumstances of the incident. It would be considered 
a mitigating circumstance if, where more than one violation exists, the 
appropriate items or services not provided were:
    (i) Few in number, or
    (ii) Of the same type and occurred within a short period of time.
    It would be considered an aggravating circumstance if such items or 
services were of several types and occurred over a lengthy period of 
time, or if there were many such items or services (or the nature and 
circumstances indicate a pattern of such items or services not being 
provided).
    (2) Degree of culpability. It would be considered a mitigating 
circumstance if the violation was the result of an unintentional, 
unrecognized error, and corrective action was taken promptly after 
discovery of the error.
    (3) Failure to provide required care. It would be considered an 
aggravating circumstance if the failure to provide required care was 
attributable to an individual or entity that the contracting 
organization is expressly prohibited by law from contracting with or 
employing.
    (4) Use of excluded individuals. It would be considered an 
aggravating factor if the contracting organization knowingly or 
routinely engages in the prohibited practice of contracting or 
employing, either directly or indirectly, individuals or entities 
excluded from the Medicare program under section 1128 or section 1128A 
of the Act.
    (5) Routine practices. It would be considered an aggravating factor 
if the contracting organization knowingly or routinely engages in any 
discriminatory or other prohibited practice which has the effect of 
denying or discouraging enrollment by individuals whose medical 
condition or history indicates a need for substantial future medical 
services.
    (6) Prior offenses. It would be considered an aggravating 
circumstance if at any time prior to determination of the current 
violation or violations, the contracting organization or any of its 
principals was convicted on criminal charges or held liable for civil or 
administrative sanctions in connection with a program covered by this 
part or any other public or private program of payment for medical 
services. The lack of prior liability for criminal, civil, or 
administrative sanctions by the contracting organization, or the 
principals of the contracting organization, would not necessarily be 
considered a mitigating circumstance in determining civil money penalty 
amounts.
    (e)(1) The standards set forth in this section are binding, except 
to the extent that their application would result in imposition of an 
amount that would exceed limits imposed by the United States 
Constitution.
    (2) The amount imposed will not be less than the approximate amount 
required to fully compensate the United States, or any State, for its 
damages and costs, tangible and intangible, including but not limited to 
the costs attributable to the investigation, prosecution and 
administrative review of the case.
    (3) Nothing in this section will limit the authority of the 
Department to settle any issue or case as provided by Sec. 1003.126, or 
to compromise any penalty and assessment as provided by Sec. 1003.128.

sampling in accordance with Sec. 1003.133 in which case the notice shall 
describe those claims and requests for payment comprising the sample 
upon which the Inspector General is relying and will also briefly 
describe the statistical sampling technique utilized by the Inspector

without right of appeal; and
    (7) In the case of a notice sent to a respondent who has an 
agreement under section 1866 of the Act, the notice also indicates that 
the imposition of an exclusion may result in the termination of the 
provider's agreement in accordance with section 1866(b)(2)(C) of the 
Act.

caused to be presented a claim or request for payment falling within the 
scope of Sec. 1003.102 has been rendered in any proceeding in which the 
respondent was a party and had an opportunity to be heard, the 
respondent shall be bound by such determination in any proceeding under

<R05>
Sec. 1003.133  Statistical sampling.

    (a) In meeting the burden of proof set forth in Sec. 1005.15, the 
Inspector General may introduce the results of a statistical sampling 
study as evidence of the number and amount of claims and/or requests for 
payment as described in Sec. 1003.102 that were presented or caused to 
be presented by respondent. Such a statistical sampling study, if based 
upon an appropriate sampling and computed by valid statistical methods, 
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the number and amount of claims 
or requests for payment as described in Sec. 1003.102.
    (b) Once the Inspector General has made a prima facie case as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the burden of production 
shall shift to respondent to produce evidence reasonably calculated to 
rebut the findings of the statistical sampling study. The Inspector 
General will then be given the opportunity to rebut this evidence.

    (g) The PRO may allow the practitioner or other person 5 working 
days after the meeting to provide the PRO additional relevant 
information that may affect its finding; and
    (h) A verbatim record must be made of the meeting and must be made

<R05>
Sec. 1004.60  PRO finding of a violation.

    (a) On the basis of any additional information received, the PRO 
will affirm or modify its finding. If the PRO affirms its finding, it 
may suggest in writing a method for correcting the situation and a time 
period for corrective action. This CAP could correspond with, or be a 
continuation of, a prior CAP or be a new proposal based on additional 
information received by the PRO. If the finding has been resolved to the 
PRO's satisfaction, the PRO may modify its initial finding or 
recommendation or close the case.
    (b) The PRO must give written notice to the practitioner or other 
person of any action it takes as a result of the additional information 
received, as specified in Sec. 1004.70.

which resulted in a recommendation to the OIG that a practitioner or 
other person be sanctioned should practice in a similar geographic area, 
e.g. urban or rural, and at least one member of the panel must be in the 
same medical specialty. Both requirements can be met by a single 
individual. In addition, no one at the PRO who is a participant in such 
a finding may be in direct economic competition with, or have a 
substantial bias for or against, that practitioner or other person being 
recommended for sanction.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.70  PRO action on final finding of a violation.

    (b) Send the affected practitioner or other person a concurrent 
final notice, with a copy of all the material that is being forwarded to 
the OIG, advising that--
    (1) The PRO recommendation has been submitted to the OIG;
    (2) The practitioner or other person has 30 days from receipt of 
this final notice to submit any additional written material or 
documentary evidence to the OIG at its headquarters location. The date 
of receipt is presumed to be 5 days after the date on the notice, unless 
there is a reasonable showing to the contrary; and
    (3) Due to the 120-day statutory requirement specified in 
Sec. 1004.100(e), the period for submitting additional information will 
not be extended and any material received by the OIG after the 30-day 
period will not be considered; and
    (c) Provide notice to the State medical board or to other 
appropriate licensing boards for other practitioner types when it 
submits a report and recommendations to the OIG with respect to a 
physician or other person whom the board is responsible for licensing.

                     Subpart D--OIG Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 1004.100  Acknowledgement and review of report.

    (a) Acknowledgement. The OIG will inform the PRO of the date it 
received the PRO's report and recommendation.
    (b) Review. The OIG will review the PRO report and recommendation to 
determine whether--
    (1) The PRO has followed the regulatory requirements of this part; 
and
    (2) A violation has occurred.
    (c) Rejection of the PRO recommendation. If the OIG decides that a 
sanction is not warranted, it will notify the PRO that recommended the 
sanction, the affected practitioner or other person, and the licensing 
board informed by the PRO of the sanction recommendation that the 
recommendation is rejected.
    (d) Decision to sanction. If the OIG decides that a violation of

    (7) Any other matters relevant to the particular case.
    (e) Exclusion sanction. If the PRO submits a recommendation for 
exclusion to the OIG, and a determination is not made by the 120th day 
after actual receipt by the OIG, the exclusion sanction recommended will 
become effective and the OIG will provide notice in accordance with 
Sec. 1004.110(f).
    (f) Monetary penalty. If the PRO recommendation is to assess a 
monetary penalty, the 120-day provision does not

[[Page 1015]]

apply and the OIG will provide notice in accordance with Sec. 1004.110 
(a)-(e).

[60 FR 63640, Dec. 12, 1995, as amended at 62 FR 23143, Apr. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1004.110  Notice of sanction.

    (a) The OIG must notify the practitioner or other person of the 
adverse determination and of the sanction to be imposed.
    (b) The sanction is effective 20 days from the date of the notice. 
Receipt is presumed to be 5 days after the date on the notice, unless 
there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
    (c) The notice must specify--
    (1) The legal and factual basis for the determination;
    (2) The sanction to be imposed;
    (3) The effective date and, if appropriate, the duration of the 
exclusion;
    (4) The appeal rights of the practitioner or other person;
    (5) The opportunity and the process necessary to provide alternative 
notification as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section; and
    (6) In the case of exclusion, the earliest date on which the OIG 
will accept a request for reinstatement.
    (d) Patient notification. (1)(i) The OIG will provide a sanctioned 
practitioner or other person an opportunity to elect to inform each of 
their patients of the sanction action. In order to elect this option, 
the sanctioned practitioner or other person must, within 30 calendar 
days from receipt of the OIG notice, inform both new and existing 
patients through written notice--based on a suggested (non-mandatory) 
model provided to the sanctioned individual by the OIG--of the sanction 
and, in the case of an exclusion, its effective date. Receipt of the OIG 
notice is presumed to be 5 days after the date of the notice, unless 
there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. Within this same period, 
the practitioner or other person must also sign and return the 
certification that the OIG will provide with the notice. For purposes of 
this section, the term ``all existing patients'' includes all patients 
currently under active treatment with the practitioner or other person, 
as well as all patients who have been treated by the practitioner or 
other person within the last 3 years. In addition, the practitioner or 
other person must notify all prospective patients orally at the time 
such persons request an appointment. If the sanctioned party is a 
hospital, it must notify all physicians who have privileges at the 
hospital, and must post a notice in its emergency room, business office 
and in all affiliated entities regarding the exclusion. In addition, for 
purposes of this section, the term ``in all affiliated entities'' 
encompasses all entities and properties in which the hospital has a 
direct or indirect ownership interest of 5 percent or more and any 
management, partnership or control of the entity.
    (ii) The certification will provide that the practitioner or other 
person--
    (A) Has informed each of his, her or its patients in writing that 
the practitioner or other person has been sanctioned, or if a hospital, 
has informed all physicians having privileges at the hospital that it 
has been sanctioned;
    (B) If excluded from Medicare and the State health care programs, 
has informed his, her or its existing patients in writing that the 
programs will not pay for items and services furnished or ordered (or at 
the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded physician) 
by the practitioner or other person until they are reinstated, or if a 
hospital, has provided this information to all physicians having 
privileges at that hospital;
    (C) If excluded from Medicare and State health care programs, will 
provide prospective patients--or if a hospital, physicians requesting 
privileges at that hospital prior to furnishing or ordering (or in the 
case of an excluded physician, medically directing or prescribing) 
services--oral information of both the sanction and that the programs 
will not pay for services provided and written notification of the same 
at the time of the provision of services;
    (D) If excluded from Medicare and State health care programs and is 
an entity such as a hospital, has posted a notice in its emergency room, 
business office and in all affiliated entities that the programs will 
not pay for services provided; and
    (E) Certifies to the truthfulness and accuracy of the notification 
and the statements in the certification.

[[Page 1016]]

    (2) If the sanctioned practitioner or other person does not inform 
his, her or its patients and does not return the required certification 
within the 30-day period, or if the sanctioned practitioner or other 
person returns the certification within the 30-day period but the OIG 
obtains reliable evidence that such person nevertheless has not 
adequately informed new and existing patients of the sanction, the OIG--
    (i) Will see that the public is notified directly of the identity of 
the sanctioned practitioner or other person, the finding that the 
obligation has been violated, and the effective date of any exclusion; 
and
    (ii) May consider this failure to adhere to the certification 
obligation as an adverse factor at the time the sanctioned practitioner 
or other person requests reinstatement.
    (3) If the sanctioned practitioner or other person is entitled to a 
preliminary hearing in accordance with Sec. 1004.140(a) and requests 
such a preliminary hearing, and if the administrative law judge (ALJ) 
decides that he, she or it poses a risk to program beneficiaries, the 
sanctioned practitioner or other person would have 30 days from the date 
of receipt of the ALJ's decision to provide certification to the OIG in 
accordance with Sec. 1004.110(d)(1). The date of receipt is presumed to 
be 5 days after the date of the ALJ's decision, unless there is a 
reasonable showing to the contrary.
    (e) Notice of the sanction is also provided to the following 
entities as appropriate--
    (1) The PRO that originated the sanction report;
    (2) PROs in adjacent areas;
    (3) State Medicaid fraud control units and State licensing and 
accreditation bodies;
    (4) Appropriate program contractors and State agencies;
    (5) Hospitals, including the hospital where the sanctioned 
individual's case originated and where the individual currently has 
privileges, if known; skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, 
and health maintenance organizations and Federally-funded community 
health centers where the practitioner or other person works;
    (6) Medical societies and other professional organizations; and
    (7) Medicare carriers and fiscal intermediaries, health care 
prepayment plans and other affected agencies and organizations.
    (f) If an exclusion sanction is effectuated because a decision was 
not made within 120 days after receipt of the PRO recommendation, 
notification is as follows--
    (1) As soon as possible after the 120th day, the OIG will issue a 
notice to the practitioner or other person, in compliance with the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, affirming the PRO 
recommendation based on the OIG's review of the case, and that the 
exclusion is effective 20 days from the date of the notice; and
    (2) Notice of sanction is also provided as specified in paragraph 
(e) of this section.

time of reinstatement.


<R04>
                           Subpart F--Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 1004.140  Appeal rights.

    (a) Right to preliminary hearing. (1)(i) A practitioner or other 
person excluded from participation in Medicare and any

[[Page 1017]]

State health care programs under section 1156 of the Act may request a 
preliminary hearing if the location where services are rendered to over 
50 percent of the practitioner's or other person's patients at the time 
of the exclusion notice is in a rural HPSA or in a county with a 
population of less than 70,000.
    (ii) Unless the practitioner's or other person's practice meets the 
definition for psychiatric professional, vision care professional, 
dental professional, podiatric professional or pharmacy professional, 
the HPSA used by the OIG for determination of entitlement to a 
preliminary hearing will be the HPSA list for primary medical care 
professional.
    (iii) Information on the population size of a county in order to 
determine entitlement to a preliminary hearing will be obtained by the 
OIG from the responsible officials of that county.
    (2)(i) A request for a preliminary hearing must be made in writing 
and received by the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) no later than the 
15th day after the notice of exclusion is received by a practitioner or 
other person. The date of receipt of the notice of exclusion by the 
practitioner or other person is presumed to be 5 days after the date 
appearing on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the 
contrary.
    (ii) A request for a preliminary hearing will stay the effective 
date of the exclusion pending a decision of the ALJ at the preliminary 
hearing, and all the parties informed by the OIG of the exclusion will 
be notified of the stay.
    (iii) A request for a preliminary hearing received after the 15-day 
period has expired will be treated as a request for a hearing before an 
ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (iv) If the practitioner or other person exercises his, her or its 
right to a preliminary hearing, such a hearing must be held by the ALJ 
in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section unless the OIG 
waives it in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.
    (v) The ALJ cannot consolidate the preliminary hearing with a full 
hearing without the approval of all parties to the hearing.
    (3)(i) The preliminary hearing will be conducted by an ALJ of the 
DAB in a city that the ALJ deems equitable to all parties. The ALJ will 
conduct the preliminary hearing and render a decision no later than 45 
days after receipt of the request for such a hearing by the DAB. Unless 
there is a reasonable showing to the contrary, date of receipt by the 
DAB is presumed to be 5 days after the date on the request for a 
preliminary hearing or, if undated, the date of receipt will be the date 
the DAB actually received the request. A reasonable extension to the 45-
day period of up to 15 days may be requested by any party to the 
preliminary hearing and such a request may be granted upon concurrence 
by all parties to the preliminary hearing. Such request must be received 
no later than 15 days prior to the scheduled date of the preliminary 
hearing.
    (ii) The only issue to be heard and decided on by the ALJ at the 
preliminary hearing, based on the preponderance of the evidence, is 
whether the practitioner's or other person's continued participation in 
the Medicare and State health care programs during the appeal of the 
exclusion before an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious 
risk. The ALJ's decision is to be based on the preponderance of the 
evidence.
    (iii) In the interest of time, the ALJ may issue an oral decision to 
be followed by a written decision.
    (iv) In those cases where the ALJ has stayed an exclusion after a 
preliminary hearing, a full hearing must be held and a decision rendered 
by the ALJ within 6 months. If, for any reason, the request for a full 
hearing before the ALJ is withdrawn or dismissed, the practitioner or 
other person will be excluded effective 5 days after the notice of the 
withdrawal or dismissal is received in the OIG headquarters.
    (4) The preliminary hearing decision is not appealable or subject to 
further administrative or judicial review.
    (5) A practitioner or other person found at the preliminary hearing 
not to place program beneficiaries at serious risk, but later determined 
to have been properly excluded from program participation after a full 
hearing before an ALJ, is not entitled to have the exclusion stayed 
further during an appeal

[[Page 1018]]

to the DAB. Exclusions in such instances will be effective 5 days after 
receipt of the ALJ decision in the OIG headquarters.
    (6)(i) After notice of a timely request for a preliminary hearing, 
the OIG may determine that the practitioner's or other person's 
continued program participation during the appeal before the ALJ will 
not place program beneficiaries at serious risk and waive the 
preliminary hearing. Under these circumstances, the exclusion will be 
stayed pending the decision of the ALJ after a full hearing. the hearing 
must be held, and a decision reached, within 6 months.
    (ii) If the OIG decides to waive the preliminary hearing, the 
request for the preliminary hearing will be considered a request for a 
hearing before the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Right to administrative review. (1) A practitioner or other 
person dissatisfied with an OIG determination, or an exclusion that 
results from a determination not being made within 120 days, is entitled 
to appeal such sanction in accordance with part 1005 of this chapter.
    (2) Due to the 120-day statutory requirement specified in 
Sec. 1004.100(e), the following limitations apply--
    (i) The period of time for submitting additional information will 
not be extended.
    (ii) Any material received by the OIG after the 30-day period 
allowed will not be considered by the ALJ or the DAB.
    (3) The OIG's determination continues in effect unless reversed by a 
hearing.
    (c) Rights to judicial review. Any practitioner or other person 
dissatisfied with a final decision of the Secretary may file a civil 
action in accordance with the provisions of section 205(g) of the Act.

the issues before the ALJ.
    (b) For the purpose of this section, the term documents includes 
information, reports, answers, records, accounts, papers and other data

    (c) Requests for documents, requests for admissions, written 
interrogatories, depositions and any forms of discovery, other than

<R05>
Sec. 1005.8  Exchange of witness lists, witness statements and exhibits.

    (a) At least 15 days before the hearing, the ALJ will order the 
parties to exchange witness lists, copies of prior written statements of 
proposed witnesses and copies of proposed hearing exhibits, including 
copies of any written statements that the party intends to offer in lieu 
of live testimony in accordance with Sec. 1005.16.
    (b) (1) If at any time a party objects to the proposed admission of 
evidence not exchanged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, 
the ALJ will determine whether the failure to comply with paragraph (a) 
of this section should result in the exclusion of such evidence.
    (2) Unless the ALJ finds that extraordinary circumstances justified 
the failure to timely exchange the information listed under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the ALJ must exclude from the party's case-in-
chief:
    (i) The testimony of any witness whose name does not appear on the 
witness list, and
    (ii) Any exhibit not provided to the opposing party as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) If the ALJ finds that extraordinary circumstances existed, the 
ALJ must then determine whether the admission of such evidence would 
cause substantial prejudice to the objecting party. If the ALJ finds 
that there is no substantial prejudice, the evidence may be admitted. If 
the ALJ finds that there is substantial prejudice, the ALJ may exclude 
the evidence, or at his or her discretion, may postpone the hearing for 
such time as is necessary for the objecting party to prepare and respond 
to the evidence.
    (c) Unless another party objects within a reasonable period of time 
prior to the hearing, documents exchanged in accordance with paragraph 
(a) of this section will be deemed to be authentic for the purpose of 
admissibility at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1005.9  Subpoenas for attendance at hearing.

    (a) A party wishing to procure the appearance and testimony of any 
individual at the hearing may make a motion requesting the ALJ to issue

comply by designating any of its representatives to appear and testify.
    (d) A party seeking a subpoena will file a written motion not less 
than 30 days before the date fixed for the hearing, unless otherwise 
allowed by the ALJ for good cause shown. Such request will:

    (2) Designate the witnesses, and
    (3) Describe the address and location with sufficient particularity 
to permit such witnesses to be found.
    (e) The subpoena will specify the time and place at which the

party seeking the subpoena will serve it by delivery to the individual 
named, or by certified mail addressed to such individual at his or her 
last dwelling place or principal place of business.

the ALJ a motion to quash the subpoena within 10 days after service.
    (i) The exclusive remedy for contumacy by, or refusal to obey a

Sec. 1005.10  Fees.

    The party requesting a subpoena will pay the cost of the fees and 
mileage of any witness subpoenaed in the amounts that would be payable 
to a witness in a proceeding in United States District Court. A check

<R05>
Sec. 1005.12  Computation of time.

    (a) In computing any period of time under this part or in an order 
issued thereunder, the time begins with the day following the act, event

Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday observed by the Federal Government, in 
which event it includes the next business day.
    (b) When the period of time allowed is less than 7 days,

and the facts alleged, and will be filed with the ALJ and served on all

time as may be fixed by the ALJ, any party may file a response to such 
motion.
    (d) The ALJ may not grant a written motion before the time for

outstanding motions prior to the beginning of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1005.14  Sanctions.

    (a) The ALJ may sanction a person, including any party or attorney, 
for failing to comply with an order or procedure, for failing to defend 
an action or for other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, 
orderly or fair conduct of the hearing. Such sanctions will reasonably 
relate to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct. Such 
sanction may include--
    (1) In the case of refusal to provide or permit discovery under the

otherwise supporting a particular claim or defense;
    (3) Striking pleadings, in whole or in part;

the Act or under any provision which incorporates section 1128A(c)(4) of 
the Act, the ALJ may also order the party or attorney who has engaged in

Secs. 1001.701, 1001.901 and 1001.951 of this chapter--
    (1) The respondent bears the burden of going forward and the burden 
of persuasion with respect to affirmative defenses and any mitigating 
circumstances; and
    (2) The IG bears the burden of going forward and the burden of

additional items and information, including aggravating or mitigating 
circumstances that arose or became known subsequent to the issuance of

Sec. 1005.16  Witnesses.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony 
at the hearing will be given orally by witnesses under oath or 
affirmation.
    (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony (other than expert 
testimony) may be admitted in the form of a written statement. Any such 
written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the 
last known address of such witness, in a manner that allows sufficient 
time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at 
the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify 
at the hearing will be exchanged as provided in Sec. 1005.8.

[[Page 1024]]

    (c) The ALJ will exercise reasonable control over the mode and order 
of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:
    (1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the 
ascertainment of the truth,
    (2) Avoid repetition or needless consumption of time, and
    (3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
    (d) The ALJ will permit the parties to conduct such cross-
examination of witnesses as may be required for a full and true 
disclosure of the facts.
    (e) The ALJ may order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear 
the testimony of other witnesses. This does not authorize exclusion of--
    (1) A party who is an individual;
    (2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or 
employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated as 
the party's representative; or
    (3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential 
to the presentation of its case, including an individual engaged in 
assisting the attorney for the IG.


<R05>
Sec. 1005.17  Evidence.

    (a) The ALJ will determine the admissibility of evidence.
    (b) Except as provided in this part, the ALJ will not be bound by 
the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the ALJ may apply the Federal 
Rules of Evidence where appropriate, for example, to exclude unreliable 
evidence.
    (c) The ALJ must exclude irrelevant or immaterial evidence.
    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative 
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, 
confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence.
    (e) Although relevant, evidence must be excluded if it is privileged 
under Federal law.
    (f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement made in 
this action will be inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of 
the Federal Rules of Evidence.
    (g) Evidence of crimes, wrongs or acts other than those at issue in 
the instant case is admissible in order to show motive, opportunity, 
intent, knowledge, preparation, identity, lack of mistake, or existence 
of a scheme. Such evidence is admissible regardless of whether the 
crimes, wrongs or acts occurred during the statute of limitations period 
applicable to the acts which constitute the basis for liability in the 
case, and regardless of whether they were referenced in the IG's notice 
sent in accordance with Secs. 1001.2002, 1001.2003 or 1003.109.
    (h) The ALJ will permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses 
and evidence.
    (i) All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record 
will be open to examination by all parties, unless otherwise ordered by 
the ALJ for good cause shown.
    (j) The ALJ may not consider evidence regarding the issue of 
willingness and ability to enter into and successfully complete a 
corrective action plan when such evidence pertains to matters occurring 
after the submittal of the case to the Secretary. The determination 
regarding the appropriateness of any corrective action plan is not 
reviewable.


<R05>
Sec. 1005.18  The record.

    (a) The hearing will be recorded and transcribed. Transcripts may be 
obtained following the hearing from the ALJ.
    (b) The transcript of testimony, exhibits and other evidence 
admitted at the hearing, and all papers and requests filed in the

reasonable fee) by any person, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ for 
good cause shown.
    (d) For good cause, the ALJ may order appropriate redactions made to 
the record.


<R05>
Sec. 1005.19  Post-hearing briefs.

    The ALJ may require the parties to file post-hearing briefs. In any 
event, any party may file a post-hearing brief. The ALJ will fix the 
time for filing such briefs which are not to exceed 60 days from the

<R05>
Sec. 1005.20  Initial decision.

    (a) The ALJ will issue an initial decision, based only on the 
record, which will contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.
    (b) The ALJ may affirm, increase or reduce the penalties, assessment 
or exclusion proposed or imposed by the IG, or reverse the imposition of 
the exclusion. In exclusion cases where the period of exclusion 
commenced prior to the hearing, any period of exclusion imposed by the 
ALJ will be deemed to commence on the date such exclusion originally 
went into effect.
    (c) The ALJ will issue the initial decision to all parties within 60 
days after the time for submission of post-hearing briefs and reply 
briefs, if permitted, has expired. The decision will be accompanied by a 
statement describing the right of any party to file a notice of appeal 
with the DAB and instructions for how to file such appeal. If the ALJ 
fails to meet the deadline contained in this paragraph, he or she will 
notify the parties of the reason for the delay and will set a new 
deadline.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, unless the 
initial decision is appealed to the DAB, it will be final and binding on 
the parties 30 days after the ALJ serves the parties with a copy of the 
decision. If service is by mail, the date of service will be deemed to 
be 5 days from the date of mailing.
    (e) If an extension of time within which to appeal the initial 
decision is granted under Sec. 1005.21(a), except as provided in 
Sec. 1005.22(a), the initial decision will become final and binding on 
the day following the end of the extension period.


<R05>
Sec. 1005.21  Appeal to DAB.

    (a) Any party may appeal the initial decision of the ALJ to the DAB 
by filing a notice of appeal with the DAB within 30 days of the date of 
service of the initial decision. The DAB may extend the initial 30 day 
period for a period of time not to exceed 30 days if a party files with 
the DAB a request for an extension within the initial 30 day period and 
shows good cause.
    (b) If a party files a timely notice of appeal with the DAB, the ALJ 
will forward the record of the proceeding to the DAB.
    (c) A notice of appeal will be accompanied by a written brief 
specifying exceptions to the initial decision and reasons supporting the 
exceptions. Any party may file a brief in opposition to exceptions, 
which may raise any relevant issue not addressed in the exceptions, 
within 30 days of receiving the notice of appeal and accompanying brief. 
The DAB may permit the parties to file reply briefs.
    (d) There is no right to appear personally before the DAB, or to 
appeal to the DAB any interlocutory ruling by the ALJ.
    (e) The DAB will not consider any issue not raised in the parties' 
briefs, nor any issue in the briefs that could have been raised before 
the ALJ but was not.
    (f) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the DAB that 
additional evidence not presented at such hearing is relevant and 
material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to 
adduce such evidence at such hearing, the DAB may remand the matter to 
the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence.
    (g) The DAB may decline to review the case, or may affirm, increase, 
reduce, reverse or remand any penalty, assessment or exclusion 
determined by the ALJ.
    (h) The standard of review on a disputed issue of fact is whether 
the initial decision is supported by substantial evidence on the whole 
record. The standard of review on a disputed issue of law is whether the 
initial decision is erroneous.
    (i) Within 60 days after the time for submission of briefs and reply 
briefs, if permitted, has expired, the DAB will issue to each party to 
the appeal a copy of the DAB's decision and a statement describing the 
right of any petitioner or respondent who is found liable to seek 
judicial review.
    (j) Except with respect to any penalty, assessment or exclusion 
remanded

Sec. 1005.22  Stay of initial decision.

    (a) In a CMP case under section 1128A of the Act, the filing of a 
respondent's request for review by the DAB will automatically stay the 
effective date of the ALJ's decision.
    (b) (1) After the DAB renders a decision in a CMP case, pending 
judicial review, the respondent may file a request for stay of the 
effective date of any penalty or assessment with the ALJ. The request 
must be accompanied by a copy of the notice of appeal filed with the 
Federal court. The filing of such a request will automatically act to 
stay the effective date of the penalty or assessment until such time as 
the ALJ rules upon the request.
    (2) The ALJ may not grant a respondent's request for stay of any 
penalty or assessment unless the respondent posts a bond or provides 
other adequate security.

days of receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 1005.23  Harmless error.

no error or defect in any ruling or order or in any act done or omitted 
by the ALJ or by any of the parties, including Federal representatives 
such as Medicare carriers and intermediaries and Peer Review 
Organizations, is ground for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing 
an otherwise appropriate ruling or order or act, unless refusal to take 
such action appears to the ALJ or the DAB inconsistent with substantial 
justice. The ALJ and the DAB at every stage of the proceeding will 
disregard any error or defect in the proceeding that does not affect the 
substantial rights of the parties.

Sec. 1007.3  Scope and purpose.

    This part implements sections 1903(a)(6), 1903(b)(3), and 1903(q) of 
the Social Security Act, as amended by the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud 
and Abuse Amendments (Pub. L. 95-142). The statute authorizes the 
Secretary to pay a State 90 percent of the costs of establishing and 
operating a State Medicaid fraud control unit, as defined by the 
statute, for the purpose of eliminating fraud in the State Medicaid 
program.

[[Page 1029]]


<R05>
Sec. 1007.5  Basic requirement.

    A State Medicaid fraud control unit must be a single identifiable 
entity of the State government certified by the Secretary as meeting the 
requirements of Secs. 1007.7 through 1007.13 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.7  Organization and location requirements.

    Any of the following three alternatives is acceptable:
    (a) The unit is located in the office of the State Attorney General 
or another department of State government which has Statewide authority 
to prosecute individuals for violations of criminal laws with respect to 
fraud in the provision or administration of medical assistance under a 
State plan implementing title XIX of the Act;
    (b) If there is no State agency with Statewide authority and 
capability for criminal fraud prosecutions, the unit has established 
formal procedures that assure that the unit refers suspected cases of 
criminal fraud in the State Medicaid program to the appropriate State 
prosecuting authority or authorities, and provides assistance and 
coordination to such authority or authorities in the prosecution of such 
cases; or
    (c) The unit has a formal working relationship with the office of 
the State Attorney General and has formal procedures for referring to 
the Attorney General suspected criminal violations occurring in the 
State Medicaid program and for effective coordination of the activities 
of both entities relating to the detection, investigation and 
prosecution of those violations. Under this requirement, the office of 
the State Attorney General must agree to assume responsibility for 
prosecuting alleged criminal violations referred to it by the unit. 
However, if the Attorney General finds that another prosecuting 
authority has the demonstrated capacity, experience and willingness to 
prosecute an alleged violation, he or she may refer a case to that 
prosecuting authority, as long as the Attorney General's Office 
maintains oversight responsibility for the prosecution and for 
coordination between the unit and the prosecuting authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.9  Relationship to, and agreement with, the Medicaid agency.

    (a) The unit must be separate and distinct from the Medicaid agency.
    (b) No official of the Medicaid agency will have authority to review 
the activities of the unit or to review or overrule the referral of a 
suspected criminal violation to an appropriate prosecuting authority.
    (c) The unit will not receive funds paid under this part either from 
or through the Medicaid agency.
    (d) The unit will enter into an agreement with the Medicaid agency 
under which the Medicaid agency will agree to comply with all 
requirements of Sec. 455.21(a)(2) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.11  Duties and responsibilities of the unit.

    (a) The unit will conduct a Statewide program for investigating and 
prosecuting (or referring for prosecution) violations of all applicable 
State laws pertaining to fraud in the administration of the Medicaid 
program, the provision of medical assistance, or the activities of 
providers of medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan.
    (b) (1) The unit will also review complaints alleging abuse or 
neglect of patients in health care facilities receiving payments under 
the State Medicaid plan and may review complaints of the 
misappropriation of patient's private funds in such facilities.
    (2) If the initial review indicates substantial potential for 
criminal prosecution, the unit will investigate the complaint or refer 
it to an appropriate criminal investigative or prosecutive authority.
    (3) If the initial review does not indicate a substantial potential 
for criminal prosecution, the unit will refer the complaint to an 
appropriate State agency.
    (c) If the unit, in carrying out its duties and responsibilities 
under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, discovers that 
overpayments have been made to a health care facility or other provider 
of medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan, the unit will 
either attempt to collect such overpayment or refer the matter to an 
appropriate State agency for collection.

[[Page 1030]]

    (d) Where a prosecuting authority other than the unit is to assume 
responsibility for the prosecution of a case investigated by the unit, 
the unit will insure that those responsible for the prosecutive decision 
and the preparation of the case for trial have the fullest possible 
opportunity to participate in the investigation from its inception and 
will provide all necessary assistance to the prosecuting authority 
throughout all resulting prosecutions.
    (e) The unit will make available to Federal investigators or 
prosecutors all information in its possession concerning fraud in the 
provision or administration of medical assistance under the State plan 
and will cooperate with such officials in coordinating any Federal and 
State investigations or prosecutions involving the same suspects or 
allegations.
    (f) The unit will safeguard the privacy rights of all individuals 
and will provide safeguards to prevent the misuse of information under 
the unit's control.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.13  Staffing requirements.

    (a) The unit will employ sufficient professional, administrative, 
and support staff to carry out its duties and responsibilities in an 
effective and efficient manner. The staff must include:
    (1) One or more attorneys experienced in the investigation or 
prosecution of civil fraud or criminal cases, who are capable of giving 
informed advice on applicable law and procedures and providing effective 
prosecution or liaison with other prosecutors;
    (2) One or more experienced auditors capable of supervising the 
review of financial records and advising or assisting in the 
investigation of alleged fraud; and
    (3) A senior investigator with substantial experience in commercial 
or financial investigations who is capable of supervising and directing 
the investigative activities of the unit.
    (b) The unit will employ, or have available to it, professional 
staff who are knowledgeable about the provision of medical assistance 
under title XIX and about the operation of health care providers.

other reviews or information he or she deems necessary or warranted, and 
will promptly notify the unit whether he or she has approved the 
reapplication and recertified the unit.
    (2) In reviewing the reapplication, the Secretary will give special

undertaking, or plans to undertake.
    (b) Requests presenting a general question of interpretation, posing 
a hypothetical situation, or regarding the activities of third parties

    (1) The request is not related to a named individual or entity;
    (2) The same, or substantially the same, course of action is under 
investigation, or is or has been the subject of a proceeding involving 
the Department of Health and Human Services or another governmental

obtained from the OIG. Requests should be made in writing, specify the 
subject matter, and be sent to the headquarter offices of the OIG.
    (c) When submitting a request for an advisory opinion, a requestor 
may answer the questions corresponding to the subject matter for which

<R04>
                    Subpart C--Advisory Opinion Fees


<R05>
Sec. 1008.31  OIG fees for the cost of advisory opinions.

    (a) Responsibility for fees. The requestor is responsible for paying 
a fee equal to the costs incurred by the Department in responding to the 
request for an advisory opinion.
    (b) Initial payment. A request for an advisory opinion must be 
accompanied by a check or money order payable to the Treasury of the 
United States for $250. This initial payment is non-refundable.
    (c) Calculation of costs: Prior to the issuance of the advisory 
opinion, the OIG will calculate the costs incurred by the Department in 
responding to the request. The calculation will include the costs of 
salaries and benefits payable to attorneys and others who

[[Page 1035]]

have worked on the request in question, as well as administrative and 
supervisory support for such person. The OIG has the exclusive authority 
to determine the cost of responding to a request for an advisory opinion 
and such determination is not reviewable or waiveable.
    (d) Agreement to pay all costs. (1) By submitting the request for an 
advisory opinion, the requestor agrees, except as indicated in paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section, to pay all costs incurred by the OIG in 
responding to the request for an advisory opinion.
    (2) In its request for an advisory opinion, the requestor may 
request a written estimate of the cost involved in processing the 
advisory opinion. Within 10 business days of receipt of the request, the 
OIG will notify in writing of such estimate. Such estimate will not be 
binding on the Department, and the actual cost to be paid may be higher 
or lower than estimated. The time period for issuing the advisory 
opinion will be tolled from the time the OIG notifies the requestor of 
the estimate until the OIG receives written confirmation from the 
requestor that the requestor wants the OIG to continue processing the 
request. Such notice may include a new or revised triggering dollar 
amount, as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (3) In its request for an advisory opinion, the requestor may 
designate a triggering dollar amount. If the OIG estimates that the 
costs of processing the advisory opinion request have reached, or are 
likely to exceed, the designated triggering dollar amount, the OIG will 
notify the requestor. The requestor may revise its designated triggering 
dollar amount in writing in its response to notification of a cost 
estimate in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (4) If the OIG notifies the requestor that the estimated cost of 
processing the request has reached or is likely to exceed the triggering 
dollar amount, the OIG will stop processing the request until such time 
as the requestor makes a written request for the OIG to continue 
processing the request. Any delay in the processing of the request for 
an advisory opinion attributable to these procedures will toll the time 
for issuance of an advisory opinion until the requestor asks the OIG to 
continue working on the request.
    (5) If the requestor chooses not to pay for completion of an 
advisory opinion, or withdraws the request, the requestor is still 
obligated to pay for all costs incurred and identified by the OIG 
attributable to processing the request for an advisory opinion up to 
that point.
    (6) If the costs incurred by the OIG in responding to the request 
are greater than the amount paid by the requestor, the OIG will, prior 
to the issuance of the advisory opinion, notify the requestor of any 
additional amount due. The OIG will not issue an advisory opinion until 
the full amount owed by the requestor has been paid. Once the requestor 
has paid the OIG the total amount due for the costs of processing the 
request, the OIG will issue the advisory opinion. The time period for 
issuing advisory opinions will be tolled from the time the OIG notifies 
the requestor of the amount owed until the time full payment is 
received.
    (e) Fees for outside experts. (1) In addition to the fees identified 
in this section, the requestor also must pay any required fees for 
expert opinions, if any, from outside sources, as described in 
Sec. 1008.33.
    (2) If the OIG determines that it is necessary to obtain expert 
advice to issue a requested advisory opinion, the OIG will notify the 
requestor of that fact and provide the identity of the appropriate 
expert and an estimate of the costs of the expert advice.

[62 FR 7357, Feb. 19, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 38324, July 16, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1008.33  Expert opinions from outside sources.

    (a) The OIG may request expert advice from qualified sources on non-
legal issues if necessary to respond to the advisory opinion request. 
For example, the OIG may require the use of appropriate medical 
reviewers, such as peer review organizations, to obtain medical opinions 
on specific issues.
    (b) The time period for issuing an advisory opinion will be tolled 
from the time that the OIG notifies the requestor of the need for an 
outside expert

[[Page 1036]]

opinion until the time the OIG receives the necessary expert opinion.
    (c) Once payment is made for the cost of the expert opinion, as set 
forth in Sec. 1008.31(e) of this part, either directly to the expert or 
otherwise, the OIG will arrange for a prompt expert review of the issue 
or issues in question. Regardless of the manner of payment, the expert's 
work and opinion will be subject to the sole direction of the OIG.

amended, altered, or limited, and that the advisory opinion continues in

<R05>
Sec. 1008.51  Exclusivity of OIG advisory opinions.

    The only method for obtaining a binding advisory opinion regarding 
any of the subject matters set forth in Sec. 1008.5(a) is through the 
procedures described in this part. No binding advisory opinion, oral or 
written, has or may be issued by the OIG regarding the specific matters 
set forth in Sec. 1008.5(a) except through written opinions issued in 
accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1008.53  Affected parties.

    An advisory opinion issued by the OIG will have no application to 
any individual or entity that does not join in the request for the 
opinion. No individual or entity other than the requestor(s) may rely on 
an advisory opinion.


<R05>
Sec. 1008.55  Admissibility of evidence.

    (a) The failure of a party to seek an advisory opinion may not be 
introduced into evidence to prove that the party intended to violate the 
provisions of sections 1128, 1128A or 1128B of the Act.
    (b) An advisory opinion may not be introduced into evidence by a 
person or entity that was not the requestor of the advisory opinion to 
prove that the person or entity did not violate the

[[Page 1040]]

provisions of sections 1128, 1128A or 1128B of the Act or any other law.

<R05>
Sec. 1008.59  Range of the advisory opinion.

    (a) An advisory opinion will state only the OIG's opinion regarding 
the subject matter of the request. If the arrangement for which an 
advisory opinion is requested is subject to approval or regulation by 
any other Federal, State or local government agency, such advisory 
opinion may not be taken to indicate the OIG's views on the legal or 
factual issues that may be raised before that agency. The OIG will not 
provide any legal opinion on questions or issues regarding an authority 
which is vested in other Federal, State or local government agencies.
    (b) An advisory opinion issued under this part will not bind or 
obligate any agency other than the Department. It will not affect the 
requestor's, or anyone else's, obligations to any other agency, or under 
any statutory or regulatory provision other than that which is the 
specific subject matter of the advisory opinion.
