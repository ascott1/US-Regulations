# US Government Federal Regulations

This repository contains all of the United States federal regulations as plain text files. The files have been made available through the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) beginning in 1996. Each year, all new rules created through the rulemaking process are compiled into the regulations. 

The goal of this repository is to both make the text of federal regulations more easily accessible to developers as well as provide a glimpse into how the regulations have evolved over time. Beginning in 1996, each year of regulations is a git commit. This allows us to see additions and subtractions to the regulations over time.

This was done with the aid of my [Reg-Crawler](https://github.com/ascott1/reg-crawler) script.

## What is a regulation?

From [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Reference-Shelf/Laws.shtml)

Regulations are issued by federal agencies, boards, or commissions. They explain how the agency intends to carry out a law.

### The Rulemaking Process

Federal regulations are created through a process known as rulemaking.
By law, federal agencies must consult the public when creating, modifying, or deleting rules in the Code of Federal Regulations. This is an annual publication that lists the official and complete text of federal agency regulations.

Once an agency decides that a regulation needs to be added, changed, or deleted, it typically publishes a proposed rule in the Federal Register to ask the public for comments.

After the agency considers public feedback and makes changes where appropriate, it then publishes a final rule in the Federal Register with a specific date for when the rule will become effective and enforceable.
When the agency issues a final rule for comment, it must describe and respond to the public comments it received.
