              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2012), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 8.1  Policy.

    (a) Pursuant to chapter 15 of title 44, United States Code, the 
Director of the Federal Register shall publish periodically a special 
edition of the Federal Register to present a compact and practical code 
called the ``Code of Federal Regulations'', to contain each Federal 
regulation of general applicability and legal effect.

be used to keep the Code as current and readily usable as possible, 
within limitations imposed by dependability and reasonable costs.

<R05>
Sec. 8.2  Orderly development.

    To assure orderly development of the Code of Federal Regulations 
along practical lines, the Director of the Federal Register may 
establish new titles in the Code and rearrange existing titles and 
subordinate assignments. However, before taking an action under this 
section, the Director shall consult with each agency directly affected 
by the proposed change.


<R05>
Sec. 8.3  Periodic updating.

    (a) Criteria. Each book of the Code shall be updated at least once 
each calendar year. If no change in its contents has occurred during the 
year, a simple notation to that effect may serve as the supplement for 
that year. More frequent updating of any unit of the Code may be made 
whenever the Director of the Federal Register determines that the 
content of the unit has been substantially superseded or otherwise 
determines that such action would be consistent with the intent and 
purpose of the Administrative Committee as stated in Sec. 8.1.
    (b) Staggered publication. The Code will be produced over a 12-month 
period under a staggered publication system to be determined by the 
Director of the Federal Register.
    (c) Cutoff dates. Each updated title of the Code will reflect each 
amendment to that title published as a codified regulation in the 
Federal Register on or before the ``As of'' date. Thus, each title 
updated as of July 1 each year will reflect all amendatory documents 
appearing in the daily Federal Register on or before July 1.

chapter shall be assigned to the regular schedule. Unless the issuing 
agency makes special arrangements otherwise, or the Office determines 
that the document requires a deferred schedule (see 1 CFR 17.7), receipt 
of a document by 2:00 p.m. is considered to be a request for filing for 
public inspection and publication on the regular schedule. Documents 
received after 2:00 p.m. which meet the requirements of this chapter 
shall be assigned to the next working day's regular schedule.
    (c) The regular schedule for filing for public inspection and

control, or relief of an emergency situation.

<R05>
Sec. 17.5  Criteria for emergency filing for public inspection.

    An agency may request emergency filing for public inspection for 
documents to be published under the regular, emergency or deferred 
publication schedules. Emergency filing for public inspection provides 
for the fastest possible public access to a document after it has been 
received, processed and assigned a publication date. Emergency filing 
for public inspection is considered a special arrangement under Sec. 
17.2 of this part that results in deviation from the regular schedule 
for filing for public inspection. A document receiving emergency filing 
for public inspection remains on public inspection until it is published 
according to the schedule for publication.

    (a) Each document submitted for publication in the Federal Register 
that includes an effective date or time period should either set forth a

period measured by a certain number of days after publication, Office of 
the Federal Register staff will compute the date to be inserted in the 
document as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Dates certain will be computed by counting the day after the 
publication day as one, and by counting each succeeding day, including 
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. However, where the final count would 
fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the date certain will be the 
next succeeding Federal business day.
    (c) In the event an effective date is dependent upon Congressional 
action, or an act of Congress or a dispositive Federal court decision 
establishes or

[[Page 25]]

changes the effective date of an agency's regulation, the issuing agency 
shall promptly publish a document in the Federal Register announcing the

liaison with the Office on matters relating to The United States 
Government Manual:
    (1) Agencies of the legislative and judicial branches.
    (2) Executive agencies that do not have a liaison officer designated

officer for Manual matters other than the one designated under such 
Sec. 16.1.
    (3) Quasi-official agencies represented in the Manual.
    (4) Any other agency that the Director believes should be included

FR 9682, Mar. 7, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 20.2  Preparation of agency statements.

    In accordance with schedules established under Sec. 20.7 each 
agency shall submit for publication in the Manual an official draft of 
the information required by Sec. 9.2 of this chapter and this part 20.


<R05>
Sec. 20.3  Organization.

    (a) Information about lines of authority and organization may be 
reflected in a chart if the chart clearly delineates the agency's 
organizational structure. Charts must be prepared so as to be perfectly 
legible when reduced to the size of a Manual page. Charts that do not 
meet this requirement will not be included in the Manual.
    (b) Listings of heads of operating units should be arranged whenever 
possible to reflect relationships between units.
    (c) Narrative descriptions of organizational structure or hierarchy 
that duplicate information conveyed by charts or by lists of officials 
will not be published in the Manual.

<R05>
Sec. 20.4  Description of program activities.

    (a) Descriptions should clearly state the public purposes that the 
agency serves, and the programs that carry out those purposes.
    (b) Descriptions of the responsibilities of individuals or of 
administrative units common to most agencies will not be accepted for

shall plainly identify the places at which the public may obtain 
information or make submittals or requests.


<R05>
Sec. 20.6  Form, style, arrangement and apportionment of space.

    The form, style, and arrangement of agency statements and other 
materials included in the Manual and the apportionment of space therein 
shall be determined by the Director of the Federal Register. The U.S.

with information about their Government on a timely basis. Therefore, 
agencies must comply with the deadline dates established by the Director 
of the Federal Register for transmittal of statements and charts and for 
the verification of proofs. Failure to do so may result in publication 
of an outdated statement or the omission of important material, thus 
depriving members of the public of information they

have a right to expect in a particular edition of the Manual.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(a).

    Source: 47 FR 34108, Aug. 6, 1982, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1  Policy.

    (a) Section 552(a) of title 5, United States Code, provides, in 
part, that ``matter reasonably available to the class of persons 
affected thereby is deemed published in the Federal Register when 
incorporated by reference therein with the approval of the Director of 
the Federal Register.''
    (b) The Director will interpret and apply the language of section 
552(a) together with other requirements which govern publication in the 
Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations. Those requirements 
which govern publication include--
    (1) The Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.)
    (2) The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.);
    (3) The regulations of the Administrative Committee of the Federal 
Register under the Federal Register Act (1 CFR Ch. I); and
    (4) The acts which require publication in the Federal Register (See 
CFR volume entitled ``CFR Index and Finding Aids.'')
    (c) The Director will assume in carrying out the responsibilities 
for incorporation by reference that incorporation by reference--
    (1) Is intended to benefit both the Federal Government and the 
members of the class affected; and
    (2) Is not intended to detract from the legal or practical 
attributes of the system established by the Federal Register Act, the 
Administrative Procedure Act, the regulations of the Administrative 
Committee of the Federal Register, and the acts which require 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (d) The Director will carry out the responsibilities by applying the 
standards of part 51 fairly and uniformly.
    (e) Publication in the Federal Register of a document containing an 
incorporation by reference does not of itself constitute an approval of 
the incorporation by reference by the Director.
    (f) Incorporation by reference of a publication is limited to the 
edition of the publication that is approved. Future amendments or 
revisions of the publication are not included.


<R05>
Sec. 51.3  When will the Director approve a publication?

    (a) The Director will approve the incorporation by reference of a 
publication when the following requirements are met:
    (1) The publication is eligible for incorporation by reference (See 
Sec. 51.7).
    (2) The language of incorporation meets the requirements of this 
part (See Sec. 51.9).
    (3) The publication is on file with the Office of the Federal 
Register.
    (4) The Director has received a written request from the agency to 
approve the incorporation by reference of the publication.
    (b) The Director will notify the agency of the approval or 
disapproval of an incorporation by reference within 20 working days 
after the agency has met all the requirements for requesting approvals 
(See Sec. 51.5).


<R05>
Sec. 51.5  How does an agency request approval?

    (a) Formal approval of a publication for incorporation by reference 
applies to a final rule document. For timely approval by the Director of 
the Federal Register, the agency must--
    (1) Make a written request for approval at least 20 working days 
before the agency intends to submit the final rule document for 
publication;
    (2) Send with the written request a copy of the final rule document 
that uses the proper language of incorporation; and
    (3) Ensure that a copy of the publication is on file at the Office 
of the Federal Register.

[[Page 38]]

    (b) Agencies may consult with the Office of the Federal Register at 
any time with respect to the requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 51.7  What publications are eligible?

    (a) A publication is eligible for incorporation by reference under 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) if it--
    (1) Conforms to the policy stated in Sec. 51.1;
    (2) Is published data, criteria, standards, specifications, 
techniques, illustrations, or similar material;
    (3) Substantially reduces the volume of material published in the 
Federal Register; and
    (4) Is reasonably available to and usable by the class of persons 
affected by the publication. In determining whether a publication is 
usable, the Director will consider--
    (i) The completeness and ease of handling of the publication; and
    (ii) Whether it is bound, numbered, and organized.
    (b) The Director will assume that a publication produced by the same 
agency that is seeking its approval is inappropriate for incorporation 
by reference. A publication produced by the agency may be approved, if, 
in the judgment of the Director, it meets the requirements of paragraph 
(a) and possesses other unique or highly unusual qualities. A 
publication may be approved if it cannot be printed using the Federal 
Register/Code of Federal Regulations printing system.
    (c) The following materials are not appropriate for incorporation by 
reference:
    (1) Material published previously in the Federal Register.
    (2) Material published in the United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 51.9  What is the proper language of incorporation?

    (a) The language incorporating a publication by reference shall be 
as precise and complete as possible and shall make it clear that the 
incorporation by reference is intended and completed by the final rule 
document in which it appears.
    (b) The language incorporating a publication by reference is precise 
and complete if it--
    (1) Uses the words ``incorporated by reference;''
    (2) States the title, date, edition, author, publisher, and 
identification number of the publication;
    (3) Informs the user that the incorporated publication is a 
requirement;
    (4) Makes an official showing that the publication is in fact 
available by stating where and how copies may be examined and readily 
obtained with maximum convenience to the user; and
    (5) Refers to 5 U.S.C. 552(a).
    (c) If the Director approves a publication for incorporation by 
reference, the agency must--
    (1) Include the following under the DATES caption of the preamble to 
the final rule document (See 1 CFR 18.12 Preamble requirements):

    The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the 
regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of --
----.

    (2) Includes the term ``incorporation by reference'' in the list of 
index terms (See 1 CFR 18.20 Identification of subjects in agency 
regulations).


<R05>
Sec. 51.11  How does an agency change or remove an approved incorporation?

    (a) An agency that seeks approval for a change to a publication that 
is approved for incorporation by reference must--
    (1) Publish notice of the change in the Federal Register and amend 
the Code of Federal Regulations;
    (2) Ensure that a copy of the amendment or revision is on file at 
the Office of the Federal Register; and
    (3) Notify the Director of the Federal Register in writing that the 
change is being made.
    (b) If a regulation containing an incorporation by reference fails 
to become effective or is removed from the Code of Federal Regulations, 
the agency must notify the Director of the Federal Register in writing 
of that fact within 5 working days of the occurrence.

<R05>
Sec. 301.1  Establishment and location.

    The Administrative Conference of the United States was established 
as a permanent independent agency of the Federal Government by the 
Administrative Conference Act (5 U.S.C. 591-96), as amended. The 
Conference offices are located at 1120 20th Street, NW., South Lobby, 
Suite 706, Washington, DC 20036. The offices are open from 8:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays, unless 
otherwise stated. General correspondence and filings should be delivered 
to the foregoing address. Electronic filings should be transmitted as 
specified by the Conference. The public may obtain information about the 
Conference either by accessing its Web site at http://www.acus.gov, by 
calling the Conference offices at (202) 480-2080, or by contacting 
info@acus.gov. The Conference's recommendations may be obtained by 
accessing its Web site or by visiting the reading room at its offices.


<R05>
Sec. 301.2  Purposes.

    The purposes of the Administrative Conference are--
    (a) To provide suitable arrangements through which Federal agencies, 
assisted by outside experts, may cooperatively study mutual problems, 
exchange information, and develop recommendations for action by proper 
authorities to the end that private rights may be fully protected and 
regulatory activities and other Federal responsibilities may be carried 
out expeditiously in the public interest;
    (b) To promote more effective public participation and efficiency in 
the rulemaking process;
    (c) To reduce unnecessary litigation in the regulatory process;
    (d) To improve the use of science in the regulatory process; and
    (e) To improve the effectiveness of laws applicable to the 
regulatory process.


<R05>
Sec. 301.3  Organization.

    (a) The Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United 
States is appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the 
Senate, for a five-year term.
    (b) The Council consists of the Chairman and 10 other members who 
are appointed by the President for three-year terms, of whom not more 
than one-half may be employees of Federal regulatory agencies or 
Executive departments.
    (c) The total membership of the Conference may not, by statute, be 
lower than 75 or higher than 101. It comprises, in addition to the 
Council, approximately 50 Government members (from Executive departments 
and agencies designated by the President and independent regulatory 
boards or commissions) and approximately 40 non-Government or public 
members appointed by the Chairman with the approval of the Council 
(lawyers in private practice, scholars in the field of administrative 
law or government, or others specially informed by knowledge and 
experience with respect to Federal administrative procedure). Public 
members are selected so as to provide broad representation of the views 
of private citizens and utilize diverse experience.
    (d) Members of the Conference, except the Chairman, are not entitled 
to pay for service; although public members are entitled to travel 
reimbursement.
    (e) The membership is divided into six standing committees, each 
assigned a broad area of interest as follows: Adjudication, 
Administration, Public Processes, Judicial Review, Regulation, and 
Rulemaking.
    (f) The membership meeting in plenary session is called the Assembly 
of the Administrative Conference. The Council must call at least one 
plenary session each year. The Assembly has

[[Page 42]]

authority to adopt bylaws for carrying out the functions of the 
Conference.


<R05>
Sec. 301.4  Activities.

    (a) The Conference may study the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness 
of the administrative procedure used by administrative agencies in 
carrying out administrative programs. Subjects for inquiry by the 
Conference are developed by the Chairman, the Council, the committees, 
and the Assembly. The committees, with the assistance of staff and 
consultants, conduct thorough studies of these subjects and develop 
proposed recommendations and supporting reports. Reports and 
recommendations are considered by the Council and distributed to the 
membership, with the views and recommendations of the Council, to be 
placed on the agenda of a plenary session. The Assembly has complete 
authority to approve, amend, remand, or reject recommendations presented 
by the committees. The deliberations of the Assembly are public. 
Recommendations may be made to administrative agencies, collectively or 
individually, and to the President, Congress, or the Judicial Conference 
of the United States, as the Conference considers appropriate.
    (b) The Conference may arrange for interchange among administrative 
agencies of information potentially useful in improving administrative 
procedure, collect information and statistics from administrative 
agencies and publish such reports as it considers useful for evaluating 
and improving administrative procedure, and enter into arrangements with 
any administrative agency or major organizational unit within an 
administrative agency pursuant to which the Conference performs any of 
the functions described in this section.
    (c) The Conference may provide assistance in response to requests 
relating to the improvement of administrative procedure in foreign 
countries, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State or the 
Administrator of the Agency for International Development, as 
appropriate, except that:
    (1) Such assistance shall be limited to the analysis of issues 
relating to administrative procedure, the provision of training of 
foreign officials in administrative procedure, and the design or 
improvement of administrative procedure, where the expertise of members 
of the Conference is indicated; and
    (2) Such assistance may only be undertaken on a fully reimbursable 
basis, including all direct and indirect administrative costs.
    (d) For purposes of this section:
    (1) ``Administrative program'' includes a Federal function which 
involves protection of the public interest and the determination of 
rights, privileges, and obligations of private persons through 
rulemaking, adjudication, licensing, or investigation, except that it 
does not include a military or foreign affairs function of the United 
States; and
    (2) ``Administrative procedure'' means procedure used in carrying 
out an administrative program and is to be broadly construed to include 
any aspect of agency organization, procedure, or management which may 
affect the equitable consideration of public and private interests, the 
fairness of agency decisions, the speed of agency action, and the 
relationship of operating methods to later judicial review, but does not 
include the scope of agency responsibility as established by law or 
matters of substantive policy committed by law to agency discretion.


<R05>
Sec. 301.5  Office of the Chairman.

    The Chairman is the chief executive of the Conference. The Chairman 
presides at meetings of the Council and at each plenary session of the 
Conference. Among his powers is the authority to encourage Federal 
agencies to adopt the recommendations of the Conference. The Chairman is 
also authorized to make inquiries into matters he considers important 
for Conference consideration, including matters proposed by individuals 
inside or outside the Federal Government. The purpose of such inquiries 
is not to review the results in particular cases, but rather to 
determine whether the problems should be made the subject of Conference 
study in the interests of developing fair and effective procedures for 
such cases. Upon request of the head of an agency, the Chairman is 
authorized to furnish assistance and advice on matters of administrative 
procedure.

[[Page 43]]

The Chairman may request agency heads to provide information needed by 
the Conference, which information shall be supplied to the extent 
permitted by law.

  Subpart A_Procedures for Disclosure of Records Under the Freedom of 

                             Information Act

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552, 591-96.


<R05>
Sec. 304.1  General provisions.

    (a) This subpart contains the rules that the Administrative 
Conference of the United States (``ACUS'' or ``the agency'') follows in 
processing requests for disclosure of records under the Freedom of 
Information Act (``FOIA'' or ``the Act''), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and 
in meeting its responsibilities under the Act. Note that electronic 
records are treated as records for the purposes of the FOIA. These rules 
should be read together with the text of the FOIA itself, which provides 
additional information about access to records maintained by the agency. 
They also may be read in conjunction with the agency's ``Freedom of 
Information Act Reference Guide,'' which provides basic information 
about use of the Act in relation to the agency's records. Requests made 
by individuals for access to records about themselves under the Privacy 
Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a (2006 & Supp. II 2008), which are processed 
under subpart B of this part, are also processed under this subpart. The 
agency will automatically process the request under both provisions in 
order to provide the maximum possible records to the requester. 
Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular agency 
activity (for example, press releases or recommendations adopted by the 
agency pursuant to the Administrative Conference Act, 5 U.S.C. 591 et 
seq.) may be provided to the public without following this subpart.
    (b) As a matter of policy, ACUS makes discretionary disclosures of 
records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever it 
is determined that disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest 
protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right 
enforceable in court.
    (c) The agency has designated its General Counsel as its Chief FOIA 
Officer, who has agency-wide responsibility

[[Page 44]]

for efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA and these 
implementing regulations. The General Counsel has designated the 
agency's Deputy General Counsel as its FOIA Public Liaison.


<R05>
Sec. 304.2  Public reading room.

    (a) ACUS maintains a public reading room that affords access to the 
records that the FOIA requires it to make regularly available for public 
inspection and copying even in the absence of a FOIA request, including 
a current subject-matter index of its reading room records that will be 
updated quarterly with respect to newly included records.
    (b) ACUS also makes all reading room records that have been created 
by the agency regularly available to the public electronically on its 
Web site (http://www.acus.gov).


<R05>
Sec. 304.3  Requirements for making requests.

    (a) How made and addressed. You may make a request for records by 
sending an e-mail message addressed to info@acus.gov, or by using the 
FOIA Request form on the ACUS Web site at http://www.acus.gov/foia. You 
may also send a written request letter to the agency either by mail 
addressed to FOIA Public Liaison, Administrative Conference of the 
United States, 1120 20th Street, NW., South Lobby, Suite 706, 
Washington, DC 20036, or by fax delivery to (202) 386-7190. For the 
quickest possible handling of a mail request, you should mark both your 
request letter and the envelope ``Freedom of Information Act Request.'' 
(You may find the agency's ``Freedom of Information Act Reference 
Guide''--which is available on its Web site and in paper form--helpful 
in making your request.) If you are making a request for records about 
yourself, see Sec. 304.21(d) for additional requirements. If you are 
making a request for records about another individual, then either a 
written authorization signed by that individual permitting disclosure of 
those records to you or proof that that individual is deceased (for 
example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary notice) will help 
the processing of your request. Your request will be considered received 
as of the date upon which it is logged in as received by the agency's 
FOIA Public Liaison.
    (b) Description of records sought. You must describe the records 
that you seek in enough detail to enable agency personnel to locate them 
with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request 
should include specific information about each record sought, such as 
the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the 
record. If known, you should include any file designations or similar 
descriptions for the records that you want. As a general rule, the more 
specific you are about the records or type of records that you want, the 
more likely that the agency will be able to locate those records in 
response to your request. If the agency determines that your request 
does not reasonably describe records, then it will tell you either what 
additional information is needed or why your request is otherwise 
insufficient. It also will give you an opportunity to discuss your 
request by telephone so that you may modify it to meet the requirements 
of this section. Additionally, if your request does not reasonably 
describe the records you seek, the agency's response to it may be 
delayed as an initial matter.
    (c) Agreement to pay fees. When you make a FOIA request, it will be 
considered to be an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged 
under Sec. 304.9, up to $50.00, unless you specifically request a 
waiver of fees. The agency ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an 
acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a 
willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount. Your agreement will not 
prejudice your ability to seek a waiver or reduction of any applicable 
fee at a later time.


<R05>
Sec. 304.4  Responsibility for responding to requests.

    (a) In general. The agency will be responsible for responding to a 
request in all respects, except in the case of a referral to another 
agency as is described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. 
In determining which records are responsive to a request, the agency 
ordinarily will include only records in its possession and control as of 
the date upon which it begins its search for

[[Page 45]]

them. If any other date is used, the agency will inform the requester of 
that date.
    (b) Consultations and referrals. When the agency receives a request 
for a record in its possession and control, it will determine whether 
another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine 
whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA and, if so, 
whether it should be disclosed as a matter of administrative discretion. 
If the agency determines that it is best able to process the record in 
response to the request, then it will do so. If the agency determines 
that it is not best able to process the record, then it will either:
    (1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting 
with the agency that is best able to determine whether to disclose it 
and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or
    (2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding 
that record to another agency that originated the record (but only if 
that agency is subject to the FOIA). Ordinarily, the agency that 
originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine 
whether to disclose it.
    (c) Notice of referral. When the agency refers all or any part of 
the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it 
ordinarily will notify the requester of the referral and inform the 
requester of the name of the agency to which the request has been 
referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.
    (d) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All 
consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date upon 
which the FOIA request initially was received by the first agency, and 
not any later date.
    (e) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. The agency may 
make agreements with other agencies designed to eliminate the need for 
consultations or referrals regarding particular types of records.


<R05>
Sec. 304.5  Timing of responses to requests.

    (a) In general. The agency ordinarily will respond to requests 
according to their order of receipt.
    (b) Multi-track processing. The agency may use two or more 
processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex 
requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the 
request, including according to the number of pages involved. If it does 
so, then it will advise requesters in its slower track(s) of the limits 
of its faster track(s) and may provide requesters in its slower track(s) 
with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to 
qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of its faster 
track(s). The agency will contact the requester by telephone, e-mail or 
letter, whichever is most efficient, in each case.
    (c) Unusual circumstances. (1) Where the statutory time limits for 
processing a request cannot be met because of ``unusual circumstances,'' 
as defined in the FOIA, and the agency determines to extend the time 
limits on that basis, it will as soon as practicable notify the 
requester in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by 
which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where 
the extension is for more than ten business days, it will provide the 
requester with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it 
may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an alternative 
time period processing the request or a modified request.
    (2) Where the agency reasonably believes that multiple requests 
submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, 
constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual 
circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, they 
may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will 
not be aggregated.
    (d) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals will be taken out 
of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that 
they involve:
    (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could 
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual;
    (ii) An urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged 
federal

[[Page 46]]

government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information; or
    (iii) Other circumstances as determined by the agency.
    (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of 
the initial request for records (i.e., as part of the initial request) 
or at any later time.
    (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a 
statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's 
knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting 
expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category in 
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the 
news media, must establish that he or she is a person whose main 
professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though 
it need not be his or her sole occupation. That requester also must 
establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government 
activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know 
about government activity generally. The formality of certification may 
be waived by the agency as a matter of administrative discretion.
    (4) Within ten calendar days of its receipt of a request for 
expedited processing, the agency will decide whether to grant it and 
will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited 
treatment is granted, then the request will be given priority and will 
be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited 
processing is denied, then any appeal of that decision will be acted on 
expeditiously.


<R05>
Sec. 304.6  Responses to requests.

    (a) Acknowledgments of requests. On receipt of a request, if the 
agency cannot provide the requested information within two business 
days, then an acknowledgment letter or e-mail message will be sent to 
the requester that will confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees 
under Sec. 304.3(c) and will provide a request tracking number for 
further reference. Requesters may use this tracking number to determine 
the status of their request--including the date of its receipt and the 
estimated date on which action on it will be completed--by calling the 
agency's FOIA Public Liaison at (202) 480-2080. In some cases, the 
agency may seek further information or clarification from the requester.
    (b) Grants of requests. Ordinarily, the agency will have twenty 
business days from when a request is received to determine whether to 
grant or deny the request. Once the agency makes such a determination, 
it will immediately notify the requester in writing. The agency will 
inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under Sec. 304.9 
and will disclose records to the requester promptly upon payment of any 
applicable fee. Records disclosed in part will be marked or annotated to 
show the amount of information deleted, unless doing so would harm an 
interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the 
information deleted also will be indicated on the record, if technically 
feasible.
    (c) Adverse determinations of requests. Whenever the agency makes an 
adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify 
the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, 
or denials of requests, consist of: A determination to withhold any 
requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested 
record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that a 
record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the 
requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a record 
subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, 
including a denial of a request for a fee waiver; and a denial of a 
request for expedited treatment. The denial letter will include:
    (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the 
denial;
    (2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any 
FOIA exemption(s) applied by the agency in denying the request;
    (3) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in 
number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This 
estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise 
indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if 
providing an estimate

[[Page 47]]

would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and
    (4) An indication on the released portion of a record of each 
exemption applied, at the place at which it was applied, if technically 
feasible.
    (5) A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec. 304.8(a) 
and a description of the requirements of Sec. 304.8(a).


<R05>
Sec. 304.7  Business information.

    (a) In general. Business information obtained by the agency will be 
disclosed under the FOIA only under this section and in accordance with 
Executive Order 12,600, 3 CFR part 235 (1988).
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) ``Business information'' means privileged or confidential 
commercial or financial information obtained by the agency from a 
submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the 
FOIA.
    (2) ``Submitter'' means any person or entity from whom the agency 
obtains business information, either directly or indirectly. The term 
includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign 
governments.
    (c) Designation of business information. A submitter of business 
information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate 
markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time 
thereafter, any and all portion(s) of its submission that it considers 
to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations 
will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the 
submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation 
period.
    (d) Notice to submitters. The agency will provide a submitter with 
prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that 
seeks its business information wherever required under paragraph (e) of 
this section, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, in 
order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of 
any specified portion of that information under paragraph (f) of this 
section. The notice will either describe the business information 
requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions 
containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of 
submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or 
publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish it.
    (e) Where notice is required. Notice will be given to a submitter 
wherever:
    (1) The information has been designated in good faith by the 
submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under 
Exemption 4; or
    (2) The agency has reason to believe that the information may be 
protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.
    (f) Opportunity to object to disclosure. The agency will allow a 
submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in 
paragraph (d) of this section and will specify that time period within 
the notice. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it is 
required to submit a detailed written statement. The statement must 
specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under 
any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, it must show 
why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial 
information that is privileged or confidential. In the event that a 
submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified in 
it, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure 
of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is not 
received by the agency until after its disclosure decision has been made 
will not be considered by the agency. Information provided by a 
submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under 
the FOIA.
    (g) Notice of intent to disclose. The agency will consider a 
submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in 
deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever the agency 
decides to disclose business information over the objection of a 
submitter, it will give the submitter written notice, which will 
include:
    (1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's 
disclosure objections was not sustained;
    (2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and
    (3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time 
subsequent to the notice.

[[Page 48]]

    (h) Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of 
paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section will not apply if:
    (1) The agency determines that the information should not be 
disclosed;
    (2) The information lawfully has been published or has been 
officially made available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than 
the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements 
of Executive Order 12,600; or
    (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of 
this section appears obviously frivolous--except that, in such a case, 
the agency will, within a reasonable time prior to a specified 
disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision 
to disclose the information.
    (i) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit 
seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the agency 
will promptly notify the submitter.
    (j) Corresponding notice to requesters. Whenever the agency provides 
a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under 
paragraph (d) of this section, it will also notify the requester(s). 
Whenever the agency notifies a submitter of its intent to disclose 
requested information under paragraph (g) of this section, it will also 
notify the requester(s). Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to 
prevent the disclosure of business information, the agency will notify 
the requester(s).


<R05>
Sec. 304.8  Appeals.

    (a) Appeals of adverse determinations. If you are dissatisfied with 
the response to your request, you may appeal an adverse determination 
denying your request, in any respect, to the Chairman of the agency. You 
must make your appeal in writing, by e-mail or letter, and it must be 
received by the agency within 60 days of the date of the agency's 
response denying your request. Your appeal should provide reasons and 
supporting information as to why the initial determination was 
incorrect. The appeal should clearly identify the particular 
determination (including the assigned request number, if known) that you 
are appealing. For the quickest possible handling of a mail request, you 
should mark your appeal ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal.'' The 
Chairman or his or her designee will act on the appeal, except that an 
appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes a matter 
of FOIA litigation.
    (b) Responses to appeals. The decision on your appeal will be made 
by e-mail or letter, ordinarily within 20 business days of receipt of 
your appeal. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or 
in part will contain a statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, 
including any FOIA exemption(s) applied, and will inform you of the FOIA 
provisions for court review of the decision. (You also may be aware of 
the mediation services that are offered by the Office of Government 
Information Services (``OGIS'') of the National Archives and Records 
Administration--see http://www.archives.gov/ogis/--as a non-exclusive 
alternative to FOIA litigation.) If the adverse determination is 
reversed or modified on appeal, in whole or in part, then you will be 
notified in a written decision and your request will be reprocessed in 
accordance with that appeal decision.
    (c) When appeal is required. As a general rule, if you wish to seek 
review by a court of any adverse determination, you must first appeal it 
in a timely fashion under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 304.9  Fees.

    (a) In general. The agency will charge for processing requests under 
the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where 
fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section, where a waiver or 
reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (k) of this section, or 
where the agency's FOIA staff waives fees in whole or in part because 
they are deemed to be inappropriate or unreasonable--and in some cases 
the agency may seek further information or clarification from the 
requester for this purpose. The agency ordinarily will collect all 
applicable fees before sending copies of requested records to a 
requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable 
to the Treasury of the United States.

[[Page 49]]

    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) ``Commercial use request'' means a request from or on behalf of 
a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or 
her commercial, trade, or profit interests, including furthering those 
interests through litigation. The agency will determine, whenever 
reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested 
records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a 
commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or 
because the agency has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated 
use, the agency will provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to 
submit further clarification.
    (2) ``Direct costs'' means those expenses that an agency actually 
incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial 
use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct 
costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the 
work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that 
rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. 
Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of 
space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are 
kept.
    (3) ``Duplication'' means the making of a copy of a record, or of 
the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. 
Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic 
records, among others. The agency will honor a requester's specified 
preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily 
reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.
    (4) ``Educational institution'' means a preschool, a public or 
private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate 
higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational 
education, that operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify 
under this category, a requester must show that the request is 
authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution 
and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought 
to further scholarly research.
    (5) ``Noncommercial scientific institution'' means an institution 
that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as that term is defined 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the 
purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not 
intended to promote any particular product or industry. To qualify under 
this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by 
and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the 
records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further 
scientific research.
    (6) ``Representative of the news media,'' or ``news-media 
requester,'' means any person or entity that gathers information of 
potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills 
to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that 
work to an audience. For this purpose, the term ``news'' means 
information that is about current events or that would be of current 
interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television 
or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of 
periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of 
``news'') who make their products available for purchase by or 
subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These 
examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery 
evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of 
newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media 
shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist 
shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist 
can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that 
entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the 
entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an 
expectation; the agency may also consider the past publication record of 
the requester in making such a determination. To qualify under this 
category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for a

[[Page 50]]

commercial use. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination 
function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial 
use.
    (7) ``Review'' means the examination of a record located in response 
to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt 
from disclosure. It also includes processing any record for disclosure--
for example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for 
disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is 
not disclosed. Review time includes time spent considering any formal 
objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under Sec. 304.7 
but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues 
regarding the application of exemptions.
    (8) ``Search'' means the process of looking for and retrieving 
records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page 
or line-by-line identification of information within records and also 
includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from 
records maintained in electronic form or format. The agency will conduct 
searches in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably 
possible. For example, it will not search on a line-by-line basis where 
duplicating an entire document would be quicker and less expensive.
    (c) Fees charged. In responding to FOIA requests, the agency will 
charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been 
granted under paragraph (k) of this section:
    (1) Search. (i) Search fees will be charged for all requests (other 
than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific 
institutions, or representatives of the news media) subject to the 
limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. The agency may charge for 
time spent searching even if it does not locate any responsive record or 
if it withholds the record(s) located as entirely exempt from 
disclosure.
    (ii) For each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching 
for and retrieving a requested record, the fee will be $5.00. Where a 
search and retrieval cannot be performed entirely by clerical personnel 
(for example, where the identification of records within the scope of a 
request requires the use of professional personnel) the fee will be 
$10.00 for each quarter hour of search time spent by professional 
personnel. Where the time of managerial personnel is required, the fee 
will be $15.00 for each quarter hour of time spent by those personnel.
    (iii) For computer searches of records, requesters will be charged 
the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters 
(as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) will be charged no 
search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section) will be entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of 
manual search time without charge. These direct costs will include the 
costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.
    (2) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, 
subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper 
photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), 
the fee will be ten cents per page. For copies produced by computer, 
such as tapes, disks, or printouts, the agency will charge the direct 
costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. For other forms 
of duplication, the agency will charge the direct costs of that 
duplication.
    (3) Review. Review fees will be charged to requesters who make a 
commercial use request. Review fees will be charged only for the initial 
record review, when the agency determines whether an exemption applies 
to a particular record or record portion at the initial request level. 
No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level 
regarding an exemption already applied. However, records or record 
portions withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not 
to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption 
not previously considered applies; the costs of that review are 
chargeable where it is made necessary by such a change of circumstances. 
Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those used for a search 
under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (d) Limitations on charging fees. (1) No search fee will be charged 
for requests

[[Page 51]]

by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or 
representatives of the news media.
    (2) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour 
period unless more than half of that period is required for search or 
review.
    (3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the 
agency will provide without charge:
    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and
    (ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent).
    (4) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this 
section is $20.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.
    (5) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section work 
together. This means that for requesters other than those seeking 
records for a commercial use, no fee will be charged unless the cost of 
search in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 
100 pages totals more than $20.00.
    (6) In the case of any request on which the agency does not comply 
with any of the time limits of the FOIA and for which no ``unusual or 
exceptional circumstances'' exist, as those terms are defined by the 
FOIA, the agency will not charge any search fee or, for such requests 
made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, 
or representatives of the news media, will not charge any duplication 
fee.
    (e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $50.00. When the agency 
determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section 
will amount to more than $50.00, it will notify the requester of the 
actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has 
indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If 
only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the agency will 
advise the requester that the estimated fee might be only a portion of 
the total fee. In cases in which a requester has been notified that 
actual or estimated fees amount to more than $50.00, the request will 
not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until 
the requester agrees to pay the total anticipated fee. Any such 
agreement should be memorialized in writing. A notice under this 
paragraph will offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter 
with agency personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the 
requester's needs at a lower cost.
    (f) Charges for other services. Apart from the other provisions of 
this section, when the agency chooses as a matter of administrative 
discretion to provide a special service--such as certifying that records 
are true copies or sending them by other than ordinary mail--the direct 
costs of providing the service ordinarily will be charged.
    (g) Charging interest. The agency may charge interest on any unpaid 
bill starting on the 31st day following the date of the billing of the 
requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 
U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment 
is received by the agency. The agency will follow the provisions of the 
Debt Collection Act of 1982, Public Law 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749, as 
amended, and regulations pursuant thereto.
    (h) Aggregating requests. Wherever the agency reasonably believes 
that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting 
to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of 
avoiding fees, it may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. 
In so doing, it will presume that multiple requests of this type made 
within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. Where 
requests are separated by a longer period, the agency will aggregate 
them only where there exists a solid basis for determining that 
aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple 
requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
    (i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in 
paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, the agency will not 
require the requester to make an advance payment--in other words, a 
payment made before work is begun or continued on a request. Payment 
owed for work already completed (i.e., a prepayment before copies are 
sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

[[Page 52]]

    (2) Where the agency determines or estimates that a total fee to be 
charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require the 
requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of 
the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, 
except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a 
requester that has a history of prompt payment.
    (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly 
charged FOIA fee to any agency within 30 days of the date of billing, 
the agency may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus 
any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full 
amount of any anticipated fee, before it begins to process a new request 
or continues to process a pending request from that requester.
    (4) In cases in which the agency requires advance payment or payment 
due under paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, the request will 
not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until 
the required payment is received.
    (j) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule 
of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that 
specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular 
types of records. In cases in which records responsive to requests are 
maintained for distribution by another agency under such a statutorily 
based fee schedule program, ACUS will inform the requesters of the steps 
for obtaining records from those sources so that they may do so most 
economically.
    (k) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records 
responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge 
reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section where 
the agency determines, based on all available information, that the 
requester has demonstrated that:
    (i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public 
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and
    (ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the 
commercial interest of the requester.
    (2) To determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, 
the agency will consider the following factors:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government.'' The 
subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or 
activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct 
and clear, not remote or attenuated.
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the 
requested records must be meaningfully informative about government 
operations or activities in order to be ``likely to contribute''' to an 
increased public understanding of those operations or activities.
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the 
requested information will contribute to ``public understanding.'' The 
disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad 
audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the 
individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in 
the subject area and ability and intention to convey information 
effectively to the public will be considered. It will be presumed that a 
representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government operations or activities. The 
public's understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the 
level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be 
enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. The agency will not 
make value judgments about whether information that would contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the

[[Page 53]]

operations or activities of the government is ``important'' enough to be 
made public.
    (3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, 
the agency will consider the following factors:
    (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure. The agency will consider any commercial interest 
of the requester (with reference to the definition of ``commercial use'' 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), or of any person on whose behalf 
the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested 
disclosure. Requesters will be given an opportunity in the 
administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this 
consideration.
    (ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether any identified 
commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in 
comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is 
``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'' A fee waiver 
or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is 
satisfied and that public interest is greater in magnitude than that of 
any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The agency ordinarily 
will presume that where a news-media requester has satisfied the public 
interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily 
served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or 
others who merely compile and market government information for direct 
economic return will not be presumed primarily to serve the public 
interest.
    (4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the 
requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those 
records.
    (5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the 
factors listed in paragraphs (k)(2) and (k)(3) of this section insofar 
as they apply to each request. The agency will exercise its discretion 
to consider the cost-effectiveness of its investment of administrative 
resources in this decisionmaking process in deciding to grant waivers or 
reductions of fees.


<R05>
Sec. 304.10  Preservation of records.

    (a) The agency will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the 
requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all 
requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by 
title 44 of the United States Code or the National Archives and Records 
Administration's General Records Schedule 14. Records will not be 
disposed of while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or 
lawsuit under the FOIA.
    (b) In the event that the agency contracts with another agency, 
entity, or person to maintain records for the agency for the purposes of 
records management, it will promptly identify such records in its 
``Freedom of Information Reference Guide'' and specify the particular 
means by which request for such records can be made.


<R05>
Sec. 304.11  Other rights and services.

    Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as 
of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which 
such person is not entitled under the FOIA.


<R04>
 Subpart B_Protection of Privacy and Access to Individual Records Under 

                         the Privacy Act of 1974

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a, 591-96.


<R05>
Sec. 304.20  General provisions.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This subpart contains the rules that the 
Administrative Conference of the United States (``ACUS'' or ``the 
agency'') follows under the Privacy Act of 1974 (``the Privacy Act''), 5 
U.S.C. 552a, as amended, regarding the protection of, and individual 
access to, certain records about individuals. These rules should be read 
together with and are governed by the Privacy Act itself, which provides 
additional information about records maintained on individuals. The 
rules in this subpart apply to all records in Privacy Act systems of 
records maintained by the agency, which are retrieved by an individual's 
name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which 
individuals may request access to records about themselves, request

[[Page 54]]

amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of 
disclosures of those records by the agency. In addition, the agency 
processes all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the 
Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, 
following the rules contained in subpart A of this part. Thus, all 
Privacy Act requests will be subject to exemptions for access to records 
only applicable under both FOIA and the Privacy Act.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subpart:
    (1) ``Request for access to a record'' means a request made under 
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1).
    (2) ``Request for amendment or correction of a record'' means a 
request made under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2).
    (3) ``Request for an accounting'' means a request made under Privacy 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3).
    (4) ``Requester'' means an individual who makes a request for 
access, a request for amendment or correction, or a request for an 
accounting under the Privacy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 304.21  Requests for access to records.

    (a) How made and addressed. You may make a request for access to a 
record about yourself by appearing in person or by sending an e-mail 
message addressed to info@acus.gov. You may also send a written request 
letter to the agency either by mail addressed to 1120 20th Street, NW., 
South Lobby, Suite 706, Washington, DC 20036, or by fax delivery to 
(202) 386-7190. For the quickest possible handling of a mail request, 
you should mark both your request letter and the envelope ``Privacy Act 
Request.''
    (b) Description of records sought. You must describe the records 
that you want in enough detail to enable agency personnel to locate the 
system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. 
Whenever possible, your request should describe the records sought, the 
time periods in which you believe they were compiled, and the name or 
identifying number of each system of records in which you believe they 
are kept. The agency publishes a notice in the Federal Register that 
describes its systems of records.
    (c) Agreement to pay fees. If you make a Privacy Act request for 
access to records, it will be considered an agreement by you to pay all 
applicable fees charged under Sec. 304.27, up to $50.00. Duplication 
fees in excess of $50.00 are subject to the requirements of Sec. 304.27 
of this subpart and the notification requirements in Sec. 304.9 of 
subpart A. The agency ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an 
acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a 
willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.
    (d) Verification of identity. When you make a request for access to 
records about yourself, you must verify your identity. You must state 
your full name, current address, and date and place of birth. You must 
sign your request and your signature must either be notarized or 
submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to 
be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In 
order to help the identification and location of requested records, you 
may also, entirely at your option, include the last four digits of your 
social security number.


<R05>
Sec. 304.22  Responsibility for responding to requests for access to records.

    (a) In general. The agency will be responsible for responding to a 
request in all respects, except in the case of a referral to another 
agency as is described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. 
In determining which records are responsive to a request, the agency 
ordinarily will include only records in its possession and control as of 
the date upon which it begins its search for them. If any other date is 
used, the agency will inform the requester of that date.
    (b) Consultations and referrals. When the agency receives a request 
for access to a record in its possession and control, it will determine 
whether another agency of the Federal Government, is better able to 
determine whether the record is exempt from access under the Privacy 
Act. If the agency determines

[[Page 55]]

that it is the agency best able to process the record in response to the 
request, then it will do so. If it determines that it is not best able 
to process the record, then it will either:
    (1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting 
with the agency that is best able to determine whether the record is 
exempt from access and with any other agency that has a substantial 
interest in it; or
    (2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding 
that record to the agency that is best able to determine whether it is 
exempt from access, or to another agency that originated the record (but 
only if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act). Ordinarily, the 
agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to 
determine whether it is exempt from access.
    (c) Notice of referral. When the agency refers all or any part of 
the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it 
ordinarily will notify the requester of the referral and inform the 
requester of the name of the agency to which the request has been 
referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.
    (d) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All 
consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date upon 
which the Privacy Act access request was initially received by the first 
agency, not any later date.
    (e) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. The agency may 
make agreements with other agencies designed to eliminate the need for 
consultations or referrals for particular types of records.


<R05>
Sec. 304.23  Responses to requests for access to records.

    (a) Acknowledgments of requests. On receipt of a request, the agency 
ordinarily will send an acknowledgment letter to the requester that will 
confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under Sec. 304.21(c) and 
provide an assigned request number for further reference. In some cases, 
the agency may seek further information or clarification from the 
requester.
    (b) Grants of requests for access. Once the agency makes a 
determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it will 
notify the requester in writing. The agency will inform the requester in 
the notice of any fee charged under Sec. 304.27 and will disclose 
records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a 
request is made in person, the agency may disclose records to the 
requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its 
operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record 
made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by 
another person, the requester will be required to authorize in writing 
any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.
    (c) Adverse determinations of requests for access. Upon making an 
adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect, the 
agency will notify the requester of that determination in writing. 
Adverse determinations, or denials of requests consist of: a 
determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a 
determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be 
located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record 
subject to the Privacy Act; a determination on any disputed fee matter; 
and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The notification 
letter will include:
    (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the 
denial;
    (2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any 
Privacy Act exemption(s) applied in denying the request; and
    (3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec. 
304.24(a) and a description of the requirements of Sec. 304.24(a).


<R05>
Sec. 304.24  Appeals from denials of requests for access to records.

    (a) Appeals. If you are dissatisfied with the response to your 
request, you may appeal an adverse determination denying your request, 
in any respect, to the Chairman of the agency. You must make your appeal 
in writing, by e-mail or letter, and it must be received by the agency 
within 60 days of the date of the denial of your request. Your appeal 
letter should provide reasons and supporting information as to

[[Page 56]]

why the initial determination was incorrect. The appeal should clearly 
identify the particular determination (including the assigned request 
number, if known) that you are appealing. For the quickest possible 
handling of a mail request, you should mark your appeal letter and the 
envelope ``Privacy Act Appeal.'' The Chairman of the agency or his or 
her designee will act on the appeal, except that an appeal ordinarily 
will not be acted on if the request becomes a matter of FOIA or Privacy 
Act litigation.
    (b) Responses to appeals. The decision on your appeal will be made 
in writing. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in 
part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, 
including any exemption applied, and will inform you of the Privacy Act 
provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse 
determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, 
then you will be notified in a written decision and your request will be 
reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.
    (c) When appeal is required. As a general rule, if you wish to seek 
review by a court of any adverse determination or denial of a request, 
you must first appeal it under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 304.25  Requests for amendment or correction of records.

    (a) How made and addressed. Unless the record is not subject to 
amendment or correction as stated in paragraph (f) of this section, you 
may make a request for amendment or correction of an ACUS record about 
yourself by following same procedures as in Sec. 304.21. Your request 
should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment 
or correction that you want, and state why you believe that the record 
is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. You may submit any 
documentation that you think would be helpful. If you believe that the 
same record is maintained in more than one system of records, you should 
state that.
    (b) Agency responses. Within ten business days of receiving your 
request for amendment or correction of records, the agency will send you 
a written acknowledgment of its receipt of your request. The agency will 
promptly notify you whether your request is granted or denied. If the 
agency grants your request in whole or in part, it will describe the 
amendment or correction made and will advise you of your right to obtain 
a copy of the corrected or amended record, in disclosable form. If the 
agency denies your request in whole or in part, it will send you a 
letter that will state:
    (1) The reason(s) for the denial; and
    (2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of 
this section, including the name and business address of the official 
who will act on your appeal.
    (c) Appeals. You may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or 
correction in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to 
records (see Sec. 304.24(a)) and the same procedures will be followed. 
The agency will ordinarily act on the appeal within 30 business days of 
receipt of the appeal, except that the Chairman of the agency may extend 
the time for response for good cause shown. If your appeal is denied, 
you will be advised of your right to file a Statement of Disagreement as 
described in paragraph (d) of this section and of your right under the 
Privacy Act for court review of the decision.
    (d) Statements of Disagreement. If your appeal under this section is 
denied in whole or in part, you have the right to file a Statement of 
Disagreement that states your reason(s) for disagreeing with the 
agency's denial of your request for amendment or correction. Statements 
of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each part of any 
record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for 
each fact disputed. The agency will place your Statement of Disagreement 
in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and 
will mark the disputed record to indicate that a Statement of 
Disagreement has been filed and exactly where in the system of records 
it may be found.
    (e) Notification of amendment/correction or disagreement. Within 30 
business days of the amendment or correction of a record, the agency 
will notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it 
previously disclosed the

[[Page 57]]

record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record 
has been amended or corrected. If an individual has filed a Statement of 
Disagreement, the agency will append a copy of it to the disputed record 
whenever the record is disclosed and may also append a concise statement 
of its reason(s) for denying the request to amend or correct the record.
    (f) Records not subject to amendment or correction. The following 
records are not subject to amendment or correction:
    (1) Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements 
made under oath;
    (2) Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, or 
quasi-judicial proceedings, which are the official record of those 
proceedings; and
    (3) Any other record that originated with the courts.


<R05>
Sec. 304.26  Requests for an accounting of record disclosures.

    (a) How made and addressed. Except where accountings of disclosures 
are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section), you may make a request for an accounting of any disclosure 
that has been made by the agency to another person, organization, or 
agency of any record about you. This accounting contains the date, 
nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address 
of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. 
Your request for an accounting should identify each particular record in 
question and should be made in writing to the agency, following the 
procedures in Sec. 304.21.
    (b) Where accountings are not required. The agency is not required 
to provide accountings to you where they relate to:
    (1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept 
(i.e., disclosures that are made to officers and employees of the agency 
and disclosures required under the FOIA); or
    (2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law 
enforcement activities in response to written requests from a duly 
authorized representative of any such law enforcement agency specifying 
portion of the record desired and the law enforcement activity for which 
the record is sought.
    (c) Appeals. You may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting 
in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see 
Sec. 304.24(a)) and the same procedures will be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 304.27  Fees.

    The agency will charge fees for duplication of records under the 
Privacy Act in the same way in which it charges duplication fees under 
Sec. 304.9 of subpart A. No search or review fee may be charged for any 
record under the Privacy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 304.28  Notice of court-ordered and emergency disclosures.

    (a) Court-ordered disclosures. When a record pertaining to an 
individual is required to be disclosed by a court order, the agency will 
make reasonable efforts to provide notice of such order to the 
individual. Notice will be given within a reasonable time after the 
agency's receipt of the order, except that in a case in which the order 
is not a matter of public record, the notice will be given only after 
the order becomes public. This notice will be mailed to the individual's 
last known address and will contain a copy of the order and a 
description of the information disclosed.
    (b) Emergency disclosures. Upon disclosing a record pertaining to an 
individual made under compelling circumstances affecting health or 
safety, the agency will notify that individual of the disclosure. This 
notice will be mailed to the individual's last known address and will 
state the nature of the information disclosed; the person, organization, 
or agency to which it was disclosed; the date of disclosure; and the 
compelling circumstances justifying the disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 304.29  Security of systems of records.

    (a) Administrative and physical controls. The agency will have 
administrative and physical controls to prevent unauthorized access to 
its systems of records, to prevent unauthorized disclosure of records, 
and to prevent physical damage to or destruction of

[[Page 58]]

records. The stringency of these controls corresponds to the sensitivity 
of the records that the controls protect. At a minimum, these controls

criminal penalty provisions. Unless otherwise permitted by law, an 
employee of the agency will:
    (a) Collect from individuals and maintain only the information that 
is relevant and necessary to discharge the agency's responsibilities;

individual to the greatest extent practicable when the information may 
result in an adverse determination about an individual's rights, 
benefits, or privileges under Federal programs;
    (c) Inform each individual from whom information is collected of the 
information set forth in Sec. 304.31(b);

FOIA, make reasonable efforts, prior to disseminating any record about 
an individual, to ensure that the record is accurate, relevant, timely,

her First Amendment rights unless such maintenance is expressly 
authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is 
maintained or is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law 
enforcement activity;
    (h) When required by the Privacy Act, maintain an accounting in the 
specified form of all disclosures of records by the agency to persons,

                   CHAPTER IV--MISCELLANEOUS AGENCIES


<R03>

  --------------------------------------------------------------------


  Editorial Note: Federal agencies are required to publish regulations 
implementing the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 
552(a)), the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579, 5 U.S.C. 552a), the 
Government in the Sunshine Act (Pub. L. 94-409, 5 U.S.C. 552b), and 
section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by section 119 
of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental 
Disabilities Amendments of 1978 (29 U.S.C. 794). While most agencies 
have existing chapter assignments in the Code of Federal Regulations, a 
few agencies do not. Since certain of these agencies are unlikely to be 
issuing regulations other than those relating to the acts mentioned 
above, the Director of the Office of the Federal Register has grouped 
these miscellaneous agencies into this chapter as an efficient means of 
administering the CFR system.

individuals.

    (a) The system of records, as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974, 
maintained by the President's Commission on White House Fellowships is 
listed annually in the Federal Register as required by that Act. Any 
person who wishes to know whether a system of records contains a record 
pertaining to him or her may either appear in person at Room 1308, 1900 
E Street, NW., on work days between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. or

recommended that requests be made in writing.
    (b) Requests for notification of the existence of a record should 
state, if the requester is other than the individual to whom the record 
pertains, the relationship of the requester to that individual. (Note 
that requests will not be honored by the Commission pursuant to the 
Privacy Act unless made: (1) By the individual to whom the record 
pertains or (2) by such individual's legal guardian if the individual 
has been declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity 
or age by a court of competent jurisdiction.)
    (c) The Commission will acknowledge requests for the existence of 
records within 10 working days from the time it receives the request and 
will normally notify the requester of the existence or non-existence of 
records within 30 working days from receipt of request.
    (d) No special identity verification is required for individuals who 
wish to know whether a specific system of records pertains to them.

the record available within 15 working days of the request or to inform 
the requester of the need for additional identification.
    (b) In the case of persons making requests by appearing at the 
Commission, reasonable identification such as employment identification 
cards, drivers licenses, or credit cards will normally be accepted as 
sufficient evidence of identity in the absence of any indications to the 
contrary.
    (c) Charges for copies of records will be at the rate of $0.10 per 
photocopy of each page. No charge will be made unless the charge as 
computed above would exceed $3 for each request or related series of 
requests. If a fee in excess of $25 would be required, the requester 
shall be notified and the fee must be tendered before the records will 
be copied. Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check 
or bank draft drawn on a bank in the

[[Page 64]]

United States, or a money order. Remittances shall be made payable to 
the order of the Treasury of the United States and mailed or delivered

Fellowships, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415.
    (d) Individuals will not be denied access to records pertaining to 
them.

address.
    (b) The signature of the requester will be sufficient identification 
for requesting correction of records.
    (c) A request for amendment shall contain an exact description of 
the item or items sought to be amended and specific reasons for the

request has been granted.

review pursuant to Sec. 425.4(f)(2) the Director shall make an 
independent review of the record, using the criteria of Sec. 425.4(e) 
(1) and (2).
    (1) If the Director determines that the record should be amended in 
accordance with the request, the Administrative Officer shall take the 
actions listed in Sec. 425.4(e)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii).
    (2) If the Director, after independent review, determines that the 
record should not be amended in accordance with the request, the 
Administrative Officer shall advise the requester:
    (i) Of the determination and the reasons therefor;
    (ii) Of his or her right to file with the Administrative Officer a 
concise statement of his or her reasons for disagreeing with the refusal 
to amend the record;
    (iii) That the record will be annotated to indicate to anyone 
subsequently having access to it that a statement of disagreement has 
been filed, and that the statement will be made available to anyone to

discretion, include a brief summary of their reasons for refusing to

Sec. 456.3  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    (a) Direct costs. This term means those expenditures which the 
Commission actually incurs in searching for, duplicating and reviewing 
records.
    (b) Search. This term includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents.
    (c) Duplication. This term refers to the process of making a copy of 
a document necessary to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request.
    (d) Review. This term refers to the process of examining documents 
located in response to a request that is for commercial use to determine 
whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld, 
and includes processing any documents for disclosure.
    (e) Commercial use request. This term refers to a request from or on 
behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers 
the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person 
on whose behalf the request is made.
    (f) Educational institution. This term refers to a preschool, a 
public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of 
graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher 
education, an institution of professional education, and an institution 
of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of 
scholarly research.
    (g) Non-commercial scientific institution. This term refers to a 
non-profit institution which is operated solely for the purpose of 
conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to 
promote any particular product or industry.
    (h) Representative of the news media. This term refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means 
information that is about current events or that would be of current 
interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include 
television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and 
publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can 
qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available 
for purchase or subscription by the general public. In the case of 
``freelance'' journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news 
organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting 
publication through that organization, even though not actually employed 
by it. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function 
of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a 
commercial use.

[52 FR 34373, Sept. 11, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 456.4  Public access to information.

    (a) General policy. It is the Commission's general policy to 
facilitate the broadest possible availability and dissemination of 
information to the public. The Commission's staff is available to assist 
the public in obtaining information formally by using the procedures 
herein or informally by discussions with the staff. The Commission's 
staff may, therefore, continue to furnish informally to the public 
information, which, prior to the amendments to the Act contained in 
Public Law 93-502, enacted November 21, 1974, was customarily furnished 
in the regular performance of their duties, provided the staff do so in 
a manner not inconsistent with these regulations. In addition, to the 
extent permitted by other laws, the Commission will make available 
records which it is authorized to withhold under the Act when it 
determines that such disclosure is in the public interest.
    (b) Established place of obtaining information. Information may be 
obtained only from the Commission's offices, which are located at 1325 G 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20576. Its official hours are 8:00 a.m. to 
6:00 p.m., Monday

[[Page 69]]

through Friday, excluding legal holidays.
    (c) Information sources within the Commission. Requests for 
Commission publications, offered for sale or informal requests for 
general information on the Commission should be directed to the Public 
Affairs Officer. All formal requests for agency records pursuant to the 
Act must be directed to the Freedom of Information Officer.

Any request directed initially to the wrong information source will be 
correctly routed by the Commission's staff and the requesting party will 
be so notified. The ten-day time period within which the Commission is 
required to determine whether to comply with a request shall not begin 
to run until the request reaches, or with the exercise of due diligence 
should have reached, the appropriate information source.
    (d) Information routinely available. The following types of 
information shall be routinely available (subject to the fee schedule, 
infra) for public dissemination without recourse to the Commission's 
formal information request procedures unless such information falls 
within one of the exemptions to agency disclosure listed in 5 U.S.C. 
552(b):
    (1) Correspondence between the Commission and the public;
    (2) Executive Director's Recommendations;
    (3) Committee Reports;
    (4) Commission Memorandums of Actions; and
    (5) Maps.

Requests for information, other than maps, shall be directed to the 
Freedom of Information Officer; map requests shall be directed to the 
Public Affairs Officer.
    (e) Formal requests for information. All formal requests for 
information pursuant to the Act shall be made in writing to the Freedom 
of Information Officer. To expedite internal handling of such requests, 
the words ``Freedom of Information Request'' shall appear on the face of 
the envelope bearing such request. The request shall state that the 
request is made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act; shall 
reasonably describe the information sought, including the date the 
Commission received or produced the requested information, if known; 
shall state, pursuant to the fee schedule set forth infra, the maximum 
fee the party making the request would be willing to pay for the 
duplication of the requested records without further approval; and 
shall, if possible, provide a telephone number at which the requesting 
party can be contacted to facilitate handling of the request.
    (f) Commission response to formal requests. The Freedom of 
Information Officer, upon request for information made in compliance 
with these regulations, shall determine within ten days (excepting 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the receipt of any such 
request whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify 
the person making such request of such determination and the reasons 
therefor and of the right of such person to appeal to the head of the 
agency any adverse determination. In unusual circumstances as specified 
infra, the ten-day time limit may be extended by written notice to the 
person making the request setting forth the reasons for such extension 
and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No 
such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for 
more than ten working days. As used in this paragraph, ``unusual 
circumstances'' means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to 
the proper processing of the particular request:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
establishments that are separate from the Commission's offices;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having substantial subject matter interest therein.
    (g) Determination to grant request. If the Freedom of Information 
Officer makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, 
the person making such request will be so notified

[[Page 70]]

in writing. The notice shall also include a description of the 
information to be made available, a statement of the time when and the 
place where such information may be inspected or alternatively, the 
procedure for duplication and delivery (by mail or other means) of the 
information to the requesting party and a statement of the total fees 
chargeable to the requesting person pursuant to the fee schedule infra.
    (h) Determination to deny request-appeal procedure. If the Freedom 
of Information Officer makes a determination to deny, in whole or in 
part, a request for information, he shall so notify the party making the 
request in writing. Any appeal of such determination shall be made in 
writing to the Chairman of the Commission and shall include a brief 
statement of the legal, factual, or other basis for the party's 
objection to the initial decision. The Chairman shall, within twenty 
days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) of the receipt 
of any such appeal determine whether to grant or deny the appeal and 
shall, immediately upon making his decision, give written notice of the 
decision to the party, including a brief statement of the reasons 
therefor.
    (i) Waiver. Whenever a waiver of any of the procedures set forth 
herein would further the purpose of the Act by causing the public 
disclosure of non-confidential information within the time period 
required by the Act, the Freedom of Information Officer may, in the 
context of individual requests for information, waive any of the 
procedural requirements herein.
    (j) Schedule of fees. (1) The Commission may charge the following 
fees for the production of information pursuant to the Act:
    (i) Publications offered for sale--as marked.
    (ii) Commission reports--$0.25/page.
    (iii) Committee reports--$0.25/page.
    (iv) Commission Memorandums of Actions--$0.25/page.
    (v) Transcripts of Commission meetings and Committee meetings--
$0.25/page.
    (vi) Other records--$0.25/page.
    (vii) Map publications--microfilm printout--$1.00/each; ozalid 
maps--$0.30/linear foot.
    (viii) Manual record research: $2.25 per quarter hour if conducted 
by a clerical employee; $5.00 per quarter hour if conducted by a 
professional or managerial employee. The Commission may charge for 
search costs, where applicable, even if there is ultimately no 
disclosure of records.
    (ix) Review charges: $5.00 per quarter hour. The Commission may 
charge for review costs, where applicable, even if there is ultimately 
no disclosure of records.
    (2) The Commission may charge the above-stated fees for the 
production of information pursuant to the Act, based upon the following 
requester classifications:
    (i) Commercial use requester. The Commission may charge requesters 
in this category for all the direct costs of searching for, reviewing 
for release, and duplicating the records sought. In determining whether 
a request is for commercial use, the Commission will look to the use to 
which a requester will put the documents requested. Where a requester 
does not explain the use or where the explanation is insufficient, the 
Commission may draw reasonable inferences from the requester's identity.
    (ii) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution 
requesters. The Commission shall provide documents to requesters in this 
category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the 
first 100 pages. Requesters must show that the request is being made as 
authorized by or under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that 
the records sought are not for a commercial use, but are sought in 
furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational 
institution) or non-commercial scientific research (if the request is 
from a non-commercial scientific institution).
    (iii) Representatives of the news media. The Commission shall 
provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of 
reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.
    (iv) All other requesters. The Commission may charge requesters who 
do not fit into any of the categories above fees

[[Page 71]]

which recover the full reasonable direct costs of searching for and 
reproducing records that are responsive to the request, excluding the 
first 100 pages and first two hours of search time. Requests from record 
subjects for records about themselves filed in the Commission's system 
of records will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the 
Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction.
    (3) The Commission keeps on file a limited quantity of back copies 
of Executive Director's Recommendations, Committee Reports, and 
Commission Memorandums of Actions. The Commission will first attempt to 
fill specific requests for these documents from its supply of back 
copies and until the supply is exhausted, the Commission will provide 
the documents at no charge. Once the supply is exhausted, the requested 
documents will be provided in accord with the fee schedule.
    (4) The Commission may not charge fees to any requester if the cost 
of collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. 
The minimum fee for the production of information will be $2.00 (over 
and above the first free 100 pages and 2 hours search time, where 
applicable). The Commission's Freedom of Information Officer shall 
provide documents furnished under the Act without any charge or at a 
charge reduced below the fees established under Sec. 456.3(j)(1) if 
disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is 
likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the 
operations or activities of the government and it is not primarily in 
the commercial interest of the requester.
    (5) In deciding whether a fee waiver or reduction under Sec. 
456.4(j)(4) is justified, the Commission will consider the following 
factors:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the Government'';
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities;
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of 
the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding''; 
and
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government perations or activities.
    (v) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure; and, if so
    (vi) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of 
the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public interest disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''
    (k) Prior approval or advance deposit of fees. (1) Where the agency 
estimates that duplication, review or search charges are likely to 
exceed $25.00, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of 
fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his or her 
willingness to pay fees as high as those estimated. Where the fees 
anticipated to result from a request are substantially greater than the 
amount estimated in the written request, the persons requesting the 
information shall be immediately notified of the estimated fees and his 
approval of such fees requested. Such person shall also be afforded the 
opportunity to revise his or her request to reduce the fees but satisfy 
his or her needs for information.
    (2) Where the Freedom of Information Officer determines that fees 
are likely to exceed $250.00, the Commission may require advance payment 
of the fee in whole or in part. Where a requester has previously failed 
to pay a fee charged in a timely manner or is presently in arrears, the 
Commission may require the requester to pay the full amount owed and to 
make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fees before 
the agency begins to process a new request or completes a pending 
request.

[[Page 72]]

    (3) The dispatch of any such request for an estimated fee approval 
or advance deposit shall suspend, until a reply is received by the 
Freedom of Information Officer, the period pursuant to 5 U.S.C., 552 and 
paragraph (f) supra within which the Freedom of Information Officer must 
respond to a written request for information.
    (4) A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, 
each seeking portions of a document(s), solely in order to avoid payment 
of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes a requester(s) is 
attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the 
purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Commission may aggregate 
any such requests and charge accordingly.
    (l) Payment of fees. Fees charged a person for the production of 
information must be paid in full prior to release of the information. 
Payment of fees shall be made by a personal check, postal money order or 
bank draft on a bank in the United States, made payable to the order of 
the Treasurer of the United States.

    (i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;

participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not

or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to 
obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same 
level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons than is

effective as those provided to others;
    (v) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
    (vi) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment

receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
    (2) The agency may not deny a qualified handicapped person the

separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs or activities.
    (3) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangments, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose 
or effect of which would--

program in a manner that subjects qualified handicapped persons to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish 
requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified 
entities that subject qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on 
the basis of handicap. However, the programs or activities of entities 
that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, 
covered by this part.

part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 457.141-457.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 457.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 457.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 457.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 457.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by

[[Page 76]]

a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an 
action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons 
receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not 
required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other 
methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The 
agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 457.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped 
persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is 
not required because of Sec. 457.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 457.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. Sec. 457.152-457.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 457.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 457.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR

    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.

reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.

building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended

[[Page 78]]

(42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which

receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.

of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or 
activities.

<R05>
Sec. 500.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 500.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 500.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--

[[Page 82]]

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 500.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not 
required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other 
methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The 
agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 500.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped 
persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is 
not required because of Sec. 500.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--

[[Page 83]]

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped

<R05>
Sec. 500.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. Sec. 500.152-500.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 500.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 500.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.

Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a

the agency.

receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
