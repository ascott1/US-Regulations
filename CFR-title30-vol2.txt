                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 202.51  Scope and definitions.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to Federal and Indian (Tribal and 
allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage Indian 
Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma) and OCS sulfur leases.
    (b) The definitions in subparts C, D, and I of part 206 of this 
title are applicable to subparts B, C, D, and I of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 202.52  Royalties.

    (a) Royalties on oil, gas, and OCS sulfur shall be at the royalty 
rate specified in the lease, unless the Secretary, pursuant to the 
provisions of the applicable mineral leasing laws, reduces, or in the 
case of OCS leases, reduces or eliminates, the royalty rate or net 
profit share set forth in the lease.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, the use of the term royalty(ies) 
includes the term net profit share(s).


<R05>
Sec. 202.53  Minimum royalty.

    For leases that provide for minimum royalty payments, the lessee 
shall pay the minimum royalty as specified in the lease.


<R04>
                    Subpart C--Federal and Indian Oil


<R05>
Sec. 202.100  Royalty on oil.

    (a) Royalties due on oil production from leases subject to the 
requirements of this part, including condensate separated from gas 
without processing, shall be at the royalty rate established by the 
terms of the lease. Royalty shall be paid in value unless MMS requires 
payment in-kind. When paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, 
for royalty purposes, determined pursuant to part 206 of this title 
multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
    (b)(1) All oil (except oil unavoidably lost or used on, or for the 
benefit of, the lease, including that oil used off-lease for the benefit 
of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the MMS or BLM, as 
appropriate) produced from a Federal or Indian lease to which this part 
applies is subject to royalty.
    (2) When oil is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a 
production facility handling production from more than one lease with 
the approval of the MMS or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production 
facility handling unitized or communitized production, only that 
proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) 
necessary to operate the production facility may be used royalty-free.
    (3) Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this section, 
the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

[[Page 7]]

    (c) If BLM determines that oil was avoidably lost or wasted from an 
onshore lease, or that oil was drained from an onshore lease for which 
compensatory royalty is due, or if MMS determines that oil was avoidably 
lost or wasted from an offshore lease, then the value of that oil shall 
be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 206.
    (d) If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost 
oil, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This 
paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.
    (e)(1) In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to 
a federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not 
actually take the proportionate share of the agreement production 
attributable to its lease under the terms of the agreement, the full 
share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the 
agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting 
requirements of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, the value, for royalty purposes, of production 
attributable to unitized or communitized leases will be determined in 
accordance with 30 CFR part 206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR 
part 206, the circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the 
portion of the production to which the lessee was entitled but did not 
take shall be considered as controlling in arriving at the value, for 
royalty purposes, of that portion as though the person actually selling 
or disposing of the production were the lessee of the Federal or Indian 
lease.
    (2) If a Federal or Indian lessee takes less than its proportionate 
share of agreement production, upon request of the lessee MMS may 
authorize a royalty valuation method different from that required by 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purposes of 
these regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which 
royalties are due.
    (3) For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking 
volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any 
month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed 
to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less than their 
proportionate share of the agreement production for that month.
    (4) If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement 
production for any month but royalties are paid on the full volume of 
its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this 
section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior 
periods when the lessee subsequently takes more than its proportionate 
share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a sum of money 
by the other agreement participants to balance its account.
    (f) For production from Federal and Indian leases which are 
committed to federally-approved unitization or communitization 
agreements, upon request of a lessee MMS may establish the value of 
production pursuant to a method other than the method required by the 
regulations in this title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing 
value is consistent with the requirements of the applicable statutes, 
lease terms, and agreement terms; (2) persons with an interest in the 
agreement, including, to the extent practical, royalty interests, are 
given notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation 
method before it is authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons 
with an interest in a Federal or Indian lease committed to the 
agreement, including royalty interests, must agree to use the proposed 
method for valuing production from the agreement for royalty purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 202.150  Royalty on gas.

    (a) Royalties due on gas production from leases subject to the 
requirements of this subpart, except helium produced from Federal 
leases, shall be at the rate established by the terms of the lease. 
Royalty shall be paid in value unless MMS requires payment in kind. When 
paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, for royalty purposes, 
determined pursuant to 30 CFR part 206 of this title multiplied by the 
royalty rate in the lease.
    (b)(1) All gas (except gas unavoidably lost or used on, or for the 
benefit of, the lease, including that gas used off-lease for the benefit 
of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the MMS or BLM, as 
appropriate) produced from a Federal or Indian lease to which this 
subpart applies is subject to royalty.
    (2) When gas is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a 
production facility handling production from more than one lease with 
the approval of MMS or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production facility 
handling unitized or communitized production, only that proportionate 
share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to 
operate the production facility may be used royalty free.
    (3) Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this subpart, 
the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) If BLM determines that gas was avoidably lost or wasted from an 
onshore lease, or that gas was drained from an onshore lease for which 
compensatory royalty is due, or if MMS determines that gas was avoidably 
lost or wasted from an OCS lease, then the value of that gas shall be 
determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 206.
    (d) If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost 
gas, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This 
paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.
    (e)(1) In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to 
a Federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not 
actually take the proportionate share of the production attributable to 
its Federal or Indian lease under the terms of the agreement, the full 
share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the 
agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting 
requirements of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, the value for royalty purposes of production attributable 
to unitized or communitized leases will be determined in accordance with 
30 CFR part 206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR part 206, the 
circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the portion of the 
production to which the lessee was entitled but did not take shall be 
considered as controlling in arriving at the value for royalty purposes 
of that portion, as if the person actually selling or disposing of the 
production were the lessee of the Federal or Indian lease.
    (2) If a Federal or Indian lessee takes less than its proportionate 
share of agreement production, upon request of the lessee MMS may 
authorize a royalty valuation method different from that required by 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purpose of 
these regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which 
royalties are due.
    (3) For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking 
volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any 
month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed 
to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less than their 
proportionate share of the agreement production for that month.
    (4) If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement 
production for any month but royalties are paid on the full volume of 
its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this 
section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior 
periods at the time the lessee subsequently takes more than its 
proportionate share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a 
sum of

[[Page 9]]

money by the other agreement participants to balance its account.
    (f) For production from Federal and Indian leases which are 
committed to federally-approved unitization or communitization 
agreements, upon request of a lessee MMS may establish the value of 
production pursuant to a method other than the method required by the 
regulations in this title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing 
value is consistent with the requirements of the applicable statutes, 
lease terms and agreement terms; (2) to the extent practical, persons 
with an interest in the agreement, including royalty interests, are 
given notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation 
method before it is authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons 
with an interest in a Federal or Indian lease committed to the 
agreement, including royalty interests, must agree to use the proposed 
method for valuing production from the agreement for royalty purposes.

Sec. 202.151  Royalty on processed gas.

    (a)(1) A royalty, as provided in the lease, shall be paid on the 
value of:
    (i) Any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty 
settlement without resorting to processing; and
    (ii) Residue gas and all gas plant products resulting from 
processing the gas produced from a lease subject to this subpart.
    (2) MMS shall authorize a processing allowance for the reasonable, 
actual costs of processing the gas produced from Federal and Indian 
leases. Processing allowances shall be determined in accordance with 30 
CFR part 206 subpart D for gas production from Federal leases and 30 CFR 
part 206 subpart E for gas production from Indian leases.
    (b) A reasonable amount of residue gas shall be allowed royalty free 
for operation of the processing plant, but no allowance shall be made 
for boosting residue gas or other expenses incidental to marketing, 
except as provided in 30 CFR part 206. In those situations where a 
processing plant processes gas from more than one lease, only that 
proportionate share of each lease's residue gas necessary for the 
operation of the processing plant shall be allowed royalty free.
    (c) No royalty is due on residue gas, or any gas plant product 
resulting from processing gas, which is reinjected into a reservoir 
within the same lease, unit area, or communitized area, when the 
reinjection is included in a plan of development or operations and the 
plan has received BLM or MMS approval for onshore or offshore 
operations, respectively, until such time as they are finally produced 
from the reservoir for sale or other disposition off-lease.

Sec. 202.152  Standards for reporting and paying royalties on gas.

    (a)(1) If you are responsible for reporting production or royalties, 
you must:
    (i) Report gas volumes and British thermal unit (Btu) heating 
values, if applicable, under the same degree of water saturation;
    (ii) Report gas volumes in units of 1,000 cubic feet (mcf); and
    (iii) Report gas volumes and Btu heating value at a standard 
pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) and a 
standard temperature base of 60 deg. F.
    (2) The frequency and method of Btu measurement as set forth in the 
lessee's contract shall be used to determine Btu heating values for 
reporting purposes. However, the lessee shall measure the Btu value at 
least semiannually by recognized standard industry testing methods even 
if the lessee's contract provides for less frequent measurement.
    (b)(1) Residue gas and gas plant product volumes shall be reported 
as specified in this paragraph.
    (2) Carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen (N<INF>2</INF>), 
helium (He), residue gas, and any other gas marketed as a separate 
product shall be reported by using the same standards specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) Natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes shall be reported in standard 
U.S. gallons (231 cubic inches) at 60  deg.F.
    (4) Sulfur (S) volumes shall be reported in long tons (2,240 
pounds).

<R05>
Sec. 202.350  Scope and definitions.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all geothermal resources produced 
from Federal geothermal leases issued pursuant to the Geothermal Steam 
Act of 1970, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).
    (b) The definitions in 30 CFR 206.351 are applicable to this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 202.351  Royalties on geothermal resources.

    (a) Royalties on geothermal resources, including byproduct minerals 
and commercially demineralized water, shall be at the royalty rate(s) 
specified in the lease, unless the Secretary of the Interior temporarily 
waives, suspends, or reduces that rate(s). Royalties shall be paid in 
value. The royalty due shall be the value determined pursuant to subpart 
H of 30 CFR part 206 multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
    (b)(1) Royalties are due on all geothermal resources, except those 
specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that are produced from a 
lease and are sold or utilized by the lessee or are reasonably 
susceptible to sale or utilization by the lessee.
    (2) Geothermal resources that are unavoidably lost, as determined by 
the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and geothermal resources that are 
reinjected prior to use on or off the lease, as approved by BLM, are not 
subject to royalty. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) will allow 
free of royalty a reasonable amount of geothermal energy necessary to 
generate electricity for internal powerplant operations or to generate 
electricity returned to the lease for lease operations. If a powerplant 
uses geothermal production from more than one lease, or uses unitized or 
communitized production, only that proportionate share of each lease's 
production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the powerplant may 
be used royalty free. The MMS will also allow free of royalty a 
reasonable amount of commercially demineralized water necessary for 
powerplant operations or otherwise used on or for the benefit of the 
lease.
    (3) Royalties on byproducts are due at the time the recovered 
byproduct is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. Byproducts 
produced and added to stockpiles or inventory do not require payment of 
royalty until the byproducts are sold, utilized, or otherwise finally 
disposed of. The MMS may ask BLM to increase the lease bond to protect 
the lessor's interest when BLM determines that stockpiles or inventories 
become excessive.
    (c) If BLM determines that geothermal resources (including 
byproducts) were avoidably lost or wasted from the lease, or that 
geothermal resources (including byproducts) were drained from the lease 
for which compensatory royalty is due, the value of those geothermal 
resources shall be determined in accordance with subpart H of 30 CFR 
part 206.
    (d) If a lessee receives insurance or other compensation for 
unavoidably lost geothermal resources (including byproducts), royalties 
at the rates specified in the lease are due on the amount of that 
compensation. This paragraph shall not apply to compensation through 
self-insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 202.352  Minimum royalty.

    In no event shall the lessee's annual royalty payments for any 
producing lease be less than the minimum royalty established by the 
lease.

<R05>
Sec. 202.353  Measurement standards for reporting and paying royalties.

    (a) For geothermal resources used to generate electricity, the 
quantity on which royalty is due shall be reported on Form MMS-2014 
(Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance) as follows:
    (1) For geothermal resources valued under arm's-length or non-arm's-
length contracts, quantities shall be reported in:
    (i) Kilowatthours to the nearest whole kilowatthour if the contract 
specifies payment in terms of generated electricity,
    (ii) Thousands of pounds to the nearest whole thousand pounds if the 
contract specifies payment in terms of weight, or
    (iii) Millions of Btu's to the nearest whole million Btu if the 
contract specifies payment in terms of heat or thermal energy.
    (2) For geothermal resources valued by the netback procedure 
pursuant to 30 CFR 206.352(c)(1)(ii) or (d)(1)(ii), the quantities shall 
be reported in kilowatthours to the nearest whole kilowatthour.
    (b) For geothermal resources used in direct utilization processes, 
the quantity on which royalty is due shall be reported on Form MMS-2014 
in:
    (1) Millions of Btu's to the nearest whole million Btu if valuation 
is in terms of thermal energy used or displaced,
    (2) Hundreds of gallons to the nearest hundred gallons of geothermal 
fluid produced if valuation is in terms of volume, or
    (3) Other measurement unit approved by MMS for valuation and 
reporting purposes.
    (c) For byproduct minerals, the quantity on which royalty is due 
shall be reported on Form MMS-2014 consistent with MMS-established 
reporting standards.
    (d) For commercially demineralized water, the quantity on which 
royalty is due shall be reported on Form MMS-2014 in hundreds of gallons 
to the nearest hundred gallons.
    (e) Lessees are not required to report the quality of geothermal 
resources, including byproducts, to MMS. The lessee must maintain 
quality measurements for audit and valuation purposes. Quality 
measurements include, but are not limited to, temperatures and chemical 
analyses for fluid geothermal resources and chemical analyses, weight 
percent, or other purity measurements for byproducts.

Sec. 203.0  What definitions apply to this part?

    Authorized field means a field in a water depth of at least 200 
meters and in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West 
longitude from which no current pre-Act lease produced, other than test 
production, before November 28, 1995.
    Complete application means an original and two copies of the six

203.85 through 203.89, along with one set of digital information, which 
MMS has reviewed and found complete.
    Determination means the binding decision by MMS on whether your 
field qualifies for relief or how large a royalty-suspension volume must 
be to make the field economically viable.
    Draft application means the preliminary set of information and 
assumptions you submit to seek a nonbinding assessment on whether a 
field could be expected to qualify for royalty relief.
    Eligible lease means a lease that results from a lease sale held 
after November 28, 1995; is located in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in water 
depths 200 meters or deeper; lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes 
West longitude; and is offered subject to a royalty-suspension volume 
authorized by statute.
    Expansion project means a project you propose in a Development 
Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or a Supplement approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior after November 28, 1995,

that will increase the ultimate recovery of resources from a pre-Act 
lease and that involves a substantial capital investment (e.g., fixed-
leg platform, subsea template and manifold, tension-leg platform, 
multiple well project, etc.).
    Fabrication (or start of construction) means evidence of 
irreversible commitment to a concept and scale of development, including 
copies of a binding contract between you (as applicant) and a 
fabrication yard, a letter from a fabricator certifying that 
construction has begun, and a receipt for the customary down payment.
    Field means an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple 
reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same general geological 
structural feature or stratigraphic trapping condition. Two or more 
reservoirs may be in a field, separated vertically by intervening 
impervious strata or laterally by local geologic barriers, or both.
    Lease means a lease or unit.
    New production means any production from a current pre-Act lease 
from which no royalties are due on production, other than test 
production, before November 28, 1995. Also, it means any production 
resulting from lease-development activities involving a substantial 
capital investment (e.g., fixed-leg platform, subsea template and 
manifold, tension-leg platform, multiple well project, etc.) on a 
current pre-Act lease under a Development Operations Coordination 
Document--or its supplement--approved by the Secretary of the Interior 
after November, 28, 1995.
    Nonbinding assessment means an opinion by MMS of whether your field 
could qualify for royalty relief. It is based on your draft application 
and does not entitle the field to relief.
    Performance conditions means minimum conditions you must meet, after 
we have granted relief and before production begins, to remain qualified 
for that relief. If you do not meet each one of these performance 
conditions, we consider it a change in material fact significant enough 
to invalidate our original evaluation and approval.
    Pre-Act lease means a lease issued as a result of a lease sale held 
before November 28, 1995; in a water depth of at least 200 meters; and 
in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.
    Production means all oil, gas, and other relevant products you save, 
remove, or sell from a tract or those quantities allocated to your tract 
under a unitization formula, as measured for the purposes of determining 
the amount of royalty payable to the United States.
    Project means any activity that requires at least a permit to drill.
    Redetermination means your request for us to reconsider our 
determination on royalty relief if we have rejected your application or 
if we have granted relief but you want a larger suspension volume.
    Renounce means action you take to give up relief after we have 
granted it and before you start production.
    Sunk costs means costs (as specified in 30 CFR 203.89(a)) of 
exploration, development, and production that you incur after the date 
of first discovery on the field and before the date we receive your 
complete application for royalty relief. Sunk costs include the costs of 
the discovery well qualified as producible under 30 CFR part 250, 
subpart A but do not include any pre-discovery activity costs or lease 
acquisition and holding costs such as cash bonus and rental payments.
    Withdraw means action we take on a field that has qualified for 
relief if you have not met one or more of the performance conditions.

Sec. 203.1  What is MMS's authority to grant royalty relief?

    The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337, as 
amended by the OCS Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA), Public Law 
104-58, authorizes us to grant royalty relief in three situations.
    (a) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(A), we may reduce or eliminate any 
royalty or a net profit share specified for an OCS lease to promote 
increased production.
    (b) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(B), we may reduce, modify, or 
eliminate any royalty or net profit share to promote development, 
increase production, or encourage production of marginal resources on 
certain leases or categories of leases. This authority is restricted to 
leases in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM)

that are west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.
    (c) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), we may suspend royalties for 
designated volumes of new production from any lease if:
    (1) Your lease is in deep water (water at least 200 meters deep);
    (2) Your lease is in designated areas of the GOM (west of 87 
degrees, 30 minutes West longitude);
    (3) Your lease was acquired in a lease sale held before the DWRRA 
(before November 28, 1995);
    (4) We find that your new production would not be economic without 
royalty relief; and
    (5) Your lease is on a field that did not produce before enactment 
of the DWRRA, or if you propose a project to significantly expand 
production under a Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) 
or a supplementary DOCD, that MMS approved after November 28, 1995.

Sec. 203.2  When can I get royalty relief?

    We can reduce or suspend royalties for OCS leases or projects that 
meet the criteria in the following table.

Sec. 203.3  Why must I pay a fee to request royalty relief?

    (a) When you submit an application or ask for a preview assessment, 
you must include a fee to reimburse us for our costs of processing your 
application or assessment. Federal policy and law require us to recover 
the cost of services that confer special benefits to identifiable non-
Federal recipients. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act (31 U.S.C. 
9701), Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25, and the Omnibus 
Appropriations Bill (Pub. L. 104-133, 110 Stat. 1321, April 26, 1996) 
authorize us to collect these fees.
    (b) We will specify the necessary fees for each of the types of 
royalty-relief applications and possible MMS audits in a Notice to 
Lessees. We will periodically update the fees to reflect changes in 
costs as well as provide other information necessary to administer 
royalty relief.

                  Royalty Relief for End-of-life Leases


<R05>
Sec. 203.50  Who may apply for end-of-life royalty relief?

    You may apply for royalty relief in two situations.
    (a) Your end-of-life lease (as defined in Sec. 203.2) is an oil and 
gas lease and has average daily production of at least 100 barrels of 
oil equivalent (BOE) per month (as calculated in Sec. 203.73) in at 
least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are 
considered the qualifying months.
    (b) Your end-of-life lease is other than an oil and gas lease (e.g., 
sulphur) and has production in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The 
most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months.


<R05>
Sec. 203.51  How do I apply for end-of-life royalty relief?

    You must submit a complete application and the required fee to the 
appropriate MMS Regional Director. Your MMS regional office will provide 
specific guidance on the report formats. A complete application for 
relief includes:
    (a) An administrative information report (specified in Sec. 203.83) 
and
    (b) A net revenue and relief justification report (specified in 
Sec. 203.84).


<R05>
Sec. 203.52  What criteria must I meet to get relief?

    (a) To qualify for relief, you must demonstrate that the sum of 
royalty payments over the 12 qualifying months exceeds 75 percent of the 
sum of net revenues (before-royalty revenues minus allowable costs, as 
defined in Sec. 203.84).
    (b) To re-qualify for relief, e.g., either applying for additional 
relief on top of relief already granted, or applying for relief sometime 
after your earlier agreement terminated, you must demonstrate that:
    (1) You have met the criterion listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, and

[[Page 17]]

    (2) The 12 required qualifying months of operation have occurred 
under the current royalty arrangement.


<R05>
Sec. 203.53  What relief will MMS grant?

    (a) If we approve your application and you meet certain conditions, 
we will reduce the pre-application effective royalty rate by one-half on 
production up to the relief volume amount. If you produce more than the 
relief volume amount:
    (1) We will impose a royalty rate equal to 1.5 times the effective 
royalty rate on your additional production up to twice the relief volume 
amount; and
    (2) We will impose a royalty rate equal to the effective rate on all 
production greater than twice the relief volume amount.
    (b) Regardless of the level of production or prices (see 
Sec. 203.54), royalty payments due under end-of-life relief will not 
exceed the royalty obligations that would have been due at the effective 
royalty rate.
    (1) The effective royalty rate is the average lease rate paid on 
production during the 12 qualifying months.
    (2) The relief volume amount is the average monthly BOE production 
for the 12 qualifying months.


<R05>
Sec. 203.54  How does my relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease operate if prices rise sharply?

    In those months when your current reference price rises by at least 
25 percent above your base reference price, you must pay the effective 
royalty rate on all monthly production.
    (a) Your current reference price is a weighted average of daily 
closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas 
over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
    (b) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing 
prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas during the 
qualifying months; and
    (c) Your weighting factors are the proportions of your total 
production volume (in BOE) provided by oil and gas during the qualifying 
months.


<R05>
Sec. 203.55  Under what conditions can my end-of-life royalty relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease be ended?

    (a) If you have an end-of-life royalty relief arrangement, you may 
renounce it at any time. The lease rate will return to the effective 
rate during the qualifying period in the first full month following our 
receipt of your renouncement of the relief arrangement.
    (b) If you pay the effective lease rate for 12 consecutive months, 
we will terminate your relief. The lease rate will return to the 
effective rate in the first full month following this termination.
    (c) We may stipulate in the letter of approval for individual cases 
certain events that would cause us to terminate relief because they are 
inconsistent with an end-of-life situation.


<R05>
Sec. 203.56  Does relief transfer when a lease is assigned?

    Yes. Royalty relief is based on the lease circumstances, not 
ownership. It transfers upon lease assignment.

Royalty Relief For Deep Water Expansion Projects And Pre-Act Deep Water 
                                 Leases


<R05>
Sec. 203.60  Who may apply for deep water royalty relief?

    Under conditions in Secs. 203.61(b) and 203.62, you may apply for 
royalty relief if:
    (a) You are a lessee of a lease in water at least 200 meters deep in 
the GOM and lying wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude;
    (b) We have assigned your lease to a field (as defined in 
Sec. 203.0); and
    (c) You hold a pre-Act lease on an authorized field (as defined in 
Sec. 203.0) or you propose an expansion project (as defined in 
Sec. 203.0).


<R05>
Sec. 203.61  How do I assess my chances for getting relief?

    You may ask for a nonbinding assessment (a formal opinion on whether 
a field would qualify for royalty relief) before turning in your first 
complete application on an authorized field. This field must have a 
qualifying well under 30 CFR part 250, subpart A, or be on a

[[Page 18]]

lease that has allocated production under an approved unit agreement.
    (a) To request a nonbinding assessment, you must:
    (1) Submit a draft application in the format and detail specified in 
guidance from the MMS regional office for the GOM;
    (2) Propose to drill at least one more appraisal well if you get a 
favorable assessment; and
    (3) Pay a fee under Sec. 203.3.
    (b) You must wait at least 90 days after receiving our assessment to 
apply for relief under Sec. 203.62.
    (c) This assessment is not binding because a complete application 
may contain more accurate information that does not support our original 
assessment. It will help you decide whether your proposed inputs for 
evaluating economic viability and your supporting data and assumptions 
are adequate.

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 2619, Jan. 16, 1998, Sec. 203.61 was 
revised. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 203.62  How do I apply for relief?

    You must send a complete application and the required fee to the MMS 
GOM Regional Director.
    (a) Your application for deep water royalty relief must include an 
original and two copies (one set of digital information) of:
    (1) Administrative information report;
    (2) Deep water economic viability and relief justification report;
    (3) G&G report;
    (4) Engineering report;
    (5) Production report; and
    (6) Deep water cost report.
    (b) Section 203.82 explains why we are authorized to require these 
reports.
    (c) Sections 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89 describe what 
these reports must include. The MMS GOM Regional Office will guide you 
on the format for the required reports.


<R05>
Sec. 203.63  Does my application have to include all leases in the field?

    For authorized fields, we will accept only one joint application for 
all leases that are part of the designated field on the date of 
application, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and 
Sec. 203.64.
    (a) The Regional Director maintains a Field Names Master List with 
updates of all leases in each designated field.
    (b) To avoid sharing proprietary data with other lessees on the 
field, you may submit your proprietary G&G report separately from the 
rest of your application. Your application is not complete until we 
receive all the required information for each lease on the field. We 
will not disclose proprietary data when explaining our assumptions and 
reasons for our determinations under Sec. 203.67.
    (c) We will not require a joint application if you show good cause 
and honest effort to get all lessees in the field to participate. If you 
must exclude a lease from your application because its lessee will not 
participate, that lease is ineligible for the royalty relief for the 
designated field.


<R05>
Sec. 203.64  How many applications may I file on a field?

    You may file one complete application for royalty relief during the 
life of the field. However, you may send another application if:
    (a) You are eligible to apply for a redetermination under 
Sec. 203.74;
    (b) You apply for royalty relief for an expansion project;
    (c) You withdraw the application before we make a determination; or
    (d) You apply for end-of-life royalty relief.


<R05>
Sec. 203.65  How long will MMS take to evaluate my application?

    (a) We will determine within 20 working days if your application for 
royalty relief is complete. If your application is incomplete, we will 
explain in writing what it needs. If you withdraw a complete 
application, you may reapply.
    (b) We will evaluate your first application on a field within 180 
days and a redetermination under Sec. 203.75 within 120 days after we 
say it is complete.
    (c) We may ask to extend the review period for your application 
under the conditions in the following table.

[[Page 19]]

We need more records to audit sunk costs...............  Ask to extend the 120-day or 180-day evaluation period.
                                                          The extension we request will equal the number of days

We need more data, explanations, or revision...........  Ask to extend the 120-day or 180-day evaluation period.
                                                          The extension we request will equal the number of days
                                                          between when you receive our request and the day we   
                                                          receive the information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) We may change your assumptions under Sec. 203.62 if our 
technical evaluation reveals others that are more appropriate. We may 
consult with you before a final decision and will explain any changes.
    (e) We will notify all designated lease operators within a field 
when royalty relief is granted.


<R05>
Sec. 203.66  What happens if MMS does not act in the time allowed under Sec. 203.65, including any extensions?

    If we do not act within the timeframes established in Sec. 203.65, 
the conditions in the following table apply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 203.67  What economic criteria must I meet to get royalty relief on an authorized field or expansion project?

    Your field or project must require royalty relief to be economic and 
must become economic with this relief. That is, we will not approve 
applications if we determine that royalty relief cannot make the field 
or project economically viable.


<R05>
Sec. 203.68  What pre-application costs will MMS consider in determining economic viability?

    (a) We will not consider ineligible costs as set forth in 
Sec. 203.89(h) in determining economic viability for purposes of royalty 
relief.
    (b) We will consider sunk costs (allowable expenditures on and after 
the discovery well as specified in Sec. 203.89(a)) in accordance with 
the following table.

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
          We will--                              When--                 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Include sunk costs...........  The field has not produced, other than   
                                test production, before the application 
                                submission date.                        
Not include sunk costs.......  Determining whether an authorized field  
                                can become economic with any relief (see
                                Sec.  203.67).                          
Not include sunk costs.......  Determining how much suspension volume is
                                necessary to make development economic  
                                (see Sec.  203.69(c)).                  
Not include sunk costs.......  Evaluating an expansion project.         
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 203.69  If my application is approved, what royalty relief will I receive?

    This section applies only to leases on which you have applied for 
and received a royalty-suspension volume under section 302 of the DWRRA. 
We will not collect royalties on a specified suspension volume for your 
field. Suspension amounts include volumes allocated to a lease under an 
approved unit agreement and exclude any volumes that do not bear a 
royalty under the lease or the regulations of this chapter.
    (a) For authorized fields, the minimum royalty-suspension volumes 
are:
    (1) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) for fields in 200 
to 400 meters of water;
    (2) 52.5 MMBOE for fields in 400 to 800 meters of water; and
    (3) 87.5 MMBOE for fields in more than 800 meters of water.
    (b) If the application for the field includes leases in different 
categories of water depth, we apply the minimum royalty-suspension 
volume for the deepest lease then associated with the field. We base the 
water depth and makeup of a field on the water-depth delineations in the 
``Royalty Suspension Areas Map'' and the Field Names Master List and 
updates in effect at the time your application is approved. These 
publications are available from the GOM Regional Office.
    (c) You will get a royalty-suspension volume above the minimum if we 
determine that you need more to make developing the field economic.
    (d) For expansion projects, the minimum suspension volumes do not 
apply. If we determine that your expansion project may be economic only 
with relief, we will determine and grant you

[[Page 21]]

the royalty-suspension volume necessary to make the project economic.
    (e) A royalty-suspension volume will continue through the end of the 
month in which cumulative production reaches that volume. The cumulative 
production is from all the leases in the authorized field or expansion 
project that are entitled to share the royalty suspension volume.


<R05>
Sec. 203.70  What information must I provide after MMS approves relief?

    You must submit reports to us as indicated in the following table. 
Sections 203.81 and 203.90 through 203.91 describe what these reports 
must include. MMS's GOM Regional Office will tell you the formats.

<R05>
Sec. 203.71  How does MMS allocate a field's suspension volume between my lease and other leases on my field?

    The allocation depends on when production occurs, when the lease is 
assigned to the field, and whether we award the volume suspension by an 
approved application or establish it in the lease terms.
    (a) If your authorized field has an approved royalty-suspension 
volume under Secs. 203.67 and 203.69, we will suspend payment of 
royalties on production from all applying leases in the field until 
their cumulative production equals the approved volume. The following 
conditions also apply as appropriate:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) If your authorized field has an automatic royalty-suspension 
volume established under Sec. 260.110 of this chapter, we will suspend 
payment of royalties on production from all eligible leases in the field 
until their cumulative production equals the automatic volume. The 
following conditions also apply as appropriate:

                                                     the application.   
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) If you have an expansion project with more than one lease, the 
royalty-suspension volume for each lease equals that lease's actual 
incremental production from the project (or production allocated under 
an approved unit agreement) until cumulative incremental production for 
all leases in the project equals the project's approved royalty-
suspension volume.
    (d) You may receive a royalty-suspension volume only if your entire 
lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. If the field 
lies on both sides of this meridian, only leases located entirely west 
of the meridian will receive a royalty-suspension volume.


<R05>
Sec. 203.72  Can my lease receive more than one suspension volume?

    Yes. You may apply for royalty relief that involves more than one 
suspension volume under Sec. 203.62 in two circumstances.
    (a) Each field that includes your lease may receive a separate 
royalty-suspension volume, if it meets the evaluation criteria of 
Sec. 203.67.
    (b) An expansion project on your lease may receive a separate 
royalty-suspension volume, even if we have already granted a royalty-
suspension volume to the field that encompasses the project. But the 
reserves associated with the project must not have been part of our 
original determination, and the project must meet the evaluation 
criteria of Sec. 203.67.


<R05>
Sec. 203.73  How do suspension volumes apply to natural gas?

    You must measure natural gas production under the royalty-suspension 
volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured in 
accordance with 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil 
equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 203.74  When will MMS reconsider its determination?

    Under certain conditions, you may request a redetermination if we 
deny your application, if you want your approved royalty-suspension 
volume to change, after we withdraw approval, or after you renounce 
royalty relief. To be eligible for a redetermination, at least one of 
the following three conditions must occur.
    (a) You have significant new G&G data and you previously have not 
either requested a redetermination or reapplied for relief after we 
withdrew approval or you relinquished royalty relief. ``Significant'' 
means that the new G&G data:
    (1) Results from drilling new wells or getting new three-dimensional 
seismic data and information (but not reinterpreting old data);
    (2) Did not exist at the time of the earlier application; and
    (3) Changes your estimates of gross resource size, quality, or 
projected flow rates enough to materially affect the results of our 
earlier determination.
    (b) Your current reference price decreases by more than 25 percent 
from your base reference price. For royalty relief on deep water 
expansion projects and pre-Act deep water leases:
    (1) Your current reference price is a weighted average of daily 
closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas 
over the most recent full 12-calendar months;
    (2) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing 
prices on the NYMEX for oil and gas for the most recent full 12-calendar 
months preceding the date of your most recent, complete application for 
this royalty relief; and
    (3) The weighting factors are the proportions of the total 
production volume (in BOE) for oil and gas associated

[[Page 23]]

with the most likely scenario (identified in Secs. 203.85 and 203.88) 
from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.
    (c) Before starting to build your development and production system, 
you have revised your estimated development costs, and they are more 
than 120 percent of the eligible development costs associated with the 
most likely scenario from your most recent, complete application for 
this royalty relief.
[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998; 63 FR 24747, May 5, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 203.75  What risk do I run if I request a redetermination?

    If you request a redetermination after we have granted you a 
suspension volume, you could lose some or all of the previously granted 
relief. This can happen because you must file a new complete application 
and pay the required fee, as discussed in Sec. 203.62. We will evaluate 
your application under Sec. 203.67 using the conditions prevailing at 
the time of your redetermination request. In our evaluation, we may find 
that you should receive a larger, equivalent, smaller, or no suspension 
volume. This means we could find that you do not qualify for the amount 
of relief previously granted or for any relief at all.


<R05>
Sec. 203.76  When might MMS withdraw or reduce the approved size of my relief?

    We will withdraw approval of relief for any of the following 
reasons.
    (a) You change the type of development system proposed in your 
application (e.g., change from a fixed platform to floating production 
system, tension leg platform to a moored catenary system such as a SPAR 
platform, an independent development and production system to one with 
subsea wells tied back to a host production facility, etc.).
    (b) You do not start building the proposed development and 
production system within 1 year of the date we approved your 
application--unless the MMS Director grants you an extension under 
Sec. 203.79(c).
    (c) You do not tell us in your post-production development report 
(Sec. 203.70), and we find out your actual development costs are less 
than 80 percent of the eligible development costs estimated in your 
application's most likely scenario. Development costs are those incurred 
between the application submission date and start of production. If you 
tell us about this result in the post-production development report, you 
may retain 50 percent of the original royalty-suspension volume.
    (d) We granted you a royalty-suspension volume after you qualified 
for a redetermination under Sec. 203.74(c), and we find out your actual 
development costs are less than 90 percent of the eligible development 
costs associated with your application's most likely scenario. 
Development costs are those expenditures defined in Sec. 203.89(b) 
incurred between your application submission date and start of 
production.
    (e) You do not send us the fabrication confirmation report or the 
post-production development report, or you provide false or 
intentionally inaccurate information that was material to our granting 
royalty relief under this section. You must pay royalties and late-
payment interest determined under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and Sec. 218.54 of this 
chapter on all volumes for which you used the royalty suspension. You 
also may be subject to penalties under other provisions of law.


<R05>
Sec. 203.77  May I voluntarily give up relief if conditions change?

    You may renounce approved royalty-suspension volumes as soon as you 
anticipate violating one of the withdrawal conditions, or for any other 
reason, before you start production.


<R05>
Sec. 203.78  Do I keep relief if prices rise significantly?

    No, you must pay full royalties if prices rise above the statutory 
base price for light sweet crude oil or natural gas.
    (a) Suppose the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX light 
sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $28.00 per 
barrel, as adjusted in paragraph (f) of this section. In this case, we 
retract the royalty relief authorized in this section and you must:

[[Page 24]]

    (1) Pay royalties on all oil production for the previous year at the 
lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 
Sec. 218.54 of this chapter) by April 30 of the current calendar year, 
and
    (2) Pay royalties on all your oil production in the current year.
    (b) Suppose the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX 
natural gas prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $3.50 per 
million British thermal units (Btu), as adjusted in paragraph (f) of 
this section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in 
this section and you must:
    (1) Pay royalties on all natural gas production for the previous 
year at the lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 
1721 and Sec. 218.54 of this chapter) by April 30 of the current 
calendar year, and
    (2) Pay royalties on all your natural gas production in the current 
year.
    (c) Production under both paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume.
    (d) You are entitled to a refund or credit, with interest, of 
royalties paid on any production (that counts as part of the royalty-
suspension volume):
    (1) Of oil if the arithmetic average of the closing oil prices for 
the current calendar year is $28.00 per barrel or less, as adjusted in 
paragraph (f) of this section, and
    (2) Of gas if the arithmetic average of the closing natural gas 
prices for the current calendar year is $3.50 per million Btu or less, 
as adjusted in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) You must follow our regulations in part 230 of this chapter for 
receiving refunds or credits.
    (f) We change the prices referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) 
of this section during each calendar year after 1994. These prices 
change by the percentage the implicit price deflator for the gross 
domestic product changed during the preceding calendar year.


<R05>
Sec. 203.79  How do I appeal MMS's decisions related to Deep Water Royalty Relief?

    (a) Once we have designated your lease as part of a field and 
notified you and other affected operators of the designation, you can 
request reconsideration by sending the MMS Director a letter within 15 
days that also states your reasons. The MMS Director's response is the 
final agency action.
    (b) Our decisions on your application for relief from paying royalty 
under Sec. 203.67 and the royalty-suspension volumes under Sec. 203.69 
are final agency actions.
    (c) If you cannot start construction by the deadline in 
Sec. 203.76(b) for reasons beyond your control (e.g., strike at the 
fabrication yard), you may request an extension up to 1 year by writing 
the MMS Director and stating your reasons. The MMS Director's response 
is the final agency action.
    (d) We will notify you of all final agency actions by certified 
mail, return receipt requested. Final agency actions are not subject to 
appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 290 and 
43 CFR part 4. They are judicially reviewable under section 10(a) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 702) only if you file an action 
within 30 days of the date you receive our decision.

<R05>
Sec. 203.81  What supplemental reports do royalty-relief applications require?

    (a) You must send us the supplemental reports listed below that 
apply to your field. Secs. 203.83 through 203.91 describe these reports 
in detail.

<R05>
Sec. 203.82  What is MMS's authority to collect this information?

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information 
collection requirements in part 203 under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and 
assigned OMB control number 1010-0071.
    (a) We use the information to determine whether royalty relief will 
result in production that wouldn't otherwise occur. We rely largely on 
your information to make these determinations.
    (1) Your application for royalty relief must contain enough 
information on finances, economics, reservoirs, G&G characteristics, 
production, and engineering estimates for us to determine whether:
    (i) We should grant relief under the law, and
    (ii) The requested relief will ultimately recover more resources and 
return a reasonable profit on project investments.
    (2) Your fabricator confirmation and post-production development 
reports must contain enough information for us to verify that your 
application reasonably represented your plans.
    (b) Applicants (respondents) are Federal OCS oil and gas lessees. 
Applications are required to obtain or retain a benefit. Therefore, if 
you apply for royalty relief, you must provide this information. We will 
protect information considered proprietary under applicable law and 
under regulations at Sec. 203.63(b) and part 250 of this chapter.
    (c) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires us to inform you 
that we may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond 
to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    (d) You may send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of 
information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Minerals 
Management Service, Mail Stop 4230, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC

Sec. 203.84  What is in a net revenue and relief justification report?

    This report presents cash flow data for 12 qualifying months, using 
the format specified in the ``Guidelines for the Application, Review, 
Approval, and Administration of Royalty Relief for End-of-Life Leases'', 
U.S. Department of the Interior, MMS. Qualifying months for an oil and 
gas lease are the most recent 12 months out of the last 15 months that 
you produced at least 100 BOE per day on average. Qualifying months for 
other than oil and gas leases are the most recent 12 of the last 15 
months having some production.

    (1) Lease production subject to royalty;
    (2) Total revenues;
    (3) Royalty payments out of production;
    (4) Total allowable costs; and
    (5) Transportation and processing costs.
    (b) Do not include in your cash flow table the non-allowable costs 
listed at 30 CFR 220.013 (a), (b), and (d) through (k) or:
    (1) OCS rental payments on the lease(s) in the application;
    (2) Damages and losses;
    (3) Taxes;
    (4) Any costs associated with exploratory activities;
    (5) Civil or criminal fines or penalties;
    (6) Fees for your royalty relief application; and

overrides or other forms of payment for acquiring the lease).
    (c) We may, in reviewing and evaluating your application, disallow 
costs when you have not shown they are necessary to operate the lease, 
or if it appears you spent the money only to qualify for royalty relief.


<R05>
Sec. 203.85  What is in an economic viability and relief justification report?

    This report should show that your project appears economic without 
royalties and sunk costs using the RSVP model we provide. The format of 
the report and the assumptions and parameters we specify are found in 
the ``Guidelines for the Application, Review, Approval and

Department of the Interior, MMS. Clearly justify each parameter you set 
in every scenario you specify in the RSVP. You may provide supplemental 
information, including your own model and results. The economic 
viability and relief justification report must contain the following 
items for an oil and gas lease.
    (a) Economic assumptions we provide which include:
    (1) Starting oil and gas prices;
    (2) Real price growth;
    (3) Real cost growth or decline rate, if any;

    (1) All costs, gross production, and scheduling are consistent with 
the data in the G&G, engineering, production, and cost reports 
(Secs. 203.86 through 203.89) and
    (2) The development and production scenarios provided in the various 
reports are consistent with each other and with the proposed development 
system. You can use up to three scenarios (conservative, most likely, 
and optimistic), but you must link each to a specific range on the 
distribution of resources from the RSVP Resource Module.

scale associated with each of up to three production profiles 
(conservative, most likely, optimistic) provided in the production 
report for your field (Sec. 203.88). Each development scenario and 
production profile must denote the likely events should the field size 
turn out to be within a range represented by one of the three segments 
of the field size distribution. If you send in fewer than three 
scenarios, you must explain why fewer scenarios are more efficient 
across the whole field size distribution.

Sec. 203.88  What is in a production report?

    This report supports your development and production timing and 
product quality expectations and must contain the following elements.
    (a) Production profiles by well completion and field that specify 
the actual and projected production by year for each of the following 
products: oil, condensate, gas, and associated gas. The production from 
each profile must be consistent with a specific level of reserves and

    (b) Production drive mechanisms for each reservoir.


<R05>
Sec. 203.89  What is in a deep water cost report?

    This report lists all actual and projected costs for your field, 
must explain and document the source of each

[[Page 29]]

cost estimate, and must identify the following elements.
    (a) Sunk cost, which are all your eligible post-discovery 
exploration, development, and production expenses (no third party 
costs), and also include the eligible costs of the discovery well on the 
field. Report them in nominal dollars and only if you have 
documentation. We count sunk costs in an evaluation (specified in 
Sec. 203.68) as after-tax expenses, using nominal dollar amounts.
    (b) Appraisal, delineation and development costs. Base them on 
actual spending, current authorization for expenditure, engineering 
estimates, or analogous projects. These costs cover:
    (1) Platform well drilling and average depth;
    (2) Platform well completion;
    (3) Subsea well drilling and average depth;
    (4) Subsea well completion;
    (5) Production system (platform); and
    (6) Flowline fabrication and installation.
    (c) Production costs based on historical costs, engineering 
estimates, or analogous projects. These costs cover:
    (1) Operation;
    (2) Equipment; and
    (3) Existing royalty overrides (we will not use the royalty

    (2) Trunkline and tieback lines; and
    (3) Gas plant processing for natural gas liquids.
    (e) Abandonment costs, based on historical costs, engineering 
estimates, or analogous projects. You should provide the costs to plug 
and abandon only wells and to remove only production systems for which 
you have not incurred costs as of the time of application submission. 
You should also include a point estimate or distribution of prospective 
salvage value for all potentially reusable facilities and materials, 
along with the source and an explanation of the figures provided.
    (f) A set of cost estimates consistent with each one of up to three 
field-development scenarios and production profiles (conservative, most 
likely, optimistic). You should express costs in constant real dollar 
terms for the base year. You may also express the uncertainty of each 
cost estimate with a minimum and maximum percentage of the base value.
    (g) A spending schedule. You should provide costs for each year (in 
real dollars) for each category in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this 
section.
    (h) A summary of other costs which are ineligible for evaluating 
your need for relief. These costs cover:
    (1) Expenses before first discovery on the field;
    (2) Cash bonuses;
    (3) Fees for royalty relief applications;
    (4) Lease rentals, royalties, and payments of net profit share and 
net revenue share;

overrides or other forms of payment for acquiring a financial position 
in a lease, expenditures for plugging wells and removing and abandoning 
facilities that existed on the application submission date).


<R05>
Sec. 203.90  What is in a fabricator's confirmation report?

    This report shows you have committed in a timely way to the approved 
system for production. This report must include the following (or its 
equivalent for unconventionally acquired systems):
    (a) A copy of the contract(s) under which the fabrication yard is 
building the approved system for you;
    (b) A letter from the contractor building the system to the MMS's 
GOM Regional Supervisor--Production and Development, certifying when 
construction started on your system; and
    (c) Evidence of an appropriate down payment or equal action that 
you've started acquiring the approved system.

[[Page 30]]


<R05>
Sec. 203.91  What is in a post-production development report?

    For each cost category in the deep water cost report, you must 
compare actual costs up to the date when production starts to your 
planned pre-production costs. If your application included more than one 
development scenario, you need to compare actual costs with those in 
your scenario of most likely development. Keep supporting records for 
these costs and make them available to us on request.

<R05>
Sec. 206.50  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all oil production from Indian 
(Tribal and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage 
Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma). The purpose of this subpart 
is to establish the value of production, for royalty purposes, 
consistent with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and 
lease terms.
    (b) If the specific provisions of any Federal statute, treaty, 
settlement agreement between the Indian lessor and a lessee resulting 
from administrative or judicial litigation, or oil and gas lease subject 
to the requirements of this subpart are inconsistent with any regulation 
in this subpart, then the statute, treaty, lease provision or settlement 
agreement shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) All royalty payments made to MMS or Indian Tribes are subject to 
audit and adjustment.
    (d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the 
trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the 
administration of Indian oil and gas leases are discharged in accordance 
with the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, 
and lease terms.


<R05>
Sec. 206.51  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart:
    Allowance means an approved or an MMS-initially accepted deduction 
in

[[Page 32]]

determining value for royalty purposes. Transportation allowance means 
an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for 
moving oil to a point of sale or point of delivery off the lease, unit 
area, or communitized area, excluding gathering, or an approved or MMS-
initially accepted deduction for costs of such transportation, 
determined by this subpart.
    Area means a geographic region at least as large as the defined 
limits of an oil and/or gas field in which oil and/or gas lease products 
have similar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the market place between independent, nonaffiliated 
persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For 
purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another 
person. For purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of 
ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms 
of ownership: ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control; 
ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control; and 
ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol 
which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, 
including the existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding 
any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, 
either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. MMS may 
require the lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-
length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements 
of this definition for that production month, as well as when the 
contract was executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.
    BIA means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the 
Interior.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees 
of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to 
processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that 
results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially 
in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface 
oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs 
vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually 
given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil 
and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields 
are located.
    Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central 
accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized 
area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, 
unit, or communitized area as approved by BLM operations personnel for 
onshore leases.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the 
disposition of the oil produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not 
limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as 
dehydration, measurement, and/or gathering to the extent that the lessee 
is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Indian lessor. Gross 
proceeds, as applied to oil, also includes, but is not limited to, 
reimbursements for harboring or terminating fees. Tax reimbursements are 
part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Indian 
royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Monies and other 
consideration, including the forms of consideration identified in this 
paragraph,

[[Page 33]]

to which a lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does 
not seek to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross 
proceeds.
    Indian allottee means any Indian for whom land or an interest in 
land is held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to 
Federal restriction against alienation.
    Indian Tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, 
community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any 
land or interest in land is held in trust by the United States or which 
is subject to Federal restriction against alienation.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a 
mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or 
extraction of, or removal of lease products--or the land area covered by 
that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lease products means any leased minerals attributable to, 
originating from, or allocated to Indian leases.
    Lessee means any person to whom an Indian Tribe, or an Indian 
allottee issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an 
obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This 
includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an 
operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed 
the royalty payment responsibility.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products which have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
    Load oil means any oil which has been used with respect to the 
operation of oil or gas wells for wellbore stimulation, workover, 
chemical treatment, or production purposes. It does not include oil used 
at the surface to place lease production in marketable condition.
    Marketable condition means lease products which are sufficiently 
free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be 
accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or 
area.
    Marketing affiliate means an affiliate of the lessee whose function 
is to acquire only the lessee's production and to market that 
production.
    Minimum royalty means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the 
lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing 
regulations.
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Net-back method (or workback method) means a method for calculating 
market value of oil at the lease. Under this method, costs of 
transportation, processing, or manufacturing are deducted from the 
proceeds received for the oil and any extracted, processed, or 
manufactured products, or from the value of the oil or any extracted, 
processed, or manufactured products at the first point at which 
reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a sale 
under an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of such 
products, to ascertain value at the lease.
    Net profit share (for applicable Indian lessees) means the specified 
share of the net profit from production of oil and gas as provided in 
the agreement.
    Oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase 
in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric 
pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and is 
marketed or used as such. Condensate recovered in lease separators or 
field facilities is considered to be oil. For purposes of royalty 
valuation, the term tar sands is defined separately from oil.
    Oil shale means a kerogen-bearing rock (i.e., fossilized, insoluble, 
organic material). Separation of kerogen from oil shale may take place 
in situ or in surface retorts by various processes. The kerogen, upon 
distillation, will yield liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Posted price means the price specified in publicly available posted 
price bulletins, onshore terminal postings, or other price notices net 
of all adjustments for quality (e.g., API gravity, sulfur content, etc.) 
and location for oil in marketable condition.

[[Page 34]]

    Processing means any process designed to remove elements or 
compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including 
absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally 
take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, 
mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression 
are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or 
temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of oil are made. Selling arrangements 
are described by illustration in MMS Royalty Management Program Oil and 
Gas Payor Handbook.
    Spot sales agreement means a contract wherein a seller agrees to 
sell to a buyer a specified amount of oil at a specified price over a 
fixed period, usually of short duration, which does not normally require 
a cancellation notice to terminate, and which does not contain an 
obligation, nor imply an intent, to continue in subsequent periods.
    Tar sands means any consolidated or unconsolidated rock (other than 
coal, oil shale, or gilsonite) that either contains a hydrocarbonaceous 
material with a gas-free viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise at 
original reservoir temperature, or contains quarrying.


<R05>
Sec. 206.52  Valuation standards.

    (a)(1) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of oil from 
leases subject to this subpart shall be the value determined under this 
section less applicable allowances determined under this subpart.
    (2)(i) For any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may 
consider the highest price paid or offered for a major portion of 
production (major portion) in determining value for royalty purposes, if 
data are available to compute a major portion, MMS will, where 
practicable, compare the value determined in accordance with this 
section with the major portion. The value to be used in determining the 
value of production, for royalty purposes, shall be the higher of those 
two values.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, major portion means the highest 
price paid or offered at the time of production for the major portion of 
oil production from the same field. The major portion will be calculated 
using like-quality oil sold under arm's-length contracts from the same 
field (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same 
area) for each month. All such oil production will be arrayed from 
highest price to lowest price (at the bottom).
    The major portion is that price at which 50 percent (by volume) plus 
1 barrel of the oil (starting from the bottom) is sold.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of oil which is sold under an arm's-length 
contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section. The 
lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is 
arm's-length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, 
is subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this 
section, oil which is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's 
marketing affiliate and then sold by the marketing affiliate under an 
arm's-length contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph 
based upon the sale by the marketing affiliate.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the oil. If the 
contract does not reflect the total consideration, then MMS may require 
that the oil sold under that contract be valued in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less than the gross 
proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the additional consideration.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee under an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable 
value of the production because of misconduct by or between two 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the oil 
production be

[[Page 35]]

valued under the first applicable of paragraph (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4), 
or (c)(5) of this section. When MMS determines that the value may be 
unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give the lessee an 
opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's 
value. If the oil production is then valued under paragraph (c)(4) or 
(c)(5) of this section, the notification requirements of paragraph (e) 
of this section shall apply.
    (2) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the oil.
    (c) The value of oil production from leases subject to this section 
which is not sold under an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable 
value determined in accordance with the first applicable of the 
following paragraphs:
    (1) The lessee's contemporaneous posted prices or oil sales contract 
prices used in arm's-length transactions for purchases or sales of 
significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if 
necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area); provided, 
however, that those posted prices or oil sales contract prices are 
comparable to other contemporaneous posted prices or oil sales contract 
prices used in arm's-length transactions for purchases or sales of 
significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if 
necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area). In 
evaluating the comparability of posted prices or oil sales contract 
prices, the following factors shall be considered: Price, duration, 
market or markets served, terms, quality of oil, volume, and other 
factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the oil. If the 
lessee makes arm's-length purchases or sales at different postings or 
prices, then the volume-weighted average price for the purchases or 
sales for the production month will be used;
    (2) The arithmetic average of contemporaneous posted prices used in 
arm's-length transactions by persons other than the lessee for purchases 
or sales of significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field 
(or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area);
    (3) The arithmetic average of other contemporaneous arm's-length 
contract prices for purchases or sales of significant quantities of 
like-quality oil in the same area or nearby areas;
    (4) Prices received for arm's-length spot sales of significant 
quantities of like-quality oil from the same field (or, if necessary to 
obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area), and other relevant 
matters, including information submitted by the lessee concerning 
circumstances unique to a particular lease operation or the salability 
of certain types of oil;
    (5) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value;
    (6) For purposes of this paragraph, the term lessee includes the 
lessee's designated purchasing agent, and the term contemporaneous means 
postings or contract prices in effect at the time the royalty obligation 
is incurred.
    (d) Any Indian lessee will make available, upon request to the 
authorized MMS or Indian representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Interior, or other persons authorized 
to receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for 
like-quality production sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the 
lessee from the field or area or from nearby fields or areas.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination 
of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and 
MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that 
the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value under 
paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/her 
designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and 
contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The 
notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due 
no later than the end of the month following

[[Page 36]]

the month the lessee first reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a 
valuation method authorized by paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this 
section and each time there is a change from one to the other of these 
two methods.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on the difference computed under 30 CFR 218.54. If the 
lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for the 
taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that value for royalty payment purposes until MMS issues a value 
determination. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant to 
its proposal. MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based upon the 
lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems necessary. In 
making a value determination, MMS may use any of the valuation criteria 
authorized by this subpart. That determination shall remain effective 
for the period stated therein. After MMS issues its determination, the 
lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production, for royalty purposes, be 
less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease 
production, less applicable allowances determined under this subpart.
    (i) The lessee is required to place oil in marketable condition at 
no cost to the Indian lessor unless otherwise provided in the lease 
agreement or this section. Where the value established under this 
section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value shall be 
increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced 
because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain 
services the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the 
lessee to place the oil in marketable condition.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee makes timely 
application for a price increase or benefit allowed under its contract 
but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable measures, 
which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe 
no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration 
resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. 
This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its 
royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, 
in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of oil.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Indian Tribes or 
allottees until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation allowances or extraordinary cost 
allowances, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this part 
are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 
regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2. Nothing in 
this section is intended to limit or diminish in any manner whatsoever 
the right of an Indian lessor to obtain any and all information to which 
such lessor may be

[[Page 37]]

lawfully entitled from MMS or such lessor's lessee directly under the 
terms of the lease, 30 U.S.C. 1733, or other applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 206.53  Point of royalty settlement.

    (a)(1) Royalties shall be computed on the quantity and quality of 
oil as measured at the point of settlement approved by BLM for onshore 
leases.
    (2) If the value of oil determined under Sec. 206.52 of this subpart 
is based upon a quantity and/or quality different from the quantity and/
or quality at the point of royalty settlement approved by the BLM for 
onshore leases, the value shall be adjusted for those differences in 
quantity and/or quality.
    (b) No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty 
value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss that may be 
sustained prior to the royalty settlement metering or measurement point 
will not be subject to royalty provided that such actual loss is 
determined to have been unavoidable by BLM.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, royalties 
are due on 100 percent of the volume measured at the approved point of 
royalty settlement. There can be no reduction in that measured volume 
for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty settlement or for 
theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken place either prior to 
or beyond the proved point of royalty settlement. Royalties are due on 
100 percent of the value of the oil as provided in this subpart. There 
can be no deduction from the value of the oil for royalty purposes to 
compensate for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty 
settlement or for theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken 
place either prior to or beyond the approved point of royalty 
settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 206.54  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of oil has been determined under Section 206.52 
of this subpart at a point (e.g., sales point or point of value 
determination) off the lease, MMS shall allow a deduction for the 
reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee to transport oil to a 
point off the lease; provided, however, that no transportation allowance 
will be granted for transporting oil taken as Royalty-In-Kind (RIK); or
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling arrangement 
shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the oil at the point of sale 
as determined under Sec. 206.52 of this subpart. Transportation costs 
cannot be transferred between selling arrangements or to other products.
    (2) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a transportation 
allowance deduction in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. The lessee must demonstrate that the 
transportation costs incurred in excess of the limitation prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. 
An application for exception (using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed 
Regulatory Allowance Limitation) shall contain all relevant and 
supporting documentation necessary for MMS to make a determination. 
Under no circumstances shall the value, for royalty purposes, under any 
selling arrangement, be reduced to zero.
    (c) Transportation costs must be allocated among all products 
produced and transported as provided in Sec. 206.55. Transportation 
allowances for oil shall be expressed as dollars per barrel.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
subpart, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest.


<R05>
Sec. 206.55  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length transportation contracts. (1)(i) For transportation 
costs incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the 
transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred 
by the lessee for transporting oil under that contract, except as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, 
subject to

[[Page 38]]

monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall have the 
burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. Such 
allowances shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this 
section. Before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed page one of Form MMS-4110 (and Schedule 1), Oil Transportation 
Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A 
transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of 
not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form 
MMS-4110 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a 
showing of good cause by the lessee.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration, then MMS may require that the transportation allowance be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-
length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of 
the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the 
lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and 
the lessor, then MMS shall require that the transportation allowance be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, MMS 
will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.
    (2)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one liquid product, and the transportation costs attributable to each 
product cannot be determined from the contract, then the total 
transportation costs shall be allocated in a consistent and equitable 
manner to each of the liquid products transported in the same proportion 
as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products 
which have no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding 
waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this 
paragraph, no allowance may be taken for the costs of transporting lease 
production which is not royalty-bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (3) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous 
and liquid products, and the transportation costs attributable to each 
product cannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose 
an allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the oil 
transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed 
allocation procedure until MMS issues its determination on the 
acceptability of the cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all 
available data to support its proposal. The initial proposal must be 
submitted by June 30, 1988 or within 3 months after the last day of the 
month for which the lessee requests a transportation allowance, 
whichever is later (unless MMS approves a longer period). MMS shall then 
determine the oil transportation allowance based upon the lessee's 
proposal and any additional information MMS deems necessary.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for 
the purposes of this section.
    (5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price, or a posted price, 
includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a 
transportation factor, MMS will not consider the transportation factor 
to be a transportation allowance. The transportation factor may be used 
in determining the lessee's gross proceeds for the sale of the product. 
The transportation factor may not

[[Page 39]]

exceed 50 percent of the base price of the product without MMS approval.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, 
the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable, 
actual costs as provided in this paragraph. All transportation 
allowances deducted under a non-arms-length or no-contract situation are 
subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. Before any 
estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed Form MMS-4110 in its entirety in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. A transportation allowance may be claimed 
retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first 
day of the month that Form MMS-4110 is filed with MMS, unless MMS 
approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee. MMS 
will monitor the allowance deductions to determine whether lessees are 
taking deductions that are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or 
appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its actual transportation 
allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arms-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial capital 
investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate of return 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets 
(including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) 
which are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. 
State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, 
including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. After a lessee has elected to use either method for 
a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the 
other alternative without approval of MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services or on 
a unit-of-production method. After an election is made, the lessee may 
not change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a 
transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall 
not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the initial capital 
investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return 
determined under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall 
be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to 
transportation facilities first placed in service after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is 
applicable and shall be effective

[[Page 40]]

during the reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined at the 
beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting period 
(which is determined under paragraph (c) of this section).
    (3)(i) The deduction for transportation costs shall be determined on 
the basis of the lessee's cost of transporting each product through each 
individual transportation system. Where more than one liquid product is 
transported, allocation of costs to each of the liquid products 
transported shall be in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume 
of each liquid product (excluding waste products which have no value) to 
the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products which have 
no value) and such allocation shall be made in a consistent and 
equitable manner. Except as provided in this paragraph, the lessee may 
not take an allowance for transporting lease production which is not 
royalty-bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (4) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through 
the same transportation system, the lessee shall propose a cost 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the oil transportation 
allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination on the acceptability of the 
cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all available data to support 
its proposal. The initial proposal must be submitted by June 30, 1988 or 
within 3 months after the last day of the month for which the lessee 
requests a transportation allowance, whichever is later (unless MMS 
approves a longer period). MMS shall then determine the oil 
transportation allowance on the basis of the lessee's proposal and any 
additional information MMS deems necessary.
    (5) A lessee may apply to MMS for an exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(4) of this section. MMS will grant the exception only if the 
lessee has a tariff for the transportation system approved by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for Indian leases. MMS shall 
deny the exception request if it determines that the tariff is excessive 
as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by pipelines, owned 
by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in 
that area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, MMS 
shall deny the exception request if:
    (i) No FERC cost analysis exists and the FERC has declined to 
investigate under MMS timely objections upon filing; and
    (ii) the tariff significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation as determined under this section.
    (c) Reporting requirements. (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the 
exception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page 
one of the initial Form MMS-4110 (and Schedule 1), Oil Transportation 
Allowance Report, prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation 
allowance determined, under an arm's-length contract, is reported on 
Form MMS-2014, Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance. A Form MMS-4110 
received by the end of the month that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be 
considered to be timely received.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4110 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is 
modified or amended, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding 
reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form MMS-4110 (and 
Schedule 1) within 3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after 
the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, 
whichever is earlier, unless MMS approves a longer period (during

[[Page 41]]

which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the 
previous reporting period).
    (iv) MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (v) Transportation allowances which are based on arm's-length 
contracts and which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those 
transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v), (c)(2)(vii) 
and (c)(2)(viii) of this section, the lessee shall submit an initial 
Form MMS-4110 prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation 
allowance determined under a non-arm's-length contract or no-contract 
situation is reported on Form MMS-2014. A Form MMS-4110 received by the 
end of the month that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be considered to be 
timely received. The initial report may be based upon estimated costs.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4110 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until transportation under the non-arm's-length 
contract or the no-contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial 
reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4110 
containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If oil 
transportation is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4110 
its estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated oil 
transportation allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the 
previous reporting period plus or minus any adjustments which are based 
on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases that will affect the 
allowance. MMS must receive the Form MMS-4110 within 3 months after the 
end of the previous reporting period, unless MMS approves a longer 
period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the 
allowance from the previous reporting period).
    (iv) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial Form MMS-4110 shall include estimates of the allowable oil 
transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be 
based upon the most recently available operations data for the 
transportation system or, if such data are not available, the lessee 
shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation 
systems.
    (v) Non-arm's-length contract or no-contract transportation 
allowances which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare its Form MMS-4110. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (vii) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (viii) If the lessee is authorized to use its FERC-approved tariff 
as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section.
    (3) MMS may establish reporting dates for individual lessees 
different from those specified in this subpart in order to provide more 
effective administration. Lessees will be notified of any change in 
their reporting period.

[[Page 42]]

    (4) Transportation allowances must be reported as a separate line 
item on Form MMS-2014, unless MMS approves a different reporting 
procedure.
    (d) Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and for 
failure to report. (1) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on 
its Form MMS-2014 without complying with the requirements of this 
section, the lessee shall pay interest only on the amount of such 
deduction until the requirements of this section are complied with. The 
lessee also shall repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed 
by this section.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required 
to pay additional royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 
218.54, retroactive to the first day of the first month the lessee is 
authorized to deduct a transportation allowance. If the actual 
transportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken 
on Form MMS-2014 for each month during the allowance form reporting 
period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (2) For lessees transporting production from Indian leases, the 
lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual costs, 
together with any payment, in accordance with instructions provided by 
MMS.
    (f) Actual or theoretical losses. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this subpart, for other than arm's-length contracts, no 
cost shall be allowed for oil transportation which results from payments 
(either volumetric or for value) for actual or theoretical losses. This 
section does not apply when the transportation allowance is based upon a 
FERC or State regulatory agency approved tariff.
    (g) Other transportation cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing 
value using a netback valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of transportation costs.

<R05>
Sec. 206.100  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all oil production from Federal 
oil and gas leases. The purpose of this subpart is to establish the 
value of production, for royalty purposes, consistent with the mineral 
leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.
    (b) If the specific provisions of any Federal statute, settlement 
agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from 
administrative or judicial litigation, or oil and gas lease subject to 
the requirements of this subpart are inconsistent with any regulation in 
this subpart, then the statute, lease provision or settlement agreement 
shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) All royalty payments made to MMS are subject to audit and 
adjustment.
    (d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the 
trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the 
administration of Indian oil and gas leases are discharged in accordance 
with the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, 
and lease terms.

<R05>
Sec. 206.101  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart:
    Allowance means a deduction in determining value for royalty 
purposes. Transportation allowance means an allowance for the 
reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for moving oil to a 
point of sale or point of delivery off the lease, unit area, or 
communitized area, excluding gathering.

[[Page 43]]

    Area means a geographic region at least as large as the defined 
limits of an oil and/or gas field in which oil and/or gas lease products 
have similar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the market place between independent, nonaffiliated 
persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For 
purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another 
person. For purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of 
ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms 
of ownership:
    (a) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;
    (b) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of 
control; and
    (c) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of 
noncontrol which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal 
control, including the existence of interlocking directorates.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between 
relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length 
contracts. The MMS may require the lessee to certify ownership control. 
To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must 
meet the requirements of this definition for that production month, as 
well as when the contract was executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees 
of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to 
processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that 
results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially 
in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface 
oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs 
vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually 
given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil 
and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields 
are located. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) fields are named and their 
boundaries are designated by MMS.
    Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central 
accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized 
area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, 
unit, or communitized area as approved by BLM or MMS OCS operations 
personnel for onshore and offshore leases, respectively.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total moneys 
and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the 
disposition of the oil produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not 
limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as 
dehydration, measurement, and/or gathering to the extent that the lessee 
is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Federal Government. Gross 
proceeds, as applied to oil, also includes, but is not limited to, 
reimbursements for harboring or terminaling fees. Tax reimbursements are 
part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Federal 
royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Moneys and other 
consideration, including the forms of consideration identified in this 
paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally entitled but 
which it does not seek to collect through reasonable efforts are also 
part of gross proceeds.

[[Page 44]]

    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a 
mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or 
extraction of, or removal of lease products--or the land area covered by 
that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lease products means any leased minerals attributable to, 
originating from, or allocated to Outer Continental Shelf or onshore 
Federal leases.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, 
and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or 
other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has 
an interest in a lease as well as an operator or payor who has no 
interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment 
responsibility.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products which have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
    Load oil means any oil which has been used with respect to the 
operation of oil or gas wells for wellbore stimulation, workover, 
chemical treatment, or production purposes. It does not include oil used 
at the surface to place lease production in marketable condition.
    Marketable condition means lease products which are sufficiently 
free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be 
accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or 
area.
    Marketing affiliate means an affiliate of the lessee whose function 
is to acquire only the lessee's production and to market that 
production.
    Minimum royalty means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the 
lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing 
regulations.
    Net-back method (or workback method) means a method for calculating 
market value of oil at the lease. Under this method, costs of 
transportation, processing, or manufacturing are deducted from the 
proceeds received for the oil and any extracted, processed, or 
manufactured products, or from the value of the oil or any extracted, 
processed, or manufactured products at the first point at which 
reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a sale 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of 
such products, to ascertain value at the lease.
    Net profit share (for applicable Federal leases) means the specified 
share of the net profit from production of oil and gas as provided in 
the agreement.
    Netting is the deduction of an allowance from the sales value by 
reporting a one line net sales value, instead of correctly reporting the 
deduction as a separate line item on the Form MMS-2014.
    Oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase 
in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric 
pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and is 
marketed or used as such. Condensate recovered in lease separators or 
field facilities is considered to be oil. For purposes of royalty 
valuation, the term tar sands is defined separately from oil.
    Oil shale means a kerogen-bearing rock (i.e., fossilized, insoluble, 
organic material). Separation of kerogen from oil shale may take place 
in situ or in surface retorts by various processes. The kerogen, upon 
distillation, will yield liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.
    Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) means all submerged lands lying 
seaward and outside of the area of lands beneath navigable waters as 
defined in section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) and of 
which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are 
subject to its jurisdiction and control.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Posted price means the price specified in publicly available posted 
price bulletins, offshore or onshore terminal postings, or other price 
notices net of all adjustments for quality (e.g., API gravity, sulfur 
content, etc.) and location for oil in marketable condition.
    Processing means any process designed to remove elements or 
compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including 
absorption,

[[Page 45]]

adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place 
on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical 
separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression are not 
considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in 
a reservoir is not considered processing.
    Section 6 lease means an OCS lease subject to section 6 of the Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1335.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of oil are made. Selling arrangements 
are described by illustration in the MMS Royalty Management Program (Oil 
and Gas or Solid Minerals) Payor Handbook.
    Spot sales agreement means a contract wherein a seller agrees to 
sell to a buyer a specified amount of oil at a specified price over a 
fixed period, usually of short duration, which does not normally require 
a cancellation notice to terminate, and which does not contain an 
obligation, nor imply an intent, to continue in subsequent periods.
    Tar sands means any consolidated or unconsolidated rock (other than 
coal, oil shale, or gilsonite) that either contains a hydrocarbonaceous 
material with a gas-free viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise at 
original reservoir temperature, or contains a hydrocarbonaceous material 
and is produced by mining or quarrying.

<R05>
Sec. 206.102  Valuation standards.

    (a) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of oil from 
leases subject to this subpart shall be the value determined pursuant to 
this section less applicable allowances determined pursuant to this 
subpart.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of oil which is sold pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section. The lessee 
shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-
length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, is 
subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this section, 
oil which is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing 
affiliate and then sold by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-
length contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph based 
upon the sale by the marketing affiliate.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the oil. If the 
contract does not reflect the total consideration, then the MMS may 
require that the oil sold pursuant to that contract be valued in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the additional 
consideration.
    (iii) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between 
two contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached 
its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit 
of the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the oil 
production be valued pursuant to the first applicable of paragraph (c) 
(2), (3), (4), or (5) of this section. When MMS determines that the 
value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give the 
lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's value. If the oil production is then valued pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section, the notification 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply.
    (2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the oil.
    (c) The value of oil production from leases subject to this section 
which is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the 
reasonable value determined in accordance with the first applicable of 
the following paragraphs:
    (1) The lessee's contemporaneous posted prices or oil sales contract

[[Page 46]]

prices used in arm's-length transactions for purchases or sales of 
significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if 
necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area); provided, 
however, that those posted prices or oil sales contract prices are 
comparable to other contemporaneous posted prices or oil sales contract 
prices used in arm's-length transactions for purchases or sales of 
significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if 
necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area). In 
evaluating the comparability of posted prices or oil sales contract 
prices, the following factors shall be considered: Price, duration, 
market or markets served, terms, quality of oil, volume, and other 
factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the oil. If the 
lessee makes arm's-length purchases or sales at different postings or 
prices, then the volume-weighted average price for the purchases or 
sales for the production month will be used;
    (2) The arithmetic average of contemporaneous posted prices used in 
arm's-length transactions by persons other than the lessee for purchases 
or sales of significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field 
(or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area);
    (3) The arithmetic average of other contemporaneous arm's-length 
contract prices for purchases or sales of significant quantities of 
like-quality oil in the same area or nearby areas;
    (4) Prices received for arm's-length spot sales of significant 
quantities of like-quality oil from the same field (or, if necessary to 
obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area), and other relevant 
matters, including information submitted by the lessee concerning 
circumstances unique to a particular lease operation or the saleability 
of certain types of oil;
    (5) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value;
    (6) For purposes of this paragraph, the term lessee includes the 
lessee's designated purchasing agent, and the term contemporaneous means 
postings or contract prices in effect at the time the royalty obligation 
is incurred.
    (d) Any Federal lessee will make available, upon request to the 
authorized MMS or State representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Interior, or other persons authorized 
to receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for 
like-quality production sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the 
lessee from the field or area or from nearby fields or areas.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the 
determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and 
audit, and MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it 
determines that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements 
of these regulations.
    (2) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to the MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/her 
designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and 
contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The 
notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due 
no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized 
by paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section and each time there is a 
change from one to the other of these two methods.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on the difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54. 
If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for 
the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that value for royalty payment purposes until MMS issues a value 
determination. The lessee shall submit

[[Page 47]]

all available data relevant to its proposal. MMS shall expeditiously 
determine the value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional 
information MMS deems necessary. In making a value determination, MMS 
may use any of the valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That 
determination shall remain effective for the period stated therein. 
After MMS issues its determination, the lessee shall make the 
adjustments in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production, for royalty purposes, be 
less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease 
production, less applicable allowances determined pursuant to this 
subpart.
    (i) The lessee is required to place oil in marketable condition at 
no cost to the Federal Government unless otherwise provided in the lease 
agreement or this section. Where the value established under this 
section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value shall be 
increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced 
because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain 
services the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the 
lessee to place the oil in marketable condition.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee makes timely 
application for a price increase or benefit allowed under its contract 
but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable measures, 
which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe 
no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration 
resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. 
This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its 
royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, 
in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of oil.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Federal Government 
or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation allowances or extraordinary cost 
allowances, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this part 
are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 
regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2.

1988; 61 FR 5462, Feb. 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 206.103  Point of royalty settlement.

    (a)(1) Royalties shall be computed on the quantity and quality of 
oil as measured at the point of settlement approved by BLM or MMS for 
onshore and offshore leases, respectively.
    (2) If the value of oil determined pursuant to Sec. 206.102 of this 
subpart is based upon a quantity and/or quality different from the 
quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement approved by 
the BLM for onshore leases or the MMS for offshore leases, the value 
shall be adjusted for those differences in quantity and/or quality.
    (b) No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty 
value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss that may be 
sustained prior to the royalty settlement metering or measurement point 
will not be subject to royalty provided that such actual loss is 
determined to have been unavoidable by BLM or MMS, as appropriate.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, royalties 
are due on

[[Page 48]]

100 percent of the volume measured at the approved point of royalty 
settlement. There can be no reduction in that measured volume for actual 
losses beyond the approved point of royalty settlement or for 
theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken place either prior to 
or beyond the approved point of royalty settlement. Royalties are due on 
100 percent of the value of the oil as provided in this part. There can 
be no deduction from the value of the oil for royalty purposes to 
compensate for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty 
settlement or for theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken 
place either prior to or beyond the approved point of royalty 
settlement.

Sec. 206.104  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of oil has been determined pursuant to 
Sec. 206.102 of this subpart at a point (e.g., sales point or point of 
value determination) off the lease, MMS shall allow a deduction for the 
reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee to:
    (1) Transport oil from an onshore lease to the point off the lease; 
Provided, however, That for onshore leases, no transportation allowance 
will be granted for transporting oil taken as Royalty-In-Kind (RIK); or
    (2) Transport oil from an offshore lease to the point off the lease; 
provided, however, that for oil taken as RIK, a transportation allowance 
shall be provided for the reasonable actual costs incurred to transport 
that oil to the delivery point specified in the contract between the RIK 
oil purchaser and the Federal Government.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling arrangement 
shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the oil at the point of sale 
as determined pursuant to Sec. 206.102 of this subpart. Transportation 
costs cannot be transferred between selling arrangements or to other 
products.
    (2) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a transportation 
allowance deduction in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. The lessee must demonstrate that the 
transportation costs incurred in excess of the limitation prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. 
An application for exception (using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed 
Regulatory Allowance Limitation) shall contain all relevant and 
supporting documentation necessary for MMS to make a determination. 
Under no circumstances shall the value, for royalty purposes, under any 
selling arrangement, be reduced to zero.
    (c) Transportation costs must be allocated among all products 
produced and transported as provided in Sec. 206.105. Transportation 
allowances for oil shall be expressed as dollars per barrel.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
subpart, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest. If the lessee takes a deduction 
for transportation on the Form MMS-2014 by improperly netting the 
allowance against the sales value of the oil instead of reporting the 
allowance as a separate line item, the lessee may be assessed an amount 
under Sec. 206.105(d).

<R05>
Sec. 206.105  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length transportation contracts. (1)(i) For transportation 
costs incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the 
transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred 
by the lessee for transporting oil under that contract, except as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, 
subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall 
have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. MMS' 
prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred 
under an arm's-length contract. Such allowances shall be subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. The lessee must claim a

[[Page 49]]

transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the 
Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration, then the MMS may require that the transportation 
allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (iii) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to 
an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable 
value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (2)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one liquid product, and the transportation costs attributable to each 
product cannot be determined from the contract, then the total 
transportation costs shall be allocated in a consistent and equitable 
manner to each of the liquid products transported in the same proportion 
as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products 
which have no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding 
waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this 
paragraph, no allowance may be taken for the costs of transporting lease 
production which is not royalty-bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. The MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (3) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous 
and liquid products, and the transportation costs attributable to each 
product cannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose 
an allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the oil 
transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed 
allocation procedure until MMS issues its determination on the 
acceptability of the cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all 
available data to support its proposal. The initial proposal must be 
submitted within 3 months after the last day of the month for which the 
lessee requests a transportation allowance. MMS shall then determine the 
oil transportation allowance based upon the lessee's proposal and any 
additional information MMS deems necessary.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for 
the purposes of this section.
    (5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price, or a posted price, 
includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a 
transportation factor, MMS will not consider the transportation factor 
to be a transportation allowance. The transportation factor may be used 
in determining the lessee's gross proceeds for the sale of the product. 
The transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of 
the product without MMS approval.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, 
the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable, 
actual costs as provided in this paragraph. All transportation 
allowances deducted under a non-arms-length or no-contract situation are 
subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment to ensure that they 
are reasonable and allowable. The lessee must claim a transportation 
allowance by reporting it as a separate

[[Page 50]]

line entry on the Form MMS-2014. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may 
direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation 
allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arms-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial capital 
investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate of return 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets 
(including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) 
which are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. 
State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, 
including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. After a lessee has elected to use either method for 
a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the 
other alternative without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services or on 
a unit-of-production method. After an election is made, the lessee may 
not change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a 
transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall 
not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the initial 
capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate 
of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No 
allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall 
apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service after 
March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3)(i) The deduction for transportation costs shall be determined on 
the basis of the lessee's cost of transporting each product through each 
individual transportation system. Where more than one liquid product is 
transported, allocation of costs to each of the liquid products 
transported shall be in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume 
of each liquid product (excluding waste products which have no value) to 
the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products which have 
no value) and such allocation shall be made in a consistent and 
equitable manner. Except as provided in this paragraph, the lessee may 
not take an allowance for transporting lease production which is not 
royalty-bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to the MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the 
values of the products transported. The MMS

[[Page 51]]

shall approve the method unless it determines that it is not consistent 
with the purposes of the regulations in this part.
    (4) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through 
the same transportation system, the lessee shall propose a cost 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the oil transportation 
allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination on the acceptability of the 
cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all available data to support 
its proposal. MMS shall then determine the oil transportation allowance 
on the basis of the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS 
deems necessary. The lessee must submit the allocation proposal within 3 
months of claiming the allocated deduction on the Form MMS-2014.
    (5) A lessee may apply to the MMS for an exception from the 
requirement that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. The MMS will grant the exception 
only if the lessee has a tariff for the transportation system approved 
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) (for both Federal and 
Indian leases) or a State regulatory agency (for Federal leases). The 
MMS shall deny the exception request if it determines that the tariff is 
excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by 
pipelines, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar 
transportation services in that area. If there are no arm's-length 
transportation charges, MMS shall deny the exception request if: (i) No 
FERC or State regulatory agency cost analysis exists and the FERC or 
State regulatory agency, as applicable, has declined to investigate 
pursuant to MMS timely objections upon filing; and (ii) the tariff 
significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for transportation as 
determined under this section.
    (c) Reporting requirements. (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) The 
lessee must notify MMS of an allowance based on incurred costs by using 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) The lessee must notify MMS 
of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial deduction shall include estimates of the allowable oil 
transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be 
based upon the most recently available operations data for the 
transportation system or, if such data are not available, the lessee 
shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation 
systems.
    (iii) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (iv) If the lessee is authorized to use its FERC-approved or State 
regulatory agency-approved tariff as its transportation cost in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section, it shall follow the 
reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a transportation 
allowance against the royalty value on the Form MMS-2014, the lessee 
shall be assessed an amount of up to 10 percent of the allowance netted 
not to exceed $250 per lease selling arrangement per sales period.
    (2) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its Form MMS-
2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the oil transported without 
obtaining prior approval of MMS under 206.104 of this subpart, the 
lessee shall pay interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the 
date such amount is taken to the date the lessee files an exception 
request with MMS.
    (3) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (4) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.

[[Page 52]]

    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay additional 
royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.54 from the 
allowance reporting period when the lessee took the deduction to the 
date the lessee repays the difference to MMS. If the actual 
transportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken 
on Form MMS-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, 
the lessee shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (2) For lessees transporting production from onshore Federal leases, 
the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual 
costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Actual or theoretical losses. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this subpart, for other than arm's-length contracts, no 
cost shall be allowed for oil transportation which results from payments 
(either volumetric or for value) for actual or theoretical losses. This 
section does not apply when the transportation allowance is based upon a 
FERC or State regulatory agency approved tariff.
    (g) Other transportation cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing 
value using a netback valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of transportation costs.

Sec. 206.150  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all gas production from Federal 
oil and gas leases. The purpose of this subpart is to establish the 
value of production for royalty purposes consistent with the mineral 
leasing laws, other applicable laws and lease terms.
    (b) If the specific provisions of any statute or settlement 
agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from 
administrative or judicial litigation, or oil and gas lease subject to 
the requirements of this subpart are inconsistent with any regulation in 
this subpart, then the lease, statute, or settlement agreement shall 
govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) All royalty payments made to MMS are subject to audit and 
adjustment.
    (d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the 
administration of oil and gas leases is discharged in accordance with 
the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws and lease terms.

<R05>
Sec. 206.151  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart:
    Allowance means a deduction in determining value for royalty 
purposes. Processing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable 
costs for processing gas determined under this subpart. Transportation 
allowance means an allowance for the cost of moving royalty bearing 
substances (identifiable, measurable oil and gas, including gas that is 
not in need of initial separation) from the point at which it is first 
identifiable and measurable to the sales point or other point where 
value is established under this subpart.
    Area means a geographic region at least as large as the defined 
limits of an oil and/or gas field, in which oil and/or gas lease 
products have similar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.

[[Page 53]]

    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes 
of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For 
purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the 
voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership:
    (a) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;
    (b) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of 
control; and
    (c) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of 
noncontrol which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal 
control, including the existence of interlocking directorates.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between 
relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length 
contracts. The MMS may require the lessee to certify ownership control. 
To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must 
meet the requirements of this definition for that production month as 
well as when the contract was executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Compression means the process of raising the pressure of gas.
    Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees 
of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to 
processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that 
results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially 
in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface 
oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs 
vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually 
given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil 
and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields 
are located. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) fields are named and their 
boundaries are designated by MMS.
    Gas means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, 
hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and 
which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand 
indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied 
state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.
    Gas plant products means separate marketable elements, compounds, or 
mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from 
processing gas, excluding residue gas.
    Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central 
accumulation and/or treatment point on the lease, unit or communitized 
area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, 
unit or communitized area as approved by BLM or MMS OCS operations 
personnel for onshore and OCS leases, respectively.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the 
disposition of the oil produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not 
limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as 
dehydration, measurement, and/or gathering to the extent that the lessee 
is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Federal Government. Gross 
proceeds, as applied to oil, also includes, but is not limited to, 
reimbursements for harboring or terminaling fees. Tax reimbursements are 
part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Federal 
royalty interest

[[Page 54]]

may be exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including 
the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a 
lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek 
to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a 
mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or 
extraction of, or removal of lease products--or the land area covered by 
that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lease products means any leased minerals attributable to, 
originating from, or allocated to Outer Continental Shelf or onshore 
Federal leases.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, 
and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or 
other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has 
an interest in a lease as well as an operator or payor who has no 
interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment 
responsibility.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products which have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
    Marketable condition means lease products which are sufficiently 
free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be 
accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or 
area.
    Marketing affiliate means an affiliate of the lessee whose function 
is to acquire only the lessee's production and to market that 
production.
    Minimum royalty means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the 
lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing 
regulations.
    Net-back method (or work-back method) means a method for calculating 
market value of gas at the lease. Under this method, costs of 
transportation, processing, or manufacturing are deducted from the 
proceeds received for the gas, residue gas or gas plant products, and 
any extracted, processed, or manufactured products, or from the value of 
the gas, residue gas or gas plant products, and any extracted, 
processed, or manufactured products, at the first point at which 
reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a sale 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of 
such products, to ascertain value at the lease.
    Net output means the quantity of residue gas and each gas plant 
product that a processing plant produces.
    Net profit share (for applicable Federal leases) means the specified 
share of the net profit from production of oil and gas as provided in 
the agreement.
    Netting is the deduction of an allowance from the sales value by 
reporting a one line net sales value, instead of correctly reporting the 
deduction as a separate line item on the Form MMS-2014.
    Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) means all submerged lands lying 
seaward and outside of the area of land beneath navigable waters as 
defined in section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) and of 
which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are 
subject to its jurisdiction and control.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Posted price means the price, net of all adjustments for quality and 
location, specified in publicly available price bulletins or other price 
notices available as part of normal business operations for quantities 
of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products in marketable 
condition.
    Processing means any process designed to remove elements or 
compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including 
absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally 
take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, 
mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression, 
are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or 
temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.
    Residue gas means that hydrocarbon gas consisting principally of 
methane resulting from processing gas.

[[Page 55]]

    Section 6 lease means an OCS lease subject to section 6 of the Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1335.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of gas, residue gas and gas plant 
products are made. Selling arrangements are described by illustration in 
the MMS Royalty Management Program Oil and Gas Payor Handbook.
    Spot sales agreement means a contract wherein a seller agrees to 
sell to a buyer a specified amount of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or 
gas plant products at a specified price over a fixed period, usually of 
short duration, which does not normally require a cancellation notice to 
terminate, and which does not contain an obligation, nor imply an 
intent, to continue in subsequent periods.
    Warranty contract means a long-term contract entered into prior to 
1970, including any amendments thereto, for the sale of gas wherein the 
producer agrees to sell a specific amount of gas and the gas delivered 
in satisfaction of this obligation may come from fields or sources 
outside of the designated fields.

<R05>
Sec. 206.152  Valuation standards--unprocessed gas.

    (a)(1) This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is not 
processed and all gas that is processed but is sold or otherwise 
disposed of by the lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract prior to 
processing (including all gas where the lessee's arm's-length contract 
for the sale of that gas prior to processing provides for the value to 
be determined on the basis of a percentage of the purchaser's proceeds 
resulting from processing the gas). This section also applies to 
processed gas that must be valued prior to processing in accordance with 
Sec. 206.155 of this part. Where the lessee's contract includes a 
reservation of the right to process the gas and the lessee exercises 
that right, Sec. 206.153 of this part shall apply instead of this 
section.
    (2) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of gas subject to 
this subpart shall be the value of gas determined under this section 
less applicable allowances.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of gas sold under an arm's-length contract is 
the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. The lessee shall 
have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The 
value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, is subject to 
monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this section, gas which 
is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and 
then sold by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon 
the sale by the marketing affiliate. Also, where the lessee's arm's-
length contract for the sale of gas prior to processing provides for the 
value to be determined based upon a percentage of the purchaser's 
proceeds resulting from processing the gas, the value of production, for 
royalty purposes, shall never be less than a value equivalent to 100 
percent of the value of the residue gas attributable to the processing 
of the lessee's gas.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the gas. If the 
contract does not reflect the total consideration, then the MMS may 
require that the gas sold pursuant to that contract be valued in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the additional 
consideration.
    (iii) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between 
the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached 
its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit 
of the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the gas 
production be valued pursuant to paragraph

[[Page 56]]

(c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and in accordance with the 
notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's value.
    (iv) How to value over-delivered volumes under a cash-out program. 
This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from 
a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation 
contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price 
the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for 
over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same 
value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those 
volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract. 
However, if MMS determines that the price specified in the 
transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low, 
the lessee must value all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2) 
or (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the value of gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract shall be 
determined by MMS, and due consideration will be given to all valuation 
criteria specified in this section. The lessee must request a value 
determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section for gas 
sold pursuant to a warranty contract; provided, however, that any value 
determination for a warranty contract in effect on the effective date of 
these regulations shall remain in effect until modified by MMS.
    (3) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the gas.
    (c) The value of gas subject to this section which is not sold 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable value 
determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following 
methods:
    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition other than by 
an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are 
equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable 
arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other dispositions of 
like-quality gas in the same field (or, if necessary to obtain a 
reasonable sample, from the same area). In evaluating the comparability 
of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the 
following factors shall be considered: price, time of execution, 
duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of gas, volume, and 
such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the 
gas;
    (2) A value determined by consideration of other information 
relevant in valuing like-quality gas, including gross proceeds under 
arm's-length contracts for like-quality gas in the same field or nearby 
fields or areas, posted prices for gas, prices received in arm's-length 
spot sales of gas, other reliable public sources of price or market 
information, and other information as to the particular lease operation 
or the saleability of the gas; or
    (3) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except 
paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal 
law at which gas may be sold is less than the value determined pursuant 
to this section, then MMS shall accept such maximum price as the value. 
For purposes of this section, price limitations set by any State or 
local government shall not be considered as a maximum price permitted by 
Federal law.
    (2) The limitation prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall not apply to gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract and valued 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the 
determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and 
audit, and MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it 
determines that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements 
of these regulations.

[[Page 57]]

    (2) Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or State representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Interior, or other person authorized to 
receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for like-
quality production sold, purchased or otherwise obtained by the lessee 
from the field or area or from nearby fields or areas.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to the MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/her 
designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and 
contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The 
notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due 
no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized 
by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and each time there is a 
change in a method under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54. 
If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for 
the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based 
upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. In making a value determination MMS may use any of the 
valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That determination shall 
remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues its 
determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease production, 
less applicable allowances.
    (i) The lessee must place gas in marketable condition and market the 
gas for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to 
the Federal Government. Where the value established under this section 
is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value will be increased 
to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the 
purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services the cost 
of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the gas 
in marketable condition or to market the gas.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. If there 
is no contract revision or amendment, and the lessee fails to take 
proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is 
entitled, it must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable 
price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing 
and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee 
makes timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under 
its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable 
measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the 
lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or 
consideration resulting from the price increase or additional benefits 
are received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee 
to avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser 
fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of gas.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or

[[Page 58]]

binding as against the Federal Government or its beneficiaries until the 
audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation or extraordinary cost allowances, is 
exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 
Sec. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this 
subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR 
part 2.

Sec. 206.153  Valuation standards--processed gas.

    (a)(1) This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is 
processed by the lessee and any other gas production to which this 
subpart applies and that is not subject to the valuation provisions of 
Sec. 206.152 of this part. This section applies where the lessee's 
contract includes a reservation of the right to process the gas and the 
lessee exercises that right.
    (2) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of gas subject to 
this section shall be the combined value of the residue gas and all gas 
plant products determined pursuant to this section, plus the value of 
any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement 
without resorting to processing determined pursuant to Sec. 206.102 of 
this part, less applicable transportation allowances and processing 
allowances determined pursuant to this subpart.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of residue gas or any gas plant product sold 
under an arm's-length contract is the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of 
this section, residue gas or any gas plant product which is sold or 
otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and then sold 
by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be 
valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon the sale by the 
marketing affiliate.
    (ii) In conducting these reviews and audits, MMS will examine 
whether or not the contract reflects the total consideration actually 
transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller 
for the residue gas or gas plant product. If the contract does not 
reflect the total consideration, then the MMS may require that the 
residue gas or gas plant product sold pursuant to that contract be 
valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not 
be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the 
additional consideration.
    (iii) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the residue gas or gas plant product because of 
misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee 
otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production 
for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall 
require that the residue gas or gas plant product be valued pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and in accordance with the 
notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's value.
    (iv) How to value over-delivered volumes under a cash-out program. 
This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from 
a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation 
contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price 
the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for 
over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same 
value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those 
volumes are subject to a lower price under the

[[Page 59]]

transportation contract. However, if MMS determines that the price 
specified in the transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is 
unreasonably low, the lessee must value all over-delivered volumes under 
paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the value of residue gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract 
shall be determined by MMS, and due consideration will be given to all 
valuation criteria specified in this section. The lessee must request a 
value determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section for 
gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract; provided, however, that any 
value determination for a warranty contract in effect on the effective 
date of these regulations shall remain in effect until modified by MMS.
    (3) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the residue gas or gas plant 
product.
    (c) The value of residue gas or any gas plant product which is not 
sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable value 
determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following 
methods:
    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition other than by 
an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are 
equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable 
arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other dispositions of 
like quality residue gas or gas plant products from the same processing 
plant (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from nearby 
plants). In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for 
the purposes of these regulations, the following factors shall be 
considered: price, time of execution, duration, market or markets 
served, terms, quality of residue gas or gas plant products, volume, and 
such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the 
residue gas or gas plant products;
    (2) A value determined by consideration of other information 
relevant in valuing like-quality residue gas or gas plant products, 
including gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts for like-quality 
residue gas or gas plant products from the same gas plant or other 
nearby processing plants, posted prices for residue gas or gas plant 
products, prices received in spot sales of residue gas or gas plant 
products, other reliable public sources of price or market information, 
and other information as to the particular lease operation or the 
saleability of such residue gas or gas plant products; or
    (3) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except 
paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal 
law at which any residue gas or gas plant products may be sold is less 
than the value determined pursuant to this section, then MMS shall 
accept such maximum price as the value. For the purposes of this 
section, price limitations set by any State or local government shall 
not be considered as a maximum price permitted by Federal law.
    (2) The limitation prescribed by paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall not apply to residue gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract and 
valued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the 
determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and 
audit, and MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it 
determines upon review or audit that the reported value is inconsistent 
with the requirements of these regulations.
    (2) Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or State representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Interior, or other persons authorized 
to receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for 
like-quality residue gas and gas plant products sold, purchased or 
otherwise obtained by the lessee from the same processing plant or from 
nearby processing plants.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined any value 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.

[[Page 60]]

The notification shall be by letter to the MMS Associate Director for 
Royalty Management or his/her designee. The letter shall identify the 
valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of the 
procedure to be followed. The notification required by this paragraph is 
a one-time notification due no later than the end of the month following 
the month the lessee first reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a 
valuation method authorized by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this 
section, and each time there is a change in a method under paragraph 
(c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest computed on that difference pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54. 
If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for 
the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based 
upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. In making a value determination, MMS may use any of the 
valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That determination shall 
remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues its 
determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for residue gas and/or 
any gas plant products, less applicable transportation allowances and 
processing allowances determined pursuant to this subpart.
    (i) The lessee must place residue gas and gas plant products in 
marketable condition and market the residue gas and gas plant products 
for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the 
Federal Government. Where the value established under this section is 
determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value will be increased to 
the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the 
purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services the cost 
of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the 
residue gas or gas plant products in marketable condition or to market 
the residue gas and gas plant products.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee makes timely 
application for a price increase or benefit allowed under its contract 
but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable measures, 
which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe 
no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration 
resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. 
This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its 
royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, 
in whole or in part, or timely, for a quantity of residue gas or gas 
plant product.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding against the Federal Government or 
its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation allowances, processing allowances or 
extraordinary

[[Page 61]]

cost allowances, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified 
by law to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, will be 
maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. All requests for information about determinations made 
under this part are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR 
part 2.

Sec. 206.154  Determination of quantities and qualities for computing royalties.

    (a)(1) Royalties shall be computed on the basis of the quantity and 
quality of unprocessed gas at the point of royalty settlement approved 
by BLM or MMS for onshore and OCS leases, respectively.
    (2) If the value of gas determined pursuant to Sec. 206.152 of this 
subpart is based upon a quantity and/or quality that is different from 
the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement, as 
approved by BLM or MMS, that value shall be adjusted for the differences 
in quantity and/or quality.
    (b)(1) For residue gas and gas plant products, the quantity basis 
for computing royalties due is the monthly net output of the plant even 
though residue gas and/or gas plant products may be in temporary 
storage.
    (2) If the value of residue gas and/or gas plant products determined 
pursuant to Sec. 206.153 of this subpart is based upon a quantity and/or 
quality of residue gas and/or gas plant products that is different from 
that which is attributable to a lease, determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section, that value shall be adjusted for the 
differences in quantity and/or quality.
    (c) The quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products 
attributable to a lease shall be determined according to the following 
procedure:
    (1) When the net output of the processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from only one lease, the quantity of the residue gas and gas 
plant products on which computations of royalty are based is the net 
output of the plant.
    (2) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from more than one lease producing gas of uniform content, the 
quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each 
lease shall be in the same proportions as the ratios obtained by 
dividing the amount of gas delivered to the plant from each lease by the 
total amount of gas delivered from all leases.
    (3) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from more than one lease producing gas of nonuniform content, 
the quantity of the residue gas allocable to each lease will be 
determined by multiplying the amount of gas delivered to the plant from 
the lease by the residue gas content of the gas, and dividing the 
arithmetical product thus obtained by the sum of the similar 
arithmetical products separately obtained for all leases from which gas 
is delivered to the plant, and then multiplying the net output of the 
residue gas by the arithmetic quotient obtained. The net output of gas 
plant products allocable to each lease will be determined by multiplying 
the amount of gas delivered to the plant from the lease by the gas plant 
product content of the gas, and dividing the arithmetical product thus 
obtained by the sum of the similar arithmetical products separately 
obtained for all leases from which gas is delivered to the plant, and 
then multiplying the net output of each gas plant product by the 
arithmetic quotient obtained.
    (4) A lessee may request MMS approval of other methods for 
determining the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable 
to each lease. If approved, such method will be applicable to all gas 
production from Federal leases that is processed in the same plant.
    (d)(1) No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty 
value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed 
gas that may be sustained prior to the royalty settlement metering or 
measurement point will not be subject to royalty provided that such loss 
is determined

[[Page 62]]

to have been unavoidable by BLM or MMS, as appropriate.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and 30 
CFR 202.151(c), royalties are due on 100 percent of the volume 
determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section. There can be no reduction in that determined volume for actual 
losses after the quantity basis has been determined or for theoretical 
losses that are claimed to have taken place. Royalties are due on 100 
percent of the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas 
plant products as provided in this subpart, less applicable allowances. 
There can be no deduction from the value of the unprocessed gas, residue 
gas, and/or gas plant products to compensate for actual losses after the 
quantity basis has been determined, or for theoretical losses that are 
claimed to have taken place.

Sec. 206.155  Accounting for comparison.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where the 
lessee (or a person to whom the lessee has transferred gas pursuant to a 
non-arm's-length contract or without a contract) processes the lessee's 
gas and after processing the gas the residue gas is not sold pursuant to 
an arm's-length contract, the value, for royalty purposes, shall be the 
greater of (1) the combined value, for royalty purposes, of the residue 
gas and gas plant products resulting from processing the gas determined 
pursuant to Sec. 206.153 of this subpart, plus the value, for royalty 
purposes, of any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty 
settlement without resorting to processing determined pursuant to 
Sec. 206.102 of this subpart; or (2) the value, for royalty purposes, of 
the gas prior to processing determined in accordance with Sec. 206.152 
of this subpart.
    (b) The requirement for accounting for comparison contained in the 
terms of leases will govern as provided in Sec. 206.150(b) of this 
subpart. When accounting for comparison is required by the lease terms, 
such accounting for comparison shall be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 206.156  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of gas has been determined pursuant to 
Sec. 206.152 or Sec. 206.153 of this subpart at a point (e.g., sales 
point or point of value determination) off the lease, MMS shall allow a 
deduction for the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee to 
transport unprocessed gas, residue gas, and gas plant products from a 
lease to a point off the lease including, if appropriate, transportation 
from the lease to a gas processing plant off the lease and from the 
plant to a point away from the plant.
    (b) Transportation costs must be allocated among all products 
produced and transported as provided in Sec. 206.157.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for 
unprocessed gas valued in accordance with Sec. 206.152 of this subpart, 
the transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling 
arrangement shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the unprocessed 
gas determined in accordance with Sec. 206.152 of this subpart.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for gas 
production valued in accordance with Sec. 206.153 of this subpart the 
transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling arrangement 
shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the residue gas or gas plant 
product determined in accordance with Sec. 206.153 of this subpart. For 
purposes of this section, natural gas liquids shall be considered one 
product.
    (3) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a transportation 
allowance deduction in excess of the limitations prescribed by 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. The lessee must 
demonstrate that the transportation costs incurred in excess of the 
limitations prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section 
were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for exception 
(using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) 
shall contain all relevant and supporting

[[Page 63]]

documentation necessary for MMS to make a determination. Under no 
circumstances shall the value for royalty purposes under any selling 
arrangement be reduced to zero.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
subpart, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest, determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest. If the lessee takes a deduction 
for transportation on the Form MMS-2014 by improperly netting the 
allowance against the sales value of the oil instead of reporting the 
allowance as a separate line item, he may be assessed an additional 
amount under 206.157(d).

Sec. 206.157  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length transportation contracts. (1)(i) For transportation 
costs incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the 
transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred 
by the lessee for transporting the unprocessed gas, residue gas and/or 
gas plant products under that contract, except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, subject to monitoring, 
review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall have the burden of 
demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. MMS' prior approval is 
not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-
length contract. Such allowances shall be subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (f) of this section. The lessee must claim a transportation 
allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether or 
not the contract reflects more than the consideration actually 
transferred either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the 
transporter for the transportation. If the contract reflects more than 
the total consideration, then the MMS may require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (iii) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to 
an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable 
value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (2)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one product in a gaseous phase and the transportation costs attributable 
to each product cannot be determined from the contract, the total 
transportation costs shall be allocated in a consistent and equitable 
manner to each of the products transported in the same proportion as the 
ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products which have 
no value) to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding 
waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this 
paragraph, no allowance may be taken for the costs of transporting lease 
production which is not royalty bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (3) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous 
and liquid products and the transportation costs attributable to each 
cannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose an 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the transportation 
allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination on the acceptability of the 
cost allocation. The lessee shall submit

[[Page 64]]

all relevant data to support its proposal. MMS shall then determine the 
gas transportation allowance based upon the lessee's proposal and any 
additional information MMS deems necessary. The lessee must submit the 
allocation proposal within 3 months of claiming the allocated deduction 
on the Form MMS-2014.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not based on a dollar per unit, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for 
the purposes of this section.
    (5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price or a posted price 
includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a 
transportation factor, MMS will not consider the transportation factor 
to be a transportation allowance. The transportation factor may be used 
in determining the lessee's gross proceeds for the sale of the product. 
The transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of 
the product without MMS approval.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, 
the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable 
actual costs as provided in this paragraph. All transportation 
allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation 
are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee 
must claim a transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-2014. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may 
direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation 
allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial 
depreciable investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate 
of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed 
assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment) which are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. 
State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, 
including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. After a lessee has elected to use either method for 
a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the 
other alternative without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, or a 
unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not 
change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a 
transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall 
not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by 
the rate of

[[Page 65]]

return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No 
allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall 
apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service after 
March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3)(i) The deduction for transportation costs shall be determined on 
the basis of the lessee's cost of transporting each product through each 
individual transportation system. Where more than one product in a 
gaseous phase is transported, the allocation of costs to each of the 
products transported shall be made in a consistent and equitable manner 
in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product 
(excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all 
products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products which have no 
value). Except as provided in this paragraph, the lessee may not take an 
allowance for transporting a product which is not royalty bearing 
without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i), the 
lessee may propose to the MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of 
the values of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method 
unless it determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (4) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through 
the same transportation system, the lessee shall propose a cost 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the transportation 
allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination on the acceptability of the 
cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all relevant data to support 
its proposal. MMS shall then determine the transportation allowance 
based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS 
deems necessary. The lessee must submit the allocation proposal within 3 
months of claiming the allocated deduction on the Form MMS-2014.
    (5) A lessee may apply to the MMS for an exception from the 
requirement that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. The MMS will grant the exception 
only if the lessee has a tariff for the transportation system approved 
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) (for both Federal and 
Indian leases) or a State regulatory agency (for Federal leases). The 
MMS shall deny the exception request if it determines that the tariff is 
excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by 
pipelines, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar 
transportation services in that area. If there are no arm's-length 
transportation charges, MMS shall deny the exception request if: (i) No 
FERC or State regulatory agency cost analysis exists and the FERC or 
State regulatory agency, as applicable, has declined to investigate 
pursuant to MMS timely objections upon filing; and (ii) the tariff 
significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for transportation as 
determined under this section.
    (c) Reporting requirements. (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) The 
lessee must notify MMS of an allowance based on incurred costs by using 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) The lessee must notify MMS 
of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial deduction shall include estimates of the allowable gas 
transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be 
based upon the most recently available operations data for the 
transportation system or, if such data are

[[Page 66]]

not available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data 
for similar transportation systems.
    (iii) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (iv) If the lessee is authorized to use its FERC-approved or State 
regulatory agency-approved tariff as its transportation cost in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section, it shall follow the 
reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a transportation 
allowance against the royalty value on the Form MMS-2014, the lessee 
shall be assessed an amount of up to 10 percent of the allowance netted 
not to exceed $250 per lease selling arrangement per sales period.
    (2) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its Form MMS-
2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the gas transported without 
obtaining prior approval of MMS under Sec. 206.156, the lessee shall pay 
interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date such amount 
is taken to the date the lessee files an exception request with MMS.
    (3) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (4) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be required to 
pay additional royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.54 
from the allowance reporting period when the lessee took the deduction 
to the date the lessee repays the difference to MMS. If the actual 
transportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken 
on Form MMS-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, 
the lessee shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (2) For lessees transporting production from onshore Federal leases, 
the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual 
costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (3) For lessees transporting gas production from leases on the OCS, 
if the lessee's estimated transportation allowance exceeds the allowance 
based on actual costs, the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 
to reflect actual costs, together with its payment, in accordance with 
instructions provided by MMS. If the lessee's estimated transportation 
allowance is less than the allowance based on actual costs, the refund 
procedure will be specified by MMS.
    (f) Allowable costs in determining transportation allowances. 
Lessees may include, but are not limited to, the following costs in 
determining the arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph 
(a) of this section or the non-arm's-length transportation allowance 
under paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Firm demand charges paid to pipelines. You must limit the 
allowable costs for the firm demand charges to the applicable rate per 
MMBtu multiplied by the actual volumes transported. You may not include 
any losses incurred for previously purchased but unused firm capacity. 
You also may not include any gains associated with releasing firm 
capacity. If you receive a payment or credit from the pipeline for 
penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce 
the firm demand charge claimed on the Form MMS-2014. You must modify the 
Form MMS-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected 
reporting period;
    (2) Gas supply realignment (GSR) costs. The GSR costs result from a 
pipeline reforming or terminating supply contracts with producers to 
implement the restructuring requirements of FERC Orders in 18 CFR part 
284;
    (3) Commodity charges. The commodity charge allows the pipeline to 
recover the costs of providing service;
    (4) Wheeling costs. Hub operators charge a wheeling cost for 
transporting gas from one pipeline to either the

[[Page 67]]

same or another pipeline through a market center or hub. A hub is a 
connected manifold of pipelines through which a series of incoming 
pipelines are interconnected to a series of outgoing pipelines;
    (5) Gas Research Institute (GRI) fees. The GRI conducts research, 
development, and commercialization programs on natural gas related 
topics for the benefit of the U.S. gas industry and gas customers. GRI 
fees are allowable provided such fees are mandatory in FERC-approved 
tariffs;
    (6) Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) fees. FERC charges these fees to 
pipelines to pay for its operating expenses;
    (7) Payments (either volumetric or in value) for actual or 
theoretical losses. This paragraph does not apply to non-arm's-length 
transportation arrangements unless the transportation allowance is based 
on a FERC or State regulatory-approved tariff;
    (8) Temporary storage services. This includes short duration storage 
services offered by market centers or hubs (commonly referred to as 
``parking'' or ``banking''), or other temporary storage services 
provided by pipeline transporters, whether actual or provided as a 
matter of accounting. Temporary storage is limited to 30 days or less; 
and
    (9) Supplemental costs for compression, dehydration, and treatment 
of gas. MMS allows these costs only if such services are required for 
transportation and exceed the services necessary to place production 
into marketable condition required under Secs. 206.152(i) and 206.153(i) 
of this part.
    (g) Nonallowable costs in determining transportation allowances. 
Lessees may not include the following costs in determining the arm's-
length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section or 
the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (1) Fees or costs incurred for storage. This includes storing 
production in a storage facility, whether on or off the lease, for more 
than 30 days;
    (2) Aggregator/marketer fees. This includes fees you pay to another 
person (including your affiliates) to market your gas, including 
purchasing and reselling the gas, or finding or maintaining a market for 
the gas production;
    (3) Penalties you incur as shipper. These penalties include, but are 
not limited to:
    (i) Over-delivery cash-out penalties. This includes the difference 
between the price the pipeline pays you for over-delivered volumes 
outside the tolerances and the price you receive for over-delivered 
volumes within the tolerances;
    (ii) Scheduling penalties. This includes penalties you incur for 
differences between daily volumes delivered into the pipeline and 
volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point;
    (iii) Imbalance penalties. This includes penalties you incur 
(generally on a monthly basis) for differences between volumes delivered 
into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or 
delivery point; and
    (iv) Operational penalties. This includes fees you incur for 
violation of the pipeline's curtailment or operational orders issued to 
protect the operational integrity of the pipeline;
    (4) Intra-hub transfer fees. These are fees you pay to hub operators 
for administrative services (e.g., title transfer tracking) necessary to 
account for the sale of gas within a hub; and
    (5) Other nonallowable costs. Any cost you incur for services you 
are required to provide at no cost to the lessor.
    (h) Other transportation cost determinations. Use this section when 
calculating transportation costs to establish value using a netback 
procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of 
transportation costs.

Sec. 206.158  Processing allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of gas is determined pursuant to Sec. 206.153 of 
this subpart, a deduction shall be allowed for the reasonable actual 
costs of processing.
    (b) Processing costs must be allocated among the gas plant products. 
A separate processing allowance must be determined for each gas plant 
product

[[Page 68]]

and processing plant relationship. Natural gas liquids (NGL's) shall be 
considered as one product.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the 
processing allowance shall not be applied against the value of the 
residue gas. Where there is no residue gas MMS may designate an 
appropriate gas plant product against which no allowance may be applied.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the 
processing allowance deduction on the basis of an individual product 
shall not exceed 66\2/3\ percent of the value of each gas plant product 
determined in accordance with Sec. 206.153 of this subpart (such value 
to be reduced first for any transportation allowances related to 
postprocessing transportation authorized by Sec. 206.156 of this 
subpart).
    (3) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a processing allowance 
in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. The lessee must demonstrate that the processing costs incurred 
in excess of the limitation prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for 
exception (using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance 
Limitation) shall contain all relevant and supporting documentation for 
MMS to make a determination. Under no circumstances shall the value for 
royalty purposes of any gas plant product be reduced to zero.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no 
processing cost deduction shall be allowed for the costs of placing 
lease products in marketable condition, including dehydration, 
separation, compression, or storage, even if those functions are 
performed off the lease or at a processing plant. Where gas is processed 
for the removal of acid gases, commonly referred to as ``sweetening,'' 
no processing cost deduction shall be allowed for such costs unless the 
acid gases removed are further processed into a gas plant product. In 
such event, the lessee shall be eligible for a processing allowance as 
determined in accordance with this subpart. However, MMS will not grant 
any processing allowance for processing lease production which is not 
royalty bearing.
    (2)(i) If the lessee incurs extraordinary costs for processing gas 
production from a gas production operation, it may apply to MMS for an 
allowance for those costs which shall be in addition to any other 
processing allowance to which the lessee is entitled pursuant to this 
section. Such an allowance may be granted only if the lessee can 
demonstrate that the costs are, by reference to standard industry 
conditions and practice, extraordinary, unusual, or unconventional.
    (ii) Prior MMS approval to continue an extraordinary processing cost 
allowance is not required. However, to retain the authority to deduct 
the allowance the lessee must report the deduction to MMS in a form and 
manner prescribed by MMS.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has improperly determined a 
processing allowance authorized by this subpart, then the lessee shall 
pay any additional royalties, plus interest determined in accordance 
with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be entitled to a credit, without interest. 
If the lessee takes a deduction for transportation on the Form MMS-2014 
by improperly netting the allowance against the sales value of the oil 
instead of reporting the allowance as a separate line item, he may be 
assessed an additional amount under 206.159(d).

<R05>
Sec. 206.159  Determination of processing allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length processing contracts. (1)(i) For processing costs 
incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the processing 
allowance shall be the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee 
for processing the gas under that contract, except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, subject to 
monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall have the 
burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. MMS' prior 
approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under 
an arm's-length contract. The lessee must claim a transportation 
allowance

[[Page 69]]

by reporting it as a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the processor for the 
processing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration, 
then the MMS may require that the processing allowance be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length processing contract does not reflect the reasonable value 
of the processing because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the 
lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and 
lessor, then MMS shall require that the processing allowance be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value of the processing may be unreasonable, MMS 
will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's processing costs.
    (2) If an arm's-length processing contract includes more than one 
gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product 
can be determined from the contract, then the processing costs for each 
gas plant product shall be determined in accordance with the contract. 
No allowance may be taken for the costs of processing lease production 
which is not royalty-bearing.
    (3) If an arm's-length processing contract includes more than one 
gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product 
cannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose an 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination. The lessee shall submit 
all relevant data to support its proposal. MMS shall then determine the 
processing allowance based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional 
information MMS deems necessary. No processing allowance will be granted 
for the costs of processing lease production which is not royalty 
bearing. The lessee must submit the allocation proposal within 3 months 
of claiming the allocated deduction on Form MMS-2014.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for processing under an arm's-length 
contract are not based on a dollar per unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for 
the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length processing contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs processing for itself, the 
processing allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual 
costs as provided in this paragraph. All processing allowances deducted 
under a non-arm's-length or no-contract situation are subject to 
monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee must claim a 
processing allowance by reflecting it as a separate line entry on the 
Form MMS-2014. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its estimated or actual processing allowance.
    (2) The processing allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for processing 
during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial 
depreciable investment in the processing plant multiplied by a rate of 
return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed 
assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment) which are an integral part of the processing plant.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
processing

[[Page 70]]

plant; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly 
allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can 
document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the processing plant is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are 
not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. When a lessee has elected to use either method for a 
processing plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other 
alternative without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the processing plant services, or a unit-
of-production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not 
change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
processing plant shall not alter the depreciation schedule established 
by the original processor/lessee for purposes of the allowance 
calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a processing plant 
shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below 
a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
initial capital investment in the processing plant multiplied by the 
rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this 
section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This 
alternative shall apply only to plants first placed in service after 
March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3) The processing allowance for each gas plant product shall be 
determined based on the lessee's reasonable and actual cost of 
processing the gas. Allocation of costs to each gas plant product shall 
be based upon generally accepted accounting principles. The lessee may 
not take an allowance for the costs of processing lease production which 
is not royalty bearing.
    (4) A lessee may apply to MMS for an exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(3) of this section. The MMS may grant the exception only if: 
(i) The lessee has arm's-length contracts for processing other gas 
production at the same processing plant; and (ii) at least 50 percent of 
the gas processed annually at the plant is processed pursuant to arm's-
length processing contracts; if the MMS grants the exception, the lessee 
shall use as its processing allowance the volume weighted average prices 
charged other persons pursuant to arm's-length contracts for processing 
at the same plant.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) The 
lessee must notify MMS of an allowance based on incurred costs by using 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
processing contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted 
within a reasonable time, as determined by MMS.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) The lessee must notify MMS 
of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) For new processing plants, the lessee's initial deduction shall 
include estimates of the allowable gas processing costs for the 
applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently 
available operations data for the plant or, if such data are not 
available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for 
similar gas processing plants.
    (iii) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (iv) If the lessee is authorized to use the volume weighted average 
prices

[[Page 71]]

charged other persons as its processing allowance in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, it shall follow the reporting 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a processing 
allowance against the royalty value on the Form MMS-2014, the lessee 
shall be assessed an amount of up to 10 percent of the allowance netted 
not to exceed $250 per lease selling arrangement per sales period.
    (2) If a lessee deducts a processing allowance on its Form MMS-2014 
that exceeds 66\2/3\ percent of the value of the gas processed without 
obtaining prior approval of MMS under Sec. 206.158, the lessee shall pay 
interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date such amount 
is taken to the date the lessee files an exception request with MMS.
    (3) If a lessee erroneously reports a processing allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (4) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual processing allowance is less than 
the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month during 
the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay additional 
royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.54 from the 
allowance reporting period when the lessee took the deduction to the 
date the lessee repays the difference to MMS. If the actual processing 
allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-
2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee 
shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (2) For lessees transporting production from onshore Federal leases, 
the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual 
costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (3) For lessees processing gas production from leases on the OCS, if 
the lessee's estimated processing allowance exceeds the allowance based 
on actual costs, the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to 
reflect actual costs, together with its payment, in accordance with 
instructions provided by MMS. If the lessee's estimated costs were less 
than the actual costs, the refund procedure will be specified by MMS.
    (f) Other processing cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine processing costs when establishing 
value using a net back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of processing costs.

<R05>
Sec. 206.170  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all gas production from Indian 
(Tribal and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage 
Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma). The purpose of this subpart 
is to establish the value of production for royalty purposes consistent 
with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.
    (b) If the specific provisions of any statute, treaty, or settlement 
agreement between the Indian lessor and a lessee resulting from 
administrative or judicial litigation, or oil and gas lease subject to 
the requirements of this subpart are inconsistent with any regulation in 
this subpart, then the lease, statute, treaty provision or settlement 
agreement shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

[[Page 72]]

    (c) All royalty payments made to any Tribe or allottee are subject 
to audit and adjustment.
    (d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the 
trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the 
administration of Indian oil and gas leases are discharged in accordance 
with the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, 
and lease terms.


<R05>
Sec. 206.171  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart:
    Allowance means an approved or an (MMS)-initially accepted deduction 
in determining value for royalty purposes. Processing allowance means an 
allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for 
processing gas, or an approved or MMS-initially accepted deduction for 
costs of such processing, determined pursuant to this subpart. 
Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual 
costs incurred by the lessee for moving unprocessed gas, residue gas, or 
gas plant products to a point of sale or point of delivery off the 
lease, unit area, communitized area, or away from a processing plant, 
excluding gathering, or an approved or MMS-initially accepted deduction 
for costs of such transportation, determined pursuant to this subpart.
    Area means a geographic region at least as large as the defined 
limits of an oil and/or gas field, in which oil and/or gas lease 
products have similar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes 
of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is 
controlled by, or is pursuant to common control with another person. For 
purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the 
voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership: 
ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control; ownership of 10 
through 50 percent creates a presumption of control; and ownership of 
less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which MMS may 
rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the 
existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood 
or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. MMS may require the 
lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for 
any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this 
definition for that production month, as well as when the contract was 
executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.
    BIA means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the 
Interior.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Compression means the process of raising the pressure of gas.
    Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees 
of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to 
processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that 
results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially 
in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface 
oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs 
vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually 
given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil 
and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields 
are located.
    Gas means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, 
hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and 
which has neither

[[Page 73]]

independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand indefinitely. It is a 
substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied state pursuant to 
standard temperature and pressure conditions.
    Gas plant products means separate marketable elements, compounds, or 
mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from 
processing gas, excluding residue gas.
    Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central 
accumulation and/or treatment point on the lease, unit or communitized 
area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, 
unit or communitized area as approved by BLM operations personnel for 
onshore leases.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the 
disposition of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products 
produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not limited to, payments to 
the lessee for certain services such as compression, dehydration, 
measurement, and/or field gathering to the extent that the lessee is 
obligated to perform them at no cost to the Indian lessor, and payments 
for gas processing rights. Gross proceeds, as applied to gas, also 
includes but is not limited to reimbursements for severance taxes and 
other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds 
accruing to a lessee even though the Indian royalty interest may be 
exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the 
forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee 
is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to 
collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Indian allottee means any Indian for whom land or an interest in 
land is held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to 
Federal restriction against alienation.
    Indian Tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, 
community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any 
land or interest in land is held in trust by the United States or which 
is subject to Federal restriction against alienation.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States pursuant to a 
mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or 
extraction of, or removal of lease products--or the land area covered by 
that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lease products means any leased minerals attributable to, 
originating from, or allocated to Indian leases.
    Lessee means any person to whom an Indian Tribe, or an Indian 
allottee issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an 
obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This 
includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an 
operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed 
the royalty payment responsibility.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products which have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
    Marketable condition means lease products which are sufficiently 
free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be 
accepted by a purchaser pursuant to a sales contract typical for the 
field or area.
    Marketing affiliate means an affiliate of the lessee whose function 
is to acquire only the lessee's production and to market that 
production.
    Minimum royalty means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the 
lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing 
regulations.
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Net-back method (or work-back method) means a method for calculating 
market value of gas at the lease. Pursuant to this method, costs of 
transportation, processing, or manufacturing are deducted from the 
proceeds received for the gas, residue gas or gas plant products, and 
any extracted, processed, or manufactured products, or from the value of 
the gas, residue gas or gas plant products, and any extracted, 
processed, or manufactured products, at the first point at which

[[Page 74]]

reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a sale 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of 
such products, to ascertain value at the lease.
    Net output means the quantity of residue gas and each gas plant 
product that a processing plant produces.
    Net profit share (for applicable Indian leases) means the specified 
share of the net profit from production of oil and gas as provided in 
the agreement.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Posted price means the price, net of all adjustments for quality and 
location, specified in publicly available price bulletins or other price 
notices available as part of normal business operations for quantities 
of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products in marketable 
condition.
    Processing means any process designed to remove elements or 
compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including 
absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally 
take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, 
mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression, 
are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or 
temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.
    Residue gas means that hydrocarbon gas consisting principally of 
methane resulting from processing gas.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
pursuant to which sales or dispositions of gas, residue gas and gas 
plant products are made. Selling arrangements are described by 
illustration in the MMS Royalty Management Program Oil and Gas Payor 
Handbook.
    Spot sales agreement means a contract wherein a seller agrees to 
sell to a buyer a specified amount of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or 
gas plant products at a specified price over a fixed period, usually of 
short duration, which does not normally require a cancellation notice to 
terminate, and which does not contain an obligation, nor imply an 
intent, to continue in subsequent periods.
    Warranty contract means a long-term contract entered into prior to 
1970, including any amendments thereto, for the sale of gas wherein the 
producer agrees to sell a specific amount of gas and the gas delivered 
in satisfaction of this obligation may come from fields or sources 
outside of the designated fields.


<R05>
Sec. 206.172  Valuation standards--unprocessed gas.

    (a)(1) This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is not 
processed and all gas that is processed but is sold or otherwise 
disposed of by the lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract prior to 
processing (including all gas where the lessee's arm's-length contract 
for the sale of that gas prior to processing provides for the value to 
be determined on the basis of a percentage of the purchaser's proceeds 
resulting from processing the gas). This section also applies to 
processed gas that must be valued prior to processing in accordance with 
Sec. 206.175 of this subpart. Where the lessee's contract includes a 
reservation of the right to process the gas and the lessee exercises 
that right, Sec. 206.173 of this subpart shall apply instead of this 
section.
    (2) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of gas subject to 
this subpart shall be the value of gas determined pursuant to this 
section less applicable allowances determined pursuant to this subpart.
    (3)(i) For any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may 
consider the highest price paid or offered for a major portion of 
production (major portion) in determining value of production for 
royalty purposes, if data are available to compute a major portion MMS 
will, where practicable, compare the value determined in accordance with 
this section with the major portion. The value to be used in determining 
the value of production for royalty purposes shall be the higher of 
those two values.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, major portion means the highest 
price paid or offered at the time of production for the major portion of 
gas production from the same field. The major portion will be calculated 
using like-quality gas sold pursuant to arm's-

[[Page 75]]

length contracts from the same field (or, if necessary to obtain a 
reasonable sample, from the same area) for each month. All such sales 
will be arrayed from highest price to lowest price (at the bottom). The 
major portion is that price at which 50 percent (by volume) plus 1 mcf 
of the gas (starting from the bottom) is sold.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of gas sold under an arm's-length contract is 
the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. The lessee shall 
have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The 
value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, is subject to 
monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this section, gas which 
is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and 
then sold by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon 
the sale by the marketing affiliate. Also, where the lessee's arm's-
length contract for the sale of gas prior to processing provides for the 
value to be determined based upon a percentage of the purchaser's 
proceeds resulting from processing the gas, the value of production, for 
royalty purposes, shall never be less than a value equivalent to 100 
percent of the value of the residue gas attributable to the processing 
of the lessee's gas.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the gas. If the 
contract does not reflect the total consideration, then MMS may require 
that the gas sold pursuant to that contract be valued in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less than the gross 
proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the additional consideration.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between 
the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached 
its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit 
of the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the gas 
production be valued pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this 
section, and in accordance with the notification requirements of 
paragraph (e) of this section. When MMS determines that the value may be 
unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give the lessee an 
opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's 
value.
    (iv) How to value over-delivered volumes under a cash-out program. 
This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from 
a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation 
contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price 
the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for 
over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same 
value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those 
volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract. 
However, if MMS determines that the price specified in the 
transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low, 
the lessee must value all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2) 
or (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the value of gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract shall be 
determined by MMS, and due consideration will be given to all valuation 
criteria specified in this section. The lessee must request a value 
determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section for gas 
sold pursuant to a warranty contract; provided, however, that any value 
determination for a warranty contract in effect on the effective date of 
these regulations shall remain in effect until modified by MMS.
    (3) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the gas.
    (c) The value of gas subject to this section which is not sold 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable value 
determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following 
methods:

[[Page 76]]

    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
pursuant to its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition other 
than by an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds 
are equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid pursuant to, 
comparable arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other 
dispositions of like-quality gas in the same field (or, if necessary to 
obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area). In evaluating the 
comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these 
regulations, the following factors shall be considered: price, time of 
execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of gas, 
volume, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the 
value of the gas;
    (2) A value determined by consideration of other information 
relevant in valuing like-quality gas, including gross proceeds pursuant 
to arm's-length contracts for like-quality gas in the same field or 
nearby fields or areas, posted prices for gas, prices received in arm's-
length spot sales of gas, other reliable public sources of price or 
market information, and other information as to the particular lease 
operation or the salability of the gas; or
    (3) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except 
paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal 
law at which gas may be sold is less than the value determined pursuant 
to this section, then MMS shall accept such maximum price as the value. 
For purposes of this section, price limitations set by any State or 
local government shall not be considered as a maximum price permitted by 
Federal law.
    (2) The limitation prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall not apply to gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract and valued 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the 
determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and 
audit, and MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it 
determines that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements 
of these regulations.
    (2) Any Indian lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or Indian representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Interior, or other person authorized to 
receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for like-
quality production sold, purchased or otherwise obtained by the lessee 
from the field or area or from nearby fields or areas.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/her 
designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and 
contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The 
notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due 
no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized 
by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and each time there is a 
change in a method pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54. 
If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for 
the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based upon 
the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. In making a value determination MMS may

[[Page 77]]

use any of the valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That 
determination shall remain effective for the period stated therein. 
After MMS issues its determination, the lessee shall make the 
adjustments in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, pursuant to 
no circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be 
less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease 
production, less applicable allowances determined pursuant to this 
subpart.
    (i) The lessee must place gas in marketable condition and market the 
gas for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to 
the Indian lessor. Where the value established under this section is 
determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value will be increased to 
the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the 
purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services the cost 
of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the gas 
in marketable condition or to market the gas.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims pursuant to its contract. If 
there is no contract revision or amendment, and the lessee fails to take 
proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is 
entitled, it must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable 
price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing 
and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee 
makes timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed 
pursuant to its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes 
reasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser 
compliance, the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until 
monies or consideration resulting from the price increase or additional 
benefits are received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a 
lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a 
purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of 
gas.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value pursuant to this 
section shall be considered final or binding as against the Indian 
Tribes or allottees until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation, processing, or extraordinary cost 
allowances, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made pursuant to this 
subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR 
part 2. Nothing in this section is intended to limit or diminish in any 
manner whatsoever the right of an Indian lessor to obtain any and all 
information as such lessor may be lawfully entitled from MMS or such 
lessor's lessee directly pursuant to the terms of the lease, 30 U.S.C. 
1733, or other applicable law.

<R05>
Sec. 206.173  Valuation standards--processed gas.

    (a)(1) This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is 
processed by the lessee and any other gas production to which this 
subpart applies and that is not subject to the valuation provisions of 
Sec. 206.172 of this part. This section applies where the lessee's 
contract includes a reservation of the right to process the gas and the 
lessee exercises that right.
    (2) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of gas subject to 
this section shall be the combined value of the residue gas and all gas 
plant products determined pursuant to this section, plus the value of 
any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement 
without resorting to processing determined pursuant to section of this 
part, less applicable

[[Page 78]]

transportation allowances and processing allowances determined pursuant 
to this subpart.
    (3)(i) For any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may 
consider the highest price paid or offered for a major portion of 
production (major portion) in determining value for royalty purposes, if 
data are available to compute a major portion MMS will, where 
practicable, compare the values determined in accordance with this 
section for any lease product with the major portion determined for that 
lease product. The value to be used in determining the value of 
production for royalty purposes shall be the higher of those two values.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, major portion means the highest 
price paid or offered at the time of production for the major portion of 
gas production from the same field, or for residue gas or gas plant 
products from the same processing plant, as applicable. The major 
portion will be calculated using like-quality lease products sold 
pursuant to arm's-length contracts from the same field or processing 
plant (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same 
area or nearby processing plants) for each month. All such sales will be 
arrayed from highest price to lowest price (at the bottom). The major 
portion is that price at which 50 percent (by volume) plus 1 mcf of the 
gas (starting from the bottom) is sold, or for gas plant products, 50 
percent (by volume) plus 1 unit.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of residue gas or any gas plant product sold 
under an arm's-length contract is the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of 
this section, residue gas or any gas plant product which is sold or 
otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and then sold 
by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be 
valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon the sale by the 
marketing affiliate.
    (ii) In conducting these reviews and audits, MMS will examine 
whether or not the contract reflects the total consideration actually 
transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller 
for the residue gas or gas plant product. If the contract does not 
reflect the total consideration, then MMS may require that the residue 
gas or gas plant product sold pursuant to that contract be valued in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the additional 
consideration.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the residue gas or gas plant product because of 
misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee 
otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production 
for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall 
require that the residue gas or gas plant product be valued pursuant to 
paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and in accordance with the 
notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's value.
    (iv) How to value over-delivered volumes under a cash-out program. 
This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from 
a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation 
contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price 
the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for 
over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same 
value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those 
volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract. 
However, if MMS determines that the price specified in the 
transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low, 
the lessee must value all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2) 
or (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the

[[Page 79]]

value of residue gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract shall be 
determined by MMS, and due consideration will be given to all valuation 
criteria specified in this section. The lessee must request a value 
determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section for gas 
sold pursuant to a warranty contract; provided, however, that any value 
determination for a warranty contract in effect on the effective date of 
these regulations shall remain in effect until modified by MMS.
    (3) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the residue gas or gas plant 
product.
    (c) The value of residue gas or any gas plant product which is not 
sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable value 
determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following 
methods:
    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
pursuant to its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition other 
than by an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds 
are equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid pursuant to, 
comparable arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other 
dispositions of like quality residue gas or gas plant products from the 
same processing plant (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, 
from nearby plants). In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length 
contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the following factors 
shall be considered: price, time of execution, duration, market or 
markets served, terms, quality of residue gas or gas plant products, 
volume, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the 
value of the residue gas or gas plant products;
    (2) A value determined by consideration of other information 
relevant in valuing like-quality residue gas or gas plant products, 
including gross proceeds pursuant to arm's-length contracts for like-
quality residue gas or gas plant products from the same gas plant or 
other nearby processing plants, posted prices for residue gas or gas 
plant products, prices received in spot sales of residue gas or gas 
plant products, other reliable public sources of price or market 
information, and other information as to the particular lease operation 
or the salability of such residue gas or gas plant products; or
    (3) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except 
paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal 
law at which any residue gas or gas plant products may be sold is less 
than the value determined pursuant to this section, then MMS shall 
accept such maximum price as the value. For the purposes of this 
section, price limitations set by any State or local government shall 
not be considered as a maximum price permitted by Federal law.
    (2) The limitation prescribed by paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall not apply to residue gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract and 
valued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the 
determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and 
audit, and MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it 
determines upon review or audit that the reported value is inconsistent 
with the requirements of these regulations.
    (2) The Indian lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS, or Indian representatives, to the Office of the 
Inspector General of the Department of the Interior, or other persons 
authorized to receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume 
data for like-quality residue gas and gas plant products sold, purchased 
or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the same processing plant or 
from nearby processing plants.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined any value 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. The notification 
shall be by letter to MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or 
his/her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be 
used and contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. 
The notification required by

[[Page 80]]

this paragraph is a one-time notification due no later than the end of 
the month following the month the lessee first reports royalties on a 
Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized by paragraph (c)(2) or 
(c)(3) of this section, and each time there is a change in a method 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest computed on that difference pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54. 
If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for 
the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based upon 
the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. In making a value determination, MMS may use any of the 
valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That determination shall 
remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues its 
determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, pursuant to 
no circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be 
less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for residue gas and/
or any gas plant products, less applicable transportation allowances and 
processing allowances determined pursuant to this subpart.
    (i) The lessee must place residue gas and gas plant products in 
marketable condition and market the residue gas and gas plant products 
for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the 
Indian lessor. Where the value established under this section is 
determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value will be increased to 
the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the 
purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services the cost 
of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the 
residue gas or gas plant products in marketable condition or to market 
the residue gas and gas plant products.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims pursuant to its contract. 
Absent contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take 
proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is 
entitled it must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price 
or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and 
signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee makes 
timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed pursuant to 
its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable 
measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the 
lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or 
consideration resulting from the price increase or additional benefits 
are received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee 
to avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser 
fails to pay, in whole or in part, or timely, for a quantity of residue 
gas or gas plant product.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value pursuant to this 
section shall be considered final or binding against the Indian Tribes 
or allottees until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation allowances, processing allowances or 
extraordinary cost allowances, is exempted from disclosure by the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data 
specified by law to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, 
will be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. All requests for information about 
determinations

[[Page 81]]

made pursuant to this part are to be submitted in accordance with the 
Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 
43 CFR part 2. Nothing in this section is intended to limit or diminish 
in any manner whatsoever the right of an Indian lessor to obtain any and 
all information as such lessor may be lawfully entitled from MMS or such 
lessor's lessee directly pursuant to the terms of the lease, 30 U.S.C. 
1733, or other applicable law.

Sec. 206.174  Determination of quantities and qualities for computing royalties.

    (a)(1) Royalties shall be computed on the basis of the quantity and 
quality of unprocessed gas at the point of royalty settlement approved 
by BLM for onshore leases.
    (2) If the value of gas determined pursuant to Sec. 206.172 of this 
subpart is based upon a quantity and/or quality that is different from 
the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement, as 
approved by BLM or MMS, that value shall be adjusted for the differences 
in quantity and/or quality.
    (b)(1) For residue gas and gas plant products, the quantity basis 
for computing royalties due is the monthly net output of the plant even 
though residue gas and/or gas plant products may be in temporary 
storage.
    (2) If the value of residue gas and/or gas plant products determined 
pursuant to Sec. 206.173 of this subpart is based upon a quantity and/or 
quality of residue gas and/or gas plant products that is different from 
that which is attributable to a lease, determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section, that value shall be adjusted for the 
differences in quantity and/or quality.
    (c) The quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products 
attributable to a lease shall be determined according to the following 
procedure:
    (1) When the net output of the processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from only one lease, the quantity of the residue gas and gas 
plant products on which computations of royalty are based is the net 
output of the plant.
    (2) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from more than one lease producing gas of uniform content, the 
quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each 
lease shall be in the same proportions as the ratios obtained by 
dividing the amount of gas delivered to the plant from each lease by the 
total amount of gas delivered from all leases.
    (3) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from more than one lease producing gas of nonuniform content, 
the quantity of the residue gas allocable to each lease will be 
determined by multiplying the amount of gas delivered to the plant from 
the lease by the residue gas content of the gas, and dividing the 
arithmetical product thus obtained by the sum of the similar 
arithmetical products separately obtained for all leases from which gas 
is delivered to the plant, and then multiplying the net output of the 
residue gas by the arithmetic quotient obtained. The net output of gas 
plant products allocable to each lease will be determined by multiplying 
the amount of gas delivered to the plant from the lease by the gas plant 
product content of the gas, and dividing the arithmetical product thus 
obtained by the sum of the similar arithmetical products separately 
obtained for all leases from which gas is delivered to the plant, and 
then multiplying the net output of each gas plant product by the 
arithmetic quotient obtained.
    (4) A lessee may request MMS approval of other methods for 
determining the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable 
to each lease. If approved, such method will be applicable to all gas 
production from Indian leases that is processed in the same plant.
    (d)(1) No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty 
value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed 
gas that may be sustained prior to the royalty settlement metering or 
measurement point will not be subject to royalty provided that such loss 
is determined to have been unavoidable by BLM .
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and 30 
CFR

[[Page 82]]

202.171(c), royalties are due on 100 percent of the volume determined in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. There can be 
no reduction in that determined volume for actual losses after the 
quantity basis has been determined or for theoretical losses that are 
claimed to have taken place. Royalties are due on 100 percent of the 
value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas plant products as 
provided in this subpart, less applicable allowances. There can be no 
deduction from the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas 
plant products to compensate for actual losses after the quantity basis 
has been determined, or for theoretical losses that are claimed to have 
taken place.


<R05>
Sec. 206.175  Accounting for comparison.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where the 
lessee (or a person to whom the lessee has transferred gas pursuant to a 
non-arm's-length contract or without a contract) processes the lessee's 
gas and after processing the gas the residue gas is not sold pursuant to 
an arm's-length contract, the value, for royalty purposes, shall be the 
greater of (1) the combined value, for royalty purposes, of the residue 
gas and gas plant products resulting from processing the gas determined 
pursuant to Sec. 206.173 of this subpart, plus the value, for royalty 
purposes, of any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty 
settlement without resorting to processing determined pursuant to 
Sec. 206.52 of this subpart; or (2) the value, for royalty purposes, of 
the gas prior to processing determined in accordance with Sec. 206.172 
of this subpart.
    (b) The requirement for accounting for comparison contained in the 
terms of leases, particularly Indian leases, will govern as provided in 
Sec. 206.170(b) of this subpart. When accounting for comparison is 
required by the lease terms, such accounting for comparison shall be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 206.176  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of gas has been determined pursuant to 
Sec. 206.172 or Sec. 206.173 of this subpart at a point (e.g., sales 
point or point of value determination) off the lease, MMS shall allow a 
deduction for the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee to 
transport unprocessed gas, residue gas, and gas plant products from a 
lease to a point off the lease including, if appropriate, transportation 
from the lease to a gas processing plant off the lease and from the 
plant to a point away from the plant.
    (b) Transportation costs must be allocated among all products 
produced and transported as provided in Sec. 206.177.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for 
unprocessed gas valued in accordance with Sec. 206.172 of this subpart, 
the transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling 
arrangement shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the unprocessed 
gas determined in accordance with Sec. 206.172 of this subpart.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for gas 
production valued in accordance with Sec. 206.173 of this subpart the 
transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling arrangement 
shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the residue gas or gas plant 
product determined in accordance with Sec. 206.173 of this subpart. For 
purposes of this section, natural gas liquids shall be considered one 
product.
    (3) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a transportation 
allowance deduction in excess of the limitations prescribed by 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. The lessee must 
demonstrate that the transportation costs incurred in excess of the 
limitations prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section 
were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for exception 
(using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) 
shall contain all relevant and supporting documentation necessary for 
MMS to make a determination. Pursuant to no circumstances shall the 
value for royalty purposes pursuant to any selling arrangement be 
reduced to zero.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
subpart,

[[Page 83]]

then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus interest, 
determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be entitled to a 
credit, without interest.


<R05>
Sec. 206.177  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length transportation contracts. (1)(i) For transportation 
costs incurred by a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the 
transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred 
by the lessee for transporting the unprocessed gas, residue gas and/or 
gas plant products pursuant to that contract, except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, subject to 
monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall have the 
burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. Such 
allowances shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this 
section. Before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed page one of Form MMS-4295 (and Schedule 1), Gas Transportation 
Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A 
transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of 
not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form 
MMS-4295 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a 
showing of good cause by the lessee.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether or 
not the contract reflects more than the consideration actually 
transferred either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the 
transporter for the transportation. If the contract reflects more than 
the total consideration, then MMS may require that the transportation 
allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable 
value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (2)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one product in a gaseous phase and the transportation costs attributable 
to each product cannot be determined from the contract, the total 
transportation costs shall be allocated in a consistent and equitable 
manner to each of the products transported in the same proportion as the 
ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products which have 
no value) to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding 
waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this 
paragraph, no allowance may be taken for the costs of transporting lease 
production which is not royalty bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this subpart.
    (3) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous 
and liquid products and the transportation costs attributable to each 
cannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose an 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the transportation 
allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination on the acceptability of the 
cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all relevant data to support 
its proposal. The initial proposal must be submitted by June 30, 1988, 
or within 3 months after the last day of the month for which the lessee 
requests a transportation allowance, whichever is later (unless MMS 
approves a longer period). MMS shall then determine the gas 
transportation allowance based upon

[[Page 84]]

the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation pursuant to an 
arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar per unit, the lessee 
shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price or a posted price 
includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a 
transportation factor, MMS will not consider the transportation factor 
to be a transportation allowance. The transportation factor may be used 
in determining the lessee's gross proceeds for the sale of the product. 
The transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of 
the product without MMS approval.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, 
the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable 
actual costs as provided in this paragraph. All transportation 
allowances deducted pursuant to a non-arm's-length or no contract 
situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. 
Before any estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must 
submit a completed Form MMS-4295 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section. A transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively 
for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the 
month that Form MMS-4295 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer 
period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee. MMS will monitor the 
allowance deductions to ensure that deductions are reasonable and 
allowable. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its actual transportation allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial 
depreciable investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate 
of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed 
assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment) which are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. 
State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, 
including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. After a lessee has elected to use either method for 
a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the 
other alternative without approval of MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, or a 
unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not 
change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a 
transportation system

[[Page 85]]

shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below 
a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by 
the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this 
section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This 
alternative shall apply only to transportation facilities first placed 
in service after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is 
applicable and shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate 
shall be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent transportation 
allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section).
    (3)(i) The deduction for transportation costs shall be determined on 
the basis of the lessee's cost of transporting each product through each 
individual transportation system. Where more than one product in a 
gaseous phase is transported, the allocation of costs to each of the 
products transported shall be made in a consistent and equitable manner 
in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product 
(excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all 
products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products which have no 
value). Except as provided in this paragraph, the lessee may not take an 
allowance for transporting a product which is not royalty bearing 
without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (4) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through 
the same transportation system, the lessee shall propose a cost 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the transportation 
allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination on the acceptability of the 
cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all relevant data to support 
its proposal. The initial proposal must be submitted by June 30, 1988 or 
within 3 months after the last day of the month for which the lessee 
begins the transportation, whichever is later, unless MMS approves a 
longer period. MMS shall then determine the transportation allowance 
based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS 
deems necessary.
    (5) A lessee may apply to MMS for an exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(4) of this section. MMS will grant the exception only if the 
lessee has a tariff for the transportation system approved by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for Indian leases. MMS shall 
deny the exception request if it determines that the tariff is excessive 
as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by pipelines, owned 
by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in 
that area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, MMS 
shall deny the exception request if: (i) No FERC cost analysis exists 
and the FERC has declined to investigate pursuant to MMS timely 
objections upon filing; and (ii) the tariff significantly exceeds the 
lessee's actual costs for transportation as determined pursuant to this 
section.
    (c) Reporting requirements. (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the 
exception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page 
one of the initial Form MMS-4295 (and Schedule 1) prior to, or at the 
same time as, the transportation allowance determined pursuant to an 
arm's-length contract is reported on Form MMS-2014, Report of Sales and 
Royalty Remittance. A Form MMS-4295 received by the end of the month 
that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be considered to be timely received.

[[Page 86]]

    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4295 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is 
modified or amended, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding 
reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form MMS-4295 (and 
Schedule 1) within 3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after 
the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, 
whichever is earlier, unless MMS approves a longer period (during which 
period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous 
reporting period).
    (iv) MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (v) Transportation allowances which are based on arm's-length 
contracts and which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those 
transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v), 
(c)(2)(vii), and (c)(2)(viii) of this section, the lessee shall submit 
an initial Form MMS-4295 prior to, or at the same time as, the 
transportation allowance determined pursuant to a non-arm's-length 
contract or no contract situation is reported on Form MMS-2014, Report 
of Sales and Royalty Remittance. A Form MMS-4295 received by the end of 
the month that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be considered to be timely 
received. The initial report may be based upon estimated costs.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4295 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until the transportation pursuant to the non-arm's-
length contract or the no contract situation terminates, whichever is 
earlier.
    (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial 
reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4295 
containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If the 
transportation is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4295 
its estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated 
transportation allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the 
previous reporting period plus or minus any adjustments which are based 
on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases which will affect 
the allowance. Form MMS-4295 must be received by MMS within 3 months 
after the end of the previous reporting period, unless MMS approves a 
longer period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the 
allowance from the previous reporting period).
    (iv) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial Form MMS-4295 shall include estimates of the allowable 
transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be 
based upon the most recently available operations data for the 
transportation system, or if such data are not available, the lessee 
shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation 
systems.
    (v) Non-arm's-length contract or no contract based transportation 
allowances which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare its Form MMS-4295. The data shall be

[[Page 87]]

provided within a reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (vii) MMS may establish in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (viii) If the lessee is authorized to use its FERC-approved tariff 
as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section.
    (3) MMS may establish reporting dates for individual lessees 
different than those specified in this subpart in order to provide more 
effective administration. Lessees will be notified of any change in 
their reporting period.
    (4) Transportation allowances must be reported as a separate line 
item on Form MMS-2014, unless MMS approves a different reporting 
procedure.
    (d) Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and failure 
to report. (1) If a lessee deducts a processing allowance on its Form 
MMS-2014 without complying with the requirements of this section, the 
lessee shall pay interest only on the amount of such deduction until the 
requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee also shall 
repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this section.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required 
to pay additional royalties due plus interest computed pursuant to 30 
CFR 218.54, retroactive to the first day of the first month the lessee 
is authorized to deduct a transportation allowance. If the actual 
transportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken 
on Form MMS-2014 for each month during the allowance form reporting 
period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.
    (2) For lessees transporting production from onshore Indian leases, 
the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual 
costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Allowable costs in determining transportation allowances. 
Lessees may include, but are not limited to, the following costs in 
determining the arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph 
(a) of this section or the non-arm's-length transportation allowance 
under paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Firm demand charges paid to pipelines. You must limit the 
allowable costs for the firm demand charges to the applicable rate per 
MMBtu multiplied by the actual volumes transported. You may not include 
any losses incurred for previously purchased but unused firm capacity. 
You also may not include any gains associated with releasing firm 
capacity. If you receive a payment or credit from the pipeline for 
penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce 
the firm demand charge claimed on the Form MMS-2014. You must modify the 
Form MMS-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected 
reporting period;
    (2) Gas supply realignment (GSR) costs. The GSR costs result from a 
pipeline reforming or terminating supply contracts with producers to 
implement the restructuring requirements of FERC Orders in 18 CFR part 
284;
    (3) Commodity charges. The commodity charge allows the pipeline to 
recover the costs of providing service;
    (4) Wheeling costs. Hub operators charge a wheeling cost for 
transporting gas from one pipeline to either the same or another 
pipeline through a market center or hub. A hub is a connected manifold 
of pipelines through which a series of incoming pipelines are 
interconnected to a series of outgoing pipelines;
    (5) Gas Research Institute (GRI) fees. The GRI conducts research, 
development, and commercialization programs on natural gas related 
topics for the benefit of the U.S. gas industry and gas

[[Page 88]]

customers. GRI fees are allowable provided such fees are mandatory in 
FERC-approved tariffs;
    (6) Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) fees. FERC charges these fees to 
pipelines to pay for its operating expenses;
    (7) Payments (either volumetric or in value) for actual or 
theoretical losses. This paragraph does not apply to non-arm's-length 
transportation arrangements unless the transportation allowance is based 
on a FERC or State regulatory-approved tariff;
    (8) Temporary storage services. This includes short duration storage 
services offered by market centers or hubs (commonly referred to as 
``parking'' or ``banking''), or other temporary storage services 
provided by pipeline transporters, whether actual or provided as a 
matter of accounting. Temporary storage is limited to 30 days or less; 
and
    (9) Supplemental costs for compression, dehydration, and treatment 
of gas. MMS allows these costs only if such services are required for 
transportation and exceed the services necessary to place production 
into marketable condition required under Secs. 206.172(i) and 206.173(i) 
of this part.
    (g) Nonallowable costs in determining transportation allowances. 
Lessees may not include the following costs in determining the arm's-
length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section or 
the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (1) Fees or costs incurred for storage. This includes storing 
production in a storage facility, whether on or off the lease, for more 
than 30 days;
    (2) Aggregator/marketer fees. This includes fees you pay to another 
person (including your affiliates) to market your gas, including 
purchasing and reselling the gas, or finding or maintaining a market for 
the gas production;
    (3) Penalties you incur as shipper. These penalties include, but are 
not limited to:
    (i) Over-delivery cash-out penalties. This includes the difference 
between the price the pipeline pays you for over-delivered volumes 
outside the tolerances and the price you receive for over-delivered 
volumes within the tolerances;
    (ii) Scheduling penalties. This includes penalties you incur for 
differences between daily volumes delivered into the pipeline and 
volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point;
    (iii) Imbalance penalties. This includes penalties you incur 
(generally on a monthly basis) for differences between volumes delivered 
into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or 
delivery point; and
    (iv) Operational penalties. This includes fees you incur for 
violation of the pipeline's curtailment or operational orders issued to 
protect the operational integrity of the pipeline;
    (4) Intra-hub transfer fees. These are fees you pay to hub operators 
for administrative services (e.g., title transfer tracking) necessary to 
account for the sale of gas within a hub; and
    (5) Other nonallowable costs. Any cost you incur for services you 
are required to provide at no cost to the lessor.
    (h) Other transportation cost determinations. Use this section when 
calculating transportation costs to establish value using a netback 
procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of 
transportation costs.

Sec. 206.178  Processing allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of gas is determined pursuant to Sec. 206.173 of 
this subpart, a deduction shall be allowed for the reasonable actual 
costs of processing.
    (b) Processing costs must be allocated among the gas plant products. 
A separate processing allowance must be determined for each gas plant 
product and processing plant relationship. Natural gas liquids (NGL's) 
shall be considered as one product.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the 
processing allowance shall not be applied against the value of the 
residue gas. Where there is no residue gas MMS may designate an 
appropriate gas plant product against which no allowance may be applied.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the 
processing allowance deduction on the basis of an

[[Page 89]]

individual product shall not exceed 66\2/3\ percent of the value of each 
gas plant product determined in accordance with Sec. 206.173 of this 
subpart (such value to be reduced first for any transportation 
allowances related to postprocessing transportation authorized by 
Sec. 206.176 of this subpart).
    (3) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a processing allowance 
in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. The lessee must demonstrate that the processing costs incurred 
in excess of the limitation prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for 
exception (using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance 
Limitation) shall contain all relevant and supporting documentation for 
MMS to make a determination. Under no circumstances shall the value for 
royalty purposes of any gas plant product be reduced to zero.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no 
processing cost deduction shall be allowed for the costs of placing 
lease products in marketable condition, including dehydration, 
separation, compression, or storage, even if those functions are 
performed off the lease or at a processing plant. Where gas is processed 
for the removal of acid gases, commonly referred to as ``sweetening,'' 
no processing cost deduction shall be allowed for such costs unless the 
acid gases removed are further processed into a gas plant product. In 
such event, the lessee shall be eligible for a processing allowance as 
determined in accordance with this subpart. However, MMS will not grant 
any processing allowance for processing lease production which is not 
royalty bearing.
    (2)(i) If the lessee incurs extraordinary costs for processing gas 
production from a gas production operation, it may apply to MMS for an 
allowance for those costs which shall be in addition to any other 
processing allowance to which the lessee is entitled pursuant to this 
section. Such an allowance may be granted only if the lessee can 
demonstrate that the costs are, by reference to standard industry 
conditions and practice, extraordinary, unusual, or unconventional.
    (ii) Prior MMS approval to continue an extraordinary processing cost 
allowance is not required. However, to retain the authority to deduct 
the allowance the lessee must report the deduction to MMS in a form and 
manner prescribed by MMS.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has improperly determined a 
processing allowance authorized by this subpart, then the lessee shall 
pay any additional royalties, plus interest determined in accordance 
with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.


<R05>
Sec. 206.179  Determination of processing allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length processing contracts. (1)(i) For processing costs 
incurred by a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the 
processing allowance shall be the reasonable actual costs incurred by 
the lessee for processing the gas pursuant to that contract, except as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, 
subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall 
have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. 
Before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed 
page one of Form MMS-4109, Gas Processing Allowance Summary Report, in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A processing allowance 
may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months 
prior to the first day of the month that Form MMS-4109 is filed with 
MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by 
the lessee.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the processor for the 
processing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration, 
then MMS may require that the processing allowance be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-

[[Page 90]]

length processing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the 
processing because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, 
or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to 
market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and lessor, 
then MMS shall require that the processing allowance be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS determines that 
the value of the processing may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's processing costs.
    (2) If an arm's-length processing contract includes more than one 
gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product 
can be determined from the contract, then the processing costs for each 
gas plant product shall be determined in accordance with the contract. 
No allowance may be taken for the costs of processing lease production 
which is not royalty-bearing.
    (3) If an arm's-length processing contract includes more than one 
gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product 
cannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose an 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination. The lessee shall submit 
all relevant data to support its proposal. The initial proposal must be 
submitted by June 30, 1988 or within 3 months after the last day of the 
month for which the lessee requests a processing allowance, whichever is 
later (unless MMS approves a longer period). MMS shall then determine 
the processing allowance based upon the lessee's proposal and any 
additional information MMS deems necessary. No processing allowance will 
be granted for the costs of processing lease production which is not 
royalty bearing.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for processing pursuant to an arm's-
length contract are not based on a dollar per unit basis, the lessee 
shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length processing contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs processing for itself, the 
processing allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual 
costs as provided in this paragraph. All processing allowances deducted 
pursuant to a non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to 
monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. Before any estimated or 
actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed Form 
MMS-4109 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A 
processing allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not 
more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form MMS-
4109 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a 
showing of good cause by the lessee. MMS will monitor the allowance 
deduction to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When 
necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its actual 
processing allowance.
    (2) The processing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for processing 
during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial 
depreciable investment in the processing plant multiplied by a rate of 
return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed 
assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment) which are an integral part of the processing plant.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: maintenance of the 
processing plant; maintenance of equipment;

[[Page 91]]

maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable 
maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the processing plant is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are 
not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. When a lessee has elected to use either method for a 
processing plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other 
alternative without approval of MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the processing plant services, or a unit-
of-production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not 
change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
processing plant shall not alter the depreciation schedule established 
by the original processor/lessee for purposes of the allowance 
calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a processing plant 
shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below 
a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
initial capital investment in the processing plant multiplied by the 
rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this 
section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This 
alternative shall apply only to plants first placed in service after 
March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is 
applicable and shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate 
shall be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent processing 
allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section).
    (3) The processing allowance for each gas plant product shall be 
determined based on the lessee's reasonable and actual cost of 
processing the gas. Allocation of costs to each gas plant product shall 
be based upon generally accepted accounting principles. The lessee may 
not take an allowance for the costs of processing lease production which 
is not royalty bearing.
    (4) A lessee may apply to MMS for an exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(3) of this section. MMS may grant the exception only if: (i) 
The lessee has arm's-length contracts for processing other gas 
production at the same processing plant; and (ii) at least 50 percent of 
the gas processed annually at the plant is processed pursuant to arm's-
length processing contracts; if MMS grants the exception, the lessee 
shall use as its processing allowance the volume weighted average prices 
charged other persons pursuant to arm's-length contracts for processing 
at the same plant.
    (c) Reporting requirements. (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the 
exception of those processing allowances specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page 
one of the initial Form MMS-4109 (and Schedule 1) prior to the time, or 
at the same time as, the processing allowance determined pursuant to an 
arm's-length contract is reported on Form MMS-2014, Report of Sales and 
Royalty Remittance. A Form MMS-4109 received by the end of the month 
that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be considered to be timely received.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4109 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct 
a processing allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar 
year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified 
or amended, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding 
reporting periods, lessees must submit page 1 of Form MMS-4109 (and 
Schedule 1) within 3 months after the end of the calendar

[[Page 92]]

year, or after the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified 
or amended, whichever is earlier, unless MMS approves a longer period 
(during which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from 
the previous reporting period).
    (iv) MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length processing 
contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a 
reasonable time, as determined by MMS.
    (v) Processing allowances which are based on arm's-length contracts 
and which are in effect at the time these regulations become effective 
will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the 
purpose of this section, only those allowances that have been approved 
by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these 
regulations became effective.
    (vi) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those 
processing allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v), (c)(2)(vii) and 
(c)(2)(viii) of this section, the lessee shall submit an initial Form 
MMS-4109 prior to, or at the same time as, the processing allowance 
determined pursuant to a non-arm's-length contract or no contract 
situation is reported on Form MMS-2014, Report of Sales and Royalty 
Remittance. A Form MMS-4109 received by the end of the month that the 
Form MMS-2014 is due shall be considered to be timely received. The 
initial report may be based upon estimated costs.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4109 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct 
a processing allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar 
year, or until the processing pursuant to the non-arm's-length contract 
or the no contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial 
reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4109 
containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If gas 
processing is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4109 its 
estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated gas processing 
allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the previous period 
plus or minus any adjustments which are based on the lessee's knowledge 
of decreases or increases which will affect the allowance. Form MMS-4109 
must be received by MMS within 3 months after the end of the previous 
reporting period, unless MMS approves a longer period (during which 
period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous 
reporting period).
    (iv) For new processing plants, the lessee's initial Form MMS-4109 
shall include estimates of the allowable gas processing costs for the 
applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently 
available operations data for the plant, or if such data are not 
available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for 
similar gas processing plants.
    (v) Processing allowances based on non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate 
for gas production from Indian leases. For the purposes of this section, 
only those allowances that have been approved by MMS in writing shall 
qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective.
    (vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used by 
the lessee to prepare its Form MMS-4109. The data shall be provided 
within a reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (vii) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (viii) If the lessee is authorized to use the volume weighted 
average prices charged other persons as its processing allowance in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, it shall follow the 
reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) MMS may establish reporting dates for individual leases 
different from those specified in this subpart in

[[Page 93]]

order to provide more effective administration. Lessees will be notified 
of any change in their reporting period.
    (4) Processing allowances must be reported as a separate line on the 
Form MMS-2014, unless MMS approves a different reporting procedure.
    (d) Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and failure 
to report. (1) If a lessee deducts a processing allowance on its Form 
MMS-2014 without complying with the requirements of this section, the 
lessee shall pay interest only on the amount of such deduction until the 
requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee also shall 
repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this section.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a processing allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual gas processing allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required 
to pay additional royalties due plus interest computed pursuant to 30 
CFR 218.54, retroactive to the first day of the first month the lessee 
is authorized to deduct a processing allowance. If the actual processing 
allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-
2014 for each month during the allowance period, the lessee shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest.
    (2) For lessees processing production from onshore Indian leases, 
the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual 
costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Other processing cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine processing costs when establishing 
value using a net back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of processing costs.

    Source: 54 FR 1523, Jan. 13, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 206.250  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all coal produced from Federal 
coal leases. The purpose of this subpart is to establish the value of 
coal produced for royalty purposes, of all coal from Federal leases 
consistent with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws and 
lease terms.
    (b) If the specific provisions of any statute or settlement 
agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from 
administrative or judicial litigation, or any coal lease subject to the 
requirements of this subpart, are inconsistent with any regulation in 
this subpart then the statute, lease provision, or settlement shall 
govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) All royalty payments made to the Mineral Management Service 
(MMS) are subject to later audit and adjustment.

Sec. 206.251  Definitions.

    Ad valorem lease means a lease where the royalty due to the lessor 
is based upon a percentage of the amount or value of the coal.
    Allowance means a deduction used in determining value for royalty 
purposes. Coal washing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, 
actual costs incurred by the lessee for coal washing. Transportation 
allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred 
by the lessee for moving coal to a point of sale or point of delivery 
remote from both the lease and mine or wash plant.
    Area means a geographic region in which coal has similar quality and 
economic characteristics. Area boundaries are not officially designated 
and the areas are not necessarily named.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with opposing economic interests regarding

[[Page 94]]

that contract. For purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated 
if one person controls, is controlled by, or is under common control 
with another person. For purposes of this subpart, based on the 
instruments of ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based 
on other forms of ownership:
    (a) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;
    (b) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of 
control; and
    (c) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of 
noncontrol which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal 
control, including the existence of interlocking directorates.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between 
relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length 
contracts. The MMS may require the lessee to certify ownership control. 
To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must 
meet the requirements of this definition for that production month as 
well as when the contract was executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Coal means coal of all ranks from lignite through anthracite.
    Coal washing means any treatment to remove impurities from coal. 
Coal washing may include, but is not limited to, operations such as 
flotation, air, water, or heavy media separation; drying; and related 
handling (or combination thereof).
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to a coal lessee for the production and 
disposition of the coal produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not 
limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as 
crushing, sizing, screening, storing, mixing, loading, treatment with 
substances including chemicals or oils, and other preparation of the 
coal to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no 
cost to the Federal Government. Gross proceeds, as applied to coal, also 
includes but is not limited to reimbursements for royalties, taxes or 
fees, and other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross 
proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Federal royalty interest 
may be exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including 
the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a 
lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek 
to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States for a Federal 
coal resource under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration 
for, development or extraction of, or removal of coal--or the land 
covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, 
and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or 
other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has 
an interest in a lease as well as an operator or payor who has no 
interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment 
responsibility.
    Like-quality coal means coal has similar chemical and physical 
characteristics.
    Marketable condition means coal that is sufficiently free from 
impurities and otherwise in a condition that it will be accepted by a 
purchaser under a sales contract typical for that area.
    Mine means an underground or surface excavation or series of 
excavations and the surface or underground support facilities that 
contribute directly or indirectly to mining, production, preparation, 
and handling of lease products.

[[Page 95]]

    Net-back method means a method for calculating market value of coal 
at the lease or mine. Under this method, costs of transportation, 
washing, handling, etc., are deducted from the ultimate proceeds 
received for the coal at the first point at which reasonable values for 
the coal may be determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract or by comparison to other sales of coal, to ascertain value at 
the mine.
    Net output means the quantity of washed coal that a washing plant 
produces.
    Netting is the deduction of an allowance from the sales value by 
reporting a one line net sales value, instead of correctly reporting the 
deduction as a separate line item on the Form MMS-2014.
    Person means by individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of coal are made to a purchaser.
    Spot market price means the price received under any sales 
transaction when planned or actual deliveries span a short period of 
time, usually not exceeding one year.

Sec. 206.252  Information collection.

    The information collection requirements contained in this subpart 
have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The forms, filing date, and approved OMB clearance 
numbers are identified in 30 CFR 210.10 and 30 CFR 216.10.


<R05>
Sec. 206.253  Coal subject to royalties--general provisions.

    (a) All coal (except coal unavoidably lost as determined by BLM 
under 43 CFR part 3400) from a Federal lease subject to this part is 
subject to royalty. This includes coal used, sold, or otherwise disposed 
of by the lessee on or off the lease.
    (b) If a lessee receives compensation for unavoidably lost coal 
through insurance coverage or other arrangements, royalties at the rate 
specified in the lease are to be paid on the amount of compensation 
received for the coal. No royalty is due on insurance compensation 
received by the lessee for other losses.
    (c) If waste piles or slurry ponds are reworked to recover coal, the 
lessee shall pay royalty at the rate specified in the lease at the time 
the recovered coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. The 
royalty rate shall be that rate applicable to the production method used 
to initially mine coal in the waste pile or slurry pond; i.e., 
underground mining method or surface mining method. Coal in waste pits 
or slurry ponds initially mined from Federal leases shall be allocated 
to such leases regardless of whether it is stored on Federal lands. The 
lessee shall maintain accurate records to determine to which individual 
Federal lease coal in the waste pit or slurry pond should be allocated. 
However, nothing in this section requires payment of a royalty on coal 
for which a royalty has already been paid.

<R05>
Sec. 206.254  Quality and quantity measurement standards for reporting and paying royalties.

    (a) For leases subject to Sec. 206.257 of this subpart, the quality 
of coal on which royalty is due shall be reported on the basis of 
percent sulfur, percent ash, and number of British thermal units (Btu) 
per pound of coal. Coal quality determinations shall be made at 
intervals prescribed in the lessee's sales contract. If there is no 
contract, or if the contract does not specify the intervals of coal 
quality determination, the lessee shall propose a quality test schedule 
to MMS. In no case, however, shall quality tests be performed less than 
quarterly using standard industry-recognized testing methods. Coal 
quality information shall be reported on the appropriate forms required 
under 30 CFR part 216.
    (b) For all leases subject to this subpart, the quantity of coal on 
which royalty is due shall be measured in short tons (of 2,000 pounds 
each) by methods prescribed by the BLM. Coal quantity information shall 
be reported on appropriate forms required under 30

[[Page 96]]

CFR part 216 and on the Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance, Form 
MMS-2014, as required under 30 CFR part 210.

<R05>
Sec. 206.255  Point of royalty determination.

    (a) For all leases subject to this subpart, royalty shall be 
computed on the basis of the quantity and quality of Federal coal in 
marketable condition measured at the point of royalty measurement as 
determined jointly by BLM and MMS.
    (b) Coal produced and added to stockpiles or inventory does not 
require payment of royalty until such coal is later used, sold, or 
otherwise finally disposed of. MMS may ask BLM to increase the lease 
bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that 
stockpiles or inventory become excessive so as to increase the risk of 
degradation of the resource.
    (c) The lessee shall pay royalty at a rate specified in the lease at 
the time the coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, 
unless otherwise provided for at Sec. 206.256(d) of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 206.256  Valuation standards for cents-per-ton leases.

    (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Federal lands which 
provide for the determination of royalty on a cents-per-ton (or other 
quantity) basis.
    (b) The royalty for coal from leases subject to this section shall 
be based on the dollar rate per ton prescribed in the lease. That dollar 
rate shall be applicable to the actual quantity of coal used, sold, or 
otherwise finally disposed of, including coal which is avoidably lost as 
determine by BLM pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400.
    (c) For leases subject to this section, there shall be no allowances 
for transportation, removal of impurities, coal washing, or any other 
processing or preparation of the coal.
    (d) When a coal lease is readjusted pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400 and 
the royalty valuation method changes from a cents-per-ton basis to an ad 
valorem basis, coal which is produced prior to the effective date of 
readjustment and sold or used within 30 days of the effective date of 
readjustment shall be valued pursuant to this section. All coal that is 
not used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of within 30 days after 
the effective date of readjustment shall be valued pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 206.257 of this subpart, and royalties shall be paid 
at the royalty rate specified in the readjusted lease.
[54 FR 1523, Jan. 13, 1989, as amended at 61 FR 5480, Feb. 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 206.257  Valuation standards for ad valorem leases.

    (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Federal lands which 
provide for the determination of royalty as a percentage of the amount 
of value of coal (ad valorem). The value for royalty purposes of coal 
from such leases shall be the value of coal determined under this 
section, less applicable coal washing allowances and transportation 
allowances determined under Secs. 206.258 through 206.262 of this 
subpart, or any allowance authorized by Sec. 206.265 of this subpart. 
The royalty due shall be equal to the value for royalty purposes 
multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
    (b)(1) The value of coal that is sold pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(5) of this section. The 
lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is 
arm's-length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, 
is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the coal 
produced. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, then 
the MMS may require that the coal sold pursuant to that contract be 
valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not 
be based on less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the 
coal production, including the additional consideration.
    (3) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee

[[Page 97]]

pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable value 
of the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the 
lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and 
the lessor, then MMS shall require that the coal production be valued 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, 
and in accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, 
MMS will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's reported coal value.
    (4) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the coal production.
    (5) The value of production for royalty purposes shall not include 
payments received by the lessee pursuant to a contract which the lessee 
demonstrates, to MMS's satisfaction, were not part of the total 
consideration paid for the purchase of coal production.
    (c)(1) The value of coal from leases subject to this section and 
which is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be 
determined in accordance with this section.
    (2) If the value of the coal cannot be determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, then the value shall be determined 
through application of other valuation criteria. The criteria shall be 
considered in the following order, and the value shall be based upon the 
first applicable criterion:
    (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition of produced 
coal by other than an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross 
proceeds are within the range of the gross proceeds derived from, or 
paid under, comparable arm's-length contracts between buyers and sellers 
neither of whom is affiliated with the lessee for sales, purchases, or 
other dispositions of like-quality coal produced in the area. In 
evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes 
of these regulations, the following factors shall be considered: Price, 
time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of 
coal, quantity, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect 
the value of the coal;
    (ii) Prices reported for that coal to a public utility commission;
    (iii) Prices reported for that coal to the Energy Information 
Administration of the Department of Energy;
    (iv) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published 
or publicly available spot market prices, or information submitted by 
the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease 
operation or the saleability of certain types of coal;
    (v) If a reasonable value cannot be determined using paragraphs 
(c)(2) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, then a net-back method 
or any other reasonable method shall be used to determine value.
    (3) When the value of coal is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, that value determination shall be consistent 
with the provisions contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (d)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, that value does not require MMS's prior approval. However, 
the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of 
royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMS 
will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the 
reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or State representatives, to the Inspector General of the 
Department of the Interior or other persons authorized to receive such 
information, arm's-length sales value and sales quantity data for like-
quality coal sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from 
the area.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraphs (c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section. The 
notification shall be by letter to the Associate Director for

[[Page 98]]

Royalty Management of his/her designee. The letter shall identify the 
valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of the 
procedure to be followed. The notification required by this section is a 
one-time notification due no later than the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on the Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method 
authorized by paragraphs (c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this 
section, and each time there is a change in a method under paragraphs 
(c)(2) (iv) or (v) of this section.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall be liable for the difference, if any, between 
royalty payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty 
payments that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The 
lessee shall also be liable for interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.202. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based 
upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. That determination shall remain effective for the period 
stated therein. After MMS issues its determination, the lessee shall 
make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value for royalty purposes be less than the 
gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the disposition of produced 
coal less applicable provisions of paragraph (b)(5) of this section and 
less applicable allowances determined pursuant to Secs. 206.258 through 
206.262 and Sec. 206.265 of this subpart.
    (h) The lessee is required to place coal in marketable condition at 
no cost to the Federal Government. Where the value established under 
this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value 
shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds has been 
reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain 
services, the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the 
lessee to place the coal in marketable condition.
    (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract, and may be retroactively applied to 
value for royalty purposes for a period not to exceed two years, unless 
MMS approves a longer period. If the lessee makes timely application for 
a price increase allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, 
and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force 
purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless 
or until monies or consideration resulting from the price increase are 
received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to 
avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser 
fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of coal.
    (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Federal Government 
or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation, coal washing, or other allowances 
under Sec. 206.265 of this subpart, is exempted from disclosure by the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 522. Any data specified by the Act 
to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt shall be maintained 
in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. All requests for information about determinations made 
under this

[[Page 99]]

part are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information 
Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2.

Sec. 206.258  Washing allowances--general.

    (a) For ad valorem leases subject to Sec. 206.257 of this subpart, 
MMS shall, as authorized by this section, allow a deduction in 
determining value for royalty purposes for the reasonable, actual costs 
incurred to wash coal, unless the value determined pursuant to 
Sec. 206.257 of this subpart was based upon like-quality unwashed coal. 
Under no circumstances shall the washing allowance and the 
transportation allowance authorized by Sec. 206.262 of this subpart 
reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.
    (b) If MMS determines that a lessee has improperly determined a 
washing allowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall be 
liable for any additional royalties, plus interest determined in 
accordance with 30 CFR 218.202, or shall be entitled to a credit without 
interest.
    (c) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate washing costs to 
Federal leases.
    (d) No cost normally associated with mining operations and which are 
necessary for placing coal in marketable condition shall be allowed as a 
cost of washing.
    (e) Coal washing costs shall only be recognized as allowances when 
the washed coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.
[54 FR 1523, Jan. 13, 1989, as amended at 61 FR 5480, Feb. 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 206.259  Determination of washing allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For washing costs incurred by a 
lessee under an arm's-length contract, the washing allowance shall be 
the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee for washing the coal 
under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible 
future adjustment. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating 
that its contract is arm's-length. MMS' prior approval is not required 
before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length 
contract. The lessee must claim a washing allowance by reporting it as a 
separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the washer for the 
washing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration 
paid, then the MMS may require that the washing allowance be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length washing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of 
the washing because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, 
or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to 
market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the 
lessor, then MMS shall require that the washing allowance be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS determines 
that the value of the washing may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's washing costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for washing under an arm's-length 
contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent. 
Washing allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal washed.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations 
where the lessee performs washing for itself, the washing allowance will 
be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All washing 
allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation 
are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future 
adjustment. The lessee must claim a washing allowance by reporting it as 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014. When

[[Page 100]]

necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its 
estimated or actual washing allowance.
    (2) The washing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for washing 
during the reported period, including operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) 
(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable investment in 
the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are 
generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of 
delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integral 
part of the wash plant.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes, rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the wash 
plant; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly 
allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can 
document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the wash plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal 
income taxes and severance taxes, including royalities, are not 
allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this 
section. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a wash 
plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative 
without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the wash plant services, whichever is 
appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, 
the lessee may not change methods without MMS approval. A change in 
ownership of a wash plant shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original operator/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a wash 
plant shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated 
below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
capital investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance 
shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to 
plants first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.
    (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3) The washing allowance for coal shall be determined based on the 
lessee's reasonable and actual cost of washing the coal. The lessee may 
not take an allowance for the costs of washing lease production that is 
not royalty bearing.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) The 
lessee must notify MMS of an allowance based on incurred costs by using 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length washing 
contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a 
reasonable time, as determined by MMS.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) The lessee must notify MMS 
of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) For new washing facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial washing deduction shall include estimates of the allowable coal 
washing costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based 
upon the most recently available operations data for the processing 
system or, if such data are not

[[Page 101]]

available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for 
similar washing systems.
    (iii) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a washing 
allowance on the Form MMS-2014, then the lessee shall be assessed an 
amount up to 10 percent of the allowance netted not to exceed $250 per 
lease selling arrangement per sales period.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a washing allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual coal washing allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay additional 
royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.202 from the date 
when the lessee took the deduction to the date the lessee repays the 
difference to MMS. If the actual washing allowance is greater than the 
amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month during the 
allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit 
without interest.
    (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect 
actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Other washing cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine washing costs when establishing value 
using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of washing costs.

Sec. 206.260  Allocation of washed coal.

    (a) When coal is subjected to washing, the washed coal must be 
allocated to the leases from which it was extracted.
    (b) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from 
coal obtained from only one lease, the quantity of washed coal allocable 
to the lease will be based on the net output of the washing plant.
    (c) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from 
coal obtained from more than one lease, unless determined otherwise by 
BLM, the quantity of net output of washed coal allocable to each lease 
will be based on the ratio of measured quantities of coal delivered to 
the washing plant and washed from each lease compared to the total 
measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed.


<R05>
Sec. 206.261  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) For ad valorem leases subject to Sec. 206.257 of this subpart, 
where the value for royalty purposes has been determined at a point 
remote from the lease or mine, MMS shall, as authorized by this section, 
allow a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes for the 
reasonable, actual costs incurred to:
    (1) Transport the coal from a Federal lease to a sales point which 
is remote from both the lease and mine; or
    (2) Transport the coal from a Federal lease to a wash plant when 
that plant is remote from both the lease and mine and, if applicable, 
from the wash plant to a remote sales point. In-mine transportation 
costs shall not be included in the transportation allowance.
    (b) Under no circumstances shall the washing allowance and the 
transportation allowance authorized by Sec. 206.257 of this subpart 
reduce the value of coal under any selling arrangement to zero.
    (c)(1) When coal transported from a mine to a wash plant is eligible 
for a transportation allowance in accordance with this section, the 
lessee is not required to allocate transportation costs between the 
quantity of clean coal output and the rejected waste material. The 
transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total production 
which is transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a 
cost per ton of cleaned coal transported.

[[Page 102]]

    (2) For coal that is not washed at a wash plant, the transportation 
allowance shall be authorized for the total production which is 
transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per 
ton of coal transported.
    (3) Transportation costs shall only be recognized as allowances when 
the transported coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
section, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest, determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest.
    (e) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate transportation 
costs to Federal leases.

<R05>
Sec. 206.262  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For transportation costs incurred by 
a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation 
allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee 
for transporting the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, 
review, audit, and possible future adjustment. The lessee shall have the 
burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The lessee 
must claim a transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration paid, then the MMS may require that the transportation 
allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (3) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable 
value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee 
shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract--(1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations 
where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the 
transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable 
actual costs. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-
length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, 
audit, and possible future adjustment. The lessee must claim a 
transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the 
Form MMS-2014. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its estimated or actual transportation allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable 
investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets 
(including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) 
which are an integral part of the transportation system.

[[Page 103]]

    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including 
royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either 
method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to 
change to the other alternative without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, 
whichever is appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an 
election is made, the lessee may not change methods without MMS 
approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not 
alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/
lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a 
change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only 
once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage 
value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate 
of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(B)(v) of this section. 
No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall 
apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service or 
acquired after March 1, 1989.
    (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3) A lessee may apply to MMS for exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section. MMS will grant the exception only if the lessee 
has a rate for the transportation approved by a Federal agency or by a 
State regulatory agency (for Federal leases). MMS shall deny the 
exception request if it determines that the rate is excessive as 
compared to arm's-length transportation charges by systems, owned by the 
lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in that 
area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, MMS shall 
deny the exception request if:
    (i) No Federal or State regulatory agency costs analysis exists and 
the Federal or State regulatory agency, as applicable, has declined to 
investigate under MMS timely objections upon filing; and
    (ii) The rate significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation as determined under this section.
    (c) Reporting requirements-- (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) The 
lessee must notify MMS of an allowance based on incurred costs by using 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract-- (i) The lessee must notify MMS 
of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line 
entry on Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial deduction shall include estimates of the allowable coal 
transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates

[[Page 104]]

shall be based upon the most recently available operations data for the 
transportation system or, if such data are not available, the lessee 
shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation 
systems.
    (iii) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (iv)  [Reserved]
    (v) If the lessee is authorized to use its Federal- or State-agency-
approved rate as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a transportation 
allowance on Form MMS-2014, the lessee shall be assessed an amount of up 
to 10 percent of the allowance netted not to exceed $250 per lease 
selling arrangement per sales period.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual coal transportation allowance is 
less than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each 
month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay 
additional royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.202 
from the date when the lessee took the deduction to the date the lessee 
repays the difference to MMS. If the actual transportation allowance is 
greater than amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a 
credit without interest.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) Other transportation cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing 
value using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of transportation costs.

Sec. 206.263  Contract submission.

    (a) The lessee and other payors shall submit to MMS, upon request, 
contracts for the sale of coal from ad valorem leases subject to this 
subpart. The MMS must receive the contracts within a reasonable period 
of time, as specified by MMS. Lessees shall include as part of the 
submittal requirements any contracts, agreements, contract amendments, 
or other documents that affect the gross proceeds received for the sale 
of coal, as well as any other information regarding any consideration 
received for the sale or disposition of coal that is not included in 
such contracts. At the time of its contract submittals, MMS may require 
the lessee to certify in writing that it has provided all documents and 
information that reflect the total consideration provided by purchasers 
of coal from ad valorem leases subject to this subpart. Information 
requested under this section may include contracts for both ad valorem 
and cents-per-ton leases and shall be available in the lessee's offices 
during normal business hours or provided to MMS at such time and in such 
manner as may be requested by authorized Department of the Interior 
personnel. Any oral sales arrangement negotiated by the lessee must be 
placed in a written form and be retained by the lessee. Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to limit the authority of MMS to obtain or 
have access to information pursuant to 30 CFR part 212.
    (b) Lessees and other payors shall designate, for each contract 
submitted pursuant to this section, whether the contract in arm's-length 
or non-arm's-length.
    (c) A lessee's or other payor's determination that its contract is 
arm's-length is subject to future audit to verify that the contract 
meets the criteria of the arm's-length contract definition in 
Sec. 206.251 of this subpart.
    (d) Information required to be submitted under this section that 
constitutes trade secrets and commercial and financial information that 
is identified as privileged or confidential shall not be available for 
public inspection or made public or disclosed without the consent of the 
lessee or other payor, except as otherwise provided by law or 
regulation.

Sec. 206.264  In-situ and surface gasification and liquefaction operations.

    In an ad valorem Federal coal lease is developed by in-situ or 
surface gasification or liquefaction technology, the lessee shall 
propose the value of coal for royalty purposes to MMS. The MMS will 
review the lessee's proposal and issue a value determination. The lessee 
may use its proposed value until MMS issues a value determination.

Sec. 206.265  Value enhancement of marketable coal.

    If, prior to use, sale, or other disposition, the lessee enhances 
the value of coal after the coal has been placed in marketable condition 
in accordance with Sec. 206.257(h) of this subpart, the lessee shall 
notify MMS that such processing is occurring or will occur. The value of 
that production shall be determined as follows:
    (a) A value established for the feedstock coal in marketable 
condition by application of the provisions of Sec. 206.257(c)(2)(i-iv) 
of this subpart; or,
    (b) In the event that a value cannot be established in accordance 
with subsection (a), then the value of production will be determined in 
accordance with Sec. 206.257(c)(2)(v) of this subpart and the value 
shall be the lessee's gross proceeds accruing from the disposition of 
the enhanced product, reduced by MMS-approved processing costs and 
procedures including a rate of return on investment equal to two times 
the Standard and Poor's BBB bond rate applicable under 
Sec. 206.259(b)(2)(v) of this subpart.

Sec. 206.301  Value basis for royalty computation.

    (a) The gross value for royalty purposes shall be the sale or 
contract unit price times the number of units sold, Provided, however, 
That where the authorized officer determines:
    (1) That a contract of sale or other business arrangement between 
the lessee and a purchaser of some or all of the commodities produced 
from the lease is not a bona fide transaction between independent 
parties because it is based in whole or in part upon considerations 
other than the value of the commodities, or
    (2) That no bona fide sales price is received for some or all of 
such commodities because the lessee is consuming them, the authorized 
officer shall determine their gross value, taking into account: (i) All 
prices received by the lessee in all bona fide transactions, (ii) Prices 
paid for commodities of like quality produced from the same general 
area, and (iii) Such other relevant factors as the authorized officer 
may deem appropriate; and Provided further, That in a situation where an 
estimated value is used, the authorized officer shall require the 
payment of such additional royalties, or allow such credits or refunds 
as may be necessary to adjust royalty payment to reflect the actual 
gross value.
    (b) The lessee is required to certify that the values reported for 
royalty purposes are bona fide sales not involving considerations other 
than the sale of the mineral, and he may be required by the authorized 
officer to supply supporting information.

<R05>
Sec. 206.350  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all geothermal resources produced 
from Federal geothermal leases issued pursuant to the Geothermal Steam 
Act of 1970, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.). The purpose of this 
subpart is to establish the value of geothermal production for royalty 
purposes.
    (b) All royalty payments made to MMS are subject to audit and 
adjustment.


<R05>
Sec. 206.351  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart:
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with

[[Page 106]]

opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes of 
this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with, another person. For 
purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the 
voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership:
    (1) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;
    (2) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a rebuttable 
presumption of control; and
    (3) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of 
noncontrol which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal 
control, including the existence of interlocking directorates.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between 
relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length 
contracts. The MMS may require the lessee to certify the claimed nature 
of ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for any production 
month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for the 
production month as well as when the contract was executed.
    Audit means a procedure having the same meaning and effect as that 
described at 30 CFR part 217 for verifying royalty payment compliance 
activities of lessees or other authorized persons who pay royalties, 
rents, or bonuses on Federal geothermal leases.
    Byproduct means:
    (1) Any mineral or minerals (exclusive of oil, hydrocarbon gas, and 
helium) which are found in solution or developed in association with 
geothermal fluids and which have a value of less than 75 per centum of 
the value of the geothermal energy or are not, because of quantity, 
quality, or technical difficulties in extraction and production, of 
sufficient value to warrant extraction and production by themselves, and
    (2) Commercially demineralized water.
    Byproduct recovery facility means the facility or facilities at 
which byproducts are placed in marketable condition.
    Byproduct transportation allowance means an approved allowance for 
the lessee's reasonable, actual costs, excluding gathering, incurred for 
moving byproducts, including commercially demineralized water, to a 
point of sale or point of delivery off the lease, unit area, or 
communitized area.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Deduction means a subtraction used in the geothermal netback 
procedure for determining the value of geothermal resources utilized by 
the lessee to generate electricity. Transmission deduction means a 
deduction for the lessee's reasonable actual costs incurred to wheel or 
transmit the electricity from the lessee's powerplant to the purchaser's 
delivery point. Generating deduction means a deduction for the lessee's 
reasonable, actual costs of generating plant tailgate electricity.
    Delivered electricity means the amount of electricity in 
kilowatthours delivered to the purchaser.
    Direct utilization means any process other than electrical 
generation in which the thermal energy of the geothermal resource is 
utilized, including, but not limited to, space heating, greenhouse 
operations, and industrial or agricultural process heat.
    Field means the land surface vertically projected over a subsurface 
geothermal reservoir encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all geothermal accumulations known to be within that reservoir. 
Geothermal fields are usually given names and their official boundaries 
are often designated by regulatory agencies in the respective States in 
which the fields are located.
    Gathering means the efficient movement of lease production from the 
wellhead to the point of utilization.
    Geothermal netback procedure means the method of determining the 
value of geothermal resources that are utilized in a lessee-owned 
powerplant for the generation and sale of electricity by deducting the 
lessee's reasonable, actual transmission and generating costs from the 
sales price or value of the electricity to derive the value of the

[[Page 107]]

geothermal resource at the powerplant inlet.
    Geothermal resources means:
    (1) All products of geothermal processes, including indigenous 
steam, hot water, and hot brines;
    (2) Steam and other gases, hot water, and hot brines resulting from 
water, gas, or other fluids artificially introduced into geothermal 
formations;
    (3) Heat or other associated energy found in geothermal formations; 
and
    (4) Any byproducts.
    Geothermal utilization facility means a powerplant or direct 
utilization facility that utilizes the heat or other energy of the 
geothermal resource.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty purposes) means the total monies and 
other consideration accruing to a geothermal lessee for any disposition 
of geothermal resources, including total payments for the sale of 
electricity generated by the lessee from lease-produced geothermal 
resources. Gross proceeds includes, but is not limited to, payments to 
the lessee for certain services such as effluent injection, field 
operation and maintenance, drilling or workover of wells, and/or field 
gathering to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at 
no cost to the Federal Government. Gross proceeds also includes, but is 
not limited to, reimbursements for production taxes and other taxes. Tax 
reimbursements are part of gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even 
though the Federal royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Monies 
and other consideration, including the forms of consideration identified 
in this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally 
entitled but which it does not seek to collect through reasonable 
efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Lease means a geothermal lease issued under authority of the 
Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), 
unless the context indicates otherwise.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a 
geothermal lease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to 
make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This includes any 
person who has an interest in a geothermal lease as well as an operator 
or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the 
royalty payment responsibility. This also includes any affiliate of the 
lessee that utilizes the geothermal resource to generate electricity, in 
a direct utilization process, or to recover byproducts, or any affiliate 
that transports lease production.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products that have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
    Marketable condition means lease products that are sufficiently free 
from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be accepted 
by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field.
    Minimum royalty means the minimum amount of annual royalty as 
specified in the lease or in applicable leasing regulations that the 
lessee must pay after commencement of geothermal production in 
commercial quantities.
    No sales means the utilization or disposal of geothermal resources 
without the benefit of a sale.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Plant tailgate electricity means the amount of electricity in 
kilowatthours generated by the powerplant exclusive of plant parasitic 
electricity, but inclusive of any electricity generated by the 
powerplant and returned to the lease for lease operations. Plant 
tailgate electricity should be measured at, or calculated for, the high 
voltage side of the transformer in the plant switchyard.
    Point of utilization means the powerplant or direct utilization 
facility in which the geothermal resource (steam or hot water) is 
utilized.
    Reasonable alternative fuel means a conventional fuel (such as coal, 
oil, gas, or wood) that would normally be used as a source of heat in 
direct utilization operations.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the Department of the Interior or 
any person duly authorized to exercise the powers vested in that office.
    Selling arrangement means the individually contracted arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of

[[Page 108]]

geothermal resources are made, including sales or dispositions of 
byproducts and electricity sales where the lessee generates electricity 
from lease geothermal production.
    Spot market price means the price received under any sales 
transaction when planned or actual deliveries span a short period of 
time, usually not exceeding 1 year.
    Wheeling means the transmission of electricity from a powerplant to 
the point of delivery.

Sec. 206.352  Valuation standards for electrical generation.

    (a) The value of geothermal resources produced from leases subject 
to this subpart and used to generate electricity shall be determined 
pursuant to this section.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of geothermal resources that are sold pursuant 
to an arm's-length contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either 
directly or indirectly, from the buyer to the seller for the geothermal 
resource. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, MMS 
may require that the geothermal resource sold pursuant to that contract 
be valued in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Value shall 
not be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including 
any additional consideration received.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between 
the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached 
its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit 
of the lessee and the lessor, MMS shall require the geothermal resource 
to be valued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, and notification 
provided to MMS in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If 
MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's value.
    (2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that the provisions in 
its arm's-length contract include all of the consideration to be paid by 
the buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the geothermal resource.
    (c)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section 
that are sold under a non-arm's-length contract shall be determined in 
accordance with the first applicable of the following paragraphs:
    (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract provided that those gross proceeds 
are not less than the gross proceeds derived from or paid under the 
lowest-priced available comparable arm's-length contract for sales of 
geothermal resources to the lessee-affiliate's same powerplant (the 
``minimum value''). If the gross proceeds under the lessee's non-arm's-
length contract are less than the ``minimum value'' under available 
comparable arm's-length contracts, or if there are no available 
comparable arm's-length contracts, value will be determined by the 
weighted average of the gross proceeds established under arm's-length 
contracts for the sale of significant quantities of geothermal resources 
to the same powerplant. Available contracts will mean contracts in the 
possession of the lessee, the lessee's affiliate, or MMS. In evaluating 
the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these 
regulations, the following factors shall be considered: Time of 
execution, duration, terms, quality of the geothermal resource, volume, 
dedication to the same powerplant, and other factors that may be 
appropriate to reflect the value of the resource;
    (ii) The value determined by the geothermal netback procedure. Under 
the geothermal netback procedure, the lessee's reasonable actual costs 
for the

[[Page 109]]

generation and transmission of electricity shall be deducted from the 
lessee's gross proceeds received for the sale of electricity to 
determine the value of the geothermal resource. Transmission deductions 
shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 206.353 of this part. Generating 
deductions shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 206.354 of this part; or
    (iii) A value determined by any other reasonable valuation method 
approved by MMS.
    (2) Value determinations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject 
to the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section 
that are not subject to a sales transaction (``no sales'' geothermal 
resources) but are instead utilized directly by the lessee in its own 
powerplant for the generation and sale of electricity shall be 
determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following 
paragraphs:
    (i) The weighted average of the gross proceeds established in arm's-
length contracts for the purchase of significant quantities of 
geothermal resources to operate the lessee's same powerplant. In 
evaluating the acceptability of arm's-length contracts, the following 
factors shall be considered: Time of execution, duration, terms, volume, 
quality of resource, and such other factors as may be appropriate to 
reflect the value of the resource;
    (ii) The value determined by the geothermal netback procedure. Under 
the geothermal netback procedure, the lessee's reasonable actual costs 
for the generation and transmission of electricity shall be deducted 
from the lessee's gross proceeds received for the sale of electricity to 
determine the value of the geothermal resource. Transmission deductions 
shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 206.353 of this part. Generating 
deductions shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 206.354 of this part; or
    (iii) A value determined by any other reasonable valuation method 
approved by MMS.
    (2) Value determinations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject 
to the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e)(1) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee shall 
retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value, 
particularly where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) or 
(d) of this section. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and 
MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that 
the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Upon request, lessees shall make available to authorized MMS 
representatives or to other authorized persons any and all contracts for 
the sale or other disposition of the lease production; contracts for the 
sale, generation, and/or transmission of electricity attributable to 
lease production; and any arm's-length sales and other data for like-
quality production sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee 
from the field as may be necessary to support a value determination.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to the MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/her 
designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and 
contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The 
notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due 
no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized 
by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.302. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that method in determining value,

[[Page 110]]

for royalty purposes, until MMS issues its decision. The lessee shall 
submit all available data relevant to its proposal. The MMS shall 
expeditiously determine the value based upon the lessee's proposal and 
any additional information MMS deems necessary. In making a value 
determination, MMS may use any of the valuation criteria consistent with 
this subpart. That determination shall remain effective for the period 
stated therein. After MMS issues its determination, the lessee shall 
make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee where geothermal 
resources are directly sold.
    (i) The lessee is required to place geothermal resources in 
marketable condition and to deliver geothermal resources to the 
powerplant at no cost to the Federal lessor. Where the value established 
pursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, 
that value shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have 
been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing 
certain services the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of 
the lessee to place the geothermal resource in marketable condition or 
deliver it to the powerplant.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to the contract. If the lessee makes timely application for a 
price increase or benefit allowed under its contract but the purchaser 
refuses and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, 
to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional 
royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting from the 
price increase or additional benefits are received. This paragraph shall 
not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment 
obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in 
part or timely, for a quantity of geothermal resources.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Federal Government 
or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support value 
determinations is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this 
subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulations of the Department, 43 CFR part 2.

Sec. 206.353  Determination of transmission deductions.

    (a) Where the value of geothermal energy is determined by the 
geothermal netback procedure pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(d)(1)(ii) of Sec. 206.352 of this subpart, a transmission deduction 
shall be subtracted from the lessee's gross proceeds received for the 
sale of electricity to determine the plant tailgate value of the 
electricity. The transmission deduction consists of either or both of 
two components:
    (1) Transmission line costs as determined pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section, and
    (2) Wheeling costs if the electricity is transmitted across a third-
party's transmission line under an arm's-length wheeling agreement. 
Transmission deductions are subject to the limitation prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b)(1) Transmission-line costs shall be based on the lessee's actual 
costs associated with the construction and operation of a transmission 
line for the

[[Page 111]]

purpose of transmitting electricity attributable and allocable to the 
lessee's powerplant utilizing Federal geothermal resources. The monthly 
transmission line cost component of the transmission deduction is 
determined by multiplying the annual transmission line cost rate (in 
dollars per kilowatthour) by the amount of electricity delivered for the 
reporting month. The transmission line cost rate shall be redetermined 
annually at the beginning of the same month of the year in which the 
transmission line was placed into service, the same month of the year in 
which the powerplant was placed into service, or, at the lessee's 
option, at a time concurrent with the beginning of the lessee's annual 
corporate accounting period; Provided, however, the period selected must 
coincide with the same period chosen for the generating deduction 
pursuant to Sec. 206.354(b)(1). After a deduction period is chosen, the 
lessee may not later elect to use a different deduction period without 
MMS approval.
    (2) Allowable transmission-line costs include operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the capital investment 
in the transmission line multiplied by a rate of return in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs 
are generally those costs for depreciable assets, including costs of 
delivery and installation of capital equipment, that are an integral 
part of the transmission line. A return on capital invested in the 
purchase of real estate for transmission facilities may be allowed 
provided that the lessee demonstrates the necessity for such purchase, 
the purchased land is not on a Federal geothermal lease, and MMS 
approves the deduction; the rate of return shall be the same rate 
determined in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and 
engineering, operations labor, materials, ad valorem property taxes, 
rent, supplies, and any other directly allocable and attributable 
operating expenses that the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the 
transmission line, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transmission line is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including 
royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee 
may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital 
investment, or a return on capital investment. After a lessee has 
elected to use either method, the lessee may not later elect to change 
to the other alternative without MMS approval.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee must use a straight-line 
depreciation method based on the expected life of the geothermal 
project, usually the term of the electricity sales contract or other 
depreciation period acceptable to MMS. A change in ownership of a 
transmission line shall not alter the depreciation schedule established 
by the original lessee-owner for purposes of computing transmission line 
costs. With or without a change in ownership, a transmission line shall 
be depreciated only once. The rate of return used to compute the return 
on undepreciated capital investment shall be determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost 
shall be the amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the 
transmission line multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided 
for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to transmission 
lines first placed into service on or after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return shall be 2 times Standard and Poor's 
industrial BBB bond rate. The rate of return shall be 2 times the 
monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond

[[Page 112]]

Guide for the first month of the annual deduction period and shall be 
effective during the following deduction period. The rate shall be 
redetermined annually at the beginning of the same month beginning the 
annual deduction period chosen pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) Transmission-line cost rates, determined annually, are computed 
by dividing the sum of the operating, maintenance, overhead, and capital 
costs by the annual amount of delivered electricity.
    (4) For new transmission lines, the lessee's costs for the first 
deduction period shall be based on estimated expenses (including 
overhead) for operating and maintaining the transmission line. For 
subsequent deduction periods, the transmission line costs shall be 
estimated based on the lessee's actual operating and maintenance 
expenses for the previous period adjusted for decreases or increases 
that the lessee knows will affect the deduction in the current period.
    (c) Under no circumstances shall the transmission deduction plus the 
generating deduction determined pursuant to Sec. 206.354 of this subpart 
reduce the royalty value of the geothermal resource to zero.
    (d)(1) If the actual transmission deduction determined at the end of 
the annual reporting period is less than the amount the lessee estimated 
and used in the netback procedure during the reporting period, the 
lessee shall be required to pay additional royalties retroactive to the 
first month of the reporting period, plus interest computed pursuant to 
30 CFR 218.302. If the actual transmission deduction is greater than the 
amount applied in the netback calculation, the lessee shall be entitled 
to a credit.
    (2) Lessees must submit corrected Forms MMS-2014 to reflect 
adjustments to royalty payments in accordance with MMS instructions.
    (e)(1) All transmission deductions are subject to review, audit, and 
adjustment. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its estimated or actual transmission deduction and adjust royalty 
values accordingly.
    (2) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee must 
maintain all data and records supporting its transmission deduction, 
including wheeling and other transmission-related agreements. These data 
and records must be made available to MMS and other authorized personnel 
upon request, and shall be maintained in a confidential manner in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations pursuant to Sec. 206.352 
of this subpart.
    (f) A one-time refund of royalties equal to the royalty amount of 
actual dismantlement costs attributable to the transmission line that 
are in excess of actual income attributable to the salvage of the 
transmission line will be allowed at the completion of the dismantlement 
and salvage operations.


<R05>
Sec. 206.354  Determination of generating deductions.

    (a) Where the value of geothermal energy is determined by the 
geothermal netback procedure pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(d)(1)(ii) of Sec. 206.352 of this subpart, that value shall be 
determined by deducting the lessee's reasonable actual costs incurred to 
generate electricity from the plant tailgate value of the electricity 
(usually the transmission-reduced value of the delivered electricity). 
Generating deductions are subject to the limitation prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b)(1) Generating costs shall be based on the lessee's actual annual 
costs associated with the construction and operation of a geothermal 
powerplant. The monthly generating deduction is determined by 
multiplying the annual generating cost rate (in dollars per 
kilowatthour) by the amount of plant tailgate electricity measured (or 
computed) for the reporting month. The generating cost rate is 
determined from the annual amount of plant tailgate electricity and must 
be redetermined annually at the beginning of the same month of the year 
in which the powerplant was placed into service or, at the lessee's 
option, at a time concurrent with the beginning of the lessee's annual 
corporate accounting period; Provided, however, the period selected must 
coincide with the same period chosen for the transmission deduction

[[Page 113]]

pursuant to Sec. 206.353(b)(1). After a deduction period is chosen, the 
lessee may not later elect to use a different deduction period without 
MMS approval.
    (2) Allowable generating costs include operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the capital investment 
in the powerplant multiplied by a rate of return in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are 
generally those costs for depreciable assets, including costs of 
delivery and installation of capital equipment, that are an integral 
part of the powerplant or are required by the design specifications of 
the power conversion cycle. A return on capital invested in the purchase 
of real estate for a powerplant site may be allowed provided that the 
lessee demonstrates the necessity for such purchase, the purchased land 
is not on a Federal geothermal lease, and MMS approves the deduction; 
the rate of return shall be the same rate determined in paragraph 
(b)(2)(v) of this section. The costs of gathering systems and other 
production-related facilities are not allowed.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and 
engineering, operations labor, materials, ad valorem property taxes, 
rent, supplies, auxiliary fuel and/or utilities used to operate the 
powerplant during down time, and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense that the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the 
powerplant, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and other 
directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the lessee 
can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the powerplant is an allowable expense. State and 
Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are not 
allowable expenses.
    (iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee 
may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital 
investment, or a return on capital investment. After a lessee has 
elected to use either method, the lessee may not later elect to change 
to the other alternative without MMS approval.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee must use a straight-line 
depreciation method based on the life of the geothermal project, usually 
the term of the electricity sales contract or other depreciation period 
acceptable to MMS. A change in ownership of a powerplant shall not alter 
the depreciation schedule established by the original lessee-owner for 
computing the generating costs. With or without a change in ownership, a 
powerplant shall be depreciated only once. The rate of return used to 
compute the return on undepreciated capital investment shall be 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost 
shall be the amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the 
powerplant multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for 
depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to powerplants first 
placed into service on or after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return shall be 2 times Standard and Poor's 
industrial BBB bond rate. The rate of return shall be 2 times the 
monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for 
the first month of the annual deduction period and shall be effective 
during the following deduction period. The rate shall be redetermined 
annually at the beginning of the same month beginning the annual 
deduction period chosen pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) Generating cost rates, determined annually, shall be computed by 
dividing the sum of the operating, maintenance, overhead, and capital 
costs by the annual amount of plant tailgate electricity.
    (4) For new powerplants, the lessee's generating costs for the first 
deduction period shall be based on estimated expenses (including 
overhead) for operating and maintaining the powerplant. For subsequent 
deduction periods, the

[[Page 114]]

generating costs shall be estimated based on the lessee's actual 
operating and maintenance expenses for the previous period adjusted for 
decreases or increases that the lessee knows will affect the deduction 
in the current period.
    (c) Under no circumstances shall the generating deduction plus the 
transmission deduction determined pursuant to Sec. 206.353 of this 
subpart reduce the royalty value of the geothermal resource to zero.
    (d)(1) If the actual generating deduction determined at the end of 
the annual reporting period is less than the amount the lessee estimated 
and used in the netback procedure during the reporting period, the 
lessee shall be required to pay additional royalties retroactive to the 
first month of the reporting period, plus interest computed pursuant to 
30 CFR 218.302. If the actual generating deduction is greater than the 
amount applied in the netback calculation, the lessee shall be entitled 
to a credit.
    (2) Lessees must submit corrected Forms MMS-2014 to reflect 
adjustments to royalty payments in accordance with MMS instructions.
    (e)(1) All generating deductions are subject to review, audit, and 
adjustment. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its estimated or actual generating deduction and adjust royalty 
values accordingly.
    (2) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee must 
maintain all data and records supporting its generating deduction. These 
data and records must be made available to MMS and other authorized 
personnel upon request, and shall be maintained in a confidential manner 
in accordance with applicable laws and regulations pursuant to 
Sec. 206.352 of this subpart.
    (f) A one-time refund of royalties equal to the royalty amount of 
actual dismantlement costs attributable to the powerplant that are in 
excess of actual income attributable to the salvage of the powerplant 
will be allowed at the completion of the dismantlement and salvage 
operations.


<R05>
Sec. 206.355  Valuation standards for direct utilization.

    (a) The value of geothermal resources produced for leases subject to 
this subpart and used in direct utilization processes shall be 
determined pursuant to this section.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of geothermal resources that are sold pursuant 
to an arm's-length contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (ii) In conducting these reviews and audits, MMS will examine 
whether or not the contract reflects the total consideration actually 
transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller 
for the geothermal resource. If the contract does not reflect the total 
consideration, MMS may require that the geothermal resource sold 
pursuant to that contract be valued in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section. Value shall not be less than the gross proceeds accruing 
to the lessee, including any additional consideration received.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the geothermal resource because of misconduct by or 
between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has 
breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual 
benefit of the lessee and the lessor, MMS shall require the geothermal 
resource to be valued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section and in 
accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this 
section. When MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS 
will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's value.
    (2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the geothermal resource.

[[Page 115]]

    (c)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section 
that are sold under a non-arm's-length contract shall be determined in 
accordance with the first applicable of the following paragraphs:
    (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract provided that those gross proceeds 
are not less than the gross proceeds derived from or paid under the 
lowest-priced available comparable arm's-length contract for sales of 
geothermal resources to the lessee-affiliate's same direct utilization 
facility (the ``minimun value''). If the gross proceeds under the 
lessee's non-arm's-length contract are less than the ``minimum value'' 
under available comparable arm's-length contracts, or if there are no 
available comparable arm's-length contracts, value will be determined by 
the weighted average of the gross proceeds established under arm's-
length contracts for the sale of significant quantities of geothermal 
resources to the same direct utilization facility. Available contracts 
will mean contracts in the possession of the lessee, the lessee's 
affiliate, or MMS. In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length 
contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the following factors 
shall be considered: Time of execution, duration, terms, quality of the 
geothermal resource, volume, dedication to the same direct utilization 
facility, and other factors that may be appropriate to reflect the value 
of the resource;
    (ii) The equivalent value of the least expensive, reasonable 
alternative energy source (fuel). The equivalent value of the least 
expensive, reasonable alternative energy source shall be based on the 
amount of thermal energy that would otherwise be used by the direct 
utilization process in place of the geothermal resource. That amount of 
thermal energy (in Btu's) displaced by the geothermal resource shall be 
determined by the equation

thermal energy displaced =
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.017


where h<INF>in</INF> is the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the utilization 
facility inlet (based on measured inlet temperature), h<INF>out</INF> is 
the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the facility outlet (based on measured 
outlet temperature), density is in lbs/cu ft based on inlet temperature, 
the factor 0.133681 (cu ft/gal) converts gallons to cubic feet, and 
volume is the quantity of geothermal fluid in gallons produced at the 
wellhead or measured at an approved point. The efficiency of the 
alternative energy source shall be 0.7 for coal and 0.8 for oil, natural 
gas, and other fuels derived from oil and natural gas, or an efficiency 
factor proposed by the lessee and approved by MMS. The methods of 
measuring resource parameters (temperature, volume, etc.) and the 
frequency of computing and accumulating the amount of thermal energy 
displaced shall be determined and approved by BLM; or
    (iii) A value determined by any other reasonable valuation method 
approved by MMS.
    (2) Valuations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject to the 
notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section 
that are not subject to a sales transaction but are instead used by the 
lessee in its own direct utilization facility (``no sales'' geothermal 
resources) shall be determined in accordance with the first applicable 
of the following paragraphs:
    (i) The weighted average of the gross proceeds established in arm's-
length contracts for the purchase of significant quantities of 
geothermal resources to operate the lessee's same direct utilization 
facility. In evaluating the acceptability of arm's-length contracts, the 
following factors shall be considered: Time of execution, duration, 
terms, volume, quality of resource, and such other factors as may be 
appropriate to reflect the value of the resource;
    (ii) The equivalent value of the least expensive, reasonable 
alternative energy source (fuel). The equivalent value of the least 
expensive, reasonable alternative energy source shall be based on the 
amount of thermal energy that would otherwise be used by the direct 
utilization process in place of the

[[Page 116]]

geothermal resource. That amount of thermal energy (in Btu's) displaced 
by the geothermal resource shall be determined by the equation

where h<INF>in</INF> is the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the utilization 
facility inlet (based on measured inlet temperature), h<INF>out</INF> is 
the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the facility outlet (based on measured 
outlet temperature), density is in lbs/cu ft based on inlet temperature, 
the factor 0.133681 (cu ft/gal) converts gallons to cubic feet, and 
volume is the quantity of geothermal fluid in gallons produced at the 
wellhead or measured at an approved point. The efficiency of the 
alternative energy source shall be 0.7 for coal and 0.8 for oil, natural 
gas, and other fuels derived from oil and natural gas, or an efficiency 
factor proposed by the lessee and approved by MMS. The methods of 
measuring resource parameters (temperature, volume, etc.) and the 
frequency of computing and accumulating the amount of thermal energy 
displaced shall be determined and approved by BLM; or
    (iii) A value determined by any other reasonable valuation method 
approved by MMS.
    (2) Valuations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject to the 
notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e)(1) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee shall 
retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value, 
particularly where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) or 
(d) of this section. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and 
MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that 
the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Upon request, lessees shall make available to authorized MMS 
representatives or to other authorized persons any and all contracts for 
the sale or other disposition of the lease production, and any arm's-
length sales and other data for like-quality production sold, purchased, 
or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the field as may be necessary 
to support a value determination.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to the MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/her 
designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and 
contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The 
notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due 
no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized 
by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.302. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that method in determining value, for royalty purposes, until 
MMS issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data 
relevant to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the 
value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information 
MMS deems necessary. In making a value determination, MMS may use any of 
the valuation criteria consistent with this subpart. That determination 
shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues 
its determination, the lessee shall make adjustments in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production, for royalty purposes, be 
less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee where geothermal 
energy is directly sold.

[[Page 117]]

    (i) The lessee is required to place geothermal resources in 
marketable condition and to deliver geothermal resources to the direct 
utilization facility at no cost to the Federal lessor. Where the value 
established pursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross 
proceeds, that value shall be increased to the extent that the gross 
proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, 
is providing certain services the cost of which ordinarily is the 
responsibility of the lessee to place the geothermal resource in 
marketable condition or to deliver it to the direct utilization 
facility.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to the contract. If the lessee makes timely application for a 
price increase or benefit allowed under its contract but the purchaser 
refuses and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, 
to force purchaser compliance, the lessee shall owe no additional 
royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting from the 
price increase or additional benefits are received. This paragraph shall 
not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment 
obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in 
part or timely, for a quantity of geothermal resources.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding against the Federal Government or 
its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support value 
determinations is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this 
subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulation of the Department, 43 CFR part 2.

<R05>
Sec. 206.356  Valuation standards for byproducts.

    (a) The value of geothermal byproducts, including commercially 
demineralized water, shall be determined pursuant to this section, less 
applicable byproducts transportation allowances determined pursuant to 
Secs. 206.357 and 206.358 of this subpart.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of byproducts that are sold pursuant to an 
arm's-length contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either 
directly or indirectly, from the buyer to the seller for the byproducts. 
If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, MMS may 
require that the byproducts sold pursuant to that contract be valued in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including any additional 
consideration received .
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between 
the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached 
its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit 
of the lessee and the lessor, MMS

[[Page 118]]

shall require that the byproduct production be valued pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section and in accordance with the notification 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. If MMS determines that 
the value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give the 
lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's reported byproduct value.
    (2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that the provisions in 
its arm's-length contract include all of the consideration to be paid by 
the buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the byproduct.
    (c) The value of byproducts that are sold pursuant to a non-arm's-
length contract or that are utilized by the lessee (no sales), except 
demineralized water used for the benefit of the lease pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 202.351 of this subpart, shall be determined in 
accordance with the first applicable of the following paragraphs:
    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non arm's-length contract (or other disposition by other than 
an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are not 
less than the gross proceeds derived from or paid under the lowest-
priced available comparable arm's-length contract for sales, purchases, 
or other dispositions of like-quality byproducts in the field or, if 
necessary to obtain a representative sample, from the same area (the 
``minimum value''). If the gross proceeds under the lessee's non-arm's-
length contract are less than the ``minimum value'' under available 
comparable arms length contracts, or if there are no available 
comparable arm's-length contracts, value will be determined by the 
weighted average of the gross proceeds established under arm's-length 
contracts for the sale of like-quality products in the field or, if 
necessary to obtain a representative sample, from the same area. 
Available contracts will mean contracts in the possession of the lessee, 
the lessee's affiliate, or MMS. In evaluating the comparability of 
arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the 
following factors shall be considered: Field or area, price, time of 
execution, duration, terms, quality of the byproduct, volume, market or 
markets served, and other factors that may be appropriate to reflect the 
value of the byproduct;
    (2) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published 
or publicly available spot-market prices, or information submitted by 
the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease 
operation or the saleability of certain byproducts; or
    (3) A netback method or any other reasonable method used to 
determine value.
    (d)(1) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee shall 
retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value, 
particularly where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMS 
will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the 
reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Upon request, lessees shall make available to authorized MMS 
representatives or to other authorized persons any and all contracts 
and/or invoices for the sale or other disposition of the byproducts, and 
any arm's-length sales and other data for like-quality production sold, 
purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the field or other 
area as may be necessary to support a value determination.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section. The notification shall be by letter to 
the MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/her designee. 
The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and contain a 
brief description of the procedure to be followed. The notification 
required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due no later than 
the end of the month following the month the lessee first reports 
royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized by 
paragraph (c) of this section, and each time there is a change in a 
method under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based

[[Page 119]]

upon the value it has used and the royalty payments that are due based 
upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall also pay interest on 
that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.302. If the lessee is 
entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for the taking of 
that credit.
    (f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that method in determining value, for royalty purposes, until 
MMS issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data 
relevant to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the 
value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information 
MMS deems necessary. In making a value determination, MMS may use any of 
the valuation criteria consistent with this subpart. That determination 
shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues 
its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance 
with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of byproducts for royalty purposes be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, less applicable 
byproduct transportation allowances determined pursuant to Secs. 206.357 
and 206.358 of this subpart.
    (h) The lessee is required to place the byproducts in marketable 
condition at no cost to the Federal Government. Where the value 
established pursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross 
proceeds, that value shall be increased to the extent that the gross 
proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, 
is providing certain services the cost of which ordinarily is the 
responsibility of the lessee to place the byproducts in marketable 
condition.
    (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to the contract, and may be retroactively applied to value 
byproducts, for royalty purposes, for a period not to exceed 2 years, 
unless MMS approves a longer period. If the lessee makes timely 
application for a price increase allowed under its contract but the 
purchaser refuses and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are 
documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no 
additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting 
from the price increase are received. This paragraph shall not be 
construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligation in 
situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or 
timely, for a quantity of byproducts.
    (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding against the Federal Government or 
its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including byproduct transportation allowances pursuant to 
Secs. 206.357 and 206.358 of this subpart, is exempted from disclosure 
by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Any data specified by 
the act to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt shall be 
maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations. All requests for information about determinations made 
under this subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulation of the Department, 43 CFR part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 206.357  Byproduct transportation allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of byproducts has been determined at a point off 
the geothermal lease, unit, or participating area, MMS shall allow a 
deduction in determining value, for royalty purposes, for the lessee's 
reasonable, actual costs incurred to:
    (1) Transport the byproducts from a Federal lease, unit, or 
participating

[[Page 120]]

area to a sales point or point of delivery that is off the lease, unit, 
or participating area; or
    (2) Transport the byproducts from a Federal lease, unit, or 
participating area, or from a geothermal utilization facility to a 
byproduct recovery facility when that byproduct recovery facility is off 
the lease, unit, or participating area and, if applicable, from the 
recovery facility to a sales point or point of delivery off the lease, 
unit, or participating area. Costs for transporting geothermal fluids 
from the lease to the geothermal utilization facility, whether on or off 
the lease, shall not be included in the transportation allowance.
    (b) Under no circumstances shall the byproduct transportation 
allowance authorized by paragraph (a) of this section reduce the value 
of the byproducts under any selling arrangement to zero.
    (c)(1) When byproducts are transported from a lease, unit, 
participating area, or geothermal utilization facility to a byproduct 
recovery facility, the lessee is not required to allocate transportation 
costs between the quantity of marketable byproducts and the rejected 
waste material. The byproduct transportation allowance shall be 
authorized for the total production that is transported. Byproduct 
transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per unit of 
marketable byproducts transported.
    (2) For byproducts that are extracted on the lease, unit, or 
participating area, or at the geothermal utilization facility, the 
byproduct transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total 
production that is transported to a point of sale off the lease, unit, 
or participating area. Byproduct transportation allowances shall be 
expressed as a cost per unit of byproduct transported.
    (3) Transportation costs shall be authorized as allowances only when 
the transported byproduct is sold, delivered, or otherwise utilized by 
the lessee and royalties are reported and paid.
    (d) Byproduct transportation allowances are subject to monitoring, 
review, and audit. If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that 
a lessee has improperly determined a byproduct transportation allowance 
authorized by this section, then the lessee shall pay any additional 
royalties plus interest determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.302, or 
shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (e) If byproducts produced from Federal and non-Federal leases are 
commingled for transportation, lessees shall not disproportionately 
allocate transportation costs to Federal lease production.
    (f) Upon request, the lessee shall make available to authorized MMS 
representatives or to other authorized persons all transportation 
contracts and all other information as may be necessary to support a 
byproduct transportation allowance.
    (g) Byproduct transportation allowances are to be reported as 
separate lines on Form MMS-2014.


<R05>
Sec. 206.358  Determination of byproduct transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For transportation costs incurred by 
a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation 
allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee 
for transporting the byproducts under that contract, subject to 
monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustments. The MMS's 
prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred 
under an arm's-length transportation contract.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration paid, MMS may require that the byproduct transportation 
allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (3) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length byproduct transportation contract does not reflect the 
reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or 
between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has 
breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual 
benefit of the lessee and the

[[Page 121]]

lessor, MMS shall require that the byproduct transportation allowance be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, MMS 
will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not established on a dollars-per-unit basis, the 
lessee shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, 
the byproduct transportation allowance shall be based upon the lessee's 
reasonable actual costs. All byproduct transportation allowances 
deducted under a non-arm's-length or no-contract situation are subject 
to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior MMS 
approval of byproduct transportation allowances is not required for non-
arm's-length or no-contract situations.
    (2) The byproduct transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or 
no-contract situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the capital investment 
in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable assets, including 
costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment, that are an 
integral part of the transportation system. A return on capital invested 
in the purchase of real estate to locate the byproduct transportation 
facilities may be allowed provided that the lessee demonstrates the 
necessity for such purchase, the purchased land is not on a Federal 
geothermal lease, and MMS approves the deduction; the rate of return 
shall be the same rate determined in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this 
section.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and 
engineering, operations labor, fuel, utilities, materials, ad valorem 
property taxes, rent, supplies, and any other allocable and attributable 
operating expenses that the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the 
transportation system, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including 
royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee 
may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
After a lessee has elected to use either method for a transportation 
system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other 
alternative without MMS approval.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee must use a straight-line 
depreciation method based on, as appropriate, either the life of 
equipment or the life of the geothermal project that the transportation 
system services. After an election is made, the lessee may not change 
methods. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not 
alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/
lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a 
change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only 
once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage 
value. The rate of return used to compute the return on undepreciated 
capital investment shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) 
of this section.
    (B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost 
shall be

[[Page 122]]

the amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the 
transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be 
provided for depreciation.
    (v) The rate of return shall be Standard and Poor's industrial BBB 
bond rate. The rate of return shall be the monthly average rate as 
published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month of the 
annual reporting period for which the allowance is applicable and shall 
be effective during the reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined 
at the beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting 
period.

                         Subpart J--Indian Coal

    Source: 61 FR 5481, Feb. 12, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 206.450  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the procedures to establish the value, 
for royalty purposes, of all coal from Indian Tribal and allotted leases 
(except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma).
    (b) If the specific provisions of any statute, treaty, or settlement 
agreement between the Indian lessor and a lessee resulting from 
administrative or judicial litigation, or any coal lease subject to the 
requirements of this subpart, are inconsistent with any regulation in 
this subpart, then the statute, treaty, lease provision, or settlement 
shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) All royalty payments are subject to later audit and adjustment.
    (d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the 
trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the 
administration of Indian coal leases are discharged in accordance with 
the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, and 
lease terms.


<R05>
Sec. 206.451  Definitions.

    Ad valorem lease means a lease where the royalty due to the lessor 
is based upon a percentage of the amount or value of the coal.
    Allowance means an approved, or an MMS-initially accepted deduction 
in determining value for royalty purposes. Coal washing allowance means 
an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for 
coal washing, or an approved or MMS-initially accepted deduction for the 
costs of washing coal, determined pursuant to this subpart. 
Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual 
costs incurred by the lessee for moving coal to a point of sale or point 
of delivery remote from both the lease and mine or wash plant, or an 
approved MMS-initially accepted deduction for costs of such 
transportation, determined pursuant to this subpart.
    Area means a geographic region in which coal has similar quality and 
economic characteristics. Area boundaries are not officially designated 
and the areas are not necessarily named.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes 
of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For 
purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the 
voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership: 
ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control; ownership of 10 
through 50 percent creates a presumption of control; and ownership of 
less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which MMS may 
rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the 
existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood 
or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. MMS may require the 
lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for 
any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this 
definition for that production month, as well as when the contract was 
executed.

[[Page 123]]

    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.
    BIA means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the 
Interior.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Coal means coal of all ranks from lignite through anthracite.
    Coal washing means any treatment to remove impurities from coal. 
Coal washing may include, but is not limited to, operations such as 
flotation, air, water, or heavy media separation; drying; and related 
handling (or combination thereof).
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to a coal lessee for the production and 
disposition of the coal produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not 
limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as 
crushing, sizing, screening, storing, mixing, loading, treatment with 
substances including chemicals or oils, and other preparation of the 
coal to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no 
cost to the Indian lessor. Gross proceeds, as applied to coal, also 
includes but is not limited to reimbursements for royalties, taxes or 
fees, and other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross 
proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Indian royalty interest 
may be exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including 
the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a 
lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek 
to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Indian allottee means any Indian for whom land or an interest in 
land is held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to 
Federal restriction against alienation.
    Indian Tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, 
community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any 
land or interest in land is held in trust by the United States or which 
is subject to Federal restriction against alienation.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States for an Indian 
coal resource under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration 
for, development or extraction of, or removal of coal--or the land 
covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lessee means any person to whom the Indian Tribe or an Indian 
allottee issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an 
obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This 
includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an 
operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed 
the royalty payment responsibility.
    Like-quality coal means coal has similar chemical and physical 
characteristics.
    Marketable condition means coal that is sufficiently free from 
impurities and otherwise in a condition that it will be accepted by a 
purchaser under a sales contract typical for that area.
    Mine means an underground or surface excavation or series of 
excavations and the surface or underground support facilities that 
contribute directly or indirectly to mining, production, preparation, 
and handling of lease products.
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Net-back method means a method for calculating market value of coal 
at the lease or mine. Under this method, costs of transportation, 
washing, handling, etc., are deducted from the ultimate proceeds 
received for the coal at the first point at which reasonable values for 
the coal may be determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract or by comparison to other sales of coal, to ascertain value at 
the mine.

[[Page 124]]

    Net output means the quantity of washed coal that a washing plant 
produces.
    Person means by individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of coal are made to a purchaser.
    Spot market price means the price received under any sales 
transaction when planned or actual deliveries span a short period of 
time, usually not exceeding one year.

Sec. 206.452  Coal subject to royalties--general provisions.

    (a) All coal (except coal unavoidably lost as determined by BLM 
pursuant to 43 CFR group 3400) from an Indian lease subject to this part 
is subject to royalty. This includes coal used, sold, or otherwise 
disposed of by the lessee on or off the lease.
    (b) If a lessee receives compensation for unavoidably lost coal 
through insurance coverage or other arrangements, royalties at the rate 
specified in the lease are to be paid on the amount of compensation 
received for the coal. No royalty is due on insurance compensation 
received by the lessee for other losses.
    (c) If waste piles or slurry ponds are reworked to recover coal, the 
lessee shall pay royalty at the rate specified in the lease at the time 
the recovered coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. The 
royalty rate shall be that rate applicable to the production method used 
to initially mine coal in the waste pile or slurry pond; i.e., 
underground mining method or surface mining method. Coal in waste pits 
or slurry ponds initially mined from Indian leases shall be allocated to 
such leases regardless of whether it is stored on Indian lands. The 
lessee shall maintain accurate records to determine to which individual 
Indian lease coal in the waste pit or slurry pond should be allocated. 
However, nothing in this section requires payment of a royalty on coal 
for which a royalty has already been paid.


<R05>
Sec. 206.453  Quality and quantity measurement standards for reporting and paying royalties.

    (a) For leases subject to Sec. 206.456 of this subpart, the quality 
of coal on which royalty is due shall be reported on the basis of 
percent sulfur, percent ash, and number of British thermal units (Btu) 
per pound of coal. Coal quality determinations shall be made at 
intervals prescribed in the lessee's sales contract. If there is no 
contract, or if the contract does not specify the intervals of coal 
quality determination, the lessee shall propose a quality test schedule 
to MMS. In no case, however, shall quality tests be performed less than 
quarterly using standard industry-recognized testing methods. Coal 
quality information shall be reported on the appropriate forms required 
under 30 CFR part 216.
    (b) For all leases subject to this subpart, the quantity of coal on 
which royalty is due shall be measured in short tons (of 2,000 pounds 
each) by methods prescribed by the BLM. Coal quantity information shall 
be reported on appropriate forms required under 30 CFR part 216 and on 
the Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance, Form MMS-2014, as required 
under 30 CFR part 210.


<R05>
Sec. 206.454  Point of royalty determination.

    (a) For all leases subject to this subpart, royalty shall be 
computed on the basis of the quantity and quality of Indian coal in 
marketable condition measured at the point of royalty measurement as 
determined jointly by BLM and MMS.
    (b) Coal produced and added to stockpiles or inventory does not 
require payment of royalty until such coal is later used, sold, or 
otherwise finally disposed of. MMS may ask BLM or BIA to increase the 
lease bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that 
stockpiles or inventory become excessive so as to increase the risk of 
degradation of the resource.
    (c) The lessee shall pay royalty at a rate specified in the lease at 
the time the coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, 
unless otherwise provided for at Sec. 206.455(d) of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 206.455  Valuation standards for cents-per-ton leases.

    (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Indian Tribal and 
allotted Indian lands (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, 
Osage County, Oklahoma) which provide for the determination of royalty 
on a cents-per-ton (or other quantity) basis.
    (b) The royalty for coal from leases subject to this section shall 
be based on the dollar rate per ton prescribed in the lease. That dollar 
rate shall be applicable to the actual quantity of coal used, sold, or 
otherwise finally disposed of, including coal which is avoidably lost as 
determined by BLM pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400.
    (c) For leases subject to this section, there shall be no allowances 
for transportation, removal of impurities, coal washing, or any other 
processing or preparation of the coal.
    (d) When a coal lease is readjusted pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400 and 
the royalty valuation method changes from a cents-per-ton basis to an ad 
valorem basis, coal which is produced prior to the effective date of 
readjustment and sold or used within 30 days of the effective date of 
readjustment shall be valued pursuant to this section. All coal that is 
not used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of within 30 days after 
the effective date of readjustment shall be valued pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 206.456 of this subpart, and royalties shall be paid 
at the royalty rate specified in the readjusted lease.


<R05>
Sec. 206.456  Valuation standards for ad valorem leases.

    (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Indian Tribal and 
allotted Indian lands (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, 
Osage County, Oklahoma) which provide for the determination of royalty 
as a percentage of the amount of value of coal (ad valorem). The value 
for royalty purposes of coal from such leases shall be the value of coal 
determined pursuant to this section, less applicable coal washing 
allowances and transportation allowances determined pursuant to 
Secs. 206.457 through 206.461 of this subpart, or any allowance 
authorized by Sec. 206.464 of this subpart. The royalty due shall be 
equal to the value for royalty purposes multiplied by the royalty rate 
in the lease.
    (b)(1) The value of coal that is sold pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(5) of this section. The 
lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is 
arm's-length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, 
is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the coal 
produced. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, then 
MMS may require that the coal sold pursuant to that contract be valued 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be based 
on less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the coal 
production, including the additional consideration.
    (3) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable value 
of the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the 
lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and 
the lessor, then MMS shall require that the coal production be valued 
pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(iv), or (c)(2)(v) 
of this section, and in accordance with the notification requirements of 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section. When MMS determines that the value may 
be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give the lessee an 
opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's 
reported coal value.
    (4) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the coal production.
    (5) The value of production for royalty purposes shall not include 
payments received by the lessee pursuant to a contract which the lessee 
demonstrates, to MMS' satisfaction, were

[[Page 126]]

not part of the total consideration paid for the purchase of coal 
production.
    (c)(1) The value of coal from leases subject to this section and 
which is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be 
determined in accordance with this section.
    (2) If the value of the coal cannot be determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, then the value shall be determined 
through application of other valuation criteria. The criteria shall be 
considered in the following order, and the value shall be based upon the 
first applicable criterion:
    (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition of produced 
coal by other than an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross 
proceeds are within the range of the gross proceeds derived from, or 
paid under, comparable arm's-length contracts between buyers and sellers 
neither of whom is affiliated with the lessee for sales, purchases, or 
other dispositions of like-quality coal produced in the area. In 
evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes 
of these regulations, the following factors shall be considered: price, 
time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of 
coal, quantity, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect 
the value of the coal;
    (ii) Prices reported for that coal to a public utility commission;
    (iii) Prices reported for that coal to the Energy Information 
Administration of the Department of Energy;
    (iv) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published 
or publicly available spot market prices, or information submitted by 
the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease 
operation or the salability of certain types of coal;
    (v) If a reasonable value cannot be determined using paragraphs 
(c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(iv) of this section, then 
a net-back method or any other reasonable method shall be used to 
determine value.
    (3) When the value of coal is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, that value determination shall be consistent 
with the provisions contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (d)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, that value does not require MMS' prior approval. However, 
the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of 
royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMS 
will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the 
reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) An Indian lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or Indian representatives, or to the Inspector General of 
the Department of the Interior or other persons authorized to receive 
such information, arm's-length sales and sales quantity data for like-
quality coal sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from 
the area.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(iv), or (c)(2)(v) of this 
section. The notification shall be by letter to the Associate Director 
for Royalty Management or his/her designee. The letter shall identify 
the valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of the 
procedure to be followed. The notification required by this section is a 
one-time notification due no later than the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on the Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method 
authorized by paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(iv), or 
(c)(2)(v) of this section, and each time there is a change in a method 
under paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) or (c)(2)(v) of this section.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall be liable for the difference, if any, between 
royalty payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty 
payments that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The 
lessee shall also be liable for interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.202. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may

[[Page 127]]

use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based upon 
the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. That determination shall remain effective for the period 
stated therein. After MMS issues its determination, the lessee shall 
make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value for royalty purposes be less than the 
gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the disposition of produced 
coal less applicable provisions of paragraph (b)(5) of this section and 
less applicable allowances determined pursuant to Secs. 206.457 through 
206.461 and Sec. 206.464 of this subpart.
    (h) The lessee is required to place coal in marketable condition at 
no cost to the Indian lessor. Where the value established pursuant to 
this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value 
shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds has been 
reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain 
services, the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the 
lessee to place the coal in marketable condition.
    (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract, and may be retroactively applied to 
value for royalty purposes for a period not to exceed two years, unless 
MMS approves a longer period. If the lessee makes timely application for 
a price increase allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, 
and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force 
purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless 
or until monies or consideration resulting from the price increase are 
received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to 
avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser 
fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of coal.
    (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Indian Tribes or 
allottees until the audit period is formally closed.
    (k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation, coal washing, or other allowances 
pursuant to Secs. 206.457 through 206.461 and Sec. 206.464 of this 
subpart, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 
5 U.S.C. 522. Any data specified by the Act to be privileged, 
confidential, or otherwise exempt shall be maintained in a confidential 
manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. All requests 
for information about determinations made under this part are to be 
submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act regulation 
of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2. Nothing in this 
section is intended to limit or diminish in any manner whatsoever the 
right of an Indian lessor to obtain any and all information as such 
lessor may be lawfully entitled from MMS or such lessor's lessee 
directly under the terms of the lease or applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 206.457  Washing allowances--general.

    (a) For ad valorem leases subject to Sec. 206.456 of this subpart, 
MMS shall, as authorized by this section, allow a deduction in 
determining value for royalty purposes for the reasonable, actual costs 
incurred to wash coal, unless the value determined pursuant to 
Sec. 206.456 of this subpart was based upon like-quality unwashed coal. 
Under no circumstances shall the washing allowance and the 
transportation allowance authorized by Sec. 206.461 of this subpart 
reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.

[[Page 128]]

    (b) If MMS determines that a lessee has improperly determined a 
washing allowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall be 
liable for any additional royalties, plus interest determined in 
accordance with 30 CFR 218.202, or shall be entitled to a credit, 
without interest.
    (c) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate washing costs to 
Indian leases.
    (d) No cost normally associated with mining operations and which are 
necessary for placing coal in marketable condition shall be allowed as a 
cost of washing.
    (e) Coal washing costs shall only be recognized as allowances when 
the washed coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.


<R05>
Sec. 206.458  Determination of washing allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For washing costs incurred by a 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the washing allowance shall 
be the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee for washing the 
coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and 
possible future adjustment. MMS' prior approval is not required before a 
lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length contract. 
However, before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed page one of Form MMS-4292, Coal Washing Allowance Report, in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A washing allowance 
may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months 
prior to the first day of the month that Form MMS-4292 is filed with 
MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by 
the lessee.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the washer for the 
washing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration 
paid, then MMS may require that the washing allowance be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length washing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of 
the washing because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, 
or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to 
market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the 
lessor, then MMS shall require that the washing allowance be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS determines 
that the value of the washing may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's washing costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for washing under an arm's-length 
contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent. 
Washing allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal washed.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations 
where the lessee performs washing for itself, the washing allowance will 
be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All washing 
allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation 
are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future 
adjustment. Prior MMS approval of washing allowances is not required for 
non-arm's-length or no contract situations. However, before any 
estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed Form MMS-4292 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. A washing allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period 
of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form 
MMS-4292 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a 
showing of good cause by the lessee. MMS will monitor the allowance 
deduction to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When 
necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its actual 
washing allowance.
    (2) The washing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual

[[Page 129]]

costs for washing during the reported period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable 
investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets 
(including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) 
which are an integral part of the wash plant.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the wash 
plant; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly 
allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can 
document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the wash plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal 
income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are not allowable 
expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either 
method for a wash plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the 
other alternative without approval of MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the wash plant services, whichever is 
appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, 
the lessee may not change methods without MMS approval. A change in 
ownership of a wash plant shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original operator/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a wash 
plant shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated 
below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
capital investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance 
shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to 
plants first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.
    (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is 
applicable and shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate 
shall be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent washing 
allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section).
    (3) The washing allowance for coal shall be determined based on the 
lessee's reasonable and actual cost of washing the coal. The lessee may 
not take an allowance for the costs of washing lease production that is 
not royalty bearing.
    (c) Reporting requirements. (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the 
exception of those washing allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(v) 
and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page one of the 
initial Form MMS-4292 prior to, or at the same time, as the washing 
allowance determined pursuant to an arm's-length contract is reported on 
Form MMS-2014, Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance. A Form MMS-4292 
received by the end of the month that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be 
considered to be received timely.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4292 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct 
a washing allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar 
year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified 
or amended, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding 
reporting periods,

[[Page 130]]

lessees must submit page one of Form MMS-4292 within 3 months after the 
end of the calendar year, or after the applicable contract or rate 
terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is earlier, unless MMS 
approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shall continue 
to use the allowance from the previous reporting period).
    (iv) MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length washing 
contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a 
reasonable time, as determined by MMS.
    (v) Washing allowances which are based on arm's-length contracts and 
which are in effect at the time these regulations become effective will 
be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the purposes 
of this section, only those allowances that have been approved by MMS in 
writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations 
become effective.
    (vi) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those 
washing allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (c)(2)(vii) of 
this section, the lessee shall submit an initial Form MMS-4292 prior to, 
or at the same time as, the washing allowance determined pursuant to a 
non-arm's-length contract or no contract situation is reported on Form 
MMS-2014, Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance. A Form MMS-4292 
received by the end of the month that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be 
considered to be timely received. The initial reporting may be based on 
estimated costs.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4292 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct 
a washing allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar 
year, or until the washing under the non-arm's-length contract or the no 
contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial 
reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4292 
containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If coal 
washing is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4292 its 
estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated coal washing 
allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the previous period 
plus or minus any adjustments which are based on the lessee's knowledge 
of decreases or increases which will affect the allowance. Form MMS-4292 
must be received by MMS within 3 months after the end of the previous 
reporting period, unless MMS approves a longer period (during which 
period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous 
reporting period).
    (iv) For new wash plants, the lessee's initial Form MMS-4292 shall 
include estimates of the allowable coal washing costs for the applicable 
period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently available 
operations data for the plant, or if such data are not available, the 
lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar coal 
wash plants.
    (v) Washing allowances based on non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used by 
the lessee to prepare its Forms MMS-4292. The data shall be provided 
within a reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (vii) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (3) MMS may establish coal washing allowance reporting dates for 
individual leases different from those specified in this subpart in 
order to provide more effective administration. Lessees will be notified 
of any change in their reporting period.
    (4) Washing allowances must be reported as a separate line on the 
Form MMS-2014, unless MMS approves a different reporting procedure.

[[Page 131]]

    (d) Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and failure 
to report. (1) If a lessee deducts a washing allowance on its Form MMS-
2014 without complying with the requirements of this section, the lessee 
shall be liable for interest on the amount of such deduction until the 
requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee also shall 
repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this section.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a washing allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual coal washing allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required 
to pay additional royalties due plus interest computed pursuant to 30 
CFR 218.202, retroactive to the first month the lessee is authorized to 
deduct a washing allowance. If the actual washing allowance is greater 
than the amount the lessee has estimated and taken during the reporting 
period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.
    (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect 
actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Other washing cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine washing costs when establishing value 
using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of washing costs.


<R05>
Sec. 206.459  Allocation of washed coal.

    (a) When coal is subjected to washing, the washed coal must be 
allocated to the leases from which it was extracted.
    (b) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from 
coal obtained from only one lease, the quantity of washed coal allocable 
to the lease will be based on the net output of the washing plant.
    (c) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from 
coal obtained from more than one lease, unless determined otherwise by 
BLM, the quantity of net output of washed coal allocable to each lease 
will be based on the ratio of measured quantities of coal delivered to 
the washing plant and washed from each lease compared to the total 
measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed.


<R05>
Sec. 206.460  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) For ad valorem leases subject to Sec. 206.456 of this subpart, 
where the value for royalty purposes has been determined at a point 
remote from the lease or mine, MMS shall, as authorized by this section, 
allow a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes for the 
reasonable, actual costs incurred to:
    (1) Transport the coal from an Indian lease to a sales point which 
is remote from both the lease and mine; or
    (2) Transport the coal from an Indian lease to a wash plant when 
that plant is remote from both the lease and mine and, if applicable, 
from the wash plant to a remote sales point. In-mine transportation 
costs shall not be included in the transportation allowance.
    (b) Under no circumstances shall the washing allowance and the 
transportation allowance authorized by Sec. 206.456 of this subpart 
reduce the value of coal under any selling arrangement to zero.
    (c)(1) When coal transported from a mine to a wash plant is eligible 
for a transportation allowance in accordance with this section, the 
lessee is not required to allocate transportation costs between the 
quantity of clean coal output and the rejected waste material. The 
transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total production 
which is transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a 
cost per ton of cleaned coal transported.
    (2) For coal that is not washed at a wash plant, the transportation 
allowance shall be authorized for the total production which is 
transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per 
ton of coal transported.

[[Page 132]]

    (3) Transportation costs shall only be recognized as allowances when 
the transported coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
section, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest, determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest.
    (e) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate transportation 
costs to Indian leases.


<R05>
Sec. 206.461  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For transportation costs incurred by 
a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation 
allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee 
for transporting the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, 
review, audit, and possible future adjustment. MMS' prior approval is 
not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-
length contract. However, before any deduction may be taken, the lessee 
must submit a completed page one of Form MMS-4293, Coal Transportation 
Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A 
transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of 
not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form 
MMS-4293 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a 
showing of good cause by the lessee.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration paid, then MMS may require that the transportation 
allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (3) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable 
value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee 
shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations 
where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the 
transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable 
actual costs. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-
length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, 
audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior MMS approval of 
transportation allowances is not required for non-arm's-length or no 
contract situations. However, before any estimated or actual deduction 
may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed Form MMS-4293 in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A transportation 
allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 
months prior to the first day of the month that Form MMS-4293 is filed 
with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a showing of good 
cause by the lessee. MMS will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure 
that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or 
appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual 
transportation allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during

[[Page 133]]

the reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, 
overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital 
investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, 
or a cost equal to the depreciable investment in the transportation 
system multiplied by the rate of return in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally 
those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and 
installation of capital equipment) which are an integral part of the 
transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including 
royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either 
method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to 
change to the other alternative without approval of MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, 
whichever is appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an 
election is made, the lessee may not change methods without MMS 
approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not 
alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/
lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a 
change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only 
once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage 
value.
    (B) MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate 
of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(B)(v) of this section. 
No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall 
apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service or 
acquired after March 1, 1989.
    (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly 
average as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first 
month of the reporting period of which the allowance is applicable and 
shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate shall be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent transportation 
allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section).
    (3) A lessee may apply to MMS for exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section. MMS will grant the exception only if the lessee 
has a rate for the transportation approved by a Federal agency for 
Indian leases. MMS shall deny the exception request if it determines 
that the rate is excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation 
charges by systems, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar 
transportation services in that area. If there are no arm's-length 
transportation charges, MMS shall deny the exception request if:
    (i) No Federal regulatory agency cost analysis exists and the 
Federal regulatory agency has declined to investigate pursuant to MMS 
timely objections upon filing; and
    (ii) The rate significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation as determined under this section.
    (c) Reporting requirements. (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the 
exception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(v) and

[[Page 134]]

(c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page one of the 
initial Form MMS-4293 prior to, or at the same time as, the 
transportation allowance determined pursuant to an arm's-length contract 
is reported on Form MMS-2014, Reports of Sales and Royalty Remittance.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4293 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is 
modified or amended, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding 
reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form MMS-4293 within 
3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after the applicable 
contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is 
earlier, unless MMS approves a longer period (during which period the 
lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting 
period). Lessees may request special reporting procedures in unique 
allowance reporting situations, such as those related to spot sales.
    (iv) MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (v) Transportation allowances that are based on arm's-length 
contracts and which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those 
transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and 
(c)(2)(vii) of this section, the lessee shall submit an initial Form 
MMS-4293 prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation allowance 
determined pursuant to a non-arm's-length contract or no contract 
situation is reported on Form MMS-2014, Report of Sales and Royalty 
Remittance. The initial report may be based on estimated costs.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4293 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until the transportation under the non-arm's-length 
contract or the no contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial 
reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4293 
containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If the 
transportation is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4293 
its estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated 
transportation allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the 
previous reporting period plus or minus any adjustments that are based 
on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases that will affect the 
allowance. Form MMS-4293 must be received by MMS within 3 months after 
the end of the previous reporting period, unless MMS approves a longer 
period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the 
allowance from the previous reporting period).
    (iv) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial Form MMS-4293 shall include estimates of the allowable 
transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be 
based upon the most recently available operations data for the 
transportation system, or, if such data are not available, the lessee 
shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation 
systems.
    (v) Non-arm's-length contract or no contract-based transportation 
allowances that are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in

[[Page 135]]

writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations 
become effective.
    (vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare its Form MMS-4293. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (vii) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
    (viii) If the lessee is authorized to use its Federal-agency-
approved rate as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) MMS may establish reporting dates for individual lessees 
different than those specified in this paragraph in order to provide 
more effective administration. Lessees will be notified as to any change 
in their reporting period.
    (4) Transportation allowances must be reported as a separate line 
item on Form MMS-2014, unless MMS approves a different reporting 
procedure.
    (d) Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and failure 
to report. (1) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its 
Form MMS-2014 without complying with the requirements of this section, 
the lessee shall be liable for interest on the amount of such deduction 
until the requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee 
also shall repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this 
section.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required 
to pay additional royalties due plus interest, computed pursuant to 30 
CFR 218.202, retroactive to the first month the lessee is authorized to 
deduct a transportation allowance. If the actual transportation 
allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has estimated and taken 
during the reporting period, the lessee shall be to a credit, without 
interest.
    (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect 
actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Other transportation cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing 
value using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of transportation costs.


<R05>
Sec. 206.462  Contract submission.

    (a) The lessee and other payors shall submit to MMS, upon request, 
contracts for the sale of coal from ad valorem leases subject to this 
subpart. MMS must receive the contracts within a reasonable period of 
time, as specified by MMS. Lessees shall include as part of the 
submittal requirements any contracts, agreements, contract amendments, 
or other documents that affect the gross proceeds received for the sale 
of coal, as well as any other information regarding any consideration 
received for the sale or disposition of coal that is not included in 
such contracts. At the time of its contract submittals, MMS may require 
the lessee to certify in writing that it has provided all documents and 
information that reflect the total consideration provided by purchasers 
of coal from ad valorem leases subject to this subpart. Information 
requested under this section may include contracts for both ad valorem 
and cents-per-ton leases and shall be available in the lessee's offices 
during normal business hours or provided to MMS at such time and in such 
manner as may be requested by authorized Department of the Interior 
personnel. Any oral sales arrangement negotiated by the lessee must be 
placed in a written form and be retained by the lessee. Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to limit the authority of MMS to obtain or 
have access to information pursuant to 30 CFR part 212.
    (b) Lessees and other payors shall designate, for each contract 
submitted pursuant to this section, whether the

[[Page 136]]

contract in arm's-length or non-arm's-length.
    (c) A lessee's or other payor's determination that its contract is 
arm's-length is subject to future audit to verify that the contract 
meets the criteria of the arm's-length contract definition in 
Sec. 206.251 of this subpart.
    (d) Information required to be submitted under this section that 
constitutes trade secrets and commercial and financial information that 
is identified as privileged or confidential shall not be available for 
public inspection or made public or disclosed without the consent of the 
lessee or other payor, except as otherwise provided by law or 
regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 206.463  In-situ and surface gasification and liquefaction operations.

    In an ad valorem Federal coal lease is developed by in-situ or 
surface gasification or liquefaction technology, the lessee shall 
propose the value of coal for royalty purposes to MMS. MMS will review 
the lessee's proposal and issue a value determination. The lessee may 
use its proposed value until MMS issues a value determination.


<R05>
Sec. 206.464  Value enhancement of marketable coal.

    If, prior to use, sale, or other disposition, the lessee enhances 
the value of coal after the coal has been placed in marketable condition 
in accordance with Sec. 206.456(h) of this subpart, the lessee shall 
notify MMS that such processing is occurring or will occur. The value of 
that production shall be determined as follows:
    (a) A value established for the feedstock coal in marketable 
condition by application of the provisions of Sec. 206.465(c)(2) (i) 
through (iv) of this subpart; or,
    (b) In the event that a value cannot be established in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section, then the value of production will be 
determined in accordance with Sec. 206.456(c)(2)(v) of this subpart and 
the value shall be the lessee's gross proceeds accruing from the 
disposition of the enhanced product, reduced by MMS-approved processing 
costs and procedures including a rate of return on investment equal to 
two times the Standard and Poor's BBB bond rate applicable under 
Sec. 206.458(b)(2)(v) of this subpart.

Sec. 207.2  Definitions.

    The definitions in part 206 of this title are applicable to this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 207.3  Contracts made pursuant to new form leases.

    On November 29, 1950 (15 FR 8585), a new lease form was adopted 
(Form 4-1158, 15 FR 8585) containing provisions whereby the lessee 
agrees that nothing in any contract or other arrangement made for the 
sale or disposal of oil, gas, natural gasoline, and other products of 
the leased land, shall be construed as modifying any of the provisions 
of the lease, including, but not limited to, provisions relating to gas 
waste, taking royalty-in-kind, and the method of computing royalties due 
as based on a minimum valuation and in accordance with the oil and gas 
valuation regulations. A contract or agreement pursuant to a lease 
containing such provisions may be made without obtaining prior approval 
of the United States as lessor, but must be retained as provided in 
Sec. 207.5 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 207.4  Contracts made pursuant to old form leases.

    (a) Old form leases are those containing provisions prohibiting 
sales or disposal of oil, gas, natural gasoline, and other products of 
the lease except in accordance with a contract or other arrangement 
approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or by the Director of the 
Minerals Management Service or his/her representative. A contract or 
agreement made pursuant to an old form lease may be made without 
obtaining approval if the contract or agreement contains either the 
substance of or is accompanied by the stipulation set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section, signed by the seller (lessee or operator).
    (b) The stipulation, the substance of which must be included in the 
contract, or be made the subject matter of a separate instrument 
properly identifying the leases affected thereby, is as follows:

    It is hereby understood and agreed that nothing in the written 
contract or in any approval thereof shall be construed as affecting any 
of the relations between the United States and its lessee, particularly 
in matters of gas waste, taking royalty in kind, and the method of 
computing royalties due as based on a minimum valuation and in 
accordance with the terms and provisions of the oil and gas valuation 
regulations applicable to the lands covered by said contract.


<R05>
Sec. 207.5  Contract and sales agreement retention.

    Copies of all sales contracts, posted price bulletins, etc., and 
copies of all agreements, other contracts, or other documents which are 
relevant to the valuation of production are to be maintained by the 
lessee and made available upon request during normal working hours to 
authorized MMS, State or Indian representatives, other MMS or BLM 
officials, auditors of the General Accounting Office, or other persons 
authorized to receive such documents, or shall be submitted to MMS 
within a reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS. Any oral sales 
arrangement negotiated by the lessee must be placed in written form and 
retained by the lessee. Records shall be retained in accordance with 30 
CFR part 212.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 208.1  General.

    The regulations in this part govern the sale of royalty oil by the 
United States to eligible refiners. The regulations apply to royalty oil 
from leases on Federal lands onshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf 
(OCS).


<R05>
Sec. 208.2  Definitions.

    Allotment means the quantity of royalty oil that DOI determines is 
available to each eligible refiner that has applied for a portion of the 
total volume of royalty oil offered in a given royalty oil sale.
    Application means the formal written request to DOI on Form MMS-4070 
by an eligible refiner interested in purchasing a quantity of royalty 
oil from the approximate volume announced by DOI in a given ``Notice of 
Availability of Royalty Oil.''
    Area or Region means the geographic territory having Federal oil and 
gas leases over which MMS has jurisdiction, unless the context in which 
those words are used indicates that a different meaning is intended.
    Delivery point means the point where the lessor, in accordance with 
lease terms, directs the lessee to deliver royalty oil to a purchaser. 
Title to the royalty oil, or to the quantity thereof in a commingled 
stream, passes from the Federal Government to the purchaser at this 
designated point, which is specified in the royalty oil contract. For 
onshore leases, the delivery point will be on or adjacent to the lease, 
except as provided in Sec. 208.8(a) of this part. In instances where an 
onshore delivery point is designated for offshore royalty oil, such 
point generally will be the first onshore point where the price of the 
oil, including transportation costs, can be determined and where the 
purchaser can either exchange or take delivery of the oil. The 
Government does not guarantee physical access to the oil at such point.
    Director means the Director of MMS, who is responsible for its 
overall direction, or his or her delegate(s).
    DOI means the Department of the Interior, including the Secretary or 
his or her delegate(s).
    Eligible refiner means a refiner of crude oil that meets the 
following criteria for eligibility to purchase royalty oil:
    (1) For the purchase of royalty oil from onshore leases, it means a 
refiner

[[Page 139]]

that qualifies as a small and independent refiner as those terms are 
defined in sections 3(3) and 3(4) of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation 
Act, 15 U.S.C. 751 et seq., except that the time period for 
determination contained in section 3(3)(A) would be the calendar quarter 
immediately preceding the date of the applicable ``Notice of 
Availability of Royalty Oil.'' A refiner that, together with all persons 
controlled by, in control of, under common control with, or otherwise 
affiliated with the refiner, inputs a volume of domestic crude oil from 
its own production exceeding 30 percent of its total refinery input of 
crude oil is ineligible to participate in royalty oil sales under this 
part. Crude oil received in exchange for such refiner's own production 
is considered to be that refiner's own production for purposes of this 
section.
    (2) For the purchase of royalty oil from leases on the OCS, it means 
a refiner that qualifies as a small business enterprise under the rules 
of the Small Business Administration (13 CFR part 121).
    Entitlement means the volume of royalty oil from the Federal 
Government's share of production from a Federal lease which a purchaser 
is entitled to receive under a royalty oil contract.
    Exchange agreement means a written agreement between the purchaser 
and another person for the exchange of royalty oil purchased under this 
part for other oil on a volume or equivalent value basis.
    Fair market value means the value of oil--(1) Computed at a unit 
price equivalent to the average unit price at which oil was sold 
pursuant to a lease during the period for which any royalty or net 
profit share is accrued or reserved to the United States pursuant to 
such lease, or
    (2) If there were no such sales, or if the Secretary finds that 
there were an insufficient number of such sales to equitably determine 
such value, computed at the average unit price at which oil was sold 
pursuant to other leases in the same region of the OCS during such 
period, or
    (3) If there were no sales of oil from such region during such 
period, or if the Secretary finds that there are an insufficient number 
of such sales to equitably determine such value, at an appropriate price 
determined by the Secretary.
    Federal lease means a contractual agreement with the Federal 
Government which authorizes the exploration, development, and production 
of oil and gas on Federal lands onshore or on the OCS.
    Interim sale means a sale conducted as a result of substantial 
additional royalty oil becoming available in a specific area prior to 
the scheduled expiration date of royalty oil contracts in effect for 
that area.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, or 
any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or other 
payments required by the lease.
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil means a notice published by 
DOI in the Federal Register (and in other printed media when 
appropriate, such as a newspaper or magazine of general or specialized 
circulation) to advise interested parties of the availability of royalty 
oil for purchase by eligible refiners and the approximate volume of 
royalty oil available to the applicants.
    OCS means the Outer Continental Shelf, as defined in 43 U.S.C. 
1331(a).
    OCSLA means the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et 
seq., as amended by 43 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).
    Oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase 
in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric 
pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and is 
marketed or used as such. Condensate recovered in lease separators or 
field facilities is considered to be oil.
    Operator means any person, including a lessee, who has control of or 
who manages operations on an oil and gas lease site on Federal onshore 
lands or on the OCS.
    Payor means any person responsible for reporting royalties from a 
Federal lease or leases on Form MMS-2014.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture.

[[Page 140]]

    Preference eligible refiner means an eligible refiner with at least 
one operating refinery which is located within the area designated as 
the preference eligible area in the ``Notice of Availability of Royalty 
Oil.'' A refiner may be deemed to be a preference eligible refiner if it 
owns a refinery located in the preference eligible area which is not 
operational if the refiner meets the requirements of Sec. 208.7(g) of 
this part.
    Purchaser means anyone who acquires royalty oil sold by DOI under 
the Federal Government's Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program and who has a 
contractual obligation under an agreement to purchase royalty oil.
    Reallocation means an offering of royalty oil previously allocated 
in a specific sale but subsequently turned back to MMS. A reallocation 
would only be made if substantial amounts of royalty oil are turned 
back.
    Refined petroleum product means gasoline, kerosene, distillates 
(including Number 2 fuel oil), refined lubricating oils, or diesel fuel.
    Royalty oil means that amount of oil that DOI takes in kind in 
partial or full satisfaction of a lessee's royalty or net profit share 
obligations as determined by whatever lease interest the lessee holds 
under an applicable mineral leasing law.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the Department of the Interior or 
his/her delegate(s).
    Section 6 lease means an oil and gas lease originally issued by any 
State and currently maintained in effect pursuant to section 6 of the 
OCSLA.
    Section 8 lease means an oil and gas lease originally issued by the 
United States pursuant to section 8 of the OCSLA.

<R05>
Sec. 208.4  Royalty oil sales to eligible refiners.

    (a) Determination to take royalty oil in kind. The Secretary may 
evaluate crude oil market conditions from time to time. The evaluation 
will include, among other things, the availability of crude oil and the 
crude oil requirements of the Federal Government, primarily those 
requirements concerning matters of national interest and defense. The 
Secretary will review these items and will determine whether eligible 
refiners have access to adequate supplies of crude oil and whether such 
oil is available to eligible refiners at equitable prices. Such 
determinations may be made on a regional basis. The determination by the 
Secretary shall be published in the Federal Register concurrent with or 
included in the ``Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil'' required by 30 
CFR 208.5.
    (b) Sale to eligible refiners. (1) Upon a determination by the 
Secretary under paragraph (a) of this section that eligible refiners do 
not have access to adequate supplies of crude oil at equitable prices, 
the Secretary, at his or her discretion, may elect to take in kind some 
or all of the royalty oil accruing to the United States from oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands onshore and on the OCS. The Secretary may 
authorize MMS to offer royalty oil for sale to eligible refiners only 
for use in their refineries and not for resale (other than under an 
exchange agreement).
    (2) All sales of royalty oil from onshore leases will be priced at 
the royalty value that would have been determined for that oil pursuant 
to 30 CFR part 206 had the royalties been paid in value rather than 
taken in kind. All sales of royalty oil from OCS leases will be priced 
at the fair market value of the oil including associated transportation 
costs to the designated delivery point, if applicable.
    (3) An eligible refiner must have a representative at a sale in 
order to participate. The Secretary may, at his or her discretion, 
establish purchase limitations and withhold any royalty oil from any 
offering.
    (4) The MMS will recover the administrative costs of the RIK Program 
through the collection of administrative fees. The fees will consist of 
an

[[Page 141]]

initial nonrefundable contract fee for each executed contract and a 
monthly variable charge applied to each lease under contract. The amount 
of the initial contract fee shall be determined prior to a sale and 
published in the ``Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil.'' The initial 
contract fee will be payable in equal installments due at the end of the 
first and second months of the contract. These contract fees will be 
applied against the RIK Program's administrative costs, and the 
remainder of the administrative costs will be recovered through the 
monthly variable charges per lease, which will be billed and payable 
concurrently with the monthly actual billings for royalty oil. The rate 
per lease will be determined by dividing the remaining recoverable 
administrative costs by the total number of leases under contract. The 
rate may change depending upon whether total administrative costs change 
and/or whether the number of leases taken in kind changes from one month 
to another. In instances where production from a lease is sold on a 
percentage basis to two or more purchasers, each percentage portion of 
the lease will be considered a separate lease for purposes of 
administrative fee determination.
    (c) Upon a determination by the Secretary under paragraph (a) of 
this section that eligible refiners do have access to adequate supplies 
of crude oil at equitable prices, MMS will not take royalties in kind 
from oil and gas leases for exclusive sale to such refiners. Such 
determinations may be made on a regional basis.
    (d) Interim sales. The MMS generally will not conduct interim sales. 
However, interim sales may be held at the discretion of the Secretary if 
substantial addition royalty oil becomes available. The potentially 
eligible refiners, individually or collectively, must submit 
documentation demonstrating that adequate supplies of crude oil at 
equitable prices are not available for purchase. Although sufficient 
documentation must be submitted, it is not mandatory for each 
potentially eligible refiner to participate in a submission of such 
documentation to be determined eligible. The documentation must be 
submitted to MMS for a determination as to whether an interim sale is 
needed.


<R05>
Sec. 208.5  Notice of royalty oil sale.

    If the Secretary decides to take royalty oil in kind for sale to 
eligible refiners, MMS will issue a ``Notice of Availability of Royalty 
Oil'' specifying the manner in which the sale is to be effected, the 
approximate quantity of royalty oil to be offered, information required 
in applications, the closing date for the receipt of applications for 
royalty oil, and other general administrative details concerning the 
application, allocation, and contract award process for the royalty oil. 
The Notice will describe generally the terms under which the royalty oil 
contracts will be awarded and will specify which applicants will be 
deemed preference eligible refiners in the sale proceedings. The Notice 
will also contain guidelines for reallocation procedures in the event 
substantial quantities of royalty oil sold in that specific sale are 
subsequently turned back to MMS. Only those purchasers that hold ongoing 
contracts from that specific sale will be allowed to participate in any 
reallocation, which would be voluntary, and then only if they continue 
to meet eligibility requirements as set forth in 30 CFR 208.2 and 208.7. 
If a reallocation is held prior to the effective date of the contracts 
as specified in the ``Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil'', all 
eligible refiners that selected a lease or leases in that specific sale 
would be allowed to participate, pursuant to the procedures in the 
Notice.


<R05>
Sec. 208.6  General application procedures.

    (a) To apply for the purchase of royalty oil, an applicant must file 
a Form MMS-4070 with MMS in accordance with instructions provided in the 
``Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil'' and in accordance with any 
instructions issued by MMS for completion of Form MMS-4070. The 
applicant will be required to submit a letter of intent from a qualified 
financial institution stating that it would be granted surety coverage 
for the royalty oil for which it is applying, or other such proof of 
surety coverage, as deemed acceptable by

[[Page 142]]

MMS. The letter of intent must be submitted with a completed Form MMS-
4070.
    (b) In addition to any other application requirements specified in 
the Notice, the following information is required on Form MMS-4070 at 
the time of application:
    (1) Name and address of the applicant, the location of the 
applicant's refinery or refineries, and disclosure of the applicant's 
affiliation with any other persons.
    (2) The capacity of the applicant's refineries in barrels of crude 
oil throughput per calendar day and a tabulation for the past 12 months 
of oil processed for each refinery, identified as to source (from own 
production or from other sources).
    (3) Identification of any Government royalty oil contracts under 
which the applicant is currently receiving royalty oil.
    (4) Identification of the locations (area/region and State) where 
the applicant proposes to purchase royalty oil, the volume of oil 
requested, and the specific refineries in which the oil will be refined.
    (5) A certification from the applicant that it is an eligible 
refiner for the purchase of Government royalty oil, as defined in 
Sec. 208.2 of this part.
[52 FR 41913, Oct. 30, 1987, as amended at 58 FR 64901, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 208.7  Determination of eligibility.

    (a) The MMS will examine each application and may request additional 
information if the information in the application is inadequate. An 
application received after the close of the application period will be 
rejected. If additional information is requested by MMS, it must be 
received by the time specified or the application will be rejected.
    (b) After the close of the application period and the receipt of any 
additional requested information, MMS will determine which applicants 
may participate in the royalty oil sale and the quantity of royalty oil 
which each applicant is authorized to purchase.
    (c) When applications are filed by two or more eligible refiners for 
the same royalty oil, the oil will be allocated among such applicants on 
an equitable basis as determined by MMS. Preference eligible refiners 
will be given priority in the allocation procedures in sales and 
subsequent reallocations of royalty oil.
    (d) No eligible refiner shall be awarded contracts for volumes of 
royalty oil that, when added to volumes of other Federal royalty oil 
being received, are in excess of 60 percent of the combined refinery 
capacity of that refiner.
    (e) The MMS may exclude any section 6 lease from a royalty oil sale.
    (f) If two or more eligible refiners are related through common 
ownership or control or otherwise affiliated, only one of them shall be 
entitled to an allotment of royalty oil from a specific sale.
    (g) Any applicant whose refinery is not in operation during the 60-
day period prior to the date of the royalty oil sale shall not be 
entitled to participate in the sale unless such applicant self-certifies 
and demonstrates to the satisfaction of MMS that it will begin 
operations by the first month in which oil becomes available under a 
royalty oil contract. If operations do not begin by that month, MMS will 
terminate the contract.
    (h) Applicants or purchasers that have delinquent balances with MMS 
as of the date of a royalty oil sale or subsequent reallocation will not 
be allowed to participate in that sale or reallocation. If a person 
which is controlled by, in control of, under common control with, or 
otherwise affiliated with an applicant or purchaser has such delinquent 
balances, the applicant or purchaser will not be allowed to participate 
in a royalty oil sale or reallocation. To the extent a purchaser or 
affiliated person has appealed a billing and posted a surety instrument 
in accordance with the contract terms and applicable MMS regulations or 
other law, the balance shall not be considered delinquent.
    (i) A purchaser must meet the eligibility criteria on the date of 
contract issuance. However, a change in a purchaser's eligibility status 
during the term of the contract will not affect the

[[Page 143]]

purchaser's right to continue that contract until its term expires, 
including any extensions thereof.
[52 FR 41913, Oct. 30, 1987, as amended at 58 FR 64901, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 208.8  Transportation and delivery.

    (a) The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from onshore leases to the 
purchaser at a point on or adjacent to the lease pursuant to the terms 
of the lease. If the purchaser does not have access to its onshore 
royalty oil entitlement at facilities on or adjacent to the lease, the 
operator of the lease must designate an alternate delivery point at no 
additional cost to the purchaser or the Government. The purchaser must 
have physical access to the oil at the alternate delivery point and such 
point must be approved by MMS.
    (b) The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from section 8 offshore 
leases issued after September 1969 at a delivery point to be designated 
by MMS. The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from section 8 offshore 
leases issued before October 1969 or from section 6 leases at a delivery 
point to be designated by the lessee. If the delivery point is on or 
immediately adjacent to the lease, the royalty oil will be delivered 
without cost to the Federal Government as an undivided portion of 
production in marketable condition at pipeline connections or other 
facilities provided by the lessee, unless other arrangements are 
approved by MMS. If the delivery point is not on or immediately adjacent 
to the lease, MMS will reimburse the lessee for the reasonable cost of 
transportation to such point in an amount not to exceed the 
transportation allowance determined pursuant to 30 CFR part 206. The MMS 
will include such transportation costs in the price charged for the oil 
taken in kind to reflect the value of the oil at the delivery point. 
Arrangements for delivery of the royalty oil from, or exchange of the 
oil at, the delivery point, and related transportation costs, are the 
responsibility of the purchaser of the royalty oil. In addition, quality 
differentials between the royalty oil to which a purchaser is entitled 
and the oil which is made available at the delivery point are matters to 
be resolved between the purchaser and the operator.
    (c) When the purchaser has physical access to the royalty oil at the 
delivery point, the lessee shall deliver such oil in marketable 
condition at pipeline connections or other facilities designated by MMS. 
If the lessee is unable to provide the royalty portion of actual 
production from the lease, the lessee must provide crude oil to the 
purchaser which is equivalent in volume or value to the royalty oil to 
which the purchaser is entitled. The lessee will deliver the royalty oil 
to the purchaser during normal operating hours and in reasonable 
quantities and intervals. The lessee will make available and the 
purchaser will accept delivery of the royalty oil entitlement no later 
than the last day of the calendar month immediately following the 
calendar month in which the oil was produced. Failure to accept 
deliveries shall constitute grounds for the termination of the contract.
    (d) Upon termination of deliveries under a royalty oil contract, the 
transportation allowance and delivery point designation authorized by 
this section no longer will remain in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 208.9  Agreements.

    (a) A purchaser must submit to MMS two copies of any written third-
party agreements, or two copies of a full written explanation of any 
oral third-party agreements, relating to the method and costs of 
delivery of royalty oil, or crude oil exchanged for the royalty oil, 
from the point of delivery under the contract to the purchaser's 
refinery. In addition, the purchaser must submit copies of agreements 
pertaining to quality differentials which may occur between leases and 
delivery points.
    (b) A purchaser may not sell royalty oil which it purchases pursuant 
to this part except for purposes of an exchange for other crude oil on a 
volume or equivalent value basis.
    (c) Royalty oil purchased under this part, or crude oil received in 
exchange for such royalty oil, must be processed into refined petroleum 
products in the purchaser's refinery.

[[Page 144]]


<R05>
Sec. 208.10  Notices.

    (a) The MMS shall notify each operator, by certified mail, of the 
Secretary's decision to take royalty oil in kind. This notice shall be 
mailed at least 45 days in advance of the effective date of delivery and 
will specify delivery points for offshore oil for OCS leases issued 
after September 1969.
    (b) Deliveries of royalty oil may be partially terminated only with 
the written approval of the Director, MMS.
    (c) Before terminating the delivery of royalty oil taken in kind, 
MMS, if possible, will notify each operator by certified mail of the 
change in requirements at least 30 days in advance of the effective 
date.
    (d) After MMS notification that royalty oil will be taken in kind, 
the operator shall be responsible for notifying each working interest on 
the Federal lease. As soon as practicable after the date of each royalty 
oil sale, MMS will publish in the Federal Register a notice of the 
leases from which royalty oil will be taken, the purchasers of the 
royalty oil, and the leases from which royalty oil deliveries will be 
discontinued on terminated contracts.
    (e) A purchaser cannot transfer, assign, or sell its rights or 
interest in a royalty oil contract without written approval of the 
Director, MMS. If the purchaser changes ownership or its assets are sold 
or liquidated for any reason, it cannot transfer, assign, or sell its 
rights or interest in the royalty oil contract without written approval 
of the Director, MMS. Without express written consent from MMS for a 
change in ownership, the royalty oil contract shall be terminated. The 
successor company must meet the definition of an eligible refiner in 
Sec. 208.2 of this part for MMS to consider assignment of the royalty 
oil contract.


<R05>
Sec. 208.11  Surety requirements.

    (a) The eligible purchaser, prior to execution of the contract, 
shall furnish an ``MMS-specified surety instrument,'' in an amount equal 
to the estimated value of royalty oil that could be taken by the 
purchaser in a 99-day period, plus related administrative charges. The 
MMS may require the purchaser to increase the amount of the surety 
instrument when necessary to protect the Government's interest or may 
allow the purchaser to decrease the amount of the surety instrument 
where necessary to further the purposes of the Royalty-in-Kind Program.
    (b) If a letter of credit is furnished as the surety instrument, it 
must be effective for a 9-month period beginning the first day the 
royalty oil contract is effective, with a clause providing for automatic 
renewal monthly for a new 9-month period. The purchaser or its surety 
company may elect not to renew the letter of credit at any monthly 
anniversary date, but must notify MMS of its intent not to renew at 
least 30 days prior to the anniversary date. The MMS may grant the 
purchaser 45 days to obtain a new surety instrument. If no replacement 
surety instrument is provided, MMS will terminate the contract effective 
at least 6 months prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit. 
Notwithstanding the above provisions, the letter of credit also may 
contain a clause providing for automatic termination 6 months after the 
royalty oil contract terminates. If a certificate of deposit is 
furnished as the surety instrument, it must be effective for the life of 
the contract plus 6 months after the royalty oil contract terminates.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, an ``MMS-specified surety 
instrument'' means either: an MMS-specified surety bond, an MMS-
specified irrevocable letter of credit, or a financial institution book-
entry certificate of deposit.
    (d) The ``MMS-specified surety instrument'' shall be in a form 
specified by MMS instructions or approved by MMS. A bond must be issued 
by a qualified surety company that has been approved by the Department 
of the Treasury. An irrevocable letter of credit or a certificate of 
deposit must be from a financial institution acceptable to MMS. The MMS 
will use a bank rating service to determine whether a financial 
institution has an acceptable rating to provide a surety instrument 
deemed adequate to indemnify the Government from loss or damage.
    (e) All surety instruments must be in a form acceptable to MMS and 
must include such other specific requirements

[[Page 145]]

as MMS may require adequately to protect the Government's interests.
[58 FR 64901, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 208.12  Payment requirements.

    (a) All payments to MMS by a purchaser of royalty oil will be due on 
the date and at the location specified in the contract, or, if there is 
no contractual provision, as specified by MMS. The purchaser shall 
tender all payments to MMS in accordance with 30 CFR 218.51. Payments 
made by a payor pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section and Sec. 208.13 also shall be tendered in accordance with 30 CFR 
218.51.
    (b)(1) Payments from a purchaser of royalty oil not received by MMS 
when due, or that portion of the payment less than the full amount due, 
will be subject to a late payment charge equivalent to an interest 
assessment on the amount past due for the number of days that the 
payment is late at the underpayment rate applicable under section 6621 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (2) The MMS may assess interest to a payor for any underpayments 
which are the result of the payor's late or underreporting, or for 
adjustments reported by the payor, or made as a result of audit, 
reconciliation, or other procedures. The interest for late payment and 
underpayment will be assessed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54.
    (c) If payment for royalty oil is not received by the due date 
specified in the contract, a notice of nonreceipt will be sent to the 
purchaser by certified mail. If payment is not received by MMS within 15 
days from the date of such notice, MMS may cancel the contract and 
collect under the MMS-specified surety instrument. See Sec. 208.11.
    (d) If the purchaser disagrees with the amount of payment due, it 
must pay the amount due as computed by MMS, unless the purchaser appeals 
the amount and posts an MMS-specified surety instrument pursuant to the 
provisions of 30 CFR part 243. The MMS may, at its discretion, waive the 
appeal surety requirements if it determines that the contract surety 
instrument is sufficient protection for an amount under appeal.
[52 FR 41913, Oct. 30, 1987, as amended at 64901, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 208.13  Reporting requirements.

    If MMS underbills a purchaser under a royalty oil contract because 
of a payor's underreporting or failure to report on Form MMS-2014 
pursuant to 30 CFR 210.52, the payor will be liable for payment of such 
underbilled amounts plus interest if they are unrecoverable from the 
purchaser or the surety instrument related to the contract.
[58 FR 64902, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 208.14  Civil and criminal penalties.

    Failure to abide by the regulations in this part may result in civil 
and criminal penalties being levied on that person as specified in 
sections 109 and 110 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act 
of 1982, 30 U.S.C. 1719-20, and regulations at 30 CFR part 241. Civil

inadequate or erroneous information submitted by the payor. For purposes 
of this section, inadequate or erroneous information is defined as:
    (1) Absent or incorrect payor assigned document number, required to

Affairs Agency/Area office and the word ``allotted'' or the tribe name 
on payment documents remitted to MMS for an Indian tribe or allottee. If 
the payment is made by EFT, the payor must identify the tribe/allottee 
on the EFT message by a pre-established five digit code.

Sec. 218.42  Cross-lease netting in calculation of late-payment interest.

    (a) Interest due from a payor on any underpayment for any Federal 
mineral lease or leases (onshore or offshore) and on any Indian tribal 
mineral lease or leases for any production month shall not be reduced by 
offsetting against that underpayment any overpayment made by the payor 
on any other lease or leases, except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section. Interest due from a payor or any underpayment on any 
Indian allotted lease shall not be reduced by offsetting against any 
overpayment on any other Indian allotted lease under any circumstances.
    (b) Royalties attributed to production from a lease or leases which 
should have been attributed to production from a different lease or 
leases may be offset to determine whether and to what extent an 
underpayment exists on which interest is due if the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The error results from attributing and reporting an equal volume 
of production, produced from a lease or leases during a particular 
production month, to a different lease or leases from which it was not 
produced for the same or another production month;
    (2) The payor is the same for the lease or leases to which 
production was attributed and the lease or leases to which it should 
have been attributed;
    (3) The payor submits production reports, pipeline allocation 
reports, or other similar documentary evidence pertaining to the 
specific production involved which verifies the correct production 
information;
    (4) The lessor is the same for the leases involved (in the case of 
Indian tribal leases, the same tribe is the lessor); and
    (5) The ultimate recipients of any royalty or other lease revenues 
under

[[Page 167]]

any applicable permanent indefinite appropriations are the same for, and 
receive the same percentage of revenue from, the leases.
    (c) If MMS assesses late-payment interest and the payor asserts that 
some or all of the interest assessed is not owed pursuant to the 
exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the burden is on 
the payor to demonstrate that the exception applies in the specific 
circumstances of the case.
    (d) The exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section shall 
not operate to relieve any payor of liability imposed by statute or 
regulation for erroneous reporting.

Sec. 218.53  Recoupment of overpayments on Indian mineral leases.

    (a) Whenever an overpayment is made under an Indian oil and gas 
lease, a payor may recoup the overpayment through a recoupment on Form 
MMS-2014 against the current month's royalties or other revenues owed on 
the same lease. However, for any month a payor may not recoup more than 
50 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under 
an individual allotted lease or more than 100 percent of the royalties 
or other revenues owed in that month under a tribal lease.
    (b) With written permission authorized by tribal statute or 
resolution, a payor may recoup an overpayment against royalties or other 
revenues owed in that month under other leases for which that tribe is 
the lessor. A copy of the tribe's written permission must be furnished 
to MMS pursuant to instructions for reporting recoupments in the MMS 
``Oil and Gas Payor Handbook.'' See 30 CFR 210.53. Recouping 
overpayments on one allotted lease from royalties paid to another 
allotted lease is specifically prohibited.

    (d) The MMS Director or his/her designee may order any payor to not 
recoup any amount for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary 
for MMS to review the nature and amount of any claimed overpayment.

Sec. 218.57  Providing information and claiming rewards.

    (a) General. (1) If a person has any information that could lead to 
the recovery of royalty or other payments owed to the United States with 
respect to any oil and gas lease on Federal lands or the Outer 
Continental Shelf, such information may be provided to the Minerals 
Management Service (MMS) in accordance with this paragraph. The MMS is 
authorized, under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 
(FOGRMA), 30 U.S.C. 1723, to pay a reward for information with respect 
to Federal oil and gas leases. Funds must be appropriated before payment 
of any reward. Criteria and procedures covering claims for and payment 
of rewards are provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
    (2) If a person has any information he or she believes would be 
valuable to MMS, that person (``informant'') should submit the 
information in writing, in the form of a letter, mailed or delivered in 
person to the Director, Minerals Management Service, Department of the 
Interior, 18th and C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, or to the 
Director's designated representative. Although written communications 
are preferred, oral information will be accepted.
    (3) The informant should provide all data he or she has with respect 
to royalty or other payments owed. The information provided should 
include: identification of the alleged debtor; the source of the 
informant's knowledge of royalties or other payments owed; the date, if 
known, of the indebtedness; and any other information that could be

[[Page 171]]

used to establish indebtedness. All information received by MMS from 
persons providing information will be considered ``highly confidential'' 
and will not be disclosed to any individual except on a ``need to know'' 
basis in the performance of official duties.
    (b) Claim for reward. (1) Any informant who provides information 
that could lead to the recovery of royalty or other payments may file a 
claim for reward unless the person is an officer or employee of the 
United States, an officer or employee of a State or Indian tribe acting 
pursuant to a cooperative agreement or delegation under the FOGRMA, or 
any person acting pursuant to a contract authorized by the FOGRMA.
    (2) A claim for reward is not acceptable if filed on behalf of a 
claimant by his or her agent under power of attorney. However, an agent 
may provide MMS with information for an unidentified informant, to be 
evaluated and used by MMS as it deems appropriate. The informant's 
identity ultimately must be disclosed if the informant intends to file a 
claim for reward so that MMS can report the reward as taxable income to 
the Internal Revenue Service. An executor, administrator, or other legal 
representative of a deceased informant may file a claim on behalf of 
such deceased informant if, prior to his or her death, the informant was 
eligible to file a claim under this section. The representative must 
attach to the claim evidence of authority to file it.
    (3) To file a claim for reward the informant must:
    (i) Notify the Director, MMS, or the person to whom the information 
was reported, that he/she is claiming a reward.
    (ii) Request an ``Application for Reward for Original Information'' 
(Form MMS-4280). This form provides for information to enable MMS to 
determine and pay rewards, to control reward applications, and to report 
a claimant's reward as taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service.
    (iii) File a claim for reward by completing Form MMS-4280, sign it 
with his or her true name, and mail or deliver it in person to the 
Director or to the Director's designated representative. If the 
informant provided the information in person, the claim should include 
the name and title of the person to whom the information was reported 
and the date that it was reported.
    (4) If the informant used an identity other than his or true name 
when the information was originally reported, the person should attach 
proof to the claim that he or she is the person who gave the 
information. The MMS does not disclose the identity of its informants to 
unauthorized persons.
    (c) Basis for rejection of claims. No reward will be paid to a 
claimant:
    (1) Where the information originally furnished was deemed unworthy 
of initiating an investigation, but at some later date the records of 
the lessee are examined without reference to the information furnished. 
The claim will be rejected on the basis that the information did not 
cause the investigation nor did it, in itself, result in any recovery.
    (2) For information that would have been discovered during the 
normal course of an audit or investigation.
    (3) Unless the informant's true identity is disclosed.
    (4) Until after all of the royalties, penalties, or other payments 
discovered to be owed as a result of information provided are collected 
and no longer subject to dispute.
    (5) Unless funds are appropriated for the payment of rewards.
    (d) Basis for allowance of claims. (1) The value of the information 
furnished in relation to the facts developed by the investigation will 
be taken into account in determining whether a reward shall be paid and, 
if so, the amount thereof. Information must be voluntarily given and 
upon the informant's own initiative to warrant the allowance of a 
reward. Information secured by representatives of MMS from witnesses and 
others in the course of their investigative activities does not 
constitute a basis for reward.
    (2) In determining whether a reward will be allowed and, if so, the 
amount thereof, consideration will be given to any corresponding 
adjustment(s) which will result in potential savings to the lessee for 
other leases owned by the lessee or an affiliate of the lessee. An

[[Page 172]]

example of such an adjustment is a reduction in royalty payment on a 
different lease as the result of a revised allocation under a 
unitization or communitization agreement or from an offshore pipeline 
system. Rewards otherwise allowable will be reduced or rejected by 
reason of such offsetting adjustments.
    (3) If several claims filed by one informant are considered in one 
recommendation, the reward, if any, may be allowed on one claim and the 
others may be closed by reference.
    (4) Where an informant has provided information and filed a claim 
for reward with respect to royalty reports of one lessee for several 
leases, no reward will be granted with respect to an individual lease 
which has been examined until examination of all leases involved has 
been completed. Because the possibility exists that adjustments made to 
the reports for the open leases may result in offsetting adjustments, no 
reward will be allowed until the overall results of the information are 
evaluated.
    (e) Amount and payment of reward. (1) The Director, MMS will 
determine whether a reward will be paid and, if so, the amount thereof. 
In making this decision, the information provided will be evaluated in 
relation to the facts developed by the resulting investigation. Claims 
for reward will be paid in proportion to the value of information 
furnished voluntarily and on the informant's own initiative with respect 
to recovered royalties or other payments. The amount of reward will be 
determined as follows:
    (i) For specific and responsible information that caused the 
investigation and resulted in recovery, the reward will be 10 percent of 
the first $75,000 recovered, 5 percent of the next $25,000, and 1 
percent of any additional recovery. The total reward cannot exceed 
$100,000.
    (ii) For information that caused the examination and was of value in 
determining royalty or other payments due, although not specific, and 
for information that was a direct factor in recovering royalty or other 
payments, the reward will be 5 percent of the first $75,000 recovered, 
2\1/2\ percent of the next $25,000, and \1/2\ percent of any additional 
recovery. The total reward cannot exceed $100,000.
    (iii) For information that caused the investigation but was of no 
value in determining royalty or other payments due, the reward will be 1 
percent of the first $75,000 recovered and \1/2\ percent of any 
additional recovery. The total reward cannot exceed $100,000.
    (2) Rewards will be paid only if moneys are appropriated for that 
purpose. Subject to appropriations, payments will be made as soon as 
possible after collection of the amounts owed by the lessee, and after 
those amounts no longer are subject to dispute by the payor. The reward 
payment to an informant will be net of Federal and State income tax in 
accordance with withholding guidelines of the Internal Revenue Service 
and the applicable State(s).
    (3) A decision by the Director, MMS, either denying a reward or 
establishing the amount of any reward is a final departmental action and 
may not be appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals in accordance 
with the provisions of 30 CFR part 290.

operations, no payment of rental or minimum royalty shall be required 
for or during the period of suspension.
    (b) The lessee shall not be relieved of the obligation to pay

suspension if the Regional Supervisor:
    (1) Under the provisions of 30 CFR 250.10(a) approves, at the 
request of a lessee, the suspension of operations or production, or 
both, or

Sec. 218.155  Method of payment.

    (a) Payment of royalties and rentals. With the exception of first-
year rental, the payor shall tender all payments in accordance with 
Sec. 218.51 of this part. First-year rental shall be paid in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Payment of the one-fifth bonus bid amount. (1) Each lease bid 
must include a payment for the one-fifth bonus bid deposit amount unless 
the bidder is otherwise directed by the Secretary. Further instructions 
on how to make payment with the bid will be included in the notice of 
each lease offering. EFT may be used as a method of payment for the one-
fifth bonus bid amount.
    (2) Beginning with lease offerings held after February 1, 1984, the 
one-fifth bonus amount received from a high bidder shall be deposited 
into an escrow account created pursuant to an agreement between the 
Departments of the Interior and Treasury, pending acceptance or 
rejection of the bid. The one-fifth bonus funds will be invested in 
public debt securities. Investment of this amount by the U.S. Government

[[Page 176]]

does not indicate acceptance of the bid. The one-fifth bonus checks 
submitted with bids other than the highest valid bid shall be returned 
to respective bidders after bids are opened, recorded, and ranked. 
Return of such checks will not affect the status, validity, or ranking 
of bids. The one-fifth bonus bid amount received from any high bidder 
and held by the Government pending acceptance or rejection, will be 
returned with actual interest earned, if the bid is subsequently 
rejected. The interest accrued during the period held in the account 
pending acceptance or rejection of the bid will accrue to the Government 
when the bid is accepted.
    (c) Payment of the four-fifths bonus bid amount and the first year's 
rental. Payment shall be made to MMS by EFT unless otherwise directed by 
the Secretary. The payment by EFT via the FRCS must be received by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York no later than noon, eastern standard 
time, on the 11th business day after receipt of the lease forms by the 
successful bidder. A ``business day'' is considered to be a day on which 
the OCS regional office issuing the lease is open for business. The 
lease will not be executed by the appropriate MMS official until payment 
is received. Failure to remit by EFT or as directed by the Secretary 
within the time specified above will result in forfeiture of the one-
fifth bonus bid amount and the lease will not be executed by the 
appropriate MMS official. Payors will not be held responsible for late 
payment due to actions beyond their control, such as mechanical or 
systems failure of FRCS or FDS. Payors will be held responsible for 
incorrect actions of their bank which result in late payments. A 2-day 
grace period will be allowed to make up a deficient payment, but a late 
payment charge will be assessed for this late payment and a penalty will 
also be assessed if appropriate. Late payment charges will be assessed 
in accordance with Subpart B of this part.
    (d) General. (1) Payors using the appropriate means of payment (EFT, 
check, etc.) may pay for multiple lease obligations with a single 
remittance but must ensure that the payment complies with subpart B of 
this part and the remittance advice adequately identifies the single 
payment. The format to be used for such identification will be provided 
by the MMS Accounting Center.
    (2) Where to pay.
    (3) The MMS mailing addresses for payments to MMS are specified in 
Sec. 218.51 (f)(1) and (f)(2).
    (4) Payments received at the MMS addresses after 4 p.m. mountain 
time are considered received the following business day.
    (e) Miscellaneous payments. Payments shall be made to the manager of 
the appropriate Outer Continental Shelf field office by cash, check or 
bank draft payable to ``Department of the Interior--MMS'' for 
miscellaneous payments such as:
    (1) Pipeline rights-of-way application filing fees and rentals, 
pipeline accessory site rentals and application fees, and other related 
costs.
    (2) Filing and approval fees for transfers of interest in leases.

Sec. 218.202  Late payment or underpayment charges.

    (a) The failure to make timely or proper payment of any monies due 
pursuant to leases and contracts subject to these rules will result in 
the collection by MMS of the full amount past due plus a late payment 
charge. Exceptions to this late payment charge may be granted when 
estimated payments on minerals production have already been made timely 
and otherwise in accordance with instructions provided by MMS to the 
operator/lessee. However, late payment charges assessed with respect to 
any Indian lease, permit, or contract shall be collected and paid to the 
Indian or tribe to which the amount overdue is owed.
    (b) Late payment charges will be assessed on any late payment or 
underpayment from the date that the payment was due until the date that 
the payment was received at the MMS addresses specified in 218.51(f)(1) 
and (f)(2). Payments received at the specified MMS addresses after 4 
p.m. mountain time are considered received the following business day.
    (c) The interest charge on late payments shall be at the 
underpayment rate established by section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal 
Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2).
    (d) Interest will be charged only on the amount of the payment not 
received by the designated due date. Interest will be charged only for 
the number of days the payment is late.
    (e) Late payment charges apply to all underpayments and payments 
received after the date due. These charges include production, minimum, 
or advance royalties; assessments for liquidated damages; or any other 
payments, fees, or assessments that an operator/lessee is required to 
pay by a specified date. The failure to pay past due payments, including 
late payment charges, will result in the initiation of other enforcement 
proceedings.
    (f) An overpayment on a lease or leases may be offset against an 
underpayment on a different lease or leases to determine a net 
underpayment on which interest is due pursuant to conditions specified 
in Sec. 218.42.

Sec. 218.203  Recoupment of overpayments on Indian mineral leases.

    (a) Whenever an overpayment is made under an Indian solid mineral 
lease, a payor may recoup the overpayment through a recoupment on Form 
MMS-2014 against the current month's royalties or other revenues owed on 
the same lease. However, for any month a payor may not recoup more than 
50 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under 
an individual allotted lease or more than 100 percent of the royalties 
or other revenues owed in that month under a tribal lease.
    (b) With written permission authorized by tribal statute or 
resolution, a payor may recoup an overpayment against royalties or other 
revenues owed in that month under other leases for which that tribe is 
the lessor. A copy of the tribe's written permission must be furnished 
to MMS pursuant to instructions for reporting recoupments in the ``AFS 
Payor Handbook--Solid Minerals.'' See 30 CFR 210.204. Recouping

Sec. 218.302  Late payment or underpayment charges.

    (a) The failure to make timely or proper payment of any monies due 
pursuant to leases and contracts subject to these regulations will 
result in the collection by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the 
full amount past due plus a late payment charge. Exceptions to this late 
payment charge may be granted when estimated payments on minerals 
production have already been made timely and otherwise in accordance 
with the instructions provided by the MMS to the payor.
    (b) Late payment charges will be assessed on any late payment or 
underpayment from the date that the payment was due until the date that 
the payment was received at the MMS addresses specified in Sec. 218.51 
(f)(1) and (f)(2). Payments received at the specified MMS addresses 
after 4 p.m. Mountain Time are considered received the following 
business day.
    (c) The interest charge on late payments shall be at the 
underpayment rate established by section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal 
Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2).
    (d) Interest will be charged only on the amount of the payment not 
received by the designated due date. Interest will be charged only for 
the number of days the payment is late.
    (e) Late payment charges apply to all underpayments and payments 
received after the date due. These charges include production, minimum, 
and compensatory royalties; assessments for liquidated damages; 
administrative fees and payments by purchasers of royalty taken-in-kind; 
or any other payments, fees, or assessments that a lessee/operator/
payor/royalty taken-in-kind purchaser is required to pay by a specified 
date. The failure to pay past due payments, including late payment 
charges, will result in the initiation of other enforcement proceedings.
    (f) An overpayment on a lease or leases may be offset against an 
underpayment on a different lease or leases to determine a net 
underpayment on which interest is due pursuant to conditions specified 
in Sec. 218.42.

    For purposes of this part 220:
    Allowance for capital recovery means the amount calculated according 
to procedures specified in Sec. 220.020. This amount allows a premium 
for risk initially undertaken by the lessee and a return on investment 
made during the capital recovery period. It is provided in lieu of 
interest on equipment and materiel charged to the NPSL capital account.
    Capital recovery period means the period of time that begins on the 
date of issuance of the NPSL and ends on the last day of the month 
during which the sooner of the following occurs:
    (1) The lessee completes the last well on the first platform 
specified in the development and production plan originally approved by 
the MMS, with any approved amendments thereto, and installation of 
wellhead equipment. In the event the last well is dry, then the capital 
recovery period shall be deemed to have ended with the determination 
that the last well is non-productive;
    (2) The balance in the NPSL capital account changes from a debit 
balance to a credit balance; or
    (3) The lessee, at his election, chooses to terminate the capital

different maximum percentage.
    (6) Charges for expenses incurred under paragraphs (b)(2) through 
(b)(5) of this section may be made to NPSL accounts on a ``when and as

assessment method is used, it shall be based upon the lessee's actual 
cost experience expressed as a percentage of costs chargeable under 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) and (b)(2) of this section. Under either 
method the lessee's own cost of administering the plans and paying the 
salaries and benefits defined in this paragraph shall be excluded. In

and contract services of technical personnel) that are entirely 
performed in the NPSL project area and benefit the NPSL operations and 
operations on other tracts must be allocated among all tracts benefited 
and only that portion representing services benefiting the NPSL tract 
charged to NPSL operations.
    (3) Contract services (including professional consulting services 
and contract services of technical personnel) that are performed at 
sites outside the NPSL project area may be charged to NPSL operations 
only if:
    (i) The contracted services charged to the NPSL operations benefit 
only the NPSL tract or support NPSL operations;
    (ii) The contract under which such services are provided deals 
exclusively with services benefiting the NPSL tract or NPSL operations, 
or the costs of the contract services which are applicable to the NPSL 
tract or NPSL operations are separately and specifically identified in 
the contract; and
    (iii) Services specified in the contract relate to the resolution of 
specific technical problems confronting NPSL operations, or specific 
engineering design problems related to equipment or facilities required 
for NPSL operations.
    (4) The cost of any contract service related to research and 
development is specifically excluded, as are contract services calling 
for feasibility studies not directly related to specific engineering 
design problems or alternatives for equipment and facilities required by 
NPSL operations.
    (f) Legal expenses. Expense of handling, investigating and settling 
litigation or claims, discharging of liens, payments of judgments and 
amounts paid for settlement of claims incurred in or resulting from NPSL 
operations, or necessary to protect or recover the NPSL property are 
allowable, except those costs listed in Sec. 220.013(f) as unallowable. 
This includes the salaries and wages of lessee's legal staff and the 
expense of outside attorneys who are assigned to matters described in 
this paragraph if supported by adequate time records showing the nature 
of the

[[Page 185]]

matter, its direct relationship to NPSL operations, and the hours spent 
on the matter.
    (g) Rental of equipment and facilities furnished by lessee. (1)(i) 
The NPSL capital account shall be charged for the use of equipment and 
facilities owned by a lessee that are proper and necessary for NPSL 
operations, including shore base and offshore facilities and pipelines 
from the tract to shore base production facilities, and that are not 
NPSL property. Rental charges shall be made at rates based upon actual 
costs of acquisition, construction, and operation. Such rates may 
include labor, the cost of setting up and dismantling equipment, 
maintenance, repairs, other operating expenses, insurance, taxes, 
depreciation (calculated using a method consistent with generally 
accepted accounting principles, consistently applied) and a return on 
the remaining undepreciated basis not to exceed 8 percent per year, 
except that the Director may from time to time establish a different 
maximum percentage. Any cost of acquiring real property in excess of 
that reasonably required to support the facilities furnished for NPSL 
operations shall not be included in the costs used to establish these 
rates. Rates charged shall not exceed average commercial rates for 
equipment and facilities of similar nature and capability currently 
prevailing in the vicinity of the NPSL project area.
    (ii) The term ``equipment and facilities'' is used in the broad 
sense to include equipment that may be mobile or semimobile and also 
installations that may be semipermanent or permanent in nature. Such 
equipment and facilities listed below shall be charged on the basis 
indicated.

Equipment and facilities that are not listed shall be charged on a basis 
consistent with the nature of the use.
    (2) In lieu of charges in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the 
lessee may elect to use average commercial rates prevailing in the 
vicinity of the NPSL project area less 20 percent. For automotive 
equipment, the lessee may elect to use rates established by the 
Director. For other equipment for which no commercial rate exists, the 
lessee shall submit the basis for determining such costs to the Director 
for approval.
    (h) Damages and losses to NPSL property. All costs necessary for the 
repair or replacement of NPSL property made necessary because of damages 
or losses incurred by fire, flood, storm, theft, accident, or other 
causes not covered by insurance, except those resulting from lessee's 
negligence or willful misconduct may be charged to the NPSL capital 
account. Any settlement received from an insurance carrier should be 
credited to NPSL operations when received.
    (i) Taxes. All taxes, except income taxes, profit share payments, 
and taxes based upon income, that are assessed or levied upon or in 
connection with NPSL operations and which have been paid by the lessee 
are allowable. Allowed taxes shall include, but not be limited to, 
production, severance, excise, ad valorem, and mineral taxes.

[[Page 186]]

    (j) Insurance. (1) Net premiums paid for insurance required to be 
carried for NPSL operations are allowable. For NPSL operations in which 
the lessee may act as self-insurer for Workmen's Compensation and 
Employer's Liability, the lessee may include the risk under its self-
insurance program in providing coverage under State and Federal laws and 
charge NPSL operations at lessee's cost not to exceed manual rates.
    (2) NPSL operations shall be credited for all reimbursements for 
costs of damage to NPSL property or personal injury. Reimbursements for 
damaged NPSL property shall be credited as follows:
    (i) If the damaged NPSL property is replaced or repaired, to the 
NPSL capital account charged for the cost of replacement or repair; or
    (ii) If the damaged NPSL property is not replaced or repaired, to 
the NPSL capital account except that if the cost of the property 
originally qualified for the allowance for capital recovery in 
Sec. 220.020, the credit shall be calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 220.021(a)(3).
    (k) Communications. Costs of leasing, acquiring, installing, 
operating, repairing and maintaining communication systems, including 
radio, microwave facilities, and computer production controls for the 
NPSL operations are allowable. If communication facilities systems 
serving the NPSL tract serve operations and/or facilities outside the 
NPSL project area, charges to NPSL operations shall be made as provided 
in paragraph (g) of this section or shall be allocated to NPSL 
operations in accordance with Sec. 220.014.
    (l) Ecological and environmental. Costs incurred in the NPSL project 
area as a result of statutory regulations for archeological and 
geophysical surveys relative to identification and protection of 
cultural resources and other environmental or ecological surveys 
required by the Bureau of Land Management or other regulatory authority, 
may be charged to the NPSL capital account. Also, the costs to provide 
or have available pollution containment and removal equipment, including 
payments to organizations and/or funds which provide equipment and/or 
assistance in the event of oil spills or other environmental damage are 
allowable. The costs of actual control and cleanup of oil spills and 
resulting responsibilities required by applicable laws and regulations 
are allowable, except that a charge shall not be allowed for any such 
costs attributable to the lessee's negligence or willful misconduct.
    (m) Dry or bottom hole contributions. The costs of dry or bottom 
hole contributions made to obtain information about the structure or 
other characteristics of the geology underlying the NPSL tract are 
allowable.
    (n) Abandonment costs. Actual costs incurred in the plugging of 
wells, dismantling of platforms and other facilities and in the 
restoration of the NPSL project area shall be charged to the NPSL 
capital account only when incurred (i.e., not on an accrual basis), 
except that costs incurred after the cessation of production shall not 
be charged to the NPSL capital account. Abandonment costs in excess of 
offsetting revenues shall not form the basis of any claim against the 
United States.
    (o) Other costs. Any other costs not covered in paragraphs (a)-(n) 
of this section and not disallowed by Sec. 220.013 that are incurred by 
the lessee in the necessary and proper conduct of NPSL operation and are 
approved by the Director, are allowable. Approval of a plan of 
development and production for the NPSL tract by the Director shall be 
considered sufficient approval for these other costs provided they are 
separately identified in said plan of development and production. Such 
separate identification shall note the nature of these other costs and 
may include an estimate of their magnitude. Any cost approvals under 
this paragraph for which the specific amounts have not been itemized are 
presumed to be approved provided they fall within the limits for a 
prudent operator. Approval of costs under this paragraph shall be 
approval solely for the purposes of determining allowable costs and 
shall not preclude a subsequent adjustment at audit of the amount of 
such costs.
    (p) Other credits. Credit shall be given to the NPSL capital 
account, depending on when it is incurred, for NPSL property leased or 
used in non-NPSL operations, for the sale of information derived from 
test wells and G & G, and

[[Page 187]]

for any and all amounts earned or otherwise due lessee as a result of 
NPSL operations.

NPSL and non-NPSL operations in reasonable proportion to the beneficial 
or causal relationships which exist between a specific cost pool and the 
operations. That portion of a joint cost pool that may be allocated to 
NPSL operations is called an allocable joint cost.
    (b) The following allocation principles apply in allocating joint 
costs:
    (1) G & G. G & G shall be allocated on a line mile per tract basis.

<R05>
Sec. 220.015  Pricing of materiel purchases, transfers, and dispositions.

    (a)(1) Purchased materiel. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) 
of this section, materiel purchased for use in NPSL operations shall be 
charged to NPSL operations at the price paid, after deduction of any 
discounts received. Should any purchased materiel be defective or 
returned to a vendor for other reasons, the credit shall be allocated to 
NPSL operations when received by the lessee in accordance with 
Sec. 220.011(c)(3).
    (2) Transferred and disposal materiel. An item of materiel, which is 
acquired by the lessee for use in NPSL operations by means other than 
purchase or disposed of by any means, shall be priced according to this 
subparagraph:
    (i) Condition A (new) materiel. (A) Tubular goods, except line pipe, 
shall be priced at the current market price in effect on date of 
movement on a minimum carload or barge load weight basis, regardless of 
quantity transferred, equalized to the lowest published price ``free on 
board'' (f.o.b.) railway receiving point or recognized barge terminal 
nearest the NPSL tract where such materiel is normally available.
    (B) Line pipe. (1) Movement of less than 30,000 pounds shall be 
priced at the current price in effect at date of movement, as listed by 
a reliable supply store nearest the NPSL tract where such materiel is 
normally available.
    (2) Movement of 30,000 pounds or more shall be priced under the 
provisions for tubular goods pricing in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this 
section.
    (C) Other materiel shall be priced at the current price in effect at 
date of movement, as listed by a reliable supply store or f.o.b. railway 
receiving point nearest the NPSL tract where such materiel is normally 
available.
    (ii) Condition B (good used) materiel. Materiel in sound and 
serviceable condition and suitable for reuse without reconditioning:
    (A) Materiel transferred to the NPSL project area shall be priced at 
75 percent of current Condition A price.
    (B) Materiel transferred from the NPSL project area shall be priced:
    (1) At 75 percent of current Condition A price, if the materiel was 
originally charged to NPSL operations as Condition A materiel, or
    (2) At 65 percent of current Condition A price, if the materiel was 
originally charged to NPSL operations as Condition B materiel at 75 
percent of current Condition A price.
    (iii) Conditions C and D (other used) materiel--(A) Condition C. 
Materiel that is not in sound and serviceable condition and not suitable 
for its original function until after reconditioning shall be priced at 
50 percent of current Condition A price.

purposes but suitable for some other purpose shall be priced on a basis 
commensurate with its use and comparable with that of materiel normally 
used for such other purpose. If the materiel has no alternative use it 
should be priced at prevailing prices as scrap.
    (iv) Obsolete materiel. Materiel that is serviceable and usable for 
its original function and has a value less than Condition A, B, or C 
materiel may be valued at a price agreed to by the Director. Such price 
should be the equivalent of the value of the service rendered by such 
materiel.
    (b) Pricing conditions. (1) Loading and unloading costs shall be 
charged at a rate of 15 cents per hundred weight, or such other rate as 
may be set by the

[[Page 189]]

Director, on all tubular goods movements, in lieu of loading/unloading 
costs sustained, when the actual hauling costs of such tubular goods is 
equalized under provisions of Sec. 220.011(d).
    (2) Materiel involving erection costs shall be charged at the 
applicable percentage of the current knocked-down price of new materiel.

by the receiving party.


<R05>
Sec. 220.020  Calculation of the allowance for capital recovery.

    (a) For purposes of this section, the cost base for the allowance 
for capital recovery in a particular month shall consist of the sum of:
    (1) All allowable direct and allocable joint costs chargeable to the 
NPSL capital account during the month less any costs specified in 
Sec. 220.012(c); plus
    (2) The value of contract services chargeable to the NPSL capital 
account during the month pursuant to Sec. 220.011(e); plus
    (3) The capital recovery period overhead allowance, calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 220.012(a), that is chargeable to the NPSL capital 
account for the month; less
    (4) Production revenues and other credits received during the month.
    (b) If the cost base for a month is greater than zero (that is, if 
the sum of the charges specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of 
this section exceeds the value of production revenues and other 
credits), the allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated by 
multiplying the cost base by the capital recovery factor, and shall be 
debited to the NPSL capital account as specified in Sec. 220.021(b).
    (c) If the cost base for a month is less than zero, the allowance 
for capital recovery for the NPSL capital account shall be calculated by 
multiplying the resulting negative cost base by the capital recovery 
factor. The negative product of this calculation shall be debited to the 
NPSL capital account as specified in Sec. 220.021(b).
    (d) No allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated on the 
charges or credits related to any time period after the end of the 
capital recovery period.


<R05>
Sec. 220.021  Determination of net profit share base.

    (a) During each month of the lease term, the NPSL capital account 
shall be:
    (1) Debited with allowable direct and allocable joint costs;
    (2) Credited with an amount reflecting the production revenues for 
the month, calculated in accordance with Sec. 260.110(b) of this 
chapter.
    (3) Credited with amounts properly credited back to the NPSL capital 
account as specified in Sec. 220.011(p). Credits associated with charges 
to the NPSL capital account during the capital recovery period, however, 
shall first be increased by the value of the credit multiplied by the 
recovery factor, before crediting that sum to the NPSL capital account.
    (b) At the end of each month of the lease term during the capital 
recovery period:
    (1) The transactions specified in paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be made to the NPSL capital account.
    (2) The capital recovery period overhead allowance shall be 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 220.012(a) and debited to the NPSL 
capital account.
    (3) The allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 220.020 and the allowance debited (or the negative 
allowance debited, as appropriate) to the NPSL capital account. (A debit 
entry of a negative allowance for capital recovery shall have the same 
effect as a credit entry of the absolute value of the allowance for 
capital recovery.)
    (4) The balance in the NPSL capital account shall be calculated. If, 
as a result of the accounting transactions described in paragraphs (b) 
(1) through (3) of this section, there is a credit balance in the NPSL 
capital account, the capital recovery period will be considered 
terminated as of this month. The credit balance will be forwarded to the 
next month, which will be the first month for which a profit share 
payment is due.
    (c) At the end of each month of the lease term following the end of 
the capital recovery period:

[[Page 190]]

    (1) The transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall 
be made to the NPSL capital account.
    (2) An overhead allowance shall be calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 220.012(b) and debited to the NPSL capital account.
    (3) The balance in the NPSL capital account shall be calculated.
    (d) If, as a result of the accounting transactions described in 
paragraph (c) of this section, there is a credit balance in the NPSL 
capital account, this credit balance is the net profit share base for 
that month. The opening debit and credit balances in the NPSL capital 
account for any month following a month in which there is a credit 
balance in the NPSL capital account (except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(4)) of this section shall be zero.
    (e) If, as a result of the accounting transactions described in 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, there is a debit balance in the 
NPSL capital account, this debit balance shall be the opening debit 
balance in the NPSL capital account for the following month.
    (f) Any credit balance in the NPSL capital account shall become the 
net profit share base as described in this section. Any debit balance in 
the NPSL capital account shall be maintained only insofar as necessary 
for the determination of profit share payments. Such debit balance shall 
not represent a claim against the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 220.022  Calculation of net profit share payment.

    The net profit share payment shall be calculated by multiplying the 
net profit share base calculated in accordance with Sec. 220.021 by the 
net profit share rate. The net profit share payment shall be paid to the 
United States in accordance with Sec. 220.031.

Sec. 220.030  Maintenance of records.

    (a) Each lessee subject to this part 220 shall establish and 
maintain such records as are necessary to determine for each NPSL:
    (1) The volume and disposition of all oil and gas production saved, 
removed or sold for each month;

capital account;
    (4) The amount and description of all costs of acquisition, 
construction, and operation of equipment and facilities furnished by the

Such records shall include worksheets or other documents that indicate 
the method used to calculate the amount of each charge made under 
Sec. 220.011(g);
    (5) The cumulative balance of costs and credits to the NPSL capital 
account; and
    (6) The inventory of materiel.
    (b) The ledger cards showing the charges and credits to the NPSL

cessation of NPSL operations by the lessee. All other documents, 
journals and records shall be maintained for thirty-six months from the 
due date or date of mailing of the statement of account on an NPSL, 
whichever comes later, except that nothing in these regulations shall 
limit the time of investigation or the need to produce records when 
prima facie evidence of fraud or willful misconduct is obtained with 
respect to the government's interest in the NPSL.


<R05>
Sec. 220.031  Reporting and payment requirements.

[[Page 191]]

to the NPSL capital account, each lessee subject to this part 220 shall 
file a report for each NPSL, not later than 60 days following the end of 
each month, containing the following information for the month for which 
the report is filed:
    (1) The volume and disposition of all oil and gas production saved, 
removed or sold;
    (2) The production revenue;

the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, any net profit 
share payment due the United States for the period covered by the 
report.
    (d) Each lessee subject to this part 220 shall file a report not 
later than 90 days after each inventory is taken, reporting the 
controllable materiel on hand, acquired, transferred or used.
    (e) Each lessee subject to this part 220 shall file a final report, 
not later than 60 days following the cessation of production, together 
with the appropriate net profit share payment, indicating the remaining 
balance and costs and credits to the NPSL capital account for the

    (f) Reports required by this section shall be filed with the 
Director, either separately or as part of the reports that are currently 
filed.
    (g) Interest shall be calculated at the prevailing rate or rates as 
published in the Bulletin to the Department of the Treasury Fiscal 
Requirement Manual, in effect for the period or periods over which the 
net profit share payment is owed, compounded monthly, on the amount of a 
net profit share payment, from the due date (60 days following the end 
of each month for which the payment was due) of a net profit share 
payment until such payment is received by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 220.032  Inventories.

    (a) The lessee is responsible for NPSL materiel and shall make 
proper and timely cost and credit notations for all materiel movements 
affecting NPSL property. The lessee shall provide only such materiel as 
may be required for immediate use or is consistent with practical, 
efficient, and economical operations. The accumulation of surplus stocks 
shall be avoided by proper materiel control, inventory and purchasing. 
The lessee shall make timely disposition of idle and surplus materiel 
through sale.
    (b) At reasonable intervals, but at least once every three years, 
inventories of controllable materiel shall be taken by the lessee. 
Written notice of intention to take inventory shall be given by the 
lessee at least 30 days before any inventory is to be taken so that the 
Director may be represented at the taking of inventory. Failure of the 
Director to be represented at an inventory shall bind the Director to 
accept the inventory taken by the lessee, except in the case of willful 
misrepresentation or fraud.
    (c) Inventory shall be valued with any generally accepted accounting 
method used by the lessee to value the same materiel for financial or 
income tax reporting purposes, provided that the method is consistently 
applied throughout the life of the materiel.
    (d) Reconciliation shall be made of a physical inventory with the 
NPSL capital account by the lessee, and a list of overages and shortages 
shall be available to the Director for audit as provided in 
Sec. 220.033. Inventory adjustments of controllable materiel shall be 
made by the lessee to the NPSL capital account for overages and 
shortages. Controllable materiel removed from physical inventory that 
has not been credited to NPSL operations under Sec. 220.015(a)(2) shall 
be credited to NPSL operations at its original value, except that when 
the cost of the materiel originally qualified for the allowance for 
capital recovery in Sec. 220.020, the credit shall be calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 220.021(a)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 220.033  Audits.

    (a) The accounts of an NPSL lessee or of a contractor of the lessee 
which

[[Page 192]]

are related to NPSL operations shall be subject to audit by DOI or its 
appointed agent. Where possible, the auditor for DOI shall coordinate 
audit efforts with other nonoperators, if any. DOI shall have the right 
to initiate an audit any time within thirty-six months of the due date 
of the monthly statement that is to be audited or the date that the 
statement was mailed, whichever is later, provided, however, that audits 
may not be conducted any more frequently than once every year except 
upon a showing of fraud or willful misrepresentation.
    (b)(1) When nonoperators of an NPSL lease call an audit in 
accordance with the terms of their operating agreement, the Director 
shall be notified of the audit call in the same manner as the operator 
is notified. DOI may elect to send an auditor with the audit team 
specified by the nonoperators in lieu of calling for a separate audit by 
DOI.
    (2) If DOI determines to call for an audit, DOI shall notify the 
lessee of its audit call and set a time and place for the audit. Such a 
notice shall be sent at least thirty days before the suggested time for 
the audit to allow the nonoperators to join in DOI's audit in lieu of 
calling for their own audit. The place for the audit will normally be 
the place where the lessee maintains its records pertaining to the NPSL 
lease. The lessee shall send copies of the notice to the nonoperators on 
the lease. The lessee shall use reasonable effort to notify all 
nonoperators, but failure to include one or more nonoperators in the 
notification shall not void the notice.
    (3) When DOI calls for an audit, DOI may suggest the date and time 
when the audit may commence. The estimated duration of the audit may be 
mentioned to the lessee as well as to the other nonoperators who may 
elect to supply and auditor for their own audit purposes. The lessee's 
office where the audit will be held may be named or, if not known, 
inquired about. If a visit to a field plant or field office is 
contemplated by the government auditor, such a field trip may be 
mentioned. If DOI expresses a desire to review a period on which the 
thirty-six month time limitation has expired, it is the lessee's 
prerogative to allow the review or to request that DOI adhere to the 
time limitation specified in these regulations.
    (c)(1) Exceptions to the accounting by the lessee, whether in favor 
of the government or the lessee, shall be noted in a report to the 
lessee. The lessee shall have 60 days from the mailing of a notice of 
exceptions to agree to the adjustments proposed by the DOI auditor or to 
object to the proposed adjustments. If the lessee accepts the proposed 
adjustments, the adjustment shall be booked in the month in which the 
lessee agrees to the adjustment, except where such adjustment would have 
resulted in a change in any net profit share payment due the United 
States. In such a case, there shall be a redetermination of the NPSL 
capital account pursuant to Sec. 220.034.
    (2) If the lessee disagrees with the adjustment, the lessee shall 
have the right to appeal the adjustment to the Director.
    (d) Upon receipt of an agreement by the government auditor that 
there are no required audit adjustments, upon final determination with 
respect to any audit adjustment proposed by the government auditor, or 
upon the lapse of thirty-six months from the due date or date of mailing 
of the statement of account on an NPSL lease, whichever comes later, the 
books shall be closed for audit adjustment purposes, except upon a 
showing of fraud or willful misrepresentation.
    (e) Records required to be kept under Sec. 220.030(a) shall be made 
available for inspection by any authorized agent of DOI at any time 
during normal business hours upon the request of the Director or other 
authorized official.


<R05>
Sec. 220.034  Redetermination and appeals.

    (a) If, as a result of an inspection of records or an audit under 
Sec. 220.033, the Director determines that there is an error in the NPSL 
capital account or an error in calculating the net profit share payment, 
whether in favor of the government or the lessee, the Director shall 
redetermine the net profit share base and recalculate the net profit 
share payment due the United States and notify the lessee of the 
recalculation.

[[Page 193]]

    (b) The lessee shall pay any additional amount of net profit share 
payment owed plus interest, compounded monthly, from the date that the 
payment was due until the date it is actually paid. Interest shall be 
calculated at the prevailing rate or rates as published in the Bulletin 
to the Department of the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, in effect 
for the period or periods over which the payment is owed.
    (c) If the recalculated profit share payment is less than the amount 
paid the United States, the lessee shall apply such overpayment to the 
next profit share payment.
    (d) Within 30 days after receiving notice of the recalculation as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the lessee may appeal the 
decision of the Director in accordance with the appeals provision of 30 
CFR part 290.

                   Delegation of MMS Royalty Functions


<R05>
Sec. 227.1  What is the purpose of this part?

    This part provides procedures to delegate Federal royalty management 
functions to States under section 205 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
Management Act of 1982 (the Act), 30 U.S.C.

[[Page 194]]

1735, as amended by the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and 
Fairness Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-185, August 13, 1996, as corrected by 
Pub. L. 104-200. This part also provides procedures to delegate only 
audit and investigation functions to States under Pub. L. 102-154 for 
solid mineral leases, geothermal leases and leases subject to section 
8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337(g). This 
part does not apply to any inspection or enforcement responsibilities of 
the Bureau of Land Management for onshore leases or the MMS Offshore 
Minerals Management program for leases on the Outer Continental Shelf.


<R05>
Sec. 227.10  What is the authority for information collection?

    (a) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
have been approved by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned OMB Control Number 1010-0088. We will 
use the information collected to review and approve delegation proposals 
from States wishing to perform royalty management functions.
    (b) Public reporting burden is estimated as follows. MMS estimates 
400 annual burden hours per function for each State performing the 
delegated functions. The Federal Government will reimburse some of these 
costs as provided by statute. However, States could incur additional 
start-up costs, such as purchasing equipment necessary to perform a 
delegated function, that may not be reimbursable. MMS estimates that, if 
applicable, each payor or reporter would spend 50 burden hours annually 
coordinating their interactions and communications among the several 
States and with MMS. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any 
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions 
for reducing burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, 
Minerals Management Service, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240; 
and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Interior 
Department, OMB Control Number 1010-0088, 725 17th Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20503.


<R05>
Sec. 227.101  What royalty management functions may MMS delegate to a State?

    (a) If there are oil and gas leases subject to the Act on Federal 
lands within your State, MMS may delegate the following royalty 
management functions for all such Federal oil and gas leases to you 
under this part:
    (1) Conducting audits and investigations;
    (2) Receiving and processing production or royalty reports;
    (3) Correcting erroneous report data;
    (4) Performing automated verification; and
    (5) Issuing demands, subpoenas, and orders to perform restructured 
accounting, including related notices to lessees or their designees, and 
entering into tolling agreements under section 115(d)(1) of the Act, 30 
U.S.C. 1725(d)(1).
    (b) If there are oil and gas leases offshore of your State subject 
to section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 
1337(g), or solid mineral leases or geothermal leases on Federal lands 
within your State, MMS only may delegate authority to conduct audits and 
investigations for all such Federal leases to you under this part. MMS 
will not delegate other functions that may be delegated for oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands.


<R05>
Sec. 227.102  What royalty management functions will MMS not delegate?

    This section lists the principal royalty management functions that 
MMS will not delegate to a State. MMS will not delegate to a State the 
following functions:
    (a) MMS must collect all moneys received from sales, bonuses, 
rentals, royalties, civil penalties, assessments and interest. MMS also 
must collect any moneys a lessee or its designee pays because of audits 
or other actions of a delegated State;
    (b) MMS must compare all cash and other payments it receives with 
payments shown on royalty reports or other documents, such as bills, to 
reconcile payor accounts. MMS also must disburse all appropriate moneys 
to States and other revenue recipients, including refunds and interest 
owed to lessees and their designees;

[[Page 195]]

    (c) The Department of the Interior will receive, process, and decide 
all administrative appeals from demands or other orders issued to 
lessees, their designees, or any other person, including demands or 
orders a delegated State issues;
    (d) Only MMS may take enforcement actions other than issuing 
demands, subpoenas and orders to perform restructured accounting. MMS or 
the appropriate Federal agency will issue notices of non-compliance and 
civil penalties, collect debts, write off delinquent debts, pursue 
litigation, enforce subpoenas, and manage any alternative dispute 
resolution. MMS will conduct, coordinate and approve any settlement or 
other compromise of an obligation that a lessee or its designee owes;
    (e) MMS will decide all valuation policies, including issuing 
valuation regulations, determinations, and guidelines, and interpreting 
valuation regulations; and
    (f) MMS may reserve additional authorities and responsibilities not 
included in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.

                          Delegation Proposals


<R05>
Sec. 227.103  What must a State's delegation proposal contain?

Applicable laws include the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Trade 
Secrets Act, and relevant Executive Orders. In addition, your statement 
must acknowledge that all documents produced, received, and maintained 
as part of any delegation functions are agency records for purposes of 
FOIA. Therefore, persons who have access to information received under 
delegated functions may not use such information or provide such 
information to any other person, including State personnel, for purposes 
other than performing delegated functions. However, this limitation does 
not apply if the person submitting the information consents in writing 
to its use for other State purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 227.104  What will MMS do when it receives a State's delegation proposal?

    When MMS receives your delegation proposal, it will record the 
receipt date. MMS will notify you in writing within 15 business days 
whether your proposal is complete. If it is not complete, MMS will 
identify any missing items Sec. 227.103 requires. Once you submit all 
required information, MMS will notify you of the date your application 
is complete.

                             Hearing Process


<R05>
Sec. 227.105  What are the hearing procedures?

    After MMS notifies you that your delegation proposal is complete, 
MMS will schedule a hearing on your proposal, if MMS determines a 
hearing is appropriate, as follows:
    (a) The MMS Director will appoint a hearing official to conduct one 
or more public hearings for fact finding regarding your ability to 
assume the delegated functions requested. The hearing official will not 
decide whether to approve your delegation request;
    (b) The hearing official will contact you about scheduling a hearing 
date and location;
    (c) The MMS will publish notice of the hearing in the Federal 
Register and other appropriate media within your State;
    (d) MMS will publish notice of the proposal in the Federal Register. 
MMS will also post the proposal on the MMS Website, and upon request, 
MMS will send a copy of the delegation proposal to the trade 
associations to distribute to their members, as necessary;

[[Page 197]]

    (e) At the hearing, you will have an opportunity to present 
testimony and written information in support of your proposal;
    (f) Other persons may attend the hearing and may present testimony 
and written information for the record;
    (g) MMS will record the hearing;
    (h) MMS will maintain a record of all documents related to the 
proposal process;
    (i) After the hearing, MMS may require you to submit additional

                           Delegation Process


<R05>
Sec. 227.106  What statutory requirements must a State meet to receive a delegation?

    The MMS Director will decide whether to approve your delegation 
request and will ask the Secretary of the Interior to concur in the 
decision. That decision is solely within the MMS Director's and the 
Secretary's discretion. The MMS Director's decision, which the Secretary 
concurs in, is the final decision for the Department of the Interior. 
The MMS Director may approve a State's request for delegation only if, 
based upon the State's delegation proposal and the hearing record, the 
MMS Director finds that:
    (a) It is likely that the State will provide adequate resources to 
achieve the purposes of the Act;
    (b) The State has demonstrated that it will effectively and 
faithfully administer the MMS regulations under the Act in accordance 
with subsections (c) and (d) of section 205 of the Act;
    (c) Such delegation will not create an unreasonable burden on any 
lessee;
    (d) The State agrees to adopt standardized reporting procedures MMS 
prescribes for royalty and production accounting purposes, unless the 
State and all affected parties (including MMS) otherwise agree;
    (e) The State agrees to follow and adhere to regulations and 
guidelines MMS issues under the mineral leasing laws regarding valuation 
of production; and
    (f) Where necessary for a State to carry out and enforce a delegated 
activity, the State agrees to enact such laws and promulgate such 
regulations as are consistent with relevant Federal laws and 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 227.107  When will the MMS Director decide whether to approve a State's delegation proposal?

    The MMS Director will decide whether to approve your delegation

written consent.


<R05>
Sec. 227.108  How will MMS notify a State of its decision?

    MMS will notify you in writing of its decision on your delegation 
proposal. If MMS approves your delegation proposal, then MMS will hold

comply with to perform those functions, and any required transition 
period.


<R05>
Sec. 227.109  What if the MMS Director denies a State's delegation proposal?

    If the MMS Director denies your delegation proposal, MMS will state

delegation proposal at any time following a denial.


<R05>
Sec. 227.110  When and for how long are delegation agreements effective?

    (a) Delegation agreements are effective for 3 years from the date 
the MMS Director signs the delegation agreement. However, during the 
development of the State's delegation proposal under Sec. 227.108 of 
this part, MMS, the delegated State, and any other affected person will 
determine an appropriate transition period for lessees and their 
designees to modify their systems to comply with any new requirements 
under a delegation agreement. MMS will publish notice of the effective 
date of a State's delegation agreement in the Federal Register and that 
notice will inform lessees and their designees of any transition period. 
MMS also will post the proposals on the MMS Website at www.mms.gov, and 
upon request,

[[Page 198]]

will send a copy of the delegation proposals to trade associations to 
distribute to their members.
    (b) You may ask MMS to renew the delegation for an additional 3 
years no less than 6 months before your 3-year delegation agreement 
expires. You must submit your renewal request to the MMS Associate 
Director for Royalty Management as follows:
    (1) If you do not want to change the terms of your delegation 
agreement for the renewal period, you need only ask to extend your 
existing agreement for the 3-year renewal period. MMS will not schedule 
a hearing unless you request one;
    (2) If you want to change the terms of your delegation agreement for 
the renewal period, you must submit a new delegation proposal under this 
part.
    (c) The MMS Director may approve your renewal request only if MMS 
determines that you are meeting the requirements of the applicable 
standards and regulations. If the MMS Director denies your renewal 
request, MMS will state the reasons for denial. MMS also will inform you 
in writing of the conditions you must meet to receive approval. You may 
submit a new renewal request any time after denial.
    (d) After the 3-year renewal period for your delegation agreement 
ends, if you wish to continue performing one or more delegated 
functions, you must request a new delegation agreement from MMS under 
this part. MMS will schedule a hearing on your request, if MMS 
determines a hearing is appropriate. As part of the decision whether to 
approve your request for a new delegation, the MMS Director will 
consider whether you are meeting the requirements of the applicable 
standards and regulations under your existing delegation agreement.
    (e) If you do not request a hearing under paragraphs (b)(1) or (d) 
of this section, any other affected person may submit a written request 
for a hearing under those paragraphs to the MMS Associate Director for 
Royalty Management.

that a State or tribe has the ability to carry out cooperative 
activities in a timely and efficient manner.


<R05>
Sec. 228.3  Limitation on applicability.

    As of the effective date of this rule, September 11, 1997, this part 
does not apply to Federal lands.
[62 FR 43091, Aug. 12, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 228.4  Authority.

    The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to enter into 
cooperative agreements with States and Indian tribes (30 U.S.C. 1732) to 
share oil or gas royalty management information, and to carry out 
auditing and related investigation or enforcement activities in 
cooperation with the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 228.5  Delegation of authority.

    (a) Authority to enter into cooperative agreements to carry out 
audit and related investigation and enforcement activities with State 
and tribal governments has been delegated to the Director of the 
Minerals Management Service (MMS).
    (b) Authority to enter into cooperative agreements with State and 
tribal governments to carry out inspection and related investigation and 
enforcement activities has been delegated to the Director of the Bureau 
of Land Management (BLM) and is not covered by this part.
    (c) The entry into a cooperative agreement with either MMS or BLM 
will not affect the ability of a State or Indian tribe to choose to 
enter into such an agreement with the other agency. A State may enter 
into a delegation agreement (30 U.S.C. 1735) with MMS to perform certain 
functions without affecting its ability to enter into a cooperative 
agreement with either MMS or BLM, or both, to cooperate in the 
performance of those functions which are not delegated in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 228.6  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, terms shall have the same meaning as 
in 30 U.S.C. 1702. In addition, the following definition shall apply:
    Audit means an examination of the financial accounting and lease 
related records of the lessee and other interest holders, who by lease 
or contract pay royalties or are obligated to pay royalties, rents, 
bonuses or other payments on Federal or Indian leases. An examination is 
to be conducted in accordance with generally accepted audit standards as 
adopted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
Activities to be examined which are considered to be an audit function 
include reconciliation of lease accounts under the Royalty Accounting 
System; records of lease activities related to Federal leases located 
within the boundaries of the State entering into a cooperative 
agreement; records of lease activities related to leases located on 
Indian lands, and the review and resolution of exceptions processed by 
the Auditing and Financial System and the Production Accounting and 
Auditing System, the official accounting systems for royalty reporters 
and payors maintained by the MMS.

Sec. 228.10  Information collection.

    (a) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
have been approved by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned OMB 
Clearance Number 1010-0087. The information collected will be used to 
prepare a cooperative agreement with a State or Indian tribe wishing to 
perform royalty audits. The information should be submitted voluntarily 
in order to enter into a cooperative agreement authorized by 30 U.S.C. 
1732.
    (b) Public reporting burden is estimated to average 136 hours for 
the preparation of the original request for consideration and 
application to enter into a cooperative agreement. Subsequent requests 
for renewal of the agreement may require about 40 hours for the 
preparation of an annual budget and work plan, and an estimated 8 hours 
per quarter for preparation of a reimbursement voucher and an audit 
progress report. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any 
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions 
for reducing burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, 
Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia 22070; 
and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1010-0087, 
Washington, DC 20503.

Secretary for the types of activities to be conducted under the terms of 
the agreement.
    (4) If the State is proposing to undertake activities on Indian 
lands located within the State, a resolution from the appropriate tribal 
council indicating their agreement to delegate to the State 
responsibilities under the terms of the cooperative agreement for 
activities to be conducted on tribal or allotted land.
    (c) The eligible activities to be conducted under the terms of a

<R05>
Sec. 228.101  Terms of agreement.

    (a) Agreements entered into under this part shall be valid for a

year periods upon request of the State or Indian tribe which is a party 
to the agreement.
    (b) An agreement may be terminated at any time by mutual agreement 
and upon any terms and conditions as agreed upon by the parties.
    (c) A State or Indian tribe may unilaterally terminate an agreement 
by giving a 120-day written notice of intent to terminate.
    (d) The MMS may commence termination of an agreement by giving a 
120-day written notice of intent to terminate. MMS shall provide the 
State or Indian tribe with the reasons for the proposed termination in 
writing if the termination is proposed because of alleged deficiencies 
by the State or Indian tribe in carrying out the provisions of the 
agreement. The State or Indian tribe will be given 60 days to respond to 
the notice of deficiencies and to provide a plan for correction of those 
deficiencies. No final action on termination shall be taken until any 
submission of the State or Indian tribe provided within the above 
prescribed 60 days has been reviewed by MMS for content or merit.

[[Page 207]]

    (e) Termination of a cooperative agreement shall not bar a later 
request by a State or Indian tribe to enter into a subsequent 
cooperative agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 228.102  Establishment of standards.

    The MMS, after consultation with States and Indian tribes, shall 
establish standards for carrying out the activities under the provisions 
of this part. The standards will be incorporated into the agreement and 
shall be no more stringent than those applicable to similar activities 
of the MMS. The States and Indian tribes shall coordinate their planned

and federally recognized Indian tribal Governments).
[56 FR 10512, Mar. 13, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 228.104  Availability of information.

    (a) Under the provisions of this part, information necessary to 
carry out the activities authorized under the terms of a cooperative 
agreement will be provided by DOI to the States and Indian tribes 
entering into such agreements. The information will consist of data 
provided from all relevant sources on a lease level basis for leases 
located within the boundaries of the State or Indian tribe which has 
entered into the agreement. This information will include any records or 
data held by the lessee or other person that have not been submitted to 
MMS, but that affect Federal lease interests and could be required to be 
submitted under the lease terms or Federal regulations.
    (b) None of the provisions of this subpart should be construed as 
limiting information already being provided to Indian tribes and 
allottees regarding their lease interests.
    (c) Information will be provided by MMS on a monthly basis and will 
include data on royalties, rents, and bonuses collected on the lease, 
volumes produced, sales made, value of products disposed of as a sale

under the cooperative agreement.
    (d) Proprietary data that is made available to a State or tribe 
under provisions of 30 U.S.C. 1733 shall be subject to the constraints 
of 18 U.S.C. 1905. To receive proprietary data, the State or tribe 
must--
    (1) Demonstrate what audit, investigation, or litigation under 
provisions of 30 U.S.C. 1734 is planned for or underway for which this 
data is essential;
    (2) Demonstrate why this particular data is necessary; and

<R05>
Sec. 228.105  Funding of cooperative agreements.

    (a)(1) The Department may, under the terms of the cooperative 
agreement, reimburse the State or Indian tribe up to 100 percent of the 
costs of eligible activities. Eligible activities will be agreed upon 
annually upon the submission and approval of a workplan and funding 
requirement.
    (2) A cooperative agreement may be entered into with a State or 
Indian tribe, upon request, without a requirement for reimbursement of 
costs by the Department.
    (b) All cooperative agreements under this part are subject to annual 
funding and the availability of appropriations specifically designated 
for the purpose of this part.
    (c) The State or Indian tribe shall submit a voucher for 
reimbursement of eligible costs incurred within 30 days of the end of 
each calendar quarter. The State or Indian tribe must provide the

<R05>
Sec. 228.107  Eligible cost of activities.

    (a) If a cooperative agreement provides for Federal funding, only 
costs directly associated with eligible activities undertaken by the 
State or Indian tribe under the terms of a cooperative agreement will be 
eligible for reimbursement. Costs of services or activities which cannot 
be directly related to the support of activities specified in the 
agreement will not be eligible for Federal funding or for inclusion in 
the State's share or in the Indian tribe's share of funding that may be 
established in the agreement.
    (b) Eligible costs are the cost of salaries and benefits associated 
with technical, support, and clerical personnel engaged in eligible 
activities; direct cost of travel, rentals, and other normal 
administrative activities in direct support of the project or projects; 
basic and specialized training for State and tribal participants; and 
cost of any contractual services which can be shown to be in direct 
support of the activities covered by the agreement. Each cooperative 
agreement shall contain detailed schedules identifying those activities 
and costs which qualify for funding and the procedures, timing, and 
mechanics for implementing Federal funding.

    As provided at 30 U.S.C. 1736, 50 percent of any civil penalty 
collected as a result of activities under a cooperative agreement will 
be shared with the State or Indian tribe performing the cooperative 
agreement; however, the amount of the civil penalty shared will be 
deducted from any Federal funding owed under that cooperative agreement. 
MMS shall maintain records of civil penalties collected and distributed 
to the States and tribes involved in cooperative agreements. Each 
quarterly payment of the Federal share of a cooperative agreement will 
be reduced by the amount of the civil penalties paid to the State or 
tribe during the prior quarter.

<R05>
Sec. 229.108  Deduction of civil penalties accruing to the State or tribe under the delegation of authority.

    Fifty percent of any civil penalty resulting from activities under a 
delegation of authority shall be shared with the delegated State. 
However, the amount of the civil penalty shared will be deducted from 
any Federal funding owed under a delegation of authority under the 
provisions of 30 U.S.C. 1735. MMS shall maintain records of civil 
penalties collected and distributed to the States involved in 30 U.S.C.

Sec. 229.120  Obtaining regulatory and policy guidance.

    All activities performed by a State under a delegation must be in 
full accord with all Federal laws, rules and regulations, and 
Secretarial and agency determinations and orders relating to the 
calculation, reporting, and payment of oil and gas royalties. In those 
cases when guidance or interpretations are necessary, the State will 
direct written requests for such guidance or interpretation to the 
appropriate MMS officials. All policy and procedural guidance or 
interpretation provided by the MMS shall be in writing and shall be 
binding on the State.

[[Page 213]]


<R05>
Sec. 229.121  Recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) The State shall maintain in a safe and secure manner all 
records, workpapers, reports, and correspondence gained or developed as 
a consequence of audit or investigative activities conducted under the 
delegation. All such records shall be made available for review and 
inspection upon request by representatives of the Secretary and the 
Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG).
    (b) The State must maintain in a confidential manner all data 
obtained from DOI sources or from payor or company sources under the 
delegation which have been deemed ``confidential or proprietary'' by DOI 
or a company or payor. In this regard, the State regulatory authority 
shall be bound by provisions of 30 U.S.C. 1733. MMS shall provide to the 
State guidelines for determining confidential and proprietary material.
    (c) All records subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) must be 
maintained for a 6-year period measured from the end of the calendar 
year in which the records were created. All dispositions or records must 
be with the written approval of the MMS. Upon termination of a 
delegation, the State shall, within 90 days from the date of 
termination, assemble all records specified in subsection (a), complete 
all working paper files in accordance with Sec. 229.124, and transfer 
such records to the MMS.
    (d) The State shall maintain complete cost records for the 
delegation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Such records shall be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the total 
actual costs associated with the project and to permit a determination 
by MMS whether delegation funds were used for their intended purpose. 
All such records shall be made available for review and inspection upon 
request by representatives of the Secretary and the Department's Office 
of Inspector General (OGIG).


<R05>
Sec. 229.122  Coordination of audit activities.

    (a) Each State with a delegation of authority shall submit annually 
to the MMS an audit workplan specifically identifying leases, resources, 
companies, and payors scheduled for audit. This workplan must be 
submitted 120 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. A State 
may request changes to its workplan (including the companies and leases 
to be audited) at the end of each quarter of each fiscal year. All 
requested changes are subject to approval by the MMS and must be 
submitted in writing.
    (b) When a State plans to audit leases of a lessee or royalty payor 
for which there is an MMS or OIG resident audit team, all audit 
activities must be coordinated through the MMS or OIG resident 
supervisor. Such activities include, but are not limited to, issuance of 
engagement letters, arranging for entrance conferences, submission of 
data requests, scheduling of audit activities including site visits, 
submission of issue letters, and closeout conferences.
    (c) The State shall consult with the MMS and/or OIG regarding 
resolution of any coordination problems encountered during the conduct 
of delegation activities.


<R05>
Sec. 229.123  Standards for audit activities.

    (a) All audit activities performed under a delegation of authority 
must be in accordance with the ``Standards for Audit of Governmental 
Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions'' as issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States.
    (b) The following audit standards also shall apply to all audit work 
performed under a delegation of authority.
    (1) General standards--(i) Qualifications. The auditors assigned to 
perform the audit must collectively possess adequate professional 
proficiency for the tasks required, including a knowledge of accounting, 
auditing, agency regulations, and industry operations.
    (ii) Independence. In all matters relating to the audit work, the 
audit organization and the individual auditors must be free from 
personal or external impairments to independence and shall maintain an 
independent attitude and appearance.
    (iii) Due professional care. Due professional care is to be used in 
conducting the audit and in preparing related reports.

[[Page 214]]

    (iv) Quality control. The State governments must institute quality 
control review procedures to ensure that all audits are performed in 
conformity with the standards established herein.
    (2) Examination and evaluation standards--Standards and requirements 
for examination and evaluation. Auditors should be alert to situations 
or transactions that could be indicative of fraud, abuse, or illegal 
acts with respect to the program. If such evidence exists, auditors 
should forward this evidence to MMS. The MMS will contact the 
appropriate Federal law enforcement agencies. The scope of examinations 
are to be governed by the principle of a justifiable relationship 
between cost and benefit as determined by the auditor or audit 
supervisor. Audit procedures should reflect the most efficient method of 
obtaining the requisite degree of satisfaction. The auditor should 
determine, to the extent possible, the effect on royalty reporting of 
the non-arms'-length nature of related party transactions, such as 
transfers of oil to refinery units affiliated with the producer. A 
review should be made of compliance with the appropriate laws and 
regulations applicable to program operations. MMS shall issue guidelines 
as to the definition and nature of arms'-length and non-arms'-length 
transactions for use in carrying out delegated audit activities.
    (3) Standards of reporting. (i) Written audit reports are to be 
submitted to the appropriate MMS officials at the end of each field 
examination.
    (ii) A statement in the auditors' report that the examination was 
made in accordance with the generally accepted program audit standards 
(including the applicable General Accounting Office (GAO) standards) for 
royalty compliance audits should be in the appropriate language to 
indicate that the audit was made in accordance with this statement of 
standards.
    (iii) The auditor's report should contain a statement of positive 
assurance on those items tested and negative assurance on those items 
not tested. It should also include all instances of noncompliance and 
instances or indications of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts found during 
or in connection with the audit.
    (iv) The auditor's report should contain any other material 
deficiency identified during the audit not covered in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (v) When factors external to the program and to the auditor restrict 
the audit or interfere with the auditor's ability to form objective 
opinions and conclusions (such as denial of access to information by a 
company), the auditor is to notify the MMS. If the limitation is not 
removed, a description of the matter must be included in the auditor's 
report. MMS will take all legally enforceable steps necessary to seek 
information necessary to complete the audit.
    (vi) If certain information is prohibited from general disclosure, 
the auditor's report should state the nature of the information omitted 
and the requirement that makes the omission necessary.
    (vii) Written audit reports are to be prepared in the format 
prescribed by the MMS.
    (viii) In instances where the extent of the audit findings or the 
amounts involved do not warrant it, a formal audit report need not be 
issued. In lieu of an audit report, a memorandum of audit findings will 
be prepared and placed on the case file.
[49 FR 40026, Oct. 12, 1984, as amended at 58 FR 64903, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 229.124  Documentation standards.

    Every audit performed by a State under a delegation of authority 
must meet certain documentation standards. In particular, detailed 
workpapers must be developed and maintained.
    (a) Workpapers are defined to include all records obtained or 
created in performing an audit.
    (b) Each audit performed varies in scope and detail. As a result, 
the audit team must determine the best presentation of the workpapers 
for a particular audit. The following general standards of workpaper 
preparation are consistent with the goal of achieving proper 
documentation while maintaining sufficient flexibility.
    (1) All relevant information obtained orally must be promptly 
recorded in

[[Page 215]]

writing and incorporated in the workpapers.
    (2) Workpapers must be complete and accurate in order to provide 
support for findings and conclusions.
    (3) Workpapers should be clear and understandable without the need 
for supplementary oral explanations. The information they contain must 
be clear, complete, and concise, so that anyone using the workpapers 
will be able to readily determine their purpose, the nature and scope of 
the work done, and the conclusions drawn.
    (4) Workpapers must be legible and as neat as practicable. They must 
meet standards which allow their use as evidence in judicial and 
administrative proceedings.
    (5) The information contained in workpapers should be restricted to 
matters which are materially important and relevant to the objectives 
established for the assignment.
    (6) Workpapers must be in sufficient detail to permit a subsequent 
independent execution of each audit procedure, assuming the target 
company retains its accounting documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 229.125  Preparation and issuance of enforcement documents.

    (a) Determinations of additional royalties due resulting from audit 
activities conducted under a delegation of authority must be formally 
communicated by the State, to the companies or other payors by an issue 
letter prior to any enforcement action. The issue letter will serve to 
ensure that all audit findings are accurate and complete by obtaining 
advance comments from officials of the companies or payors audited. 
Issue letters must be prepared in a format specified by the MMS, and 
transmitted to the company or payor. The company or payor shall be given 
30 days from receipt of the letter to respond to the State on the 
findings contained in the letter.
    (b) After evaluating the company or payor's response to the issue 
letter, the State shall draft a demand letter which will be submitted 
with supporting workpaper files to the MMS for appropriate enforcement 
action. Any sustantive revisions to the demand letter will be discussed 
with the State prior to issuance of the letter. Copies of all 
enforcement action documents shall be provided to the State by MMS upon 
their issuance to the company or payor.


<R05>
Sec. 229.126  Appeals.

    (a) Appeals made pursuant to the rules and procedures at 30 CFR 
parts 243 and 290 related to demand letters issued by officers of the 
MMS for additional royalties identified under a delegation of authority 
shall be filed with the MMS for processing. The State regulatory 
authority shall, upon the request of the MMS, provide competent and 
knowledgeable staff for testimony, as well as any required documentation 
and analyses, in support of the lessor's position during the appeal 
process.
    (b) An affected State, upon the request of the MMS, shall provide 
expert witnesses from their audit staff for testimony as well as 
required documentation and analyses to support the Department's position 
during the litigation of court cases arising from denied appeals. The 
cost of providing expert witnesses including travel and per diem is 
reimbursable under the provisions of a delegation of authority, at the 
Federal Government's existing per diem rates.


<R05>
Sec. 229.127  Reports from States.

    The State, acting under the authority of the Secretarial delegation, 
shall submit quarterly reports which will summarize activities carried 
out by the State during the preceding quarter of the year under the 
provisions of the delegation. The report shall include:
    (a) A statistical summary of the activities carried out, e.g., 
number of audits performed, accounts reconciled, and other actions 
taken;
    (b) A summary of costs incurred during the previous quarter for 
which the State is seeking reimbursement; and
    (c) A schedule of changes which the State proposes to make from its 
approved plan.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 230.51  Cross-lease netting in calculation of overpayments under section 10 of the OCSLA.

    (a) The amount of any refund or credit for any overpayment for any 
lease or leases governed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act 
(OCSLA), as amended, for any production month shall not be reduced by 
offsetting against that overpayment any reported underpayment by the 
payor on any other lease or leases, except as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Royalties attributed to production from a lease or leases 
governed by the OCSLA, which should have been attributed to production 
from a different lease or leases governed by the OCSLA, may be offset 
without regard to the provisions of OCSLA section 10, 43 U.S.C. 1339, 
only if the payor submits a written request to Minerals Management 
Service (MMS), Fiscal Accounting Division, for its approval of the 
correction and provides adequate documentation to show that the 
following conditions exist and are met:
    (1) The error results from attributing and reporting an equal volume 
of production, produced from a lease or leases during a particular 
production month, to a different lease or leases from which that 
production was not produced for the same or another production month;
    (2) The payor is the same for the lease or leases to which the 
production was attributed and the lease or leases to which it should 
have been attributed;
    (3) The payor submits production reports, pipeline allocation 
reports, or other similar documentary evidence pertaining to the 
specific production involved which verifies the correct production 
information; and
    (4) In the case of leases which are within the zone defined and 
governed by section 8(g) of the OCSLA, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1337(g), 
the leases are located off the coast of the same State.
    (c) If MMS approves a correction pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section,

[[Page 217]]

the payor is required to submit an adjusting royalty report (Form MMS-
2014) pursuant to 30 CFR part 210 to correct its reporting to the 
Auditing and Financial System.

    (d) If MMS requires a repayment of principal royalties or assesses 
late-payment interest as a result of the payor having improperly offset 
any underpayment against an overpayment and, therefore, having failed to 
request a refund or credit as required by section 10 of the OCSLA, 43 
U.S.C. 1339, and the payor asserts pursuant to 30 CFR part 290 that some 
or all of the royalties or interest assessed is not owed pursuant to the 
exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the burden is on 
the payor to demonstrate that the exception applies in the specific 
circumstances of the case.

    (e) The exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section shall 
not operate to relieve any payor of any liability imposed by statute or 
regulation for erroneous reporting.

    Source: 59 FR 38363, July 28, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 230.451  Scope.

    This subpart establishes the procedures that lessees and other 
persons who make royalty and other payments on Federal oil and gas 
leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) must follow to recover 
certain excess payments made in connection with their leases in 
accordance with section 10 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act 
(section 10), 43 U.S.C. 1339. The requirements of this subpart apply to 
both requests for refund from the Treasury of excess payments and 
requests to recover excess payments by recouping the amount through a 
credit adjustment. This subpart applies only to Federal leases on the 
OCS.


<R05>
Sec. 230.452  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart shall have the same meaning as in 30 
U.S.C. 1702.

In addition, the following definitions apply to this subpart:
    Credit or crediting means reduction of a current or future royalty 
or other payment made in connection with a lease as a result of 
reporting a credit adjustment.
    Credit Adjustment means any adjustment reported on a Report of Sales 
and Royalty Remittance (Form MMS-2014) or any other royalty report form 
which reduces any royalty or other payment made in connection with a 
lease which was reported and paid in any previous period.
    Offset means to net or cancel previous overpayments against previous 
underpayments on the same OCS lease or across lease boundaries if all 
the individual leases are part of an approved unit agreement.
    Overpayment means any payment made in excess of the amount that the 
lessee was lawfully required to pay.

[[Page 218]]

    Payment means money MMS receives in satisfaction of a lessee's 
royalty, rental, bonus, net profit share, or late payment interest 
obligation as established by statute, regulation, or the terms of a 
lease.
    Recoup or recoupment means to recover a previous overpayment through 
a credit against a current or future royalty or other payment or 
liability under an OCS lease. A recoupment occurs whenever a payor 
reports a credit adjustment on a Form MMS-2014 or other royalty report 
form resulting in a net negative dollar value for the transaction and 
the credit is taken against the royalty or other payment or liability 
shown in the balance of the report.
    Refund means a repayment by the United States Treasury to a person 
of any overpayment.
    Unit means an area of 2 or more leases subject to an agreement for 
the consolidated development and recovery of oil and gas contained on 
the leases which are part of the agreement approved by MMS.


<R05>
Sec. 230.453  Request for refund or credit.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no person may 
recover an excess payment it has made in connection with an OCS lease 
unless:
    (1) That person has made a request for refund or credit in 
accordance with the provisions of this subpart;
    (2) MMS has transmitted a report on the request for refund or credit 
to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives and 30 days have expired since the submission in 
accordance with section 10(b), 43 U.S.C. 1339(b); and
    (3) MMS notifies the person that its request for refund or credit is 
authorized and that the person may receive its refund for, or may report 
a credit adjustment to recoup, the excess payment.
    (b) A request for refund or credit must:
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Provide the person's MMS-established payor code;
    (3) Identify the leases and sales months with respect to which the 
excess payments occurred;
    (4) Identify the amount of the excess payment or, with specificity, 
describe a class of payments that are, or as a result of an 
administrative or judicial decision or other identified contingency, may 
become, excess payments;
    (5) Provide the reasons why a refund or credit is due;
    (6) Include a certification that, to the best of the person's 
knowledge or belief, the information provided in response to paragraphs 
(b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section is accurate and complete.
    (c) If MMS determines that a request for refund or credit is 
incomplete, the person who submitted the request will have 30 days, or 
such time as MMS may specify, following notice from MMS, to supplement 
the request for refund or credit.
    (d) A credit adjustment reported on a Form MMS-2014 does not 
constitute a request for refund or credit for purposes of this section, 
and does not constitute an incomplete request for refund or credit for 
purposes of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) A person who has filed a request for refund or credit pursuant 
to this section may amend that request to add an additional amount if:
    (1) The additional amount is for the same lease and sales month; and
    (2) The reason for the excess payment for the additional amount is 
the same as for the originally requested amount.
    (f) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no request for a 
refund or credit will be approved unless the request is received at MMS 
at the address provided below within 2 years of the date that MMS 
received the excess payment.
    (1) The request for refund or credit must be received at the 
following address:
    (i) By mail: Minerals Management Service, Section 10 Refund 
Requests, P.O. Box 173702, Denver, CO 80217-3702.
    (ii) By express delivery or courier: Minerals Management Service, 
Section 10 Refund Requests, Building 85, Denver Federal Center, Room A-
212, Denver, CO 80225.
    (2) If the last day of the 2-year period from the date MMS received 
the excess payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday, holiday or any other day 
that MMS is

[[Page 219]]

not open for business at the address specified in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section, then the last day of the 2-year period will be the next 
regular business day. Requests received at the specified MMS address 
after 4 p.m. Mountain Time are considered received the following 
business day.


<R05>
Sec. 230.454  Interest on excess payments.

    No person is entitled to interest on any excess payment made in 
connection with a lease that is refunded or recouped pursuant to this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 230.455  Authorization of refund or credit and subsequent audit.

    MMS may grant a refund or authorize a credit based upon satisfactory 
evidence that the payment for which a refund or credit is requested was 
made, and upon a determination that the payment was excess. An approved 
request for refund or credit may be subject to later review or audit by 
MMS. If, based upon later review or audit, MMS determines that the 
refund or credit should not have been granted or authorized, the person 
who requested the refund or credit must repay the amount refunded or 
recouped plus interest determined pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 
CFR 218.150 from the date the refund was made or the recoupment taken 
until the date it is repaid.


<R05>
Sec. 230.456  Offsets of overpayments and underpayments on the same lease (or unit) by the same person.

    If a person makes an overpayment on any OCS lease or unit in a prior 
month, it may offset that overpayment against an underpayment that same 
person made in any prior month on that same lease or unit for the same 
or a different product without submitting a request for refund or 
credit. This offset is permitted only if the underpayment was not 
created as a result of a credit adjustment to recoup the amount of the 
overpayment or was not otherwise created intentionally to provide an 
underpayment against which to offset the overpayment. This offset also 
is subject to any limitations imposed by other applicable law or 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 230.457  Offsets among different persons who reported and paid royalties on a lease for the same prior sales month.

    (a) This section applies to any reallocation of production for a 
prior sales month among different persons who reported and paid royalty 
for that month on a lease or unit, except for reallocations of 
production that result from the approval or amendment of a unit 
agreement subject to Sec. 230.461(b).
    (b) In the event of a reallocation of production as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the respective persons who reported and 
paid royalty may reconcile any resulting differences in royalty payment 
obligations between themselves without submitting revised royalty 
reports or requests for refund or credit to MMS under this subpart, 
except that:
    (1) Any person who paid any amount which remains as a net 
overpayment after such reconciliation must file a request for refund or 
credit in accordance with the requirements of this subpart to recover 
the excess payment;
    (2) Any person whose royalty obligation remains underpaid after such 
reconciliation must report the additional royalties due for the prior 
sales month on a Form MMS-2014 and pay interest on the underpayment from 
the last day of the month following the sales month until the date the 
additional royalties are paid; and
    (3) All persons involved in such reconciliation must retain all 
documents pertaining to the reallocation of production, calculation of 
royalties due, and the subsequent reconciliation among the persons 
involved together with other records pertaining to production from that 
lease during the prior sales month and the royalty due and paid thereon, 
and make such documents available for review and audit in the same 
manner as other records pertaining to the lease.
    (c) If persons who reported and paid royalty do not reconcile 
between themselves any differences in royalty payment obligations 
arising as a result of a reallocation as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, each person who pays royalties for the lease must report 
and pay any additional royalties due, or file a request for refund or 
credit in

[[Page 220]]

accordance with the requirements of this subpart to recover the excess 
payment, as applicable. Any person who reports additional royalties due 
for the prior sales month must pay interest pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54 on 
the underpayment from the last day of the month following the sales 
month until the date the additional royalties are paid.


<R05>
Sec. 230.458  Unauthorized credit adjustments.

    (a) If a person reports a credit adjustment on Form MMS-2014 that 
results in a credit before MMS approves the recoupment pursuant to 
Sec. 230.455, and if the credit adjustment does not qualify as one of 
the transactions not subject to section 10 as provided in Sec. 230.461, 
then that person has taken an unauthorized credit adjustment.
    (1) If the unauthorized credit adjustment recouped a payment that 
MMS received more than 2 years before the date MMS received the Form 
MMS-2014 which includes the unauthorized credit adjustment, the person 
must repay the amount recouped plus late payment interest determined 
pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 CFR 218.150 from the date the 
unauthorized recoupment was taken until the date it is repaid. Unless 
the person filed a request for refund or credit pursuant to Sec. 230.453 
within 2 years of the making of the excess payment for which the 
unauthorized credit adjustment was reported, the excess payment is not 
subject to refund or recoupment.
    (2) If the unauthorized credit adjustment recouped a payment that 
MMS received less than 2 years before the date MMS received the Form 
MMS-2014 with the unauthorized credit adjustment, the person must repay 
the amount recouped plus late payment interest determined pursuant to 30 
U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 CFR 218.150 from the date the unauthorized 
recoupment was taken until the date it is repaid. The report of the 
unauthorized credit adjustment on the Form MMS-2014 does not constitute 
a request for refund or credit that tolls the 2-year period in section 
10(a), 43 U.S.C. 1339(a). The person may file a request for refund or 
credit pursuant to section 230.453 for the payment for which the 
unauthorized credit adjustment was reported. MMS will review the request 
pursuant to the requirements of this subpart only if the request for 
refund or credit is received within 2 years of the making of the 
original payment for which the unauthorized credit adjustment was 
reported.
    (b) A person who reports an unauthorized credit adjustment to MMS on 
a Form MMS-2014 will be assessed $500 for each unauthorized credit 
adjustment reported.


<R05>
Sec. 230.459  Stopping or tolling of the section 10(a) 2-year period.

    (a) The period of 2 years from the making of the excess payment, 
within which a request for refund or credit must be filed under section 
10(a), 43 U.S.C. 1339(a), will be:
    (1) Tolled by MMS's receipt of a substantially complete request for 
refund or credit pursuant to Sec. 230.453; or
    (2) Tolled by a general tolling notice issued by MMS and published 
in the Federal Register in circumstances where MMS believes a 
substantial number of requests for refund or credit could result as a 
consequence of a pending administrative or judicial proceeding or other 
action. The running of the 2-year period will be tolled for the time 
period specified in the notice; or
    (3) Stopped by an application for unitization of OCS leases with 
respect to any excess payment that may result from the reallocation of 
production among leases after the unit or revision is approved; or
    (4) Tolled by a notice filed by a person at the address stated in 
Sec. 230.453(f) stating that a specifically identified action or 
proceeding may result in payments made on an OCS lease becoming excess 
payments. The notice must include:
    (i) A list of affected leases and sales months;
    (ii) The specific action or proceeding that could result in payments 
becoming excess;
    (iii) An estimate of the amount that could be subject to a request 
for refund or credit; and
    (iv) The person's MMS-established payor code.
    (b) A request for refund or credit that is filed timely by a person 
who made an

[[Page 221]]

excess payment on an OCS lease does not stop or toll the running of the 
2-year period with respect to any excess payment made by any other 
person on that lease.


<R05>
Sec. 230.460  Lease suspension.

    If MMS suspends an OCS lease pursuant to 30 CFR 250.10(b)(6), a 
person who has made excess rental payments for the period of suspension 
may request a refund or credit of any excess payments pursuant to this 
subpart. If the request for refund or credit is filed more than 2 years 
after MMS received the excess rentals, the excess payment will not be 
refunded, recouped, or credited against future rentals due on the same 
lease.


<R05>
Sec. 230.461  Transactions not subject to section 10.

    (a) A request for refund of, or any other action to recover, excess 
payments made by a refiner/purchaser under a royalty-in-kind contract 
for royalty oil produced from an OCS lease is not subject to section 10.
    (b) If MMS approves a unit agreement on the OCS, or a revision to a 
unit, a person may file amended Forms MMS-2014 within the time period 
MMS prescribes, reallocating production among its affected leases. A 
person must file a request for refund or credit pursuant to this subpart 
only if, and to the extent that, there is a net reduction in the royalty 
that person previously paid for the leases committed to the unit as a 
result of the amendments.
    (c) A person may amend Form MMS-2014 to adjust volume and royalty 
reports among OCS leases within a unit within the same sales month 
without filing a request for refund or credit pursuant to this subpart, 
except that a request for refund or credit must be filed to the extent 
that there is a net reduction in the royalty previously paid for the 
leases committed to the unit as a result of the amendments.
    (d) A person who pays more money than the total royalty due as 
reported on the Form MMS-2014 accompanying the payment, where all 
amounts reported on the Form MMS-2014 are correct, may submit a request 
for refund of the overpaid amounts. The request for refund is not 
subject to section 10's requirements unless the Form MMS-2014 includes 
reports for only one OCS lease. Any overpayment subject to this 
paragraph may not be recovered by recoupment.
    (e) A person may reduce an estimate balance, established for any 
lease product pursuant to MMS instructions, by submitting a credit 
adjustment on a Form MMS-2014, or a request for refund, for all or part 
of the established estimate balance. A credit adjustment or request for 
refund to recover all or part of an estimate balance authorized by this 
paragraph is not subject to the requirements of section 10.
    (f)(1) If adjustment of an estimated oil transportation allowance or 
estimated gas transportation allowance pursuant to 30 CFR 206.105(e) and 
206.157(e), respectively, results in an overpayment for any sales month 
because the estimated transportation costs were less than the actual 
costs, a person may submit a credit adjustment on a Form MMS-2014 to 
recoup, or may request a refund of, the overpayment. The credit 
adjustment or request for refund authorized by this paragraph is not 
subject to the requirements of section 10, and MMS approval is not 
required before reporting the credit adjustment.
    (2) If adjustment of an estimated gas processing allowance pursuant 
to 30 CFR 206.159(e) results in an overpayment for any sales month 
because the estimated processing costs were less than the actual costs, 
a person may submit a credit adjustment on a Form MMS-2014 to recoup, or 
may request a refund of, the overpayment. The credit adjustment or 
request for refund authorized by this paragraph is not subject to the 
requirements of section 10, and MMS approval is not required before 
reporting the credit adjustment.
    (3) If a person makes an error in the report of actual 
transportation or processing costs pursuant to paragraphs (f)(1) or 
(f)(2) of this section, any subsequent adjustment to the report that 
results in a credit is subject to section 10 and the requirements of 
this subpart.
    (g) If a person pays pursuant to an MMS order and challenges the 
obligation to pay in an administrative appeal or judicial action, and if 
the person is

[[Page 222]]

successful in a challenge to all or part of the MMS order to pay, 
section 10 does not apply to the refund or recoupment of the disputed 
payment or portion thereof.
    (h) MMS approval is not required for an adjustment by any person to 
the amount reported for a report month that results in a credit of not 
more than an amount established periodically by MMS and published in the 
Federal Register. However, no adjustment may be reported more than 2 
years after the date MMS received the Form MMS-2014 including the excess 
payment.

<R05>
Sec. 241.51  Civil penalties authorized by the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982.

    (a)(1) Notice of noncompliance. If the MMS believes that any person 
has failed or refused to comply with any statute, regulation, rule, 
order, lease, or permit governing the determination and collection of 
royalties on Federal or Indian lands or on the Outer Continental Shelf, 
the MMS may issue a notice of noncompliance which shall set forth the 
nature of the violation and the remedial action required.
    (2) The notice of noncompliance shall be served by personal service 
by an authorized representative of the MMS or by registered mail. 
Service by registered mail shall be deemed to occur when received or 5 
days after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (3) When a notice of noncompliance is issued by the MMS under this 
section:
    (i) Unless the violation is corrected within 20 days (or such longer 
time as specified in the notice) from the date that the notice is 
served, the person upon whom the notice is served shall be liable for a 
penalty of up to $500 per violation for each day such violation 
continues, dating from the date of service of the notice;
    (ii) Unless the violation is corrected within 40 days (or such 
longer time as specified in the notice) from the date that the notice is 
served, the person upon whom the notice is served shall be liable for a 
penalty of up to $5,000 per violation for each day such violation 
continues;
    (iii) If the person upon whom the notice is served does not correct 
the violation within 20 days (or such longer time as specified in the 
notice) from the date that the notice is served, such person may, by 
that date, request a hearing on the record by filing a written request 
with the Hearings Division (Departmental), Office of Hearings and 
Appeals, U.S. Department of the Interior, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, 
Arlington, Virginia 22203.
    (4) If the person upon whom a notice of noncompliance has been 
served pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section corrects the 
violations within 20 days (or such longer time as specified in the 
notice) from the date that the notice is served, no penalties shall be 
assessed by the MMS under this section and the person shall not be 
entitled to a hearing on the record provided for in paragraph 
(a)(3)(iii) of this section. The person may appeal the notice of 
noncompliance or other disputed MMS decision or order in accordance with 
the appeals procedures in 30 CFR part 243.
    (b)(1) Notice of noncompliance for intentional violations. In 
addition to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the MMS may 
issue a notice of noncompliance for intentional violations, which shall 
set forth the nature of the violation and the remedial action required, 
to any person who--
    (i) Knowingly or willfully fails to make any payment due by the date 
as specified by statute, regulation, order, or terms of the lease;
    (ii) Knowingly or willfully fails to submit or submits false, 
inaccurate, or misleading data to the MMS in support of a royalty, 
rental, bonus, or other payment; or
    (iii) Knowingly or willfully prepares, maintains, or submits false, 
inaccurate, or misleading reports, notices, affidavits, records, data, 
or other written information.
    (2) A person served with a notice of noncompliance for an 
intentional violation under this paragraph shall be liable for a penalty 
of up to $10,000 per

[[Page 224]]

violation for each day such violation continues.
    (3) The notice of noncompliance for intentional violation shall be 
served in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) A person who has been served with a notice of noncompliance for 
intentional violation issued pursuant to this subsection shall have 20 
days from the date of service to file a written request for a hearing on 
the record with the Hearings Division (Departmental), Office of Hearings 
and Appeals, U.S. Department of the Interior, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, 
Arlington, Virginia 22203.
    (c) Penalty notice. The MMS shall issue a penalty notice to any 
person subject to penalties under this section. The penalty notice shall 
set forth the amount of the penalty applicable for each day that the 
violation continues. The penalty amount shall be determined by MMS 
taking into account the severity of the violation and the person's 
history of noncompliance. The penalty for each day that a violation 
continues shall not exceed the amounts specified in paragraphs (a) and 
(b), of this section as applicable.
    (d) Penalties imposed under this section shall be in addition to 
interest assessed on payments not received by the MMS by the due date 
and assessments for later or incorrect reporting pursuant to part 218 of 
this chapter.
    (e) If the person served with a notice of noncompliance requests a 
hearing on the record pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii) or paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section, penalties shall accrue each day until the person 
corrects the violations set forth in the notice of noncompliance. The 
Director, MMS, may suspend the requirement to correct the violations 
pending completion of the hearings provided by this section, but only if 
the Director, MMS, suspends the obligation in writing, and then only 
upon a determination, at the discretion of the Director, that such 
suspension will not be detrimental to the lessor and upon submission and 
acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss 
or damage. The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover any 
disputed amounts plus accrued penalties and interest. The MMS may 
require, at any time, adjustment in the amount of the bond for increases 
in the amount of the underlying obligations determined by MMS to be due, 
for penalties or for interest.
    (f) Hearing. If a person served with a notice of noncompliance has 
requested a hearing on the record in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(3)(iii) or (b)(4) of this section, the hearing shall be conducted by 
an Administrative Law Judge (Departmental), Office of Hearings and 
Appeals. After the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue a 
decision in accordance with the evidence presented and applicable law. 
Any party to a case adversely affected by a decision of the 
Administrative Law Judge may appeal that decision to the Interior Board 
of Land Appeals in accordance with the procedures set forth in 43 CFR 
part 4. A decision by the Interior Board of Land Appeals shall be a 
final order which may be appealed in accordance with paragraph (i) of 
this section.
    (g) The Director of the MMS shall issue an order assessing the 
penalty, in accordance with the penalty notice, against any person 
subject to penalties under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section who does 
not request a hearing on the record as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) 
or (b)(4) of this section. The penalty assessment must be paid within 30 
days of its issuance and shall be a final order subject to collection 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (j) of this section.
    (h) On a case-by-case basis the Secretary, or his/her authorized 
representative, may compromise or reduce civil penalties under this 
section. The amount of any penalty under this section, as finally 
determined, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to 
the person charged.
    (i) Any person who has requested a hearing in accordance with 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section within the time prescribed for such 
a hearing and who is aggrieved by a final order may seek review of such 
order in the U.S. District Court for the judicial district in which the 
violation allegedly took place. Review by the District Court shall be 
only on the administrative record and not de novo. Such action shall be 
barred unless filed within 90 days after the final order.

[[Page 225]]

    (j) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty 
under this section after the order making the assessment has become a 
final order, and if such person has not filed a petition for judicial 
review in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, or, after a 
court, in an action brought under this section, has entered a final 
judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Court shall have jurisdiction to 
award the amount assessed plus interest assessed from the date of the 
expiration of the 90-day period referred to in paragraph (i) of this 
section. The amount of any penalty, as finally determined, may be 
deducted from any sum owing by the United States to the person charged.

United States the amount of which is difficult or impracticable of 
ascertainment. Therefore, the following amounts shall be deemed to cover 
such loss or damage and shall be payable upon receipt of notice from the 
Associate Director of such loss or damage.
    (a) For failure to comply with a written order or instructions of 
the Associate Director, $250 if compliance is not obtained within the 
time specified.
    (b) For failure to file sales contracts or division orders as 
required by lease terms, $25 for each violation, and for failure to 
submit pipeline run tickets, or other proper evidence of disposal as 
required by these regulations, $10 for each violation.

Sec. 243.2  Suspension of orders or decisions pending appeal.

    (a) Compliance with any orders or decisions issued by the Royalty

including orders for payments of royalty deficiencies (other than orders 
to pay additional royalties for the difference between a cents-per-ton 
royalty clause and an ad volorem royalty clause pursuant to the terms of 
coal leases following readjustment by the Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM)), rentals, interest, penalties (other than civil penalties 
provided for under section 109 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
Management Act of 1982, 30 U.S.C. 1719, and implemented in 30 CFR

that the decision or order shall not be suspended pending appeal. Unless 
the amount under appeal is $1,000 or less, suspension of an order or 
decision requiring the payment of a specified amount of money shall be 
contingent upon the appellant's submission within a time period 
prescribed by MMS of an MMS-specified surety instrument deemed adequate 
to indemnify the lessor from loss or damage. Nothing in this paragraph 
shall be construed to prohibit an appellant from paying any demanded 
amount pending appeal. If the appeal is granted in whole or in part, the 
appellant will be entitled to a refund of the amount paid, without 
interest, in accordance with MMS refund procedures.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, an ``MMS-specified surety 
instrument'' for fluids (oil, gas, and geothermal) leases means either: 
An MMS-specified administrative appeal bond; an MMS-specified 
irrevocable letter of credit; Treasury book-entry bond or note; or 
financial institution book-entry certificate of deposit. The ``MMS-
specified surety instrument'' shall be in a form specified by MMS 
instructions or approved by MMS. A bond must be issued by a qualified 
surety company which has been approved by the Department of the 
Treasury. An irrevocable letter of credit or a certificate of deposit 
must be from a financial institution acceptable to MMS with a minimum 1-
year period of coverage subject to automatic renewal up to 5 years. The 
MMS will use a bankrating service to determine whether a financial 
institution has an acceptable rating to provide a surety instrument 
deemed adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss or damage. The MMS 
will accept only an ``MMS-specified surety instrument'' as qualified in 
this paragraph and in paragraph (c) of this section. The MMS will accept 
a single surety instrument that covers multiple amounts under appeal. 
The single surety instrument must be amended annually to either add new 
amounts or remove amounts that have been adjudicated. New amounts under 
appeal each year require a separate surety instrument until covered by 
the single surety instrument during the annual amendment.
    (2) For purposes of this section, an ``MMS-specified surety 
instrument'' for other than fluids (oil, gas, and geothermal) leases, is 
the BLM lease surety instrument which must be increased at the request 
of MMS to cover royalty and interest obligations. However, if BLM has no 
lease surety instrument coverage, or the appellant chooses to provide a 
separate surety instrument to MMS, or the appellant is not the lessee of 
record, then an ``MMS-specified surety instrument'' in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section is required.
    (3) The ``MMS-specified surety instrument'' for RMP is subject to 
approval by a bond-approving officer. The designated bond-approving 
officer for RMP is the Associate Director for Royalty Management or 
delegated officials. The MMS will provide in writing to the appellant 
information and standard forms on ``MMS-specified surety instrument'' 
requirements.
    (c)(1) The amount of the bond, letter of credit, Treasury book-entry 
bond or note, or financial institution book-entry certificate of deposit 
will be determined by MMS and will include the principal amount owed 
plus any accrued interest owed and projected interest for a 1-year 
period. In the case of Treasury book-entry bonds or notes, the amount 
must be equal to 120 percent of the required surety amount.

[[Page 227]]

    (2) If a decision on the appeal is not made within 1 year from the 
date the appeal is filed, appellants who submitted a bond shall amend 
the bond amount to cover additional estimated interest for another 1-
year period. Appellants who submitted a letter of credit, a Treasury 
book-entry bond or note, or a financial institution book-entry 
certificate of deposit shall submit, at least 10 calendar days prior to 
the expiration date, a new surety instrument or an amendment to the 
existing surety instrument for an additional 1-year period of time with 
an increase in the amount to cover estimated interest for a 1-year 
period. In all cases, MMS will determine the additional estimated 
interest and amended surety instrument amount. If a surety instrument is 
not amended to include the additional interest coverage at least 10 
calendar days prior to the expiration date of the surety instrument, MMS 
may make a demand against and collect from the surety. The collection 
against the surety will include the principal amount owed plus accrued 
interest.
    (d)(1) An MMS decision or order that is appealed to the Interior 
Board of Land Appeals pursuant to 30 CFR part 290 and 43 CFR part 4, 
shall be suspended pending appeal if the appellant submits or maintains 
a surety instrument in accordance with the provisions of this section, 
unless the Director or the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs (when 
Indian lands are involved) notifies the appellant in writing at the time 
the decision or order is issued that it will not be suspended pending 
appeal. The Director or the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs may 
deny suspension of an appeal to avoid irreparable harm to the lessor.
    (2) In any case where the Director of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals or the Secretary takes jurisdiction of an administrative appeal 
involving a Royalty Management Program decision or order pursuant to 43 
CFR part 4.5 and grants a suspension of effectiveness of the decision or 
order subject to the submission of an adequate surety instrument, the 
appellant must maintain that surety instrument in accordance with the 
requirements of this section.
    (e) An Interior Board of Land Appeals decision, other final action 
of the Department of the Interior regarding a Royalty Management Program 
decision or order, or a Royalty Management Program decision or order 
which is made effective pending appeal under paragraph (a), which is the 
subject of an action for judicial review in a United States District 
Court of competent jurisdiction will be suspended pending judicial 
review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 705 if the plaintiff seeking review submits 
or maintains a surety instrument in accordance with the provisions of 
this section, unless the Government notifies the court that it will not 
agree to a suspension of the effectiveness of the decision or order 
pending judicial review.
    (f) The MMS may initiate collection against a surety instrument if:
    (1) The MMS Director decides an administrative appeal adversely to 
the appellant, and the appellant fails either to pay the disputed amount 
or pursue a further administrative appeal and maintain an adequate 
surety instrument pending such appeal;
    (2) The Interior Board of Land Appeals, the Director of the Office 
of Hearings and Appeals, an Assistant Secretary, or the Secretary 
decides an administrative appeal adversely to the appellant, and the 
appellant fails either to pay the disputed amount or pursue judicial 
review and maintain an adequate surety instrument pending such judicial 
review, in accordance with paragraph (e);
    (3) A court of competent jurisdiction issues a final nonappealable 
decision adverse to the appellant/plaintiff and the appellant/plaintiff 
fails to pay the disputed amount; or
    (4) The appellant fails to increase the amount of the surety 
instrument as required under paragraph (c) or otherwise fails to 
maintain an adequate surety instrument in effect.

Sec. 243.3  Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

    In order to exhaust administrative remedies, a decision or order of 
MMS' Royalty Management Program must be appealed pursuant to 30 CFR part 
290 to the Director (or the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs when 
Indian lands are involved), and subsequently

[[Page 228]]

to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 290.7 and 43 CFR 
part 4 unless the order has been made effective by the Director, or by 
the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, or by the 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, or by the Interior Board of Land 
Appeals pursuant to 43 CFR part 4, as applicable.

writing, of any addressee changes.
    (3) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence 
concerning onshore Federal leases is the current lessee of record with 
the Bureau of Land Management. For Indian leases, the addressee of 
record is the current lessee of record with the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs. For offshore leases, the addressee of record is the current 
lessee of record with the MMS Offshore Minerals Management Program. The 
lessee is responsible for notifying the appropriate Government office of 
any addressee changes.
    (4) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence in 
connection with reviews and audits of payor records is the position 
title, department name and address, or individual name and address 
designated, in writing, by the company at the initiation of the audit, 
or the most recent addressee that was specified, in writing, by the 
payor.
    (5) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence 
relating to reporting on the ``Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance'' 
(Form MMS-2014) is the most recent position title, department name and 
address, or individual name and address specified, in writing, by the 
payor. The payor is responsible for notifying the Royalty Management 
Program, in writing, of any addressee changes.
    (6) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence in 
connection with remittances pertaining to rental and bonuses from 
nonproducing Federal leases is the most recent position title, 
department name and address, or individual name and address maintained 
in RMP records. The payor is responsible for notifying RMP, in writing, 
of any addressee changes.
    (7) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence 
including orders, demands, invoices, or decisions, and other actions 
identified with payors reporting to the RMP Auditing and Financial 
System not identified above is the position title, department name and 
address or individual name and address for the payor identified on the 
most recent Payor Confirmation Report (Report No. ARR 290R) of a Payor 
Information Form (PIF) (Form MMS-4025 or Form MMS-4030) returned by RMP 
to the payor for the Federal or

[[Page 229]]

Indian lease (see 30 CFR 210.51 and 210.201).
    (8) In the event official correspondence is applicable to more than 
one category identified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (7) of this 
section, MMS may serve the official correspondence in accordance with 
the requirements of any one paragraph.
    (c) Dates of service. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, official correspondence is considered served on the date that 
it is received at the address of record established in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section, as evidenced by a signed receipt of any 
person at that address. If official correspondence is served both 
personally and by registered or certified mail, the date of service is 
the earlier of the two dates, if they are different.
    (d) Constructive service. (1) If delivery cannot be consummated 
after reasonable effort at the address of record established in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, official correspondence 
will be deemed to have been constructively served 7 days after the date 
that the document is mailed.
    (2) This provision covers such situations as nondelivery because the 
addressee has moved without filing a forwarding address, the forwarding 
order had expired, delivery was expressly refused, or the document was 
unclaimed where the attempt to deliver is substantiated by U.S. Postal 
Service authorities.

drilled and determined to be producible in paying quantities in 
accordance with 30 CFR 250.1603.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, suspensions 
under this section may be granted for periods of time each of which 
shall not exceed 5 years.
    (f) When the Regional Supervisor orders or approves a suspension 
pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the term of the 
lease shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period that 
the suspension is in effect, except that no lease shall be so extended 
when the suspension is the result of the lessee's gross negligence or 
willful violation of the lease or governing regulations.
    (g) The Regional Supervisor may, at any time within the period 
prescribed for a suspension issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, require the lessee to submit a plan for approval, disapproval, 
or modification in accordance with subpart B, Exploration and 
Development and Production Plans.
    (h)(1) When the Regional Supervisor directs or grants a suspension 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Regional Supervisor 
may require the lessee to conduct a site-specific study(s) to identify 
and evaluate the cause(s) of the hazard(s) generating the suspension, 
the potential damage from the hazard(s), and the measures available for 
mitigating the hazard(s). A reasonable scope of the study(s) shall be 
approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall 
furnish copies and all results of the study(s) to the Regional

lessee shall submit, when deemed appropriate by the Regional Supervisor, 
a revised Exploration Plan or a revised Development and Production Plan 
in accordance with Sec. 250.204 of this part. The revised plan shall 
incorporate the mitigating measures required by the Regional Supervisor. 
In choosing between alternative mitigating measures, the Regional 
Supervisor will balance the cost of the required measures against the 
reduction or potential reduction in damage or threat of damage or harm 
to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any 
mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), to the national 
security or defense, or to

[[Page 250]]

the marine, coastal, or human environment.
    (i) The lessee must submit with a request for a suspension of 
production the reasons for requesting the suspension, a schedule of work 
leading to the commencement or restoration of production or any other 
operation or activity, and any other information the Regional Supervisor 
may require.
    (j) Any suspension may be terminated at any time when the Director 
determines that the circumstances which justified the granting of the 
suspension no longer exist. When the Director terminates a suspension 
prior to the end of the period of time for which the suspension was 
originally granted, the Director shall specify in the notice of 
termination the reason(s) for the termination and the effective date for 
the termination of the suspension.
    (k) Any suspension shall terminate automatically upon the 
commencement of production or any other suspended operation or activity.

Sec. 250.111  Determination of well producibility.

    Upon receiving a written request from the lessee, the District 
Supervisor will determine whether a well is capable of producing in 
paying quantities (production of oil, gas, or both in quantities 
sufficient to yield a return in excess of the costs, after completion of 
the well, of producing the hydrocarbons at the wellhead.) Such a 
determination shall be based upon the following:
    (a) A production test for oil wells shall be of at least 2 hours' 
duration following stabilization of flow. A deliverability test for gas 
wells shall be of at least 2 hours' duration following stabilization of 
flow or a four-point back-pressure test. The lessee shall provide the 
District Supervisor a reasonable opportunity to witness all tests. Test 
data accompanied by the lessee's affidavit, or third-party test data, 
may be accepted in lieu of a witnessed test, provided prior approval is 
obtained from the District Supervisor.
    (b) In the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region, the following shall also be 
considered collectively as reliable evidence that a well is capable of 
producing oil or gas in paying quantities:
    (1) A resistivity or induction electric log of the well showing a 
minimum of 15 feet of producible sand in one section that does not 
include any interval which appears to be water-saturated. In some cases, 
wells with less than 15 feet of producible sand in one section may be 
approved by the District Supervisor. All of the section counted as 
producible shall exhibit the following properties:
    (i) Electrical spontaneous potential exceeding 20-negative 
millivolts beyond the shale base line. If mud conditions prevent a 20-
negative millivolt reading beyond the shale base line, a gamma ray log 
deflection of at least 70 percent of the maximum gamma ray deflection in 
the nearest clean water-bearing sand may be substituted.
    (ii) A minimum true resistivity ratio of the producible section to 
the nearest clean water-bearing sand of at least 5:1.
    (2) A log indicating sufficient porosity in the producible section.
    (3) Sidewall cores and core analyses which indicate that the section 
is capable of producing oil or gas or evidence that an attempt was made 
to obtain such cores.
    (4) A wireline formation test and/or mud-logging analysis which 
indicates that the section is capable of producing oil or gas, or 
evidence that an attempt was made to obtain such tests.

Sec. 250.112  Cancellation of leases.

    (a)(1) The Secretary may terminate a suspension and cancel a lease 
as follows after notice and opportunity for a hearing when:
    (i) Continued activity pursuant to the lease or permit would 
probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other 
aquatic life), property, other mineral deposits (in areas leased or not 
leased), or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
    (ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time;
    (iii) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of 
continuing the lease or permit in force; and

[[Page 251]]

    (iv) The suspension has been in effect for at least 5 years, or the 
termination of suspension and lease cancellation are at the request of 
the lessee.
    (2) If a lease is cancelled under this section or under part 256 of 
this title, the lessee shall be entitled to compensation pursuant to the 
provisions of this section.
    (b) Whenever an Exploration Plan is disapproved because the Regional 
Supervisor determines that approval of the activities called for in the 
plan would probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish 
and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased 
or not leased), the national security or defense, or to the marine, 
coastal, or human environment and the proposed activity cannot be 
modified to avoid these dangers, the Secretary, once the primary lease 
term has been extended continuously for a period of 5 years following 
the disapproval or upon request of the lessee at an earlier time, may 
terminate the suspension or temporary prohibition and cancel the lease, 
and the lessee shall be entitled to compensation pursuant to paragraph 
(f) of this section.
    (c)(1) Where a Development and Production Plan is submitted before 
the subsequent approval of a Coastal Zone Management (CZM) program for 
an affected State, pursuant to the CZMA, and the plan is disapproved by 
the Regional Supervisor pursuant to Sec. 250.204(k)(3)(ii), the 
following may occur:
    (i) The term of the lease shall be duly extended and, at any time 
within 5 years after such disapproval, the lessee may reapply for 
approval of the same or a modified plan, and the Regional Supervisor 
shall approve, disapprove, or require modification of the plan in 
accordance with the provisions in Sec. 250.204.
    (ii) Upon expiration of the 5-year period described in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section or, at the Secretary's discretion, at an 
earlier time upon request of the lessee, if the Regional Supervisor has 
not approved a plan or required the lessee to submit a Development and 
Production Plan for approval or modification, the Secretary shall cancel 
the lease, and the lessee shall be entitled to compensation pursuant to 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation when a lease 
expires.
    (e) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation when a lease is 
cancelled where the following circumstances exist:
    (1) A Development and Production Plan submitted after approval of a 
State's CZM program, pursuant to the CZMA, is disapproved because the 
lessee does not receive concurrence by the State pursuant to section 
307(c)(3)(B) (i) or (ii) of the CZMA, and the Secretary of Commerce does 
not make the finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the 
CZMA;
    (2) A lessee fails to submit a Development and Production Plan in 
accordance with Sec. 250.204 or fails to comply with an approved plan;
    (3) The owner of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with a 
provision of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued under the 
Act, and the default continues for a period of 30 days after the mailing 
of a notice by registered letter to the lessee;
    (4) A Development and Production Plan is disapproved because of a 
failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of applicable 
Federal law, or
    (5) A producing lease is forfeited or is cancelled pursuant to 
section (5)(d) of the Act.
    (f) Cancellation of a lease under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section shall entitle the lessee to receive such compensation as 
the lessee shows the Director as being equal to the lesser of the 
following:
    (1) The fair value of the cancelled rights as of the date of 
cancellation, taking into account both anticipated revenues from the 
lease and costs reasonably anticipated on the lease, including costs of 
compliance with all applicable regulations and operating orders and 
liability for cleanup costs or damages, or both, in the case of an oil 
spill; or
    (2) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenues from the lease 
(plus interest thereon from the date of receipt

[[Page 252]]

to date of reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and 
all direct expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of 
the lease and in connection with exploration or development, or both, 
pursuant to the lease (plus interest on this consideration and 
expenditures from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except as 
follows:
    (i) With respect to leases issued before September 18, 1978, 
compensation shall be equal to the amount specified in paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section, and
    (ii) In the case of jointly held leases which are cancelled due to 
the failure of one or more partners to exercise due diligence, innocent 
party(s) shall have the right to seek damages for losses from the 
responsible party(s) and the right to acquire the interests of the 
negligent party(s) and be issued the lease in question.

Sec. 250.113  How does production, drilling, or well-reworking affect your lease term?

    (a) Your lease expires at the end of its primary term unless you are 
producing or conducting drilling or well-reworking operations on your 
lease. See Sec. 256.37(b) of this title. Also, any drilling or well-
reworking program must be part of a plan that has as its objective 
continuous production on the lease. For purposes of this section, the 
term ``operations'' means production, drilling, or well-reworking.
    (b) If you stop conducting operations during the last 180 days of 
the primary lease term, your lease will remain in effect beyond the 
primary term only if you:
    (1) Resume operations on the lease no later than 180 days after the 
operations ended; or
    (2) Ask MMS for a suspension of operations or production under 30 
CFR 250.110 before the 180th day after you stop operations, and 
thereafter receive the Regional Supervisor's approval; or
    (3) Receive a directed suspension of operations or production from 
the Regional Supervisor under 30 CFR 250.110 before the 180th day after 
you stop operations.
    (c) If you stop conducting operations on a lease that has continued 
beyond its primary term, then your lease will expire unless you comply 
with either paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section.
    (d) You may ask the Regional Supervisor to allow you more than 180 
days to resume operations on a lease continued beyond its primary term 
when operating conditions warrant. The request must be in writing and 
explain the operating conditions that warrant a longer period. In 
allowing additional time, the Regional Supervisor must determine that 
the longer period is in the national interest and that it conserves 
resources, prevents waste, or protects correlative rights.

Sec. 250.114  Reinjection and subsurface storage of gas.

    (a)(1) The Regional Supervisor may authorize the reinjection of gas 
on the OCS to promote conservation of natural resources and to prevent 
waste when it can be shown that no undue interference with operations 
under existing leases will result.
    (2) An application for reinjection of gas may be approved for the 
purpose of the following:
    (i) Enhanced recovery projects,
    (ii) Preventing of the flaring of casinghead gas, or
    (iii) Other conservation measures approved by the Regional 
Supervisor.
    (b)(1) The Regional Supervisor may authorize subsurface storage of 
gas on the OCS for later commercial benefit when it can be shown that no 
undue interference with operations under existing leases will result.
    (2) In each case authorized in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a 
storage agreement will be required, and the authorization for storage 
will provide for the payment of a storage fee or rental.
    (c) Reinjection or storage of gas may be approved for locations on- 
or off-lease, provided that when gas is reinjected or stored off the 
lease or unit from which it was produced, royalties shall be paid at the 
time the gas is first produced. Gas produced from a reservoir containing 
both reinjected or

[[Page 253]]

stored gas and gas original to the reservoir shall be presumed to be 
made up of proportionate amounts of injected or stored gas and gas 
original to the reservoir in accordance with a formula approved or 
prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
    (d) The use of all or any part of a lease area for subsurface 
storage of gas shall not affect the continuance or expiration of such 
lease.
    (e) Gas may not be stored on unleased lands unless a right of use 
and easement for that purpose has been approved by the Regional 
Supervisor in accordance with Sec. 250.107.
    (f) Reinjection or storage of gas will not be approved when the gas 
is to be injected into the cap rock of a salt dome known to contain a 
sulphur deposit, unless the injection of gas is necessary to the 
recovery of oil and gas contained in the cap rock, and the applicant can 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Supervisor that the 
injection of gas will not significantly increase potential hazards to 
present or future sulphur mining operations.

    (a) Platforms, structures, artificial islands, and mobile drilling 
units which have helicopter landing facilities shall be identified with 
at least one sign using letters and figures not less than 12 inches in 
height. Signs for units without helicopter landing facilities shall use 
letters and figures not less than 3 inches in height. Signs shall be 
affixed at a location that is visible to approaching traffic and shall 
contain the following information which may be abbreviated:
    (1) Name of the lease operator,
    (2) The area designation based on OCS Official Protraction Diagrams 
(except in the Pacific OCS Region),
    (3) The block number (lease number in the Pacific OCS Region) in 
which the facility is located, and
    (4) Platform, structure, or rig name.
    (b) For each singly completed well, the lease number and well number 
shall be painted on the wellhead or on a sign affixed to the wellhead. 
In wells with multiple completions, each completion shall be 
individually identified at the wellhead. For subsea wellheads, the 
required sign shall be affixed to the flowline at a convenient surface 
location on the platform to which it is connected. All identifying signs 
shall be maintained in a legible condition.

requested reimbursement is proper, the lessee or third party shall be 
reimbursed for the reasonable costs of reproducing such data and 
information at the lessee's or third party's lowest rate or at the 
lowest commercial rate established in the area, whichever is less.
    (b) When processed or reprocessed geological or geophysical 
information is submitted to MMS pursuant to the requirements of this 
part (whether retained by the Regional Supervisor or not) and upon 
receipt of a request for reimbursement no later than 90 days from the 
date of delivery and a determination by the Regional Supervisor that the 
requested reimbursement is proper, the lessee or third party shall be 
reimbursed for the reasonable costs attributable to processing and 
reprocessing such information (as distinguished from the cost of data 
acquisition) but only if the processing or reprocessing was in the form 
and manner of processing other than that used in the normal conduct of 
the lessee's business and was done at the specific request of the 
Regional Supervisor.
    (c) Requests for reimbursement shall identify processing and 
reprocessing costs separate from acquisition costs.
    (d) The lessee shall not be reimbursed for the costs of analyzing 
geological information or for interpreting geological or geophysical

Sec. 250.118  Data and information to be made available to the public.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or in 
Sec. 252.7 of this chapter, geophysical data, processed geophysical 
information, reprocessed geophysical information, and interpreted 
geological and geophysical information, submitted at any time pursuant 
to the requirements of this part, shall not be available for public 
inspection without the consent of the lessee as long as the lease 
remains in effect, or for a period of 10 years after the date of 
submission, whichever is less, unless the Director determines that:
    (1) The data and information are needed to unitize operations on 2 
or more leases, to ensure proper plans of development for competitive 
reservoirs, or to promote operational safety or protection of the 
environment, and the data and information are shown only to persons with 
an interest in the issue,
    (2) The geological and geophysical data and information are 
necessary for specific scientific or research purposes for the 
Government and the release of such data and information would further 
the nation interest without unduly damaging the competitive position of 
the lessee.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or in 
Sec. 252.7 of this chapter, geological data and analyzed geological 
information submitted pursuant to the requirements of this part, shall 
not be available for public inspection without the consent of the lessee 
except under one of the following conditions based on the status of the 
lease at the time of release of the data and information:
    (1) For leases no longer in effect, the data and information will be 
released.
    (2) For a lease in effect, and within the primary term specified in 
the lease, the data and information may be released 2 years after 
submission of the data or information or 60 days after a lease sale such 
that any portion of an offered block is within 50 miles of a well, 
whichever is later. For the purpose of this paragraph 2, the primary 
term specified in a lease shall be deemed to be extended for a period of 
time equal to the period of time for which a suspension of operations is 
granted pursuant to Sec. 250.110 of this part; provided that the primary 
term specified in a lease shall not be deemed to be extended for a 
suspension of operations directed in accordance with Sec. 250.110 (b)(1) 
of this part.
    (3) For leases in effect and beyond the primary term specified in 
the lease, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, data 
and information will be released 2 years after submission.
    (4) For all leases, the data and information may be released if the 
Director determines that:
    (i) The data and information are needed to unitize operations on 2 
or more leases, to ensure proper plans of development for competitive 
reservoirs, or to promote operational safety or protection of the 
environment, and the data and information are shown only to persons with 
an interest in the issue;
    (ii) The geological data and information are necessary for specific 
scientific or research purposes for the Government and the release of 
such data and information would further the

[[Page 255]]

national interest without unduly damaging the competitive position of 
the lessee.
    (c) Geophysical data, geological data, processed geological and 
geophysical information, and interpreted geological and geophysical 
information collected on a lease with high-resolution systems 
(including, but not limited to, bathymetry, side-scan sonar, subbottom 
profiler, and magnetometer) in compliance with requirements concerning 
protection of environmental aspects of the lease may be made available 
to the public 60 days after submittal to the Regional Supervisor. 
However, unless the lessee can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Regional Supervisor that release of the data or information would unduly 
damage the lessee's competitive position, the Regional Supervisor may 
release the data and information at an earlier time if the Regional 
Supervisor determines it is needed by affected States to make 
determinations under subpart B, Exploration and Development and 
Production Plans, of this part.
    (d) Data and information identified on Forms MMS-123 through MMS-128 
are protected as follows:

the area where the archaeological resource may be; or
    (ii) Establish to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that an 
archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely affected 
by operations. This shall be done by further archaeological 
investigation, conducted by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using 
survey equipment and techniques deemed necessary by the Regional 
Director. A report on the investigation shall be submitted to the 
Regional Director for review.
    (2) If the Regional Director determines that an archaeological 
resource is likely to be present in the lease area and may be adversely 
affected by operations, the Regional Director will notify the lessee 
immediately. The lessee shall take no action that may adversely affect 
the archaeological resource until the Regional Director has told the 
lessee how to protect it.
    (b) If the lessee discovers any archaeological resource while 
conducting operations in the lease area, the lessee shall immediately 
halt operations within the area of the discovery and report the 
discovery to the Regional Director. If investigations determine that the

Sec. 250.201  Preliminary activities.

    Preliminary activities are geological, geophysical, and other 
surveys necessary to develop a comprehensive Exploration Plan or 
Development and Production Plan. Such preliminary activities are those 
which do not result in any physical penetration of the seabed of greater 
than 500 feet and which do not result in any significant adverse impact 
on the natural resources of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The 
Regional Supervisor may require prior notification of the type, scope, 
and timing of any survey.


<R05>
Sec. 250.202  Well location and spacing.

    (a) The Regional Supervisor is authorized to approve well location 
and spacing programs necessary for exploration and development of a 
leased sulphur deposit or fluid hydrocarbon reservoir giving 
consideration to, among other factors, the location of drilling units 
and platforms, extent and thickness of the sulphur deposit, geological 
and other reservoir characteristics, number of wells that can be 
economically drilled, protection of correlative rights, optimum recovery 
of resources, minimization of risk to the environment, and prevention of 
any unreasonable interference with other uses of the OCS. Well location 
and spacing programs shall be determined independently for each leased 
sulphur deposit or hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir in a manner that will 
locate wells in the optimum position for the most effective production 
of sulphur and/or reservoir fluids and avoid the drilling of unnecessary 
wells.
    (b) For wells which could intersect or drain an offset property, the 
Regional Supervisor may require special measures to protect the rights 
of the lessor and objecting offset lessees.
    (c) The lessee shall drill and produce the wells the Regional 
Supervisor determines are necessary to protect the

[[Page 260]]

lessor from loss by reason of production on other properties or in lieu 
thereof, with the approval of the Regional Supervisor, pay a sum 
determined by the Regional Supervisor as adequate to compensate the 
lessor for the lessee's failure to drill and produce any well. Payment 
of that sum shall be considered as the equivalent of production in 
paying quantities for the purpose of extending the lease term.

modification of a plan. For plans requiring modification, the Regional 
Supervisor shall also notify the lessee in writing of the conditions 
that must be met for plan approval.
    (k)(1) The lessee may resubmit an Exploration Plan, as modified, to 
the Regional Supervisor in the same manner as for a new plan. Only 
information related to the proposed modifications need be submitted. The 
Regional Supervisor shall approve, disapprove, or require modification 
of the resubmitted plan based upon the criteria in paragraph (i) of this 
section within 30 days of the resubmission date.
    (2) An Exploration Plan which has been disapproved pursuant to 
paragraph (i)(3) of this section may be resubmitted if there is a change 
in the conditions which caused it to be disapproved. The Regional 
Supervisor shall approve, require modification, or disapprove such a 
plan within 30 days of the resubmission date.
    (l) When a State objects to a lessee's coastal zone consistency 
certification, the lessee shall modify the plan to accommodate the 
State's objection(s) and resubmit the plan to--
    (1) The Regional Supervisor for review pursuant to the criteria in 
paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of this section; and
    (2) Through the Regional Supervisor to the State for review pursuant 
to the CZMA and the implementing regulations (15 CFR 930.83 and 930.84).

Alternatively, the lessee may appeal the State's objection to the 
Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the procedures described in section 
307 of the CZMA and the implementing regulations (subpart H of 15 CFR 
part 930). The Regional Supervisor shall approve or disapprove a plan as 
resubmitted within 30 days of the resubmission date.

    (m) If the Regional Supervisor disapproves an Exploration Plan, the 
Secretary may, subject to the provisions of section 5(a)(2)(B) of the 
Act and the implementing regulations in Sec. 250.112 and 256.77 of this 
chapter II, cancel the lease(s), and the lessee shall be entitled to 
compensation in accordance with section 5(a)(2)(c) of the Act.
    (n)(1) The Regional Supervisor shall periodically review the 
activities being conducted under an approved Exploration Plan and may 
request updated information on schedules and procedures. The frequency 
and extent of the Regional Supervisor's review shall be based upon the 
significance of any changes in available information and in other 
onshore or offshore conditions affecting or affected by exploration 
activities being conducted pursuant to the plan. If the review indicates 
that the plan should be revised to meet the requirements of this part, 
the Regional Supervisor shall require the needed revision.
    (2) Revisions to an approved or pending Exploration Plan, whether 
initiated by the lessee or ordered by the Regional Supervisor, shall be 
submitted to the Regional Supervisor for approval. Only information 
related to the proposed revisions need be submitted. When the Regional 
Supervisor determines that a proposed revision could result in a 
significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated or 
requires additional permits, the revisions shall be subject to all of 
the procedures in this section.
    (o) To ensure safety and protection of the environment and 
archaeological resources, the Regional Director may authorize or direct 
the lessee to conduct geological, geophysical, biological, 
archaeological, or other surveys or monitoring programs. The lessee 
shall provide the Regional Director, upon request, with copies of any 
data obtained as a result of those surveys and monitoring programs.
    (p) The lessee may not drill any well until the District 
Supervisor's approval of an Application for Permit to Drill (APD), 
submitted in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 250.414 of this 
part, has been received. The District Supervisor shall not approve any 
APD until all affected States with approved CZM programs have concurred 
or have been conclusively presumed to concur with the applicant's 
coastal zone consistency certification accompanying a plan, or the 
Secretary of Commerce has made the finding authorized by section 
307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA. The APD's must conform to the activities 
described in detail in the approved Exploration Plan and shall not be 
subject to a separate State coastal zone consistency review.
    (q) Nothing in this section or in an approved plan shall limit the 
lessee's responsibility to take appropriate measures to meet emergency 
situations. In such situations, the Regional Supervisor may approve or 
require departures from an approved Exploration Plan.

comments and recommendations shall be made available to the public.
    (i) The plan will be processed in accordance with the regulations in 
this section and the regulations governing Federal CZM consistency 
procedures (15 CFR part 930).
    (j) The Regional Supervisor shall evaluate the environmental impact 
of the activities described in the Development and Production Plan and 
prepare the appropriate environmental documentation in accordance with 
NEPA. At least once in each planning area, as identified by the 
Director, other than the western and central GOM planning areas, the 
Director shall determine that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is 
required. A determination by the Director that approval of a Development 
and Production Plan requires proceedings under NEPA shall have no effect 
upon the timeframe that a State has to complete its coastal zone 
consistency review. Copies of the draft EIS shall be transmitted to the 
Governor of each affected State and the executive of each affected local 
government that requests a copy. The Regional Supervisor shall also make 
copies of the draft EIS available to any appropriate Federal Agency, 
interstate entity, and the public.
    (k) Prior to or immediately after a determination by the Director 
that approval of a Development and Production Plan requires that the 
procedures under NEPA shall commence, the Regional Supervisor may 
require lessees of tracts in the vicinity, for which Development and 
Production Plans have not been approved, to submit preliminary or final 
plans for their leases.
    (l) No later than 60 days after the last day of the comment period 
provided in paragraph (h) of this section or within 60 days of the 
release of the final EIS describing the proposed activities, the 
Regional Supervisor shall accomplish the following:
    (1) Approve the plan;
    (2) Require modification of the plan if it is determined that the 
lessee has failed to make adequate provisions for safety, environmental 
protection, or conservation of resources including compliance with the 
regulations prescribed under the Act; or
    (3) Disapprove the plan if one or more of the following occurs:
    (i) The lessee fails to demonstrate that compliance with the 
requirements of the Act, provisions of the regulations prescribed under 
the Act, or other applicable Federal laws is possible;
    (ii) State concurrence with the applicant's coastal zone consistency 
certification has not been received, the State's concurrence has not 
been conclusively presumed, or the State objects to the consistency 
certification, and the Secretary of Commerce does not make the 
determination authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA;
    (iii) Operations threaten national security or defense; or
    (iv) Exceptional geological conditions in the lease area, 
exceptional resource value in the marine or coastal environment, or 
other exceptional circumstances exist, and all of the following:
    (A) Implementation of the plan would probably cause serious harm or 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any 
mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), the national security 
or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environments.
    (B) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time.
    (C) The advantages of disapproving the plan outweigh the advantages 
of development and production.
    (m) The Regional Supervisor shall notify the lessee in writing of 
the reason(s) for disapproving a Development and Production Plan or for 
requiring modification of a plan and the conditions which must be met 
for plan approval.
    (n) The lessee may resubmit a Development and Production Plan, as 
modified, to the Regional Supervisor. Only information related to the 
proposed modifications need be submitted. Within 60 days following the 
60-day comment period provided for in paragraph (h) of this section, the 
Regional Supervisor shall approve, disapprove, or require modification 
of the modified plan.

[[Page 270]]

    (o)(1) If a Development and Production Plan is disapproved for the 
sole reason that a State consistency certification has not been 
obtained, the Regional Supervisor shall approve the plan upon receipt of 
the concurrence, at the time when concurrence is conclusively presumed, 
or when the Secretary of Commerce makes a finding authorized by section 
307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA.
    (2) If a Development and Production Plan is disapproved because a 
State objects to the lessee's coastal zone consistency certification, 
the lessee shall modify the plan to accommodate the State's objection(s) 
and resubmit the plan to (i) the Regional Supervisor for review pursuant 
to the criteria in paragraph (l) of this section; and (ii) through the 
Regional Supervisor, to the State for review pursuant to the CZMA and 
the implementing regulations (15 CFR 930.83 and 930.84). Alternatively, 
the lessee may appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of Commerce 
pursuant to the procedures described in section 307 of the CZMA and the 
implementing regulations (subpart H of 15 CFR part 930). The Regional 
Supervisor shall approve, disapprove, or require modification of a plan 
as revised within 60 days following the 60-day comment period provided 
for in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (p) Development and Production Plans disapproved pursuant to 
paragraph (l)(3) of this section are subject to the provisions of 
section 25(h)(2) of the Act and the implementing regulations in 
Secs. 250.112 and 256.77 of this chapter.
    (q)(1) The Regional Supervisor shall periodically review the 
activities being conducted under an approved Development and Production 
Plan. The frequency and extent of the Regional Supervisor's review shall 
be based upon the significance of any changes in available information 
and onshore or offshore conditions affecting or impacted by development 
or production activities being conducted pursuant to the plan. If the 
review indicates that the plan should be revised to meet the 
requirements of this part, the Regional Supervisor shall require the 
needed revisions.
    (2) Revisions to an approved or pending Development and Production 
Plan, whether initiated by the lessee or ordered by the Regional 
Supervisor, shall be submitted to the Regional Supervisor for approval. 
Only information related to the proposed revisions need be submitted. 
When the Regional Supervisor determines that a proposed revision could 
result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and 
evaluated, requires additional permits, or proposes activities not 
previously identified and evaluated, the revision shall be subject to 
all of the procedures in this section.
    (3) When any revision to an approved Development and Production Plan 
is proposed by the lessee, the Regional Supervisor may approve the 
revision if it is determined that the revision is consistent with the 
protection of the marine, coastal, and human environments and will lead 
to greater recovery of oil and natural gas; will improve the efficiency, 
safety, and environmental protection of the recovery operation; is the 
only means available to avoid substantial economic hardship to the 
lessee; or is otherwise not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act.
    (r) Whenever the lessee fails to submit a Development and Production 
Plan in accordance with provisions of this section or fails to comply 
with an approved plan, the lease may be cancelled in accordance with 
sections 5 (c) and (d) of the Act and the implementing regulations in 
Secs. 250.112 and 256.77 of this chapter.
    (s) To ensure safety and protection of the environment and 
archaeological resources, the Regional Director may authorize or direct 
the lessee to conduct geological, geophysical, biological, 
archaeological, or other surveys or monitoring programs. The lessee 
shall provide the Regional Director, upon request, copies of any data 
obtained as a result of those surveys and monitoring programs.
    (t) The lessee may not drill any well until the District 
Supervisor's approval of an APD, filed in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 250.414 of this part, has been received. All APD's 
and applications to install platforms and structures, pipelines, and 
production equipment must conform to the activities

[[Page 271]]

described in detail in the approved Development and Production Plan and 
shall not be subject to a separate State coastal zone consistency 
review.
    (u) Nothing in this section or approved plans shall limit the 
lessee's responsibility to take appropriate measures to meet emergency 
situations. In such situations, the Regional Supervisor may approve or 
require departures from an approved Development and Production Plan.

to prevent unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the offshore 
waters. The lessee shall not create conditions that will pose 
unreasonable risk to public health, life, property, aquatic life, 
wildlife, recreation, navigation, commercial fishing, or other uses of 
the ocean.
    (1) When pollution occurs as a result of operations conducted by or 
on behalf of the lessee and the pollution damages or threatens to damage 
life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral 
deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or 
human environment, the control and removal of the pollution to the 
satisfaction of the District Supervisor shall be at the expense of the 
lessee. Immediate corrective action shall be taken in all cases where 
pollution has occurred. Corrective action shall be subject to 
modification when directed by the District Supervisor.
    (2) If the lessee fails to control and remove the pollution, the 
Director, in cooperation with other appropriate Agencies of Federal, 
State, and local governments, or in cooperation with the lessee, or 
both, shall have the right to control and remove the pollution at the 
lessee's expense. Such action shall not relieve the lessee of any 
responsibility provided for by law.
    (b)(1) The District Supervisor may restrict the rate of drilling 
fluid discharges or prescribe alternative discharge methods. The 
District Supervisor may also restrict the use of components which could 
cause unreasonable degradation to the marine environment. No petroleum-
based substances, including diesel fuel, may be added to the drilling 
mud system without prior approval of the District Supervisor.
    (2) Approval of the method of disposal of drill cuttings, sand, and 
other well solids shall be obtained from the District Supervisor.
    (3) All hydrocarbon-handling equipment for testing and production 
such as separators, tanks, and treaters shall be designed, installed, 
and operated to prevent pollution. Maintenance or repairs which are 
necessary to prevent pollution of offshore waters shall be undertaken 
immediately.
    (4) Curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains shall be installed in deck 
areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants not authorized 
for discharge. Oil drainage shall be piped to a properly designed, 
operated, and maintained sump system which will automatically maintain 
the oil at a level sufficient to prevent discharge of oil into offshore 
waters. All gravity drains shall be equipped with a water trap or other 
means to prevent gas in the sump system from escaping through the 
drains. Sump piles shall not be used as processing devices to treat or 
skim liquids but may be used to collect treated-produced water, treated-
produced sand, or liquids from drip pans and deck drains and as a final 
trap for hydrocarbon liquids in the event of equipment upsets. 
Improperly designed, operated, or maintained sump piles which do not 
prevent the discharge of oil into offshore waters shall be replaced or 
repaired.
    (5) On artificial islands, all vessels containing hydrocarbons shall 
be placed inside an impervious berm or otherwise protected to contain 
spills. Drainage shall be directed away from the drilling rig to a sump. 
Drains and sumps shall be constructed to prevent seepage.

[[Page 272]]

    (6) Disposal of equipment, cables, chains, containers, or other 
materials into offshore waters is prohibited.
    (c) Materials, equipment, tools, containers, and other items used in 
the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which are of such shape or 
configuration that they are likely to snag or damage fishing devices 
shall be handled and marked as follows:
    (1) All loose material, small tools, and other small objects shall 
be kept in a suitable storage area or a marked container when not in use 
and in a marked container before transport over offshore waters;
    (2) All cable, chain, or wire segments shall be recovered after use 
and securely stored until suitable disposal is accomplished;
    (3) Skid-mounted equipment, portable containers, spools or reels, 
and drums shall be marked with the owner's name prior to use or 
transport over offshore waters; and
    (4) All markings must clearly identify the owner and must be durable 
enough to resist the effects of the environmental conditions to which 
they may be exposed.
    (d) Any of the items described in paragraph (c) of this section that 
are lost overboard shall be recorded on the facility's daily operations 
report, as appropriate, and reported to the District Supervisor.

<R05>
Sec. 250.302  Definitions concerning air quality.

    For purposes of Secs. 250.303 and 250.304 of this part:
    Air pollutant means any combination of agents for which the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established, pursuant to 
section 109 of the Clean Air Act, national primary or secondary ambient 
air quality standards.
    Attainment area means, for any air pollutant, an area which is shown 
by monitored data or which is calculated by air quality modeling (or 
other methods determined by the Administrator of EPA to be reliable) not 
to exceed any primary or secondary ambient air quality standards 
established by EPA.
    Best available control technology (BACT) means an emission 
limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction for each air 
pollutant subject to regulation, taking into account energy, 
environmental and economic impacts, and other costs. The BACT shall be 
verified on a case-by-case basis by the Regional Supervisor and may 
include reductions achieved through the application of processes, 
systems, and techniques for the control of each air pollutant.
    Emission offsets means emission reductions obtained from facilities, 
either onshore or offshore, other than the facility or facilities 
covered by the proposed Exploration Plan or Development and Production 
Plan.
    Existing facility is an OCS facility described in an Exploration 
Plan or a Development and Production Plan submitted or approved prior to 
June 2, 1980.
    Facility means any installation or device permanently or temporarily 
attached to the seabed which is used for exploration, development, and 
production activities for oil, gas, or sulphur and which emits or has 
the potential to emit any air pollutant from one or more sources. All 
equipment directly associated with the installation or device shall be 
considered part of a single facility if the equipment is dependent on, 
or affects the processes of, the installation or device. During 
production, multiple installations or devices will be considered to be a 
single facility if the installations or devices are directly related to 
the production of oil, gas, or sulphur at a single site. Any vessel used 
to transfer production from an offshore facility shall be considered

[[Page 273]]

part of the facility while physically attached to it.
    Nonattainment area means, for any air pollutant, an area which is 
shown by monitored data or which is calculated by air quality modeling 
(or other methods determined by the Administrator of EPA to be reliable) 
to exceed any primary or secondary ambient air quality standard 
established by EPA.
    Projected emissions means emissions, either controlled or 
uncontrolled, from a source(s).
    Source means an emission point. Several sources may be included 
within a single facility.
    Temporary facility means activities associated with the construction 
of platforms offshore or with facilities related to exploration for or 
development of offshore oil and gas resources which are conducted in one 
location for less than 3 years.
    Volatile organic compound (VOC) means any organic compound which is 
emitted to the atmosphere as a vapor. The unreactive compounds are 
exempt from the above definition.

<R05>
Sec. 250.303  Facilities described in a new or revised Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan.

    (a) New plans. All Exploration Plans and Development and Production 
Plans shall include the information required to make the necessary 
findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section, and the 
lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.
    (b) Applicability of Sec. 250.303 to existing facilities. (1) The 
Regional Supervisor may review any Exploration Plan or Development and 
Production Plan to determine whether any facility described in the plan 
should be subject to review under this section and has the potential to 
significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area. To make these 
decisions, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the distance of the 
facility from shore, the size of the facility, the number of sources 
planned for the facility and their operational status, and the air 
quality status of the onshore area.
    (2) For a facility identified by the Regional Supervisor in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall require 
the lessee to refer to the information required in Sec. 250.203(b)(19) 
or Sec. 250.204(b)(12) of this part and to submit only that information 
required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) 
of this section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 
days of the Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer 
period of time at the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee 
shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.
    (c) Revised facilities. All revised Exploration Plans and 
Development and Production Plans shall include the information required 
to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this 
section. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section 
as necessary.
    (d) Exemption formulas. To determine whether a facility described in 
a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or Development and 
Production Plan is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee 
shall use the highest annual-total amount of emissions from the facility 
for each air pollutant calculated in Sec. 250.203(b)(19)(i)(A) or 
Sec. 250.204(b)(12)(i)(A) of this part and compare these emissions to 
the emission exemption amount ``E'' for each air pollutant calculated 
using the following formulas: E=3400D<SUP>2/3</SUP> for carbon monoxide 
(CO); and E=33.3D for total suspended particulates (TSP), sulphur 
dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>x</INF>), and VOC 
(where E is the emission exemption amount expressed in tons per year, 
and D is the distance of the proposed facility from the closest onshore 
area of a State expressed in statute miles). If the amount of these 
projected emissions is less than or equal to the emission exemption 
amount ``E'' for the air pollutant, the facility is exempt from further 
air quality review required under paragraphs (e) through (i) of this 
section.
    (e) Significance levels. For a facility not exempt under paragraph 
(d) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall 
use an approved air quality model to determine whether the projected 
emissions of those air

[[Page 274]]

pollutants from the facility result in an onshore ambient air 
concentration above the following significance levels:

    Significance Levels: Air pollutant concentrations (<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Significance determinations. (1) The projected emissions of any 
air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which result in an 
onshore ambient air concentration above the significance level 
determined under paragraph (e) of this section for that air pollutant, 
shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area for that air pollutant.
    (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not 
exempt under paragraph (d) of this section for that air pollutant shall 
be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area 
for VOC.
    (g) Controls required. (1) The projected emissions of any air 
pollutant other than VOC from any facility, except a temporary facility, 
which significantly affect the quality of a nonattainment area, shall be 
fully reduced. This shall be done through the application of BACT and, 
if additional reductions are necessary, through the application of 
additional emission controls or through the acquisition of offshore or 
onshore offsets.
    (2) The projected emissions of any air pollutant other than VOC from 
any facility which significantly affect the air quality of an attainment 
or unclassifiable area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (i) Except for temporary facilities, the lessee also shall use an 
approved air quality model to determine whether the emissions of TSP or 
SO<INF>2</INF> that remain after the application of BACT cause the 
following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentrations 
established in 40 CFR 52.21 to be exceeded in the attainment or 
unclassifiable area:

No concentration of an air pollutant shall exceed the concentration 
permitted under the national secondary ambient air quality standard or 
the concentration permitted under the national primary air quality 
standard, whichever concentration is lowest for the air pollutant for 
the period of exposure. For any period other than the annual period, the 
applicable maximum allowable increase may be exceeded during one such 
period per year at any one onshore location.
    (ii) If the maximum allowable increases are exceeded, the lessee 
shall apply whatever additional emission controls are necessary to 
reduce or offset the remaining emissions of TSP or SO<INF>2</INF> so 
that concentrations in the onshore ambient air of an attainment or 
unclassifiable area do not exceed the maximum allowable increases.
    (3)(i) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility, except a 
temporary facility, which significantly affect the onshore air quality 
of a nonattainment area shall be fully reduced. This shall be done 
through the application of BACT and, if additional reductions are 
necessary, through the application of additional emission controls or 
through the acquisition of offshore or onshore offsets.
    (ii) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which 
significantly affect the onshore air quality of an attainment area shall 
be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (4)(i) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect 
the onshore air quality of both a nonattainment and an attainment or 
unclassifiable

[[Page 275]]

area, the regulatory requirements applicable to projected emissions 
significantly affecting a nonattainment area shall apply.
    (ii) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect the 
onshore air quality of more than one class of attainment area, the 
lessee must reduce projected emissions to meet the maximum allowable 
increases specified for each class in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (h) Controls required on temporary facilities. The lessee shall 
apply BACT to reduce projected emissions of any air pollutant from a 
temporary facility which significantly affect the air quality of an 
onshore area of a State.
    (i) Emission offsets. When emission offsets are to be obtained, the 
lessee must demonstrate that the offsets are equivalent in nature and 
quantity to the projected emissions that must be reduced after the 
application of BACT; a binding commitment exists between the lessee and 
the owner or owners of the source or sources; the appropriate air 
quality control jurisdiction has been notified of the need to revise the 
State Implementation Plan to include the information regarding the 
offsets; and the required offsets come from sources which affect the air 
quality of the area significantly affected by the lessee's offshore 
operations.
    (j) Review of facilities with emissions below the exemption amount. 
If, during the review of a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or 
Development and Production Plan, the Regional Supervisor determines or 
an affected State submits information to the Regional Supervisor which 
demonstrates, in the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected 
emissions from an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or 
in combination with other facilities in the area, significantly affect 
the air quality of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall 
require the lessee to submit additional information to determine whether 
emission control measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the 
opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which 
demonstrates that the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the 
air quality of an onshore area of the State.
    (k) Emission monitoring requirements. The lessee shall monitor, in a 
manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from 
the facility. The lessee shall submit this information monthly in a 
manner and form approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
    (l) Collection of meteorological data. The Regional Supervisor may 
require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner 
approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit 
meteorological data from a facility.

<R05>
Sec. 250.304  Existing facilities.

    (a) Process leading to review of an existing facility. (1) An 
affected State may request that the Regional Supervisor supply basic 
emission data from existing facilities when such data are needed for the 
updating of the State's emission inventory. In submitting the request, 
the State must demonstrate that similar offshore and onshore facilities 
in areas under the State's jurisdiction are also included in the 
emission inventory.
    (2) The Regional Supervisor may require lessees of existing 
facilities to submit basic emission data to a State submitting a request 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) The State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section may submit information from its emission inventory which 
indicates that emissions from existing facilities may be significantly 
affecting the air quality of the onshore area of the State. The lessee 
shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional 
Supervisor which demonstrates that the facility is not significantly 
affecting the air quality of the State.
    (4) The Regional Supervisor shall evaluate the information submitted 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and shall determine, based on the 
basic emission data, available meteorological data, and the distance of 
the facility or facilities from the onshore area, whether any existing 
facility has the

[[Page 276]]

potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area of 
the State.
    (5) If the Regional Supervisor determines that no existing facility 
has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the State of and explain 
the reasons for this finding.
    (6) If the Regional Supervisor determines that an existing facility 
has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore 
area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to refer to 
the information requirements under Sec. 250.203(b)(19) or 250.204(b)(12) 
of this part and submit only that information required to make the 
necessary findings under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. The 
lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the Regional 
Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at the 
discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the 
requirements of this section as necessary.
    (b) Exemption formulas. To determine whether an existing facility is 
exempt from further air quality review, the lessee shall use the highest 
annual total amount of emissions from the facility for each air 
pollutant calculated in Sec. 250.203(b)(19)(i)(A) or 
250.204(b)(12)(i)(A) of this part and compare these emissions to the 
emission exemption amount ``E'' for each air pollutant calculated using 
the following formulas: E=3400D<SUP>2/3</SUP> for CO; and E=33.3D for 
TSP, SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF>, and VOC (where E is the emission 
exemption amount expressed in tons per year, and D is the distance of 
the facility from the closest onshore area of the State expressed in 
statute miles). If the amount of projected emissions is less than or 
equal to the emission exemption amount ``E'' for the air pollutant, the 
facility is exempt for that air pollutant from further air quality 
review required under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
    (c) Significance levels. For a facility not exempt under paragraph 
(b) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall 
use an approved air quality model to determine whether projected 
emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore 
ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:

   Significance Levels: Air Pollutant Concentrations (<greek-m>G/M\3\)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Significance determinations. (1) The projected emissions of any 
air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which result in an 
onshore ambient air concentration above the significance levels 
determined under paragraph (c) of this section for that air pollutant 
shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area for that air pollutant.
    (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not 
exempt under paragraph (b) of this section for that air pollutant shall 
be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area 
for VOC.
    (e) Controls required. (1) The projected emissions of any air 
pollutant which significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area 
shall be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (2) The lessee shall submit a compliance schedule for the 
application of BACT. If it is necessary to cease operations to allow for 
the installation of emission controls, the lessee may apply for a 
suspension of operations under the provisions of Sec. 250.110 of this 
part.
    (f) Review of facilities with emissions below the exemption amount. 
If, during the review of the information required under paragraph (a)(6) 
of this section, the Regional Supervisor determines or an affected State 
submits information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates, in 
the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected emissions from 
an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or in combination 
with other facilities in the

[[Page 277]]

area, significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area, then the 
Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to submit additional 
information to determine whether control measures are necessary. The 
lessee shall be given the opportunity to present information to the 
Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that the exempt facility is not 
significantly affecting the air quality of an onshore area of the State.
    (g) Emission monitoring requirements. The lessee shall monitor, in a 
manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from 
the facility following the installation of emission controls. The lessee 
shall submit this information monthly in a manner and form approved or 
prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
    (h) Collection of meteorological data. The Regional Supervisor may 
require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner 
approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit 
meteorological data from a facility.

    (b) Drilling unit safety devices. (1) No later than May 31, 1989, 
all drilling units shall be equipped with a safety device which is 
designed to prevent the traveling block from striking the crown block. 
The device shall be checked for proper operation weekly and after each 
drill-line slipping operation. The results of the operational check 
shall be entered in the driller's report.
    (2) No later than May 31, 1989, diesel-engine air intakes shall be 
equipped with a device to shut down the diesel engine in the event of 
runaway. Diesel engines which are continuously attended shall be 
equipped with either remote operated manual or automatic shutdown 
devices. Diesel engines which are not continuously attended shall be 
equipped with automatic shutdown devices.
    (c) Oceanographic, meteorological, and drilling unit performance 
data. Where such information is not otherwise readily available, upon 
request of the District Supervisor, lessees shall collect and report 
oceanographic, meteorological, and drilling unit performance data, and 
monitor ice conditions, if applicable, during the period of operations. 
The type of information to be collected and reported will be determined 
by the District Supervisor in the interests of safe conduct of 
operations and the

[[Page 278]]

structural integrity of the drilling unit.
    (d) Foundation requirements. When the lessee fails to provide 
sufficient information pursuant to Secs. 250.203 and 250.204 of this 
part to support a determination that the seafloor is capable of 
supporting a specific bottom-founded drilling unit under the site-
specific soil and oceanographic conditions, the District Supervisor may 
require that additional surveys and soil borings be performed and the 
results be submitted for review and evaluation by the District 
Supervisor before approval is granted for commencing drilling 
operations.
    (e) Tests, surveys, and samples. (1) The lessee shall conduct tests, 
obtain well and mud logs or surveys, and take samples to determine the 
reservoir energy; the presence, quantity, and quality of oil, gas, 
sulphur, and water; and the amount of pressure in the formations 
penetrated. The lessee shall take formation samples or cores to 
determine the identity, fluid content, and characteristics of any 
penetrated formation in accordance with requirements approved or 
prescribed by the District Supervisor.
    (2) Inclinational surveys shall be obtained on all vertical wells at 
intervals not exceeding 1,000 feet during the normal course of drilling. 
Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be 
obtained on all directional wells at intervals not exceeding 500 feet 
during the normal course of drilling and at intervals not exceeding 100 
feet in all portions of the hole when angle-changes are planned.
    (3) On both vertical and directionally drilled wells, directional 
surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be obtained at 
intervals not exceeding 500 feet prior to or upon setting surface or 
intermediate casing, liners, and at total depth. Composite directional 
surveys shall be prepared with the interval shown from the bottom of the 
conductor casing or, in the absence of conductor casing, from the bottom 
of the drive or structural casing to total depth. In calculating all 
surveys, a correction from the true north to Universal-Transverse-
Mercator-Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north shall be made after making the 
magnetic-to-true-north correction. A composite dipmeter directional 
survey or a composite measurement-while-drilling (MWD) directional 
survey including a listing of the directionally computed inclinations 
and azimuths on a well classified as vertical will be acceptable as 
fulfilling the applicable requirements of this paragraph. In the event a 
composite MWD survey is run, a multishot survey shall be obtained at 
each casing point in order to confirm the MWD results.
    (4) Wells are classified as vertical if the calculated average of 
inclination readings weighted by the respective interval lengths between 
readings from surface to drilled depth does not exceed 3 degrees from 
the vertical. When the calculated average inclination readings weighted 
by the length of the respective interval between readings from the 
surface to drilled depth exceeds 3 degrees, the well is classified as 
directional.
    (5) The Regional Supervisor at the request of a holder of an 
adjoining lease may, for the protection of correlative rights, furnish a 
copy of the directional survey for a well drilled within 500 feet of the 
adjacent lease to that leaseholder.
    (f) Fixed drilling platforms. Applications for installation of fixed 
drilling platforms or structures, including artificial islands, shall be 
submitted in accordance with the provisions of subpart I, Platforms and 
Structures, of this part. Mobile drilling units which have their jacking 
equipment removed or have been otherwise immobilized are classified as 
fixed drilling platforms.
    (g) Equipment movement. The movement of drilling rigs and related 
equipment on and off an offshore platform or from well to well on the 
same offshore platform, including rigging up and rigging down, shall be 
conducted in a safe manner. All wells in the same well-bay which are 
capable of producing hydrocarbons shall be shut in below the surface 
with a pump-through-type tubing plug and at the surface with a closed 
master valve prior to moving such rigs and related equipment, unless 
otherwise approved by the District Supervisor. A closed surface-
controlled subsurface safety valve of the pump-through-type may be used 
in lieu of the

[[Page 279]]

pump-through-type tubing plug, provided that the surface control has 
been locked out.
    (h) Emergency shutdown system. When drilling operations are 
conducted on a platform where there are other hydrocarbon-producing 
wells or other hydrocarbon flow, an Emergency Shutdown System (ESD) 
manually controlled station shall be installed near the driller's 
console.

    (i) An offshore mobile drilling unit during the drilling mode;
    (ii) A mobile workover unit during any drilling, completion, 
recompletion, remedial, repair, stimulation, or other workover activity;
    (iii) A platform, structure, artificial island, or other 
installation during any drilling, well-completion, well-workover, or 
production operation; and
    (iv) A platform, structure, artificial island, or other installation 
which contains a well open to a hydrocarbon-bearing zone.
    (3) All water-discharge-point sources from hydrocarbon-handling 
vessels shall be monitored in order to stop welding and burning 
operations in case flammable fluids are discharged as a result of 
equipment upset or malfunction.
    (4) Equipment containing hydrocarbons or other flammable substances 
shall be relocated at least 35 feet horizontally from the work site. 
Similar equipment located at a lower elevation where slag, sparks, or 
other burning materials could fall shall be relocated at least 35 feet 
from the point of impact. If relocation is impractical, either the 
equipment shall be protected with flame-proofed covers or otherwise 
shielded with metal or fire-resistant guards or curtains, or the 
contents shall have been rendered inert.
    (b) Welding, burning, and hot tapping plan. Each lessee shall submit 
for approval by the District Supervisor a ``Welding, Burning, and Hot 
Tapping Safe Practices and Procedures Plan'' prior to beginning the 
first drilling and/or production operations on a lease. The plan shall 
include the qualification standards or requirements for personnel who 
the lessee will authorize to conduct welding, burning, and hot tapping 
operations and the methods by which the lessee will assure that only 
trained personnel who meet such standards or requirements are utilized. 
A copy of this plan and approval letter shall be available on the 
facility where the welding is conducted. Any person designated as a 
welding supervisor shall be thoroughly familiar with this plan. An 
approved plan is required prior to conducting any welding, burning, or 
hot tapping operation. All welding and burning equipment shall be 
inspected by the welding supervisor or the lessee's designated person in 
charge prior to beginning any welding, burning, or hot tapping. All 
engine-driven welding machines shall be equipped with spark arrestors 
and drip pans. Welding leads shall be completely insulated and in good 
condition, oxygen and fuel gas bottles shall be secured in a safe place, 
and leak-free hoses shall be equipped with proper fittings, gauges, and 
regulators.
    (c) Designated safe-welding and burning areas. The lessee may 
establish and designate areas determined to be safe-welding areas. These 
designated areas shall be identified in the plan, and a drawing showing 
the location of these areas shall be maintained on the facility.
    (d) Undesignated welding and burning areas. All welding and burning, 
which cannot be done in an approved safe-welding area, shall be 
performed in compliance with the following:
    (1) Prior to the commencement of any of these operations, the 
lessee's

[[Page 280]]

designated person in charge at the installation shall inspect the 
qualifications of the welder(s) to assure that the welder(s) is properly 
qualified in accordance with the approved qualification standards or 
requirements for welders. The designated person in charge and the 
welder(s) shall inspect the work area and area(s) at elevations below 
the work area where slag, sparks, or other hot materials could fall for 
potential fire and explosion hazards. After it has been determined that 
it is safe to proceed with the welding and burning operation, the 
designated person-in-charge shall issue a written authorization for the 
work.
    (2) During these welding or burning operations, one or more persons 
shall be designated as a fire watch. The person(s) assigned as a fire 
watch shall have no other duties while actual welding or burning 
operations are in progress. If the operation is to be in an area which 
is not equipped with a gas detector, the fire watch shall also maintain 
a continuous surveillance with a portable gas detector during the 
welding and burning operation. The fire watch shall remain on duty for a 
period of 30 minutes after welding or burning operations have been 
completed.
    (3) Prior to any of these operations, the fire watch shall have in 
their possession firefighting equipment in a usable condition.
    (4) No welding or burning operation, other than approved hot 
tapping, shall be done on piping, containers, tanks, or other vessels 
which have contained a flammable substance unless the contents have been 
rendered inert and are determined to be safe for welding or burning by 
the designated person in charge.
    (5) If drilling, well-completion, well-workover, or wireline 
operations are in progress, welding operations in other than approved 
safe-welding areas shall not be conducted unless the well(s) in the area 
where drilling, well-completion, well-workover, or wireline operations 
are in progress contain noncombustible fluids and the entry of formation 
hydrocarbons into the wellbore is precluded.
    (6) If welding or burning operations are conducted in or within 10 
feet of a well-bay or production area, all producing wells in the well-
bay or production area shall be shut in at the surface safety valve.

[53 FR 10690, Apr. 1, 1988, as amended at 54 FR 50616, Dec. 8, 1989; 61 
FR 60024, Nov. 26, 1996. Redesignated at 63 FR 29479, May 29, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 250.404  Well casing and cementing.

    (a) General requirements. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the 
casing strings in order of normal installation are as follows:
    (i) Drive or structural,
    (ii) Conductor,
    (iii) Surface,
    (iv) Intermediate, and
    (v) Production casing.
    (2) The lessee shall case and cement all wells with a sufficient 
number of strings of casing and quantity and quality of cement in a 
manner necessary to prevent release of fluids from any stratum through 
the wellbore (directly or indirectly) into offshore waters, prevent 
communication between

[[Page 281]]

separate hydrocarbon-bearing strata, protect freshwater aquifers from 
contamination, support unconsolidated sediments, and otherwise provide a 
means of control of the formation pressures and fluids. Cement 
composition, placement techniques, and waiting time shall be designed 
and conducted so that the cement in place behind the bottom 500 feet of 
casing or total length of annular cement fill, if less, attains a 
minimum compressive strength of 500 pounds per square inch (psi). Cement 
placed across permafrost zones shall be designed to set before freezing 
and have a low heat of hydration.
    (3) The lessee shall install casing designed to withstand the 
anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling 
loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations 
thereof. Safety factors in the casing program design shall be of 
sufficient magnitude to provide well control during drilling and to 
assure safe operations for the life of the well. Any portion of an 
annulus opposite a permafrost zone which is not protected by cement 
shall be filled with a liquid which has a freezing point below the 
minimum permafrost temperature to prevent internal freezeback and which 
is treated to minimize corrosion.
    (4) In cases where cement has filled the annular space back to the 
mud line, the cement may be washed out or displaced to a depth not 
exceeding the depth of the structural casing shoe to facilitate casing 
removal upon well abandonment if the District Supervisor determines that 
subsurface protection against damage to freshwater aquifers and 
permafrost zones and against damage caused by adverse loads, pressures, 
and fluid flows is not jeopardized.
    (5) If there are indications of inadequate cementing (such as lost 
returns, cement channeling, or mechanical failure of equipment), the 
lessee shall evaluate the adequacy of the cementing operations by 
pressure testing the casing shoe, running a cement bond log, running a 
temperature survey, or a combination thereof before continuing 
operations. If the evaluation indicates inadequate cementing, the lessee 
shall re-cement or take other remedial actions as approved by the 
District Supervisor.
    (6) A pressure-integrity test shall be run below the surface casing, 
the intermediate casing(s), and liner(s) used as intermediate casing(s). 
The District Supervisor may require a pressure-integrity test to be run 
at the conductor casing shoe due to local geologic conditions or planned 
casing setting depths. Pressure-integrity tests shall be made after 
drilling new hole below the casing shoe and before drilling more than 50 
feet of new hole below a respective casing string. These tests shall be 
conducted either by testing to formation leak-off or by testing to a 
predetermined equivalent mud weight as specified in the approved APD. A 
safe margin, as approved by the District Supervisor, shall be maintained 
between the mud weight in use and the equivalent mud weight at the 
casing shoe as determined in the pressure-integrity test. Drilling 
operations shall be suspended when the safe margin is not maintained. 
Pressure-integrity and pore-pressure test results and related hole-
behavior observations, such as gas-cut mud and well kicks made during 
the course of drilling, shall be used in adjusting the drilling mud 
program and the approved setting depth of the next casing string. The 
results of all tests and of hole-behavior observations made during the 
course of drilling related to formation integrity and pore pressure 
shall be recorded in the driller's report.
    (b) Drive or structural casing. This casing shall be set by driving, 
jetting, or drilling to a minimum depth as may be prescribed or approved 
by the District Supervisor, in order to support unconsolidated deposits 
and to provide hole stability for initial drilling operations. If this 
portion of the hole is drilled, a quantity of cement sufficient to fill 
the annular space back to the mud line shall be used.
    (c) Conductor and surface casing requirements. (1) Conductor and 
surface casing setting depths. Conductor and surface casing design and 
setting depths shall be based upon relevant engineering and geologic 
factors including the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential 
hazards, and water depths. The approved casing setting depths may be 
adjusted when the

[[Page 282]]

change is approved by the District Supervisor to permit the casing shoe 
to be set in a competent formation or below formations which should be 
isolated from the wellbore by casing for safer drilling operations. 
However, the conductor casing shall be set immediately prior to drilling 
into formations known to contain oil or gas or, if the presence of oil 
or gas is unknown, upon encountering a formation containing oil or gas. 
Upon encountering unexpected formation pressures, the lessee shall 
submit a revised casing program to the District Supervisor for approval. 
The District Supervisor may permit a lessee to drill a well without 
setting conductor casing provided the information from approved logging 
and mud-monitoring programs for wells previously drilled in the 
immediate vacinity combined with other available geologic data are 
sufficient to demonstrate the absence of shallow hydrocarbons or 
hazards.
    (2) Conductor casing cementing requirements. Conductor casing shall 
be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular 
space back to the mud line except as applicable to the bottom of an 
excavation (glory hole) or to the surface of an artificial island. 
Cement fill in annular spaces shall be verified by the observation of 
cement returns. In the event that observation of cement returns is not 
feasible, additional quantities of cement shall be used to assure fill 
to the mud line.
    (3) Surface casing cementing requirements. (i) Surface casing shall 
be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular 
space to at least 200 feet inside the conductor casing. When geologic 
conditions such as near-surface fractures and faulting exist, surface 
casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the 
calculated annular space to the mud line, or as approved or prescribed 
by the District Supervisor.
    (ii) For floating drilling operations, a lesser volume of cement may 
be used to prevent sealing the annular space between the conductor 
casing and surface casing if the District Supervisor determines that the 
uncemented space is necessary to provide protection from burst and 
collapse pressures which may be applied inadvertently to the annulus 
between casings during blowout preventer (BOP) testing operations. Any 
annular space open to the drilled hole shall be sealed in accordance 
with the requirements for abandonment in subpart G, Abandonment of 
Wells, of this part.
    (d) Intermediate casing requirements. (1) Intermediate casing 
string(s) shall be set for protection when geologic characteristics or 
wellbore conditions, as anticipated or as encountered, so indicate.
    (2) Quantities of cement that cover and isolate all hydrocarbon-
bearing zones in the well and isolate abnormal pressure intervals from 
normal pressure intervals shall be used. This requirement for isolation 
may be satisfied by squeeze cementing prior to completion, suspension of 
operations, or abandonment, whichever occurs first. Sufficient cement 
shall be used to provide annular fill-up to a minimum of 500 feet above 
the zones to be isolated or 500 feet above the casing shoe in wells 
where zonal coverage is not required.
    (3) If a liner is to be used as an intermediate string below a 
surface casing string, it shall be lapped a minimum of 100 feet into the 
previous casing string and cemented as required for intermediate casing. 
When a liner is to be used as production casing below a surface casing 
string, it shall be extended to the surface and cemented to avoid 
surface casing being used as production casing.
    (e) Production casing requirements. (1) Production casing shall be 
cemented to cover or isolate all zones above the shoe which contain 
hydrocarbons; but in any case, a volume sufficient to fill the annular 
space at least 500 feet above the uppermost hydrocarbon-bearing zone 
shall be used.
    (2) When a liner is to be used as production casing below 
intermediate casing, it shall be lapped a minimum of 100 feet into the 
previous casing string and cemented as required for the production 
casing.


<R05>
Sec. 250.405  Pressure testing of casing.

    (a) Prior to drilling the plug after cementing and in the cases of 
plugs in production casing strings and liners

[[Page 283]]

not planned to be subsequently drilled out, all casings, except the 
drive or structural casing, shall be pressure tested to 70 percent of 
the minimum internal-yield pressure of the casing or as otherwise 
approved or required by the District Supervisor. If the pressure 
declines more than 10 percent in 30 minutes or if there is another 
indication of a leak, the casing shall be recemented, repaired, or an 
additional casing string run and the casing pressure tested again. 
Additional remedial actions shall be taken until a satisfactory pressure 
test is obtained. The results of all casing pressure tests shall be 
recorded in the driller's report.
    (b) Each production liner lap shall be tested to a minimum of 500 
psi above formation fracture pressure at the shoe of the casing into 
which the liner is lapped, or as otherwise approved or required by the 
District Supervisor. The drilling liner-lap test pressure shall be equal 
to or exceed the pressure that will be encountered at the liner lap when 
conducting the planned pressure-integrity test below the liner shoe. The 
test results shall be recorded on the driller's report. If the test 
indicates an improper seal, remedial action shall be taken which 
provides a proper seal as demonstrated by a satisfactory pressure test.
    (c) In the event of prolonged drill-pipe rotation within a casing 
string run to the surface or extended operations such as milling, 
fishing, jarring, washing over, and other operations which could damage 
the casing, the casing shall be pressure tested or evaluated by a 
logging technique such as a caliper log every 30 days. The evaluation 
results shall be submitted to the District Supervisor with a 
determination of effects of operations on the integrity of the casing 
for continued service during drilling operations and over the producing 
life of the well. If the integrity of the casing in the well has 
deteriorated to an unsafe level, remedial operations shall be conducted 
or additional casing set in accordance with a plan approved by the 
District Supervisor prior to continuing drilling operations.
    (d) After cementing any string of casing other than the structural 
casing string, drilling shall not be resumed until there has been a time 
lapse of 8 hours under pressure for the conductor casing string and 12 
hours under pressure for all other casing strings. Cement is considered 
under pressure if one or more float valves are shown to be holding the 
cement in place or when other means of holding pressure are used.

line shall be remotely controlled. At least one of the valves on the 
kill line shall be remotely controlled except that a check valve may be 
installed on the kill line in lieu of the remotely controlled valve 
provided two readily accessible manual valves are in place and the check 
valve is placed between the manual valves and the pump. For subsea BOP 
systems, a choke and a kill line each equipped with two full-opening 
valves. At least one of the valves on the choke line and at least one of 
the valves on the kill line shall be remotely controlled.
    (6) A fill-up line above the uppermost preventer.
    (7) A choke manifold suitable for the anticipated pressures to which 
it may be subjected, method of well control to be employed, surrounding 
environment, and corrosiveness, volume, and abrasiveness of fluids. The 
choke manifold shall also meet the following requirements:
    (i) Manifold and choke equipment subject to well and/or pump 
pressure shall have a rated working pressure at least as great as the 
rated working pressure of the ram-type BOP's or as otherwise approved by 
the District Supervisor;
    (ii) All components of the choke manifold system shall be protected 
from the danger, if any, of freezing by heating, draining, or filling 
with proper fluids; and
    (iii) When buffer tanks are installed downstream of the choke 
assemblies for the purpose of manifolding the bleed lines together, 
isolation valves shall be installed on each line.
    (8) Valves, pipes, flexible steel hoses, and other fittings upstream

great as the rated working pressure of the ram-type BOP's or as 
otherwise approved by the District Supervisor.
    (9) A wellhead assembly with a rated working pressure that exceeds 
the anticipated surface pressure to which it may be subjected.
    (10) The following system components:
    (i) On a conventional drilling rig, a kelly cock installed below the 
swivel (upper kelly cock), essentially full-opening, and a similar valve 
of such design that it can be run through the BOP stack (strippable) 
installed at the bottom of the kelly (lower kelly cock). With a mud 
motor in service and while using drill pipe in lieu of a kelly, one 
kelly cock located above and one strippable kelly cock located below the 
joint of drill pipe employed in lieu of a kelly. On a top-drive system 
equipped with a remote controlled valve, a second and lower strippable 
valve of a conventional kelly cock or comparable type either manually or 
remotely controlled. All required manual and remotely controlled valves 
of a kelly cock or comparable type in a top-drive system must be 
essentially full-opening and tested according to the test pressure and 
test frequency as stated in Sec. 250.407 of this part. A wrench to fit 
each manually operable valve in a conventional drilling rig, mud motor, 
and top-drive system shall be stored in a location readily accessible to 
the drilling crew.
    (ii) An inside BOP and an essentially full-opening drill-string 
safety valve in the open position on the rig floor at all times while 
drilling operations are being conducted. These valves shall be 
maintained on the rig floor to fit all connections that are in the drill 
string. A wrench to fit the drill-string safety valve shall be stored in 
a location readily accessible to the drilling crew.
    (iii) A safety valve available on the rig floor assembled with the 
proper connection to fit the casing string being run in the hole.
    (11) Locking devices installed on the ram-type preventers.
    (e) Subsea BOP requirements. (1) Prior to drilling below surface and 
intermediate casing, a BOP system shall be

[[Page 285]]

installed consisting of at least four remote controlled, hydraulically 
operated BOP's including at least two equipped with pipe rams, one with 
blind-shear rams, and one annular type. A subsea accumulator closing 
unit or a suitable alternate approved by the District Supervisor is 
required to provide fast closure of the BOP components and to operate 
all critical functions in case of a loss of the power fluid connection 
to the surface. When proposed casing setting depths or local geology 
indicate the need for a BOP to provide safety during the drilling of the 
surface hole, the District Supervisor may require that a subsea BOP 
system be installed prior to drilling below the conductor casing.
    (2) The BOP system shall include operable dual-pod control systems 
necessary to ensure proper and independent operation of the BOP system 
functions when drilling below the surface casing.
    (3) Prior to the removal of the marine riser, the riser shall be 
displaced with seawater. Sufficient hydrostatic pressure or other 
suitable precautions, such as mechanical or cement plugs or closing the 
BOP, shall be maintained within the wellbore to compensate for the 
reduction in pressure and to maintain a safe controlled well condition.
    (4) Any necessary repair or replacement of the BOP system or a 
system component after installation shall be accomplished under safe 
controlled conditions, (e.g., after casing has been cemented but prior

Sec. 250.407  Blowout preventer (BOP) system tests, inspections, and maintenance.

    (a) BOP pressure testing timeframes. You must pressure test your BOP 
system:
    (1) When installed;
    (2) Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test. 
You must begin to test your BOP system before 12 a.m. (midnight) on the 
14th day following the conclusion of the previous test. However, the 
District Supervisor may require testing every 7 days if conditions or 
BOP performance warrant; and
    (3) Before drilling out each string of casing or a liner. The 
District Supervisor may allow you to omit this test if you did not 
remove the BOP stack to run the casing string or liner and the required 
BOP-test pressures for the next section of the hole are not greater than 
the test pressures for the previous BOP test. You must indicate in your 
APD which casing strings and liners meet these criteria.
    (b) BOP test pressures. When you test the BOP system, you must 
conduct a low pressure and a high pressure test for each BOP component. 
Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to 
demonstrate that the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. 
Required test pressures are as follows:
    (1) All low pressure tests must be between 200 and 300 psi. Any 
initial pressure above 300 psi must be bled back to

[[Page 286]]

a pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the 
initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and 
reinitiate the test. You must conduct the low pressure test before the 
high pressure test.
    (2) For ram-type BOP's, choke manifold, and other BOP equipment, the 
high pressure test must equal the rated working pressure of the 
equipment or the pressure otherwise approved by the District Supervisor; 
and
    (3) For annular-type BOP's, the high pressure test must equal 70 
percent of the rated working pressure of the equipment or the pressure 
otherwise approved by the District Supervisor.
    (c) Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required 
pressure for 5 minutes.
    (1) For surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP 
system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if you record your test 
pressures on the outermost half of a 4-hour chart, on a 1-hour chart, or 
on a digital recorder.
    (2) If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a 
test, you must remedy the problem and retest the affected component(s).
    (d) Additional BOP testing requirements. You must:
    (1) Use water to test a surface BOP system;
    (2) Stump test a subsurface BOP system before installation. You must 
use water to stump test a subsea BOP system. You may use drilling fluids 
to conduct subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system;
    (3) Alternate tests between control stations and pods. If a control 
station or pod is not functional, you must suspend further drilling 
operations until that station or pod is operable;
    (4) Pressure test the blind or blind-shear ram during a stump test 
and at all casing points. Additionally, the interval between any blind 
or blind-shear ram tests may not exceed 30 days;
    (5) Function test annulars and rams every 7 days between pressure 
tests;
    (6) Pressure-test variable bore-pipe rams against all sizes of pipe 
in use, excluding drill collars and bottom-hole tools;
    (7) Test affected BOP components following the disconnection or 
repair of any well-pressure containment seal in the wellhead or BOP 
stack assembly;
    (8) Actuate safety valves assembled with proper casing connections 
prior to running casing, and
    (9) If you install casing rams, you must test the ram bonnet before 
running casing.
    (e) Postponing BOP tests. You may postpone a BOP test if you have 
well-control problems such as lost circulation, formation fluid influx, 
or stuck drill pipe. If this occurs, you must conduct the required BOP 
test on the first trip out of the hole. You must record the reason for 
postponing any test in the driller's report.
    (f) Visual inspections. You must visually inspect your surface and 
subsea BOP systems and marine riser at least once each day if weather 
and sea conditions permit. You may use television cameras to inspect 
subsea equipment. The District Supervisor may approve alternate methods 
and frequencies to inspect a marine riser. Casing risers on fixed 
structures and jackup rigs are not subject to the daily underwater 
inspections.
    (g) BOP maintenance. You must maintain your BOP system to ensure 
that the equipment functions properly.
    (h) BOP test records. You must record the time, date, and results of 
all pressure tests, actuations, and inspections of the BOP system, 
system components, and marine riser in the driller's report. In 
addition, you must:
    (1) Record BOP test pressures on pressure charts;
    (2) Have your onsite representative certify (sign and date) BOP test 
charts and reports as correct;
    (3) Document the sequential order of BOP and auxiliary equipment 
testing and the pressure and duration of each test. You may reference a 
BOP test plan if it is available at the facility;
    (4) Identify the control station or pod used during the test;
    (5) Identify any problems or irregularities observed during BOP 
system testing and record actions taken to remedy the problems or 
irregularities;
    (6) Retain all records, including pressure charts, driller's report, 
and referenced documents, pertaining to BOP tests, actuations, and 
inspections at

[[Page 287]]

the facility for the duration of drilling; and
    (7) After drilling is completed, you must retain all the records 
listed in paragraph (h)(6) of this section for a period of 2 years at 
the facility, at the lessee's field office nearest the Outer Continental 
Shelf (OCS) facility, or at another location conveniently available to 
the District Supervisor.
    (i) Alternate methods. The District Supervisor may require, or 
approve, more frequent testing, as well as different test pressures and 
inspection methods, or other practices.

<R05>
Sec. 250.409  Diverter systems.

    (a) When drilling a conductor or surface hole, all drilling units 
shall be equipped with a diverter system consisting of a diverter 
sealing element, diverter lines, and control systems unless otherwise 
approved by the District Supervisor for floating drilling operations. 
The diverter system shall be designed, installed, and maintained so as 
to divert gases, water, mud, and other materials away from the 
facilities and personnel.
    (b) No later than May 31, 1990, diverter systems shall be in 
compliance with the requirements of this section. The requirements 
applicable to diverters which were in effect April 1, 1988 shall remain 
in effect until May 31, 1990.
    (c) The diverter system shall be equipped with remote-controlled 
valves in the flow and vent lines that can be operated from at least one 
remote-control station in addition to the one on the drilling floor. Any 
valve used in a diverter system shall be full-opening. No manual or 
butterfly valve shall be installed in any part of the diverter system. 
There shall be a minimum number of turns in the vent line(s) downstream 
of the spool outlet flange and the radius of curvature of turns shall be 
as large as practicable. All right-angle and sharp turns shall be 
targeted. Flexible hose may be used for diverter lines instead of rigid 
pipe if the flexible hose has integral end couplings. The entire 
diverter system shall be firmly anchored and supported to prevent 
whipping and vibration. All diverter control instruments and lines shall 
be protected from physical damage from thrown and falling objects.
    (d) For drilling operations conducted with a surface wellhead 
configuration, the following shall apply:
    (1) If the diverter system utilizes only one spool outlet, branch 
lines shall be installed to provide downwind diversion capability; and
    (2) No spool outlet or diverter line internal diameter shall be less 
than 10 inches, except that dual spool outlets are acceptable provided 
that each outlet has a minimum internal diameter of 8 inches and that 
both outlets are piped to overboard lines and that each line downstream 
of the changeover nipple at the spool has a minimum internal diameter of 
10 inches.
    (e) For drilling operations conducted where a floating or 
semisubmersible type of drilling vessel is used and drilling fluids are 
circulated to the drilling vessel, the following shall apply:
    (1) If the diverter system utilizes only one spool outlet, branch 
lines shall be installed to provide downwind diversion capability;
    (2) No spool outlet or diverter line internal diameter shall be less 
than 12 inches; and
    (3) Dynamically positioned drill ships may be equipped with a single 
vent line provided appropriate vessel heading is maintained to allow for 
downwind diversion.
    (f) The diverter sealing element and diverter valves shall be 
pressure tested to a minimum of 200 psi when nippled up on conductor 
casing with a surface wellhead configuration. No more than 7 days shall

    (g) Diverter systems and components for use in subfreezing 
conditions shall be suitable for use under these conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 250.410  Mud program.

    (a) General requirements. The quantities, characteristics, use, and 
testing of drilling mud and the related drilling procedures shall be 
designed and implemented to prevent the loss of well control.
    (b) Mud control. (1) Before starting out of the hole with drill 
pipe, the mud shall be properly conditioned by circulation with the 
drill pipe just off bottom to the extent that a volume of drilling mud 
equal to the annular volume is displaced. This procedure may be omitted 
if proper documentation in the driller's report shows the following:
    (i) There is no indication of influx of formation fluids prior to 
starting to pull the drill pipe from the hole.
    (ii) The weight of the returning mud is essentially the same as the 
weight of the mud entering the hole. In the event that the returning mud 
is lighter than the entering mud by a weight differential equal to or 
greater than 0.2 pounds per gallon (1.5 pounds per cubic foot), the mud 
shall be circulated until a volume of drilling mud equal to the annular 
volume is displaced, and the mud properties measured to assure that 
there has been no influx of gas or liquid.
    (iii) Other mud properties recorded on the daily drilling log are 
within the limits established by the approved mud program.
    (2) When mud in the hole is circulated, the driller's report shall 
be so noted.
    (3) When coming out of the hole with drill pipe, the annulus shall 
be filled with mud before the change in mud level decreases the 
hydrostatic pressure by 75 psi, or every five stands of drill pipe, 
whichever gives a lower decrease in hydrostatic pressure. The number of 
stands of drill pipe and drill collars that may be pulled prior to 
filling the hole and the equivalent mud volume shall be calculated and 
posted near the driller's station. A mechanical, volumetric, or 
electronic device for measuring the amount of mud required to fill the 
hole shall be utilized.
    (4) Drill pipe and downhole tool running and pulling speeds shall be 
at controlled rates so as not to induce an influx of formation fluids 
from the effects of swabbing nor cause a loss of drilling fluid and 
corresponding hydrostatic pressure decrease from the effects of surging.
    (5) When there is an indication of swabbing or influx of formation 
fluids, the safety devices and measures necessary to control the well 
shall be employed. The mud shall be circulated and conditioned, on or 
near bottom, unless well or mud conditions prevent running the drill 
pipe back to the bottom.
    (6) For each casing string, the maximum pressure to be contained 
under the BOP shall be posted near the driller's station.
    (7) In areas where permafrost and/or hydrate zones may be present or 
are known to be present, drilling fluid temperatures shall be controlled 
or other measures taken to drill safely through those zones.
    (8) An operable mud-gas separator and operable degasser shall be 
installed in the mud system prior to commencement of drilling operations 
and shall be maintained for use throughout the drilling of the well.
    (9) The mud in the hole shall be circulated or reverse-circulated 
prior to pulling the drill-stem test tools from the hole. If circulating 
out test fluid is not feasible, test fluids may be bullheaded out of the 
drill-stem test string and tools with an appropriate kill fluid prior to 
pulling the test tools.
    (c) Mud-testing and monitoring equipment. (1) Mud-testing equipment 
shall be maintained on the drilling rig at all times, and mud tests 
shall be performed once each tour, or more frequently, as conditions 
warrant. Such tests shall be conducted in accordance with industry-
accepted practices and shall include mud density, viscosity, and gel 
strength, hydrogen-ion concentration (pH), filtration, and other tests 
as may be deemed necessary by the District Supervisor in the interests 
of monitoring and maintaining mud quality for safe operations, 
prevention

[[Page 290]]

of downhole equipment problems, and for kick detection. The results of 
these tests shall be recorded in the driller's report.
    (2) The following mud-system monitoring equipment shall be installed 
with derrick floor indicators and used when mud returns are established 
and throughout subsequent drilling operations:
    (i) Recording mud-pit level indicator to determine mud-pit volume 
gains and losses. This indicator shall include both a visual and an 
audible warning device.
    (ii) Mud-volume measuring device to accurately determine mud volumes 
required to fill the hole on trips.
    (iii) Mud-return indicator devices which indicate the relationship 
between mud-return flow rate and pump discharge rate. This indicator 
shall include both a visual and an audible warning device.
    (iv) Gas-detecting equipment to monitor the drilling mud returns 
with indicators located in the mud-logging compartment or on the rig 
floor. If the indicators are only in the mud-logging compartment, there 
shall be a means of immediate communication with the rig floor, and the 
gas-detecting equipment shall be continually manned. If the indicators 
are on the rig floor only, an audible alarm shall be installed.
    (d) Mud quantities. (1) Quantities of mud and mud materials at the 
drill site shall be utilized, maintained, and replenished as necessary 
to ensure well control. Those quantities shall be based on known or 
anticipated drilling conditions to be encountered, rig storage capacity, 
weather conditions, and estimated time for delivery.
    (2) Daily inventories of mud and mud materials including weight 
materials and additives at the drill site shall be recorded and those 
records maintained at the well site.
    (3) Drilling operations shall be suspended in the absence of 
sufficient quantities of mud and mud materials to maintain well control.
    (e) Safety precautions in mud-handling areas. Mud-handling areas 
which are classified as per API RP 500B where dangerous concentrations 
of combustible gas may accumulate shall be equipped with ventilation 
systems and gas monitors as described below no later than May 31, 1989. 
Regulatory requirements in effect on April 1, 1988 are applicable until 
May 31, 1989.
    (1) Be ventilated with high-capacity mechanical ventilation systems 
capable of replacing the air once every 5 minutes or 1.0 cubic feet of 
air-volume flow per minute per square foot of area, whichever is 
greater, unless such ventilation is provided by natural means. If not 
continuously activated, mechanical ventilation systems shall be 
activated on signal from gas detectors that are operational at all times 
indicating the presence of 1 percent or more of gas by volume.
    (2) Be maintained at a negative pressure relative to an adjacent 
area if mechanical ventilation is installed to meet the requirements in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and discharges may be hazardous. The 
negative pressure areas shall be protected with at least one of the 
following: (i) A pressure-sensitive alarm, (ii) open-door alarms on each 
access to the area, (iii) automatic door-closing devices, (iv) air 
locks, or (v) other devices as approved by the District Supervisor.
    (3) Be fitted with gas detectors and alarms except in open areas 
where adequate ventilation is provided by natural means.
    (4) Be equipped with either explosion-proof or pressurized 
electrical equipment to prevent the ignition of explosive gases. Where 
air is used for pressuring, the air intake shall be located outside of, 
and as far as practicable from, hazardous areas.
    (5) Mechanical ventilation systems shall be fitted with alarms which 
are activated upon a failure of the system.
    (6) Gas detection systems shall be tested for operation and 
recalibrated at a frequency such that no more than 90 days shall elapse 
between tests.

    (i) When conducting drilling, drill stem testing, well-completion, 
or well-workover operations in areas classified as H<INF>2</INF> S 
present or H<INF>2</INF> S unknown, test all detectors at least once 
every 24 hours. When drilling, begin functional testing before the bit 
is 1,500 feet (vertically) above the potential H<INF>2</INF> S zone.
    (ii) When conducting production operations, test all detectors at 
least every 14 days between tests.
    (iii) If equipment requires calibration as a result of two 
consecutive functional tests, the District Supervisor may require that 
H<INF>2</INF> S-detection and H<INF>2</INF> S-monitoring equipment be 
functionally tested and calibrated more frequently.
    (8) What documentation must I keep?

[[Page 299]]

system that activates audible and visual alarms when the concentration 
of H<INF>2</INF> S in the atmosphere reaches 20 ppm. This requirement 
does not apply to vessels positioned upwind and at a safe distance from 
the facility in accordance with the positioning procedure described in 
the approved H<INF>2</INF> S Contingency Plan.
    (10) What are the requirements for nearby facilities? The District 
Supervisor may require you to equip nearby facilities with portable or 
fixed H<INF>2</INF> S detector(s) and to test and calibrate those 
detectors. To invoke this requirement, the District Supervisor will 
consider dispersion modeling results from a possible release to 
determine if 20 ppm H<INF>2</INF> S concentration levels could be 
exceeded at nearby facilities.
    (11) What must I do to protect against SO<INF>2</INF> if I burn gas 
containing H<INF>2</INF> S? You must:

portable or strategically placed fixed devices capable of detecting a 
minimum of 2 ppm of SO<INF>2</INF>;
    (ii) Take readings at least hourly and at any time personnel detect 
SO<INF>2</INF> odor or nasal irritation;
    (iii) Implement the personnel protective measures specified in the 
H<INF>2</INF> S Contingency Plan if the SO<INF>2</INF> concentration in 
the work area reaches 2 ppm; and
    (iv) Calibrate devices every 3 months if you use fixed or portable 
electronic sensing devices to detect SO<INF>2</INF>.
    (12) May I use alternative measures? You may follow alternative 
measures instead of those in paragraph (j)(11) of this section if you 
propose and the Regional Supervisor approves the alternative measures.
    (13) What are the requirements for protective-breathing equipment? 
In an area classified as H<INF>2</INF> S present or H<INF>2</INF> S 
unknown, you must:

can be used while wearing a respirator, for use by designated personnel.
    (iv) Make spectacle kits available as needed.
    (v) Store protective-breathing equipment in a location that is 
quickly and easily accessible to all personnel.
    (vi) Label all breathing-air bottles as containing breathing-quality 
air for human use.
    (vii) Ensure that vessels attendant to facilities carry appropriate 
protective-breathing equipment for each crew member. The District 
Supervisor may require additional protective-breathing equipment on 
certain vessels attendant to the facility.
    (viii) During H<INF>2</INF> S alerts, limit helicopter flights to 
and from facilities to the conditions specified in the H<INF>2</INF> S 
Contingency Plan. During authorized flights, the flight crew and 
passengers must use pressure-demand-type respirators. You must train all 
members of flight crews in the use of the particular type(s) of 
respirator equipment made available.
    (ix) As appropriate to the particular operation(s), (production, 
drilling, well-completion or well-workover operations, or any 
combination of them), provide a system of breathing-air manifolds, 
hoses, and masks at the facility and the briefing areas. You must 
provide a cascade air-bottle system for the breathing-air manifolds to 
refill individual protective-breathing apparatus bottles. The cascade 
air-bottle system may be recharged by a high-pressure compressor 
suitable for providing breathing-quality air, provided the compressor 
suction is located in an uncontaminated atmosphere.
    (k) Personnel safety equipment.--(1) What additional personnel-
safety equipment do I need? You must ensure that your facility has:
    (i) Portable H<INF>2</INF> S detectors capable of detecting a 10 ppm 
concentration of H<INF>2</INF> S in the air available for use by all

production processing equipment area, gas compressor area, and pipeline-
pump area;
    (iv) Bull horns and flashing lights; and
    (v) At least three resuscitators on manned facilities, and a number 
equal to the personnel on board, not to exceed three, on normally 
unmanned facilities, complete with face masks, oxygen bottles, and spare 
oxygen bottles.
    (2) What are the requirements for ventilation equipment? You must:
    (i) Use only explosion-proof ventilation devices;
    (ii) Install ventilation devices in areas where H<INF>2</INF> S or 
SO<INF>2</INF> may accumulate; and
    (iii) Provide movable ventilation devices in work areas. The movable 
ventilation devices must be multidirectional and capable of dispersing 
H<INF>2</INF> S or SO<INF>2</INF> vapors away from working personnel.
    (3) What other personnel safety equipment do I need? You must have 
the following equipment readily available on each facility:
    (i) A first-aid kit of appropriate size and content for the number 
of personnel on the facility; and
    (ii) At least one litter or an equivalent device.
    (l) Do I need to notify MMS in the event of an H<INF>2</INF>S 
release? You must notify MMS without delay in the event of a gas release 
which results in a 15-minute time weighted average atmospheric 
concentration of H<INF>2</INF> S of 20 ppm or more anywhere on the 
facility.
    (m) Do I need to use special drilling, completion and workover 
fluids or procedures? When working in an area classified as 
H<INF>2</INF> S present or H<INF>2</INF> S unknown:
    (1) You may use either water- or oil-base muds in accordance with 
Sec. 250.300(b)(1).
    (2) If you use water-base well-control fluids, and if ambient air 
sensors detect H<INF>2</INF> S, you must immediately conduct either the 
Garrett-Gas-Train test or a comparable test for soluble sulfides to 
confirm the presence of H<INF>2</INF> S.
    (3) If the concentration detected by air sensors in over 20 ppm, 
personnel conducting the tests must don protective-breathing equipment 
conforming to paragraph (j)(13) of this section.
    (4) You must maintain on the facility sufficient quantities of 
additives for the control of H<INF>2</INF> S, well-control fluid pH, and 
corrosion equipment.
    (i) Scavengers. You must have scavengers for control of 
H<INF>2</INF> S available on the facility. When H<INF>2</INF> S is 
detected, you must add scavengers as needed. You must suspend drilling 
until the scavenger is circulated throughout the system.
    (ii) Control pH. You must add additives for the control of pH to 
water-base well-control fluids in sufficient quantities to maintain pH 
of at least 10.0.
    (iii) Corrosion inhibitors. You must add additives to the well-
control fluid system as needed for the control of corrosion.
    (5) You must degas well-control fluids containing H<INF>2</INF> S at 
the optimum location for the particular facility. You must collect the 
gases removed and burn them in a closed flare system conforming to 
paragraph (q)(6) of this section.
    (n) What must I do in the event of a kick? In the event of a kick, 
you must use one of the following alternatives to dispose of the well-
influx fluids giving consideration to personnel safety, possible 
environmental damage, and possible facility well-equipment damage:
    (1) Contain the well-fluid influx by shutting in the well and 
pumping the fluids back into the formation.
    (2) Control the kick by using appropriate well-control techniques to 
prevent formation fracturing in an open hole within the pressure limits 
of the well equipment (drill pipe, work string, casing, wellhead, BOP 
system, and related equipment). The disposal of H<INF>2</INF> S and 
other gases must be through pressurized or atmospheric mud-separator 
equipment depending on volume, pressure and concentration of 
H<INF>2</INF> S. The equipment must be designed to recover well-control 
fluids and burn the gases separated from the well-control fluid. The 
well-control fluid must be treated to neutralize H<INF>2</INF> S and 
restore and maintain the proper quality.
    (o) Well testing in a zone known to contain H<INF>2</INF>S. When 
testing a well in a zone

[[Page 301]]

with H<INF>2</INF> S present, you must do all of the following:
    (1) Before starting a well test, conduct safety meetings for all 
personnel who will be on the facility during the test. At the meetings, 
emphasize the use of protective-breathing equipment, first-aid 
procedures, and the Contingency Plan. Only competent personnel who are 
trained and are knowledgeable of the hazardous effects of H<INF>2</INF> 
S must be engaged in these tests.
    (2) Perform well testing with the minimum number of personnel in the 
immediate vicinity of the rig floor and with the appropriate test 
equipment to safely and adequately perform the test. During the test, 
you must continuously monitor H<INF>2</INF> S levels.
    (3) Not burn produced gases except through a flare which meets the 
requirements of paragraph (q)(6) of this section. Before flaring gas 
containing H<INF>2</INF> S, you must activate SO<INF>2</INF> monitoring 
equipment in accordance with paragraph (j)(11) of this section. If you 
detect SO<INF>2</INF> in excess of 2 ppm, you must implement the 
personnel protective measures in your H<INF>2</INF> S Contingency Plan, 
required by paragraph (f)(13)(iv) of this section. You must also follow 
the requirements of Sec. 250.1105. You must pipe gases from stored test 
fluids into the flare outlet and burn them.
    (4) Use downhole test tools and wellhead equipment suitable for 
H<INF>2</INF> S service.
    (5) Use tubulars suitable for H<INF>2</INF> S service. You must not 
use drill pipe for well testing without the prior approval of the 
District Supervisor. Water cushions must be thoroughly inhibited in 
order to prevent H<INF>2</INF> S attack on metals. You must flush the 
test string fluid treated for this purpose after completion of the test.
    (6) Use surface test units and related equipment that is designed 
for H<INF>2</INF> S service.
    (p) Metallurgical properties of equipment. When operating in a zone 
with H<INF>2</INF> S present, you must use equipment that is constructed 
of materials with metallurgical properties that resist or prevent 
sulfide stress cracking (also known as hydrogen embrittlement, stress 
corrosion cracking, or H<INF>2</INF> S embrittlement), chloride-stress 
cracking, hydrogen-induced cracking, and other failure modes. You must 
do all of the following:
    (1) Use tubulars and other equipment, casing, tubing, drill pipe, 
couplings, flanges, and related equipment that is designed for 
H<INF>2</INF> S service.
    (2) Use BOP system components, wellhead, pressure-control equipment, 
and related equipment exposed to H<INF>2</INF> S-bearing fluids that 
conform to NACE Standard MR.01-75-96.
    (3) Use temporary downhole well-security devices such as retrievable 
packers and bridge plugs that are designed for H<INF>2</INF> S service.
    (4) When producing in zones bearing H<INF>2</INF> S, use equipment 
constructed of materials capable of resisting or preventing sulfide 
stress cracking.
    (5) Keep the use of welding to a minimum during the installation or 
modification of a production facility. Welding must be done in a manner 
that ensures resistance to sulfide stress cracking.
    (q) General requirements when operating in an H<INF>2</INF> S zone--
(1) Coring operations. When you conduct coring operations in 
H<INF>2</INF> S-bearing zones, all personnel in the working area must 
wear protective-breathing equipment at least 10 stands in advance of 
retrieving the core barrel. Cores to be transported must be sealed and 
marked for the presence of H<INF>2</INF> S.
    (2) Logging operations. You must treat and condition well-control 
fluid in use for logging operations to minimize the effects of 
H<INF>2</INF> S on the logging equipment.
    (3) Stripping operations. Personnel must monitor displaced well-
control fluid returns and wear protective-breathing equipment in the 
working area when the atmospheric concentration of H<INF>2</INF> S 
reaches 20 ppm or if the well is under pressure.
    (4) Gas-cut well-control fluid or well kick from H<INF>2</INF>S-
bearing zone. If you decide to circulate out a kick, personnel in the 
working area during bottoms-up and extended-kill operations must wear 
protective-breathing equipment.
    (5) Drill- and workover-string design and precautions. Drill- and 
workover-strings must be designed consistent with the anticipated depth, 
conditions of the hole, and reservoir environment to be encountered. You 
must minimize

[[Page 302]]

exposure of the drill- or workover-string to high stresses as much as 
practical and consistent with well conditions. Proper handling 
techniques must be taken to minimize notching and stress concentrations. 
Precautions must be taken to minimize stresses caused by doglegs, 
improper stiffness ratios, improper torque, whip, abrasive wear on tool 
joints, and joint imbalance.
    (6) Flare system. The flare outlet must be of a diameter that allows 
easy nonrestricted flow of gas. You must locate flare line outlets on 
the downside of the facility and as far from the facility as is 
feasible, taking into account the prevailing wind directions, the wake 
effects caused by the facility and adjacent structure(s), and the height 
of all such facilities and structures. You must equip the flare outlet 
with an automatic ignition system including a pilot-light gas source or 
an equivalent system. You must have alternate methods for igniting the 
flare. You must pipe to the flare system used for H<INF>2</INF> S all 
vents from production process equipment, tanks, relief valves, burst 
plates, and similar devices.
    (7) Corrosion mitigation. You must use effective means of monitoring 
and controlling corrosion caused by acid gases (H<INF>2</INF> S and 
CO<INF>2</INF>) in both the downhole and surface portions of a 
production system. You must take specific corrosion monitoring and 
mitigating measures in areas of unusually severe corrosion where 
accumulation of water and/or higher concentration of H<INF>2</INF> S 
exists.
    (8) Wireline lubricators. Lubricators which may be exposed to fluids 
containing H<INF>2</INF> S must be of H<INF>2</INF> S-resistant 
materials.
    (9) Fuel and/or instrument gas. You must not use gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF> S for instrument gas. You must not use gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF> S for fuel gas without the prior approval of the District 
Supervisor.
    (10) Sensing lines and devices. Metals used for sensing line and 
safety-control devices which are necessarily exposed to H<INF>2</INF> S-
bearing fluids must be constructed of H<INF>2</INF> S-corrosion 
resistant materials or coated so as to resist H<INF>2</INF> S corrosion.
    (11) Elastomer seals. You must use H<INF>2</INF> S-resistant 
materials for all seals which may be exposed to fluids containing 
H<INF>2</INF> S.
    (12) Water disposal. If you dispose of produced water by means other 
than subsurface injection, you must submit to the District Supervisor an 
analysis of the anticipated H<INF>2</INF> S content of the water at the 
final treatment vessel and at the discharge point. The District 
Supervisor may require that the water be treated for removal of 
H<INF>2</INF> S. The District Supervisor may require the submittal of an 
updated analysis if the water disposal rate or the potential 
H<INF>2</INF> S content increases.
    (13) Deck drains. You must equip open deck drains with traps or 
similar devices to prevent the escape of H<INF>2</INF> S gas into the 
atmosphere.
    (14) Sealed voids. You must take precautions to eliminate sealed 
spaces in piping designs (e.g., slip-on flanges, reinforcing pads) which 
can be invaded by atomic hydrogen when H<INF>2</INF> S is present.

<R05>
Sec. 250.516  Blowout preventer system tests, inspections, and maintenance.

    (a) BOP pressure testing timeframes. You must pressure test your BOP 
system:
    (1) When installed; and
    (2) Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test. 
You must begin to test your BOP system before 12 a.m. (midnight) on the 
14th day following the conclusion of the previous test. However, the 
District Supervisor may require testing every 7 days if conditions or 
BOP performance warrant.
    (b) BOP test pressures. When you test the BOP system, you must 
conduct a low pressure and a high pressure test for each BOP component. 
Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to 
demonstrate that the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. 
The District Supervisor may approve or require other test pressures or 
practices. Required test pressures are as follows:
    (1) All low pressure tests must be between 200 and 300 psi. Any 
initial pressure above 300 psi must be bled back to a pressure between 
200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the initial pressure 
exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and reinitiate the test. 
You must conduct the low pressure test before the high pressure test.
    (2) For ram-type BOP's, choke manifold, and other BOP equipment, the 
high pressure test must equal the rated working pressure of the 
equipment.
    (3) For annular-type BOP's, the high pressure test must equal 70 
percent of the rated working pressure of the equipment.
    (c) Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required 
pressure for 5 minutes.
    (1) For surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP 
system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if you record your test 
pressures on the outermost half of a 4-hour chart, on a 1-hour chart, or 
on a digital recorder.
    (2) If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a 
test, you must remedy the problem and retest the affected component(s).
    (d) Additional BOP testing requirements. You must:
    (1) Use water to test the surface BOP system;
    (2) Stump test a subsurface BOP system before installation. You must 
use water to stump test a subsea BOP system. You may use drilling or 
completion fluids to conduct subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system;
    (3) Alternate tests between control stations and pods. If a control 
station

[[Page 307]]

or pod is not functional, you must suspend further completion operations 
until that station or pod is operable;
    (4) Pressure test the blind or blind-shear ram at least every 30 
days;
    (5) Function test annulars and rams every 7 days;
    (6) Pressure-test variable bore-pipe rams against all sizes of pipe 
in use, excluding drill collars and bottom-hole tools; and
    (7) Test affected BOP components following the disconnection or 
repair of any well-pressure containment seal in the wellhead or BOP 
stack assembly;
    (e) Postponing BOP tests. You may postpone a BOP test if you have 
well-control problems. You must conduct the required BOP test as soon as 
possible (i.e., first trip out of the hole) after the problem has been 
remedied. You must record the reason for postponing any test in the 
driller's report.
    (f) Weekly crew drills. You must conduct a weekly drill to 
familiarize all personnel engaged in well-completion operations with 
appropriate safety measures.
    (g) BOP inspections. You must visually inspect your BOP system and 
marine riser at least once each day if weather and sea conditions 
permit. You may use television cameras to inspect this equipment. The 
District Supervisor may approve alternate methods and frequencies to 
inspect a marine riser.
    (h) BOP maintenance. You must maintain your BOP system to ensure 
that the equipment functions properly.
    (i) BOP test records. You must record the time, date, and results of 
all pressure tests, actuations, crew drills, and inspections of the BOP 
system, system components, and marine riser in the driller's report. In 
addition, you must:
    (1) Record BOP test pressures on pressure charts;
    (2) Have your onsite representative certify (sign and date) BOP test 
charts and reports as correct;
    (3) Document the sequential order of BOP and auxiliary equipment 
testing and the pressure and duration of each test. You may reference a 
BOP test plan if it is available at the facility;
    (4) Identify the control station or pod used during the test;
    (5) Identify any problems or irregularities observed during BOP 
system and equipment testing and record actions taken to remedy the 
problems or irregularities;
    (6) Retain all records including pressure charts, driller's report, 
and referenced documents pertaining to BOP tests, actuations, and 
inspections at the facility for the duration of the completion activity; 
and
    (7) After completion of the well, you must retain all the records 
listed in paragraph (i)(6) of this section for a period of 2 years at 
the facility, at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility, or 
at another location conveniently available to the District Supervisor.
    (j) Alternate methods. The District Supervisor may require, or 
approve, more frequent testing, as well as different test pressures and 
inspection methods, or other practices.

<R05>
Sec. 250.700  General requirements.

    (a) The lessee shall abandon all wells in a manner to assure 
downhole isolation of hydrocarbon zones, protection of freshwater 
aquifers, clearance of sites so as to avoid conflict with other uses of 
the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), and prevention of migration of 
formation fluids within the wellbore or to the seafloor. Any well which 
is no longer used or useful for lease operations shall be plugged and 
abandoned in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. However, no 
production well shall be abandoned until its lack of capacity for 
further profitable production of oil, gas, or sulphur has been 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the District Supervisor. No well 
shall be plugged if the plugging operations would jeopardize safe and 
economic operations of nearby wells, unless the well poses a hazard to 
safety or the environment.
    (b) Lessees must plug and abandon all well bores, remove all 
platforms or other facilities, and clear the ocean of all obstructions 
to other users. This obligation:
    (1) Accrues to the lessee when the well is drilled, the platform or 
other facility is installed, or the obstruction is created; and
    (2) Is the joint and several responsibility of all lessees and 
owners of operating rights under the lease at the time the obligation 
accrues, and of each future lessee or owner of operating rights, until 
the obligation is satisfied under the requirements of this part.

hydrocarbon-bearing zone which is capable of natural flow shall be 
equipped with a surface-controlled SSSV, except as specified in 
paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section. The surface controls may 
be located on the site or a remote location. Wells not previously 
equipped with a surface-controlled SSSV and wells in which a surface-
controlled SSSV has been replaced with a subsurface-controlled SSSV in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be equipped with 
a surface-controlled SSSV when the tubing is first removed and 
reinstalled.
    (d) Subsurface-controlled SSSV's. Wells may be equipped with 
subsurface-controlled SSSV's in lieu of a surface-controlled SSSV 
provided the lessee demonstrates to the District Supervisor's 
satisfaction that one of the following criteria are met:
    (1) Wells not previously equipped with surface-controlled SSSV's 
shall be so equipped when the tubing is first removed and reinstalled,
    (2) The subsurface-controlled SSSV is installed in wells completed 
from a single-well or multiwell satellite caisson or seafloor 
completions, or
    (3) The subsurface-controlled SSSV is installed in wells with a 
surface-controlled SSSV that has become inoperable and cannot be 
repaired without removal and reinstallation of the tubing.
    (e) Design, installation, and operation of SSSV's. The SSSV's shall 
be designed, installed, operated, and maintained to ensure reliable 
operation.
    (1) The device shall be installed at a depth of 100 feet or more 
below the seafloor within 2 days after production is established. When 
warranted by conditions such as permafrost, unstable bottom conditions, 
hydrate formation, or paraffins, an alternate setting depth of the 
subsurface safety device may be approved by the District Supervisor.
    (2) Until a subsurface safety device is installed, the well shall be 
attended in the immediate vicinity so that emergency actions may be 
taken while the well is open to flow. During testing and inspection 
procedures, the well shall not be left unattended while open to 
production unless a properly operating subsurface-safety device has been 
installed in the well.
    (3) The well shall not be open to flow while the subsurface safety 
device is removed, except when flowing of the well is necessary for a 
particular operation such as cutting paraffin, bailing sand, or similar 
operations.

controlled SSSV or an injection valve capable of preventing backflow 
shall be installed in all injection wells. This requirement is not 
applicable if the District Supervisor concurs that the well is incapable 
of flowing. The lessee shall verify the no-flow condition of the well 
annually.
    (h) Temporary removal for routine operations. (1) Each wireline- or 
pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device may be removed, without 
further authorization or notice, for a routine operation which does not 
require the approval of a Form MMS-124, Sundry Notices and Reports on 
Wells, in Sec. 250.601 of this part for a period not to exceed 15 days.
    (2) The well shall be identified by a sign on the wellhead stating 
that the subsurface safety device has been removed. The removal of the 
subsurface safety device shall be noted in the records as required in 
Sec. 250.804(b) of this part. If the master valve is open, a trained 
person shall be in the immediate vicinity of the well to attend the well 
so that emergency actions may be taken, if necessary.
    (3) A platform well shall be monitored, but a person need not remain 
in the well-bay area continuously if the master valve is closed. If the 
well is on a satellite structure, it must be attended or a pump-through

the master valve closed, unless otherwise approved by the District 
Supervisor.
    (4) The well shall not be allowed to flow while the subsurface 
safety device is removed, except when flowing the well is necessary for 
that particular operation. The provisions of this paragraph are not 
applicable to the testing and inspection procedures in Sec. 250.804 of 
this part.
    (i) Additional safety equipment. All tubing installations in which a 
wireline- or pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device is installed 
after the effective date of this subpart shall be equipped with a 
landing nipple with flow couplings or other protective equipment above 
and below to provide for the setting of the SSSV. The control system for 
all surface-controlled SSSV's shall be an integral part of the platform 
Emergency Shutdown System (ESD). In addition to the activation of the 
ESD by manual action on the platform, the system may be activated by a 
signal from a remote location. Surface-controlled SSSV's shall close in 
response to shut-in signals from the ESD and in response to the fire 
loop or other fire detection devices.
    (j) Emergency action. In the event of an emergency, such as an 
impending storm, any well not equipped with a subsurface safety device 
and which is capable of natural flow shall have the device properly 
installed as soon as possible with due consideration being given to 
personnel safety.

Sec. 250.803  Additional production system requirements.

    (a) General. Lessees shall comply with the following production 
safety system requirements (some of which are in addition to those 
contained in API RP 14C), incorporated by reference in Sec. 250.802(b) 
of this part.
    (b) Design, installation, and operation of additional production 
systems. (1) Pressure and fired vessels. Pressure and fired vessels 
shall be designed, fabricated, code stamped, and maintained in 
accordance with applicable provisions of sections I, IV, and VIII of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. All existing uncoded vessels in 
use must be justified and approval for continued

[[Page 320]]

use obtained from the District Supervisor no later than August 29, 1988.
    (i) Pressure relief valves shall be designed, installed, and 
maintained in accordance with applicable provisions of sections I, IV, 
and VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The relief valves 
shall conform to the valve-sizing and pressure-relieving requirements 
specified in these documents; however, the relief valves, except 
completely redundant relief valves, shall be set no higher than the 
maximum-allowable working pressure of the vessel. All relief valves and 
vents shall be piped in such a way as to prevent fluid from striking 
personnel or ignition sources.
    (ii) Steam generators operating at less than 15 pounds per square 
inch gauge (psig) shall be equipped with a level safety low (LSL) sensor 
which will shut off the fuel supply when the water level drops below the 
minimum safe level. Steam generators operating at greater than 15 psig 
require, in addition to an LSL, a water-feeding device which will 
automatically control the water level.
    (iii) The lessee shall use pressure recorders to establish the new 
operating pressure ranges of pressure vessels at any time when there is 
a change in operating pressures that requires new settings for the high-
pressure shut-in sensor and/or the low-pressure shut-in sensor as 
provided herein. The pressure-recorder charts used to determine current 
operating pressure ranges shall be maintained at the lessee's field 
office nearest the OCS facility or at other locations conveniently 
available to the District Supervisor. The high-pressure shut-in sensor 
shall be set no higher than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, 
above the highest operating pressure of the vessel. This setting shall 
also be set sufficiently below (5 percent or 5 psi, whichever is 
greater) the relief valve's set pressure to assure that the pressure 
source is shut in before the relief valve activates. The low-pressure 
shut-in sensor shall activate no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi, 
whichever is greater, below the lowest pressure in the operating range. 
The activation of low-pressure sensors on pressure vessels which operate 
at less than 5 psi shall be approved by the District Supervisor on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (2) Flowlines. (i) Flowlines from wells shall be equipped with high- 
and low-pressure shut-in sensors located in accordance with section A.1 
and Figure A1 of API RP 14C. The lessee shall use pressure recorders to 
establish the new operating pressure ranges of flowlines at any time 
when there is a significant change in operating pressures. The most 
recent pressure-recorder charts used to determine operating pressure 
ranges shall be maintained at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS 
facility or at other locations conveniently available to the District 
Supervisor. The high-pressure shut-in sensor(s) shall be set no higher 
than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above the highest 
operating pressure of the line. But in all cases, it shall be set 
sufficiently below the maximum shut-in wellhead pressure or the gas-lift 
supply pressure to assure actuation of the SSV. The low-pressure shut-in 
sensor(s) shall be set no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is 
greater, below the lowest operating pressure of the line in which it is 
installed.
    (ii) If a well flows directly to the pipeline before separation, the 
flowline and valves from the well located upstream of and including the 
header inlet valve(s) shall have a working pressure equal to or greater 
than the maximum shut-in pressure of the well unless the flowline is 
protected by one of the following:
    (A) A relief valve which vents into the platform flare scrubber or 
some other location approved by the District Supervisor. The platform 
flare scrubber shall be designed to handle, without liquid-hydrocarbon 
carryover to the flare, the maximum-anticipated flow of liquid 
hydrocarbons which may be relieved to the vessel.
    (B) Two SSV's with independent high-pressure sensors installed with 
adequate volume upstream of any block valve to allow sufficient time for 
the valve(s) to close before exceeding the maximum allowable working 
pressure.
    (3) Safety sensors. All shutdown devices, valves, and pressure 
sensors shall function in a manual reset mode. Sensors with integral 
automatic reset

[[Page 321]]

shall be equipped with an appropriate device to override the automatic 
reset mode. All pressure sensors shall be equipped to permit testing 
with an external pressure source.

nonrestricted to enable the rapid actuation of the shutdown system. Only 
ESD stations at the boat landing may utilize a loop of breakable 
synthetic tubing in lieu of a valve.
    (ii) Closure of the SSV shall not exceed 45 seconds after automatic 
detection of an abnormal condition or actuation of an ESD. The surface-
controlled SSSV shall close in not more than 2 minutes after the shut-in 
signal has closed the SSV. Design-delayed closure time greater than 2 
minutes shall be justified by the lessee based on the individual well's 
mechanical/production characteristics and be approved by the District 
Supervisor.
    (iii) A schematic of the ESD which indicates the control functions 
of all safety devices for the platforms shall be maintained by the 
lessee on the platform or at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS 
facility or other location conveniently available to the District 
Supervisor.

Sec. 250.904  Environmental conditions.

    (a) General. The performance standards of this section pertain to 
all platforms covered by these requirements regardless of the 
fabrication material.
    (1) Environmental considerations. All environmental phenomena 
appropriate to the areas of fabrication, transportation, and 
installation of an offshore platform shall be considered and their 
influence on the platform accounted for. Such phenomena shall include 
wind, waves, current, temperature, tide, marine growth, chemical 
components of air and water, snow and ice, earthquakes, tsunami, seiche, 
and other appropriate phenomena.
    (2) Environmental data. Statistical data and defensible statistical 
and mathematical models shall be employed to describe the range of 
pertinent expected variations of environmental phenomena. Defensible 
data supplied by meteorologists, oceanographers, or other appropriate 
specialists are acceptable as the basis for design. Where possible, 
environmental phenomena shall be described by the characteristic 
parameters most relevant in the evaluation of effects on the platform.
    (b) Statistical methods. (1) When statistical methods are employed 
in the determination of parameters characterizing environmental 
phenomena, the statistical methods and distributions employed shall be 
appropriate to their application as evidenced by relevant statistical 
tests, confidence limits, and other measures of statistical 
significance.
    (2) Short-term and long-term variations of environmental phenomena 
such as wind, waves, and current shall

[[Page 331]]

be described by statistical distributions relevant to the parameter 
considered. Defensible statistical modeling techniques shall be used in 
the prediction of extreme values.
    (3) When hindcasting techniques are employed to approximate 
environmental parameters, the validity of the model used shall be 
defensible.
    (c) Design considerations. (1) General. A thorough assessment of the 
environment in the vicinity of the installation site shall be made to 
determine the conditions expected to occur at the site over the life of 
the platform.
    (2) Design environmental condition. (i) ``Design environmental 
condition'' means the environmental factors producing the most 
unfavorable effects on the platform. Parameters describing the design 
environmental condition are given in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (A), (B), and 
(C) of this section.
    (ii) The design environmental condition shall reflect the various 
environmental events that individually or collectively represent the 
most severe conditions the platform is anticipated to experience. Such 
conditions shall be formulated with a set of parameters that describe 
the relevant environmental events, including the following:
    (A) The maximum wave corresponding to a selected recurrence period 
together with the associated wind, current, and appropriate ice and snow 
effects;
    (B) The minimum air and sea temperatures appropriate to the event 
being treated; and
    (C) The maximum water level due to tide and storm surge.
    (iii) Consideration shall be given to other combinations of the 
parameters specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section 
involving either maximum wind, maximum current, or maximum ice load 
which may cause a greater response of the platform.
    (iv) In general, the recurrence period chosen for the events 
specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (A) and (C) of this section shall 
primarily be based on the design service life of the platform. For 
platforms designed for a service life of 20 years, the recurrence period 
chosen for the determination of these events shall not be less than 100 
years. For other service lives, the design event recurrence interval 
shall generally be adjusted to provide for a risk of occurrence which 
does not exceed the risk of occurrence for the 20-year/100-year 
combination.
    (v) For installation sites located in seismically active areas, see 
paragraph (d)(8) of this section.
    (3) Operating environmental conditions. Operating environmental 
conditions means the set of characteristic parameters of environmental 
conditions associated with a normal function or operation to be 
conducted on the platform. For each such intended normal function or 
operation, the lessee shall determine a set of characteristic parameters 
of environmental conditions.
    (d) Specific environmental conditions. (1) Waves information 
including the following:
    (i) Wave conditions considered for design shall be described by 
defensible statistical and/or deterministic methods.
    (ii) Parameters characterizing design environmental waves shall be 
based on wave statistics or the results of defensible analytic 
prediction methods such as hindcasting techniques.
    (iii) When using probabilistic analyses, the probability of 
occurrence of various wave-height groups classified by directionality 
and for a wide range of possible periods (i.e., tables of exceedance) 
shall be determined. Where required by the method selected to predict 
extreme values, the average duration of various wave-height groups 
(i.e., persistence data) shall be determined. All extrapolations and 
long-term wave data analyses shall use defensible techniques, and 
available data on extreme values measured in the vicinity of the site 
shall be included in the long-term prediction.
    (iv) When using deterministic methods, waves shall be described by 
the parameters, height, period, and other relevant shape 
characteristics. The design-wave formulation used shall be valid for the 
problem considered.
    (v) Breaking-wave criteria appropriate to the installation site 
shall be determined using defensible formulations.
    (vi) If spectral wave data are established for the dynamic analysis 
of structural response to waves, such data

[[Page 332]]

shall be derived in accordance with defensible methods. If spectral data 
are not available in adequate quantities for the intended application, 
defensible mathematical formulations that best fit the available data 
shall be used.
    (2) Wind information including the following:
    (i) Wind velocities shall be classified on the basis of their 
duration. Wind velocities having a duration of less than 1 minute are 
referred to as gust winds. Wind velocities having a duration equal to or 
greater than 1 minute are referred to as sustained winds. The reference 
elevation is 33 feet above still-water level.
    (ii) Wind conditions considered for design shall be described by 
defensible statistical or deterministic methods.
    (iii) Wind profiles shall be determined on the basis of defensible 
statistical or mathematical models. Corrections of wind velocity data to 
averaging periods other than those employed in the collections of data 
shall be based on defensible methods.
    (iv) Distribution of the direction and speed of wind approach to the 
platform shall be determined, or alternatively, winds shall be 
considered to approach from any direction.
    (3) Current information including the following:
    (i) Current velocities to be used in design shall be determined on 
the basis of the best statistics available. Tidal current, wind-
generated current, density current, circulation current, and river-
outflow current shall be combined on the basis of their probability of 
simultaneous occurrence in arriving at current velocities to be used in 
design.
    (ii) Current velocity profiles shall be determined on the basis of 
site-specific studies or defensible empirical relationships. Unusual 
profiles due to bottom currents and stratified effects in regions near 
the mouth of large rivers shall be accounted for.
    (iii) Directional data on currents which exist in the absence of 
waves shall be described for each month or by season. Unless a detailed 
study of current directions is made, currents shall be assumed to run in 
any direction.
    (4) Tide information including the following:
    (i) The design storm-tide elevation shall be identified for the 
installation site. For design purposes, the design environmental wave 
height shall be superimposed on the storm-tide elevation.
    (ii) Variations in the elevation of the daily lunar tide shall be 
used in determining the elevations of boat landings, barge fenders, and 
the corrosion-prevention treatment of platforms in the splash zone (see 
Sec. 250.906(c)(5) of this part).
    (iii) The assumed maximum or storm tide shall include astronomical 
tide, wind tide, and pressure-induced storm surge. Minimum-tide 
estimates shall be based on either the astronomical or lunar tide only. 
The water depth shall be referenced to a datum (e.g., mean low/water or 
mean low low/water) consistent with all other references to elevations 
and depths.
    (iv) If data directly applicable to the installation site are not 
available, the best estimate based on data for nearby locations shall be 
used.
    (5) Temperature information including the following:
    (i) Extreme values of low temperatures shall be expressed in terms 
of the most probable, lowest values with their corresponding recurrence 
periods;
    (ii) Air, sea surface, and seabed temperatures shall be accounted 
for in describing the environment and in justifying the temperatures 
used in design.
    (6) Snow and ice information including the following:
    (i) If the platform is to be located in an area where sea ice may 
develop or drift, ice conditions shall be accounted for. Data shall be 
derived from actual field investigations, laboratory analyses, or other 
appropriate analogous sources;
    (ii)(A) Relevant statistical and physical data on the sea-ice and 
snow conditions shall be described with particular attention to the 
following:
    (1) Concentration and distribution of ice and snow,
    (2) Morphology of sea ice (e.g., ice floes, ice ridges, or rafted 
ice),
    (3) Mechanical properties of ice (mode of failure),
    (4) Drift speed and direction,
    (5) Thickness of ice and keel depth of pressure ridges, and

[[Page 333]]

    (6) Probability of encountering icebergs, ice floes, ice-floe 
fragments, and hummocks.
    (B) The weight of the maximum snow and ice anticipated to accumulate 
on the platform shall be determined.
    (7) Marine growth information including the following:
    (i) When assessing the potential for marine growth, account shall be 
taken of relevant observations and experience in the area. In the 
absence of such information, defensible analytical techniques shall be 
employed to assess the potential for marine growth. These techniques 
shall take into account salinity, oxygen content, hydrogen-ion 
concentration value, current, temperature, water turbidity, and other 
appropriate factors.
    (ii) Consideration shall be given to the selection of surface 
coatings which resist breakdown by micro-organisms which reduce the 
onset of corrosion.
    (iii) Particular attention shall be paid to the effects that marine 
growth has on surface roughness characteristics of submerged structural 
members.
    (8) Earthquake information including the following:
    (i) The effects of earthquakes on platforms located in areas known 
to be seismically active shall be addressed.
    (ii) Except for the provision of Sec. 250.905(d)(5)(ii) of this 
part, the seismicity of the site shall be determined. Preferably, this 
shall be based on site-specific data. However, regional data shall be 
deemed acceptable for use when site-specific data are not available and 
the regional data are interpreted in a manner to produce the most 
adverse effect on a platform at the specific site. The following data 
shall be obtained:
    (A) Recurrence interval of seismic events appropriate to the design 
life of the structure,
    (B) Proximity to active faults,
    (C) Type of faulting,
    (D) Attenuation of ground motion between the faults and the site,
    (E) Subsurface soil conditions, and
    (F) Records from past seismic events at the site or from analogous 
sites.
    (iii) The use of available data to describe the seismic 
characteristics of the site is permitted where it can be shown that such 
data are consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of 
this section.
    (iv) The seismic data shall be used to establish a quantitative 
design earthquake criterion describing the design earthquake-induced 
ground motion. In addition to ground motion and as applicable to the 
installation site, the following earthquake-related phenomena shall be 
taken into account:
    (A) Liquefaction of subsurface soils,
    (B) Submarine slides,
    (C) Tsunamis, and
    (D) Fluid motions in tanks.

occurrence. The simultaneous occurrence of environmental loads shall be 
modeled by appropriate superposition methods.

proximity of the site to the potential source faults, the attenuation or 
amplification of ground motion between the faults and the site, and the 
soil conditions at the site.
    (iii) Ground-motion descriptions shall consist of three components 
corresponding to two orthogonal horizontal directions and the vertical 
direction. All three components shall be applied to the platform

Sec. 250.906  General design requirements.

    (a) General. This section specifies the general concepts and methods 
of analysis to be incorporated in the design of a platform.
    (b) Analytical approaches. (1) Structural response information 
including the following:
    (i) Methods of analysis employed in association with the 
specifications of these requirements shall treat geometric and material 
nonlinearities in a defensible manner. When nonlinear methods of 
analysis are used to assess collapse mechanisms, it shall be 
demonstrated that the platform has sufficient ductility to develop the 
required resistance or structural displacements.
    (ii) Where theoretically based analytical procedures covering the 
platform or parts thereof are unavailable or not well defined, model 
studies shall be utilized. The acceptability of model studies depends on 
the procedures employed, including enumeration of the possible sources 
of errors, the limits of applicability of the model test results, and 
the methods of extrapolation to full-scale data.
    (2) Loading format information including the following:
    (i) Either a deterministic or spectral format shall be employed to 
describe various load components. When a static approach is used, it 
shall be demonstrated, where appropriate, that the general effects of 
dynamic amplification were addressed. The influence of waves other than 
the highest waves shall be investigated for their potential to produce 
maximum peak stresses resulting from possible resonance with the 
platform.
    (ii) When considering the design earthquake as discussed in 
Sec. 250.905 of this part, a dynamic analysis shall be performed. A 
dynamic analysis shall also be performed to assess the effects of 
environmental or other types of loads if significant dynamic 
amplification is expected.
    (iii) For fatigue analysis, the long-term distribution of the stress 
range, with proper consideration of dynamic effects, shall be obtained 
for relevant loadings anticipated during the design life of the platform 
(see Secs. 250.907(c)(6) and 250.908(c)(6) of this part).
    (3) Combinations of loading components information including the 
following:
    (i) Loads imposed during and after installation shall be taken into 
account. Of the various loads described in Sec. 250.905, of this part, 
those loads to be considered for design shall be combined in a manner 
consistent with their probability of simultaneous occurrence. However, 
earthquake loadings shall be applied without consideration of other 
environmental effects unless conditions at the site necessitate their 
inclusion. The direction of applied environmental loads shall be that 
producing the highest possible influences on the platform, considering 
the platform's orientation and location with respect to bottom 
topography, direction of fetch, and nearby land masses.
    (ii) While it is required to obtain and use those loading components 
which produce realistic maximum effects on the platform, loading 
combinations corresponding to conditions after installation shall 
reflect both operating and design environmental loadings. Sections 
250.907, 250.908, and 250.909 of

[[Page 338]]

this part give the minimum load combinations to be considered.
    (iii) The operating environmental conditions and the maximum 
tolerable environmental loads during installation shall be specified.
    (c) Overall design considerations. (1) Design life. The design 
service life of the platform shall be specified as prescribed in 
Sec. 250.904(c)(2)(iv) of this part.
    (2) Air gap. An air gap of 5 feet shall be provided between the 
maximum crest elevation of the design wave (including tidal effects) and 
the lowest portion of the platform upon which wave forces have not been 
included in the design. After accounting for the initial and long-term 
settlements resulting from consolidation and subsidence, the elevation 
of the crest of the design wave shall be based on the elevation of the 
mean low-water line, astronomical and storm tides, wave runup, the 
tilting of the platform, and where necessary, tsunamis.
    (3) Long-term and secondary effects. The following effects shall be 
addressed, as appropriate, for the planned platform:
    (i) Local vibration due to machinery, equipment, and vortex 
shedding;
    (ii) Stress concentrations at critical joints;
    (iii) Secondary stresses induced by large deflections (P-<greek-D> 
effects);
    (iv) Cumulative fatigue;
    (v) Corrosion;
    (vi) Marine growth; and
    (vii) Ice abrasion.
    (4) General arrangement. The platform and equipment shall be 
arranged to minimize the potential of structural damage and personal 
injury resulting from accidents. In this regard, the consequences of the 
arrangement or placement of the following components and their effects 
shall be addressed:
    (i) Equipment and machinery--noise and vibration,
    (ii) High-pressure piping--leakage in closed spaces,
    (iii) Lifting devices--dropped loads, and
    (iv) Vessel mooring devices--line breakage and tripping quick-
release mechanisms.
    (5) Corrosion-protection zones. Measures taken to mitigate the 
effects of corrosion as required by Secs. 250.907(d) and 250.908(c)(5) 
of this part shall be specified and described in terms of the following 
definitions for corrosion-protection zones:
    (i) Submerged zone--that part of the platform below the splash zone,
    (ii) Splash zone--that part of the platform between the highest and 
lowest water levels reached by sea states exceeded for 1 percent of the 
time annually when superimposed on the highest and lowest levels of tide 
with due allowance for high and low installation of the platform,
    (iii) Atmospheric zone--that part of the platform above the splash 
zone,
    (iv) Ice zone--that part of the platform which can reasonably be 
expected to come into contact with floating or submerged ice annually.

Sec. 250.907  Steel platforms.

    (a) Materials--(1) General. (i) This section covers specifications 
for materials used for the construction of steel pile-supported 
platforms. Steels shall be suitable for their intended service as 
demonstrated by testing under relevant service conditions or previous 
satisfactory performance under service conditions similar to those 
intended. Steels shall be of good commercial quality, defined by 
specification, and free of injurious defects.
    (ii) Steels shall exhibit satisfactory formability and weldability 
characteristics and fracture toughness satisfactory for the intended 
applications. Materials for structural members which are fracture 
critical or for members which sustain significant tensile stress and 
whose fracture would pose a threat to the survival of the platform shall 
have sufficient toughness to guard against brittle fracture. Materials 
selected for members which are subjected to significant tensile stress 
shall have toughness suitable to their intended application.
    (iii) In cases where principal loads from either service or weld 
residual stresses are imposed normal to the plate, appropriate 
precautions shall be taken to avoid lamellar tearing parallel to the 
plate surface.

[[Page 339]]

    (2) Material selection information including the following:
    (i) Steels for structural members shall be selected according to 
criteria that take into account the required yield strength, fracture 
toughness, service temperature (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section), 
and intended application;
    (ii) Bolts and nuts shall have mechanical and corrosion properties 
comparable to the structural elements being joined. Materials for bolts 
and nuts shall be defined by and tested in accordance with material 
standards compatible with those for the joined structural members;
    (iii) When new alloys are used, the adequacy of fracture toughness 
shall be supported by appropriate fracture tests; and
    (iv) When materials other than steel are used for structural 
purposes, the mechanical and durability properties necessary for their 
intended function shall be designated, including toughness and fatigue 
characteristics, where necessary.
    (3) Service temperature. Service temperature means the temperature 
that the material is expected to achieve in the operational environment.
    (i) For material at or below the waterline, the minimum service 
temperature shall be the lowest average daily water temperature 
applicable to the particular depth. For material above the waterline, 
the minimum service temperature shall be the lowest 1-day average daily 
atmospheric temperature over a 10-year period, unless the material is 
warmed by auxiliary heating.
    (ii) In all cases where material temperature is reduced by localized 
cryogenic storage or other cooling means, such factors shall be 
accounted for in establishing minimum service temperature.
    (4) Classification of applications. When considering the welding 
requirements given in subsequent sections, materials shall be considered 
as ``Weld Class A'' if the members are critical or special structural 
elements, ``Weld Class B'' if the members are primary load-carrying 
members of the platform, or ``Weld Class C'' if the members are 
secondary structural elements.
    (5) Material designation. All material employed in platform 
construction shall be described and designated by a material 
specification.
    (b) Fabrication and welding--(1) General. (i) Welding shall be 
performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the American 
Welding Society (AWS) publication, AWS D1.1, Structural Welding Code--
Steel, or other appropriate welding codes.
    (ii) Fabrication other than welding shall be performed in accordance 
with American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) publication, 
Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, Allowable Stress Design 
and Plastic Design, or other appropriate codes. The code to be followed 
during fabrication and construction shall be specified on design 
documents.
    (2) Welding. (i) Welding procedures and filler metals shall be 
selected to produce sound welds, and the filler metal shall have 
strength and toughness compatible with the base metal. Workmanship shall 
be in compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (ii) Forming processes shall not degrade the base metals below their 
minimum required properties. A heat treatment shall be employed to 
provide the required properties, where necessary.
    (iii) Misalignment between parallel (abutting) members shall be 
minimized. Weld size for fillet welds shall be sufficient to compensate 
for the gap between faying surfaces of the members. Lapped joints shall 
possess sufficient overlaps. Both edges of an overlap joint shall have 
continuous fillet welds.
    (iv) When arc-air gouging is employed, the carbon buildup and 
burning of the weld or base metals shall be minimized.
    (v) Peening shall not be used for single-pass welds or for the root 
or cover passes of multipass welds. Peening shall be used only after 
cleaning of weld passes. Fairing by heating, flame shrinking, or other 
methods, when applied to Weld Class A or B structural elements, shall be 
performed without damaging the base metals. Such corrective measures 
shall be kept to a minimum when treating high-strength steels.

[[Page 340]]

    (3) Quality assurance. A documented inspection plan shall be 
prepared and followed and shall cover the following items:
    (i) A suitable system for material identification and quality 
control during all stages of construction,
    (ii) Requirements for welding procedures and welder qualifications,
    (iii) The extent of weld inspection (including nondestructive 
examination methods) and the criteria for weld acceptance or rejection, 
and
    (iv) Necessary dimensional tolerances.
    (4) Weld nondestructive examination. (i) All welds shall be 
subjected to visual examination. Nondestructive examination shall be 
conducted to the extent indicated in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this 
section after all forming and postweld heat treatments have been 
completed. Weld examination procedures shall be adequate to detect 
delayed weld cracking in cases involving high-strength steels or high-
hydrogen welding processes.
    (ii) As called for in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, a plan 
for nondestructive examination of the welds shall be prepared and 
followed. The extent of inspection of Weld Classes A and B structural 
elements shall be consistent with the applications involved. Important 
welds of Weld Classes A and B structural elements are those inaccessible 
or very difficult to inspect in service. Important welds shall be 
subjected to an increased level of nondestructive examination during 
fabrication.
    (iii) If the proportion of unacceptable welds becomes excessive, the 
frequency of nondestructive examination shall be increased.
    (c) Design and analysis--(1) General. (i) Steel platforms shall be 
adequately designed and analyzed to withstand the loads to which they 
are likely to be exposed during their design life. The effects on the 
platform shall be determined for a minimum set of loading conditions by 
using a defensible method to ensure that the resulting responses do not 
exceed the safety criteria appropriate to the methods employed.
    (ii) The use of design methods, other than those specifically 
covered in this section, and their associated safety criteria are 
allowed if it can be demonstrated that such alternative methods will 
result in a structural safety level equivalent to that provided by the 
direct application of these requirements.
    (iii) Sections 250.905 and 250.906 of this part shall be consulted 
regarding definitions and requirements pertinent to the determination of 
loads and general design requirements.
    (2) Loading conditions. (i) Appropriate loading conditions that 
produce the most adverse effects on the platform during and after 
fabrication and installation shall be considered;
    (ii) Loadings corresponding to conditions after installation shall 
include at least those relating to both the operating and design 
environmental conditions, combined with other pertinent loads in the 
following manner:
    (A) Operating environmental conditions combined with dead and live 
loads appropriate to the function and operation of the platform;
    (B) Design environmental conditions combined with dead and live 
loads appropriate to the function and operation of the platform;
    (C) Design environmental conditions combined with dead loads and 
minimum live loads appropriate to the function and operation of the 
platform; and
    (iii) For platforms located in seismically active areas, loads 
induced by earthquake ground motions shall be combined with dead and 
live loads appropriate to the operation and function of the platform.
    (3) Methods of design and analysis. (i) The nature of loads and 
loading combinations as well as the local environmental conditions shall 
be considered in the selection of design methods. Methods of analysis 
and their associated assumptions shall be compatible with the overall 
design principles.
    (ii) Linear, elastic methods (working stress methods) of design and 
analysis are acceptable if proper measures are taken to prevent general 
and local buckling failure. Regarding structural instability as a 
possible mode of failure, the effects of initial stresses and geometric 
imperfection shall be taken into account.

[[Page 341]]

    (iii) Dynamic effects shall be accounted for if the wave energy in 
the frequency range of the structural resonance frequencies is of 
sufficient magnitude to produce significant stresses in the platform. 
The determination of dynamic effects shall be accomplished either by 
computing the dynamic amplification effects in conjunction with a 
deterministic analysis or by a random dynamic analysis based on a 
spectral formulation. In the latter case, the analysis shall be 
accompanied by a statistical description and evaluation of the relevant 
input parameters.
    (iv) The interaction of the soil with the platform's piles shall be 
included in the analytical model used to obtain the structural response 
(see Sec. 250.909(d)(1)(ii) of this part).
    (v) For static loads, plastic methods of design and analysis shall 
be employed only when the properties of the steel and the connections 
exclude the possibility of brittle fracture and allow for formation of 
plastic hinges with sufficient plastic rotation capacity and adequate 
fatigue resistance.
    (vi) Whenever plastic analysis is used, it shall be demonstrated 
that the collapse mode (mechanism) corresponding to the smallest loading 
intensities has been used for the determination of the ultimate strength 
of the platform. The effect of buckling and other destabilizing 
nonlinear effects shall be taken into account in the plastic analysis of 
platforms with compressive forces. Whenever nonmonotonic or repeating 
loads are present, it shall be demonstrated that the structure will not 
fail by incremental collapse or fatigue.
    (vii) Under dynamic loads when plastic strains may occur, the 
considerations specified in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section shall be 
satisfied and any buckling and destabilizing nonlinear effects shall be 
taken into account.
    (4) Allowable stresses and load factors. (i) When the design is 
based on a working-stress method (see paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section), the safety criteria shall be expressed in 
terms of appropriate basic allowable stresses in accordance with 
requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(4) (ii) through (vi) of this 
section.
    (ii) For structural members and loadings covered by AISC 
publication, Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, Allowable 
Stress Design and Plastic Design, with the exception of earthquake 
loadings (see paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section) and tubular 
structural members under the combined loading of axial compression and 
bending, the basic allowable stresses of the members shall be obtained 
using the AISC specification. For tubular members subjected to the 
aforementioned interaction, stress limits shall be set in accordance 
with a defensible formulation.
    (iii) Where stresses in members listed in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of 
this section are shown to result from forces imposed by the design 
environmental conditions acting alone or in combination with dead and 
live loads (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), the basic 
allowable stresses cited in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, 
modified by a factor of four-thirds, are permitted for the design 
environmental load contribution if the resulting structural member sizes 
are not less than those required for dead and live loads plus operating 
environmental conditions without the one-third increase in allowable 
stresses.
    (iv) For any two- or three-dimensional stress fields within the 
scope of the working-stress formulation, the equivalent stress (e.g., 
the von Mises stress intensity) shall be limited by an appropriate 
allowable stress less than the yield stress, with the exception of 
stresses of a highly localized nature. In the latter case, local 
yielding of the structure is acceptable if it can be demonstrated that 
such yielding does not lead to progressive collapse of the overall 
platform and that the general structural stability can be maintained.
    (v) When considering loading combinations on individual members or 
on the overall platform, which include loads defined as accidental (see 
Sec. 250.905(c)(4) of this part), or in pursuing structural analysis for 
earthquake loads (see paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section), the 
allowable stress set at a level of the minimum yield or buckling 
strength of the material shall be considered appropriate.

[[Page 342]]

    (vi) Whenever elastic instability, overall or local, may occur 
before the compressive stresses reach the minimum specified yield 
strength of the material, appropriate allowable buckling stresses shall 
govern.
    (vii) Whenever the ultimate strength of the platform is used as the 
basis for the design of its members, the safety factors or the factored 
loads shall be formulated in accordance with the requirements of AISC 
publication, Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, Allowable 
Stress Design and Plastic Design, or an equivalent code. The capability 
of the primary structural members to develop their predicted ultimate 
load capacity shall be demonstrated.
    (viii) For details of high-stress concentration, consideration shall 
be given to safety against brittle fracture and to material quailty-
control procedures.
    (5) Structural response to earthquake loads. (i) Platforms located 
in seismically active areas shall be designed to possess adequate 
strength and stiffness to withstand the effects of an earthquake which 
has a reasonable likelihood of not being exceeded during the lifetime of 
the structure (see paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and remain 
stable during rare motions of greater severity;
    (ii) The adequacy of structural strength shall be demonstrated by 
analysis to verify that no significant structural damage occurs; and
    (iii) Platforms shall also possess adequate ductility to withstand a 
rare intense earthquake.
    (6) Fatigue assessment. (i) Structural members and joints for which 
fatigue is a probable mode of failure and for which past experiences are 
insufficient to ensure safety from possible cumulative fatigue damage 
shall be analyzed. Emphasis shall be given to joints and members in the 
splash zone, those that are difficult to inspect and repair after the 
platform is in service, and those susceptible to corrosion-accelerated 
fatigue, and
    (ii) For structural members and joints which require a detailed 
analysis of cumulative fatigue damage, the results of the analysis shall 
indicate a minimum calculated life of twice the design life (see 
Sec. 250.906(c)(1) of this part) of the platform if there is sufficient 
structural redundancy to prevent catastrophic failure of the platform as 
a result of fatigue failure of the member or joint under consideration. 
If such redundancy does not exist or if the desirable degree of 
redundancy is significantly reduced as a result of fatigue damages, the 
results of a fatigue analysis shall indicate a minimum calculated life 
of three times the design life of the platform.
    (d) Corrosion protection. All materials shall be protected from the 
effects of corrosion by a corrosion-protection system. The design of 
such systems shall take into account the possible existence of stress 
corrosion, corrosion fatigue, and galvanic corrosion. If the intended 
sea environment contains unusual contaminants, any special corrosive 
effects of such contaminants shall also be considered. Protection 
systems shall be designed in accordance with the National Association of 
Corrosion Engineers (NACE) publication, NACE Standard RP-01-76, 
Recommended Practice, Corrosion Control of Steel, Fixed Offshore 
Platforms Associated With Petroleum Production, or other comparable 
standards.
    (e) Connection of piles to structure. The attachment of the jacket 
structure to the piles shall be accomplished by positive, controlled 
means. Such attachments shall be capable of withstanding the static and 
long-term cyclic loadings to which they will be subjected.

addition, a ductility check shall also be performed to ensure that the 
platform has sufficient ductility to experience deflections more severe 
than those resulting from the design-earthquake loading without the

Sec. 250.909  Foundation.

    (a) General--(1) Coverage. Soil investigations, design 
considerations for the supporting soil, and the influence of the soil on 
the foundation structure are addressed in this section, including 
criteria for the strength and deformation characteristics of the 
foundation employed by both pile founded and gravity platforms.
    (2) Guidelines. (i) The degree of design conservatism shall reflect 
prior experience under similar conditions, the manner and extent of data 
collection, the scatter of design data, and the consequences of failure;
    (ii) For cases where the limits of applicability of any method of 
calculation employed are not well defined or where the soil 
characteristics are quite variable, the use of more than one method of 
calculation or a parametric study of the sensitivity of the important 
design variables shall be considered, and
    (iii) A listing of design parameters, necessary calculations, and 
test results shall be retained by the designer.
    (b) Site investigation--(1) General. (i) The actual extent, depth, 
and degree of precision to be obtained in the site investigation program 
shall reflect the type and intended use of the platform, characteristics 
of the site, similarity of the area based on previous site studies or 
platform installations as well as the consequences of a failure of the 
foundation. The site investigation program shall generally consist of 
three major phases as follows:
    (A) Shallow hazards (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section) to obtain 
relevant geophysical data.
    (B) Geological survey (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section) to 
obtain data of a regional nature concerning the site.
    (C) Subsurface investigation and testing (see paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section) to obtain the necessary geotechnical data. The results of 
these investigations shall be the basis for the additional site related 
studies specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (ii) A complete site-investigation program shall be furnished for 
each platform. The positioning devices used on the vessel employed in 
the site investigation as well as those used during the installation of 
the platform shall have sufficient accuracy to ensure that the data 
obtained are pertinent to the actual final location of the platform.
    (2) Shallow hazard survey. (i) Consistent with the objectives of 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a high-resolution or acoustic-
profiling survey shall be performed to obtain information on the 
conditions existing at and near the surface of the seafloor; and
    (ii) The information to be obtained from this survey shall include

seafloor subsidence shall be considered.
    (4) Subsurface investigation and testing. (i) The primary objective

characteristics of the soil.
    (iii) At least one borehole having a minimum depth of the 
anticipated length of the pile plus a zone of influence shall be drilled 
at the installation site for a pile-supported platform. Previously 
gathered borehole data may be used on a case-by-case basis, when 
approved by the Regional Supervisor. The zone of influence shall be 
sufficient to ensure that punch through failures will not occur. 
Additional boreholes of a lesser depth shall be required by the Regional 
Supervisor if discontinuities in the soil are indicated to exist in the 
area of the platform.
    (iv) For a gravity-type platform foundation, the required depth of 
the borehole shall be equal to at least the depth of the zone of 
influence which the structure imposes on the supporting soil. Where 
possible, in situ tests shall be performed to a depth that will include 
the anticipated shearing failure zone.
    (v) When samples from the field are sent to a laboratory for further 
testing, they shall be packed carefully and accurately labeled, and the 
results of visual inspections shall be recorded.
    (vi) A summary report showing the results of the soil testing 
program shall be prepared. The report shall describe briefly the various 
field and laboratory test methods employed and shall indicate the 
applicability of these methods as they relate to the quality of the 
sample, the type of soil, and the anticipated design application.
    (vii) The engineering properties of the soil to be used in the 
design shall be listed for each stratum. The selected design properties

term effects of cyclic loading with respect to changes in soil 
characteristics, whether caused by conditions during installation, 
seismic activity, or storms, shall be accomplished by using defensible 
methods.
    (3) Scour. (i) For unprotected foundations, the depth and lateral 
extent of scouring, as determined in the site investigation program, 
shall be accounted for in design; and
    (ii) If scour is not accounted for in design, either effective 
protection shall be furnished soon after the installation

[[Page 348]]

of the platform or frequent visual inspection shall be carried out, 
particularly after major storms.
    (4) Settlements and displacements. (i) Based on the type and 
function of the platform, tolerable limits shall be established for 
settlements and lateral deflections. Due consideration shall be given to 
the effect of these movements on risers, pilings, and other components 
which interact with the platform;
    (ii) Maximum allowable values of platform movements, as limited by 
these structural considerations or overall platform stability, shall be 
considered in the design.
    (5) Dynamic considerations. (i) For dynamic-loading conditions, a 
defensible method shall be employed to simulate the interactive effects 
between the soil and the platform, and
    (ii) The evaluation of the dynamic response of the platform shall 
account for, as appropriate, the nonlinear and inelastic characteristics 
of the soil, the possible deterioration of strength, the increased or 
decreased damping due to cyclic soil loading, and the influence of 
nearby platforms.
    (6) Loading conditions. (i) Loadings producing the worst effects on 
the foundation during and after installation shall be addressed; and
    (ii) In-place platform loadings to be checked shall include at least

appropriate to the function and operation of the platform,
    (B) Design environmental conditions with dead and live loads 
appropriate to the function and operation of the platform, and
    (C) Design environmental conditions with dead and minimum live loads 
appropriate to the function and operation of the platform.
    (d) Pile foundations--(1) General. The following requirements apply 
to pile-founded platforms. Pertinent parts of these requirements dealing

piles.
    (i) In the design of individual piles and piles in a group, the 
effects of axial, bending, and lateral loads shall be addressed.
    (ii) The design of a pile shall reflect the interactive behavior 
between the soil and the pile, between the pile and the platform, and 
between piles in a group.
    (iii) Methods of pile installation shall be consistent with the type 
of soil at the site and the installation equipment available. If 
unexpectedly high-driving resistance or other conditions lead to a 
failure of the pile to reach the desired penetration, the pile's 
capacities shall be reevaluated by considering the actual installation 
situation.
    (iv) Pile driving shall be performed and supervised by qualified and 
experienced personnel. Driving records which include such information as 
blowcounts and estimated hammer performance and stoppages shall be 
retained.
    (v) Where necessary, the effects of bottom instability in the 
vicinity of the platform shall be assessed.
    (2) Axial piles. (i) For piles in compression, the axial capacity 
shall be considered to consist of the skin friction, Q<INF>f</INF>, 
developed along the length of the pile and the end bearing, 
Q<INF>p</INF>, at the tip of the pile. The various parameters needed to 
evaluate Q<INF>f</INF> and Q<INF>p</INF> shall be predicted by using a 
defensible analytical method that employs reliably obtained soil data 
consistent with the prediction method selected. The acceptability of any 
method used to predict the components of pile resistance shall be 
demonstrated by showing satisfactory performance of the method under 
conditions similar to those existing at the actual site.
    (ii) The results of the dynamic pile driving analysis alone shall 
not be used to predict the axial load capacity of a pile.
    (iii) For piles driven through clay, the estimated skin friction 
developed over any increment of the pile surface shall not exceed the 
shear strength of the clay.
    (iv) The capacity of the internal plug of an open-ended pile shall 
be considered since it may limit the estimated end bearing to the pile.
    (v) When combining side friction and end-bearing effects in 
determining axial pile capacity, the load deflection

[[Page 349]]

response of the soil-pile system shall be addressed.
    (vi) For piles subjected to pullout loads, the contribution of the 
end resistance of the pile to its axial capacity shall not be 
considered. The possible variation of predicted pile-skin friction 
between the compressive and tensile modes of the axial-pile loading 
shall be considered.
    (3) Laterally loaded piles. (i) In evaluating the pile's behavior 
when acted upon by lateral loadings, the combined load deflection 
characteristics of the soil and the pile and the pile and the platform 
shall be addressed.
    (ii) The representation of the soil's lateral displacement when it 
is subjected to lateral loads shall adequately reflect the deterioration 
of the lateral load capacity when the soil is subjected to cyclic 
loading.
    (iii) The description of the lateral load versus displacement 
characteristics for the various soil strata shall be based on 
constitutive data obtained from suitable soil tests. The use of 
empirical methods to provide the description of the soil's lateral 
response shall be permitted if such methods are documented.
    (iv) Where applicable, the rapidly deteriorating cyclic lateral load 
capacity of stiff clays, especially those exhibiting the presence of a 
secondary structure, shall be addressed in the design.
    (v) Calculation of pile deflection and stress induced by lateral 
loads shall account for the nonlinear interaction between the soil and 
the pile.
    (4) Pile groups. Where applicable, the effects of close spacing on 
the load and deflection characteristics of pile groups shall be 
determined. The allowable load for a group, both axial and lateral, 
shall not exceed the sum of the apparent individual pile allowable 
loads.
    (5) Plastic analysis. When the design of a platform is based on the 
formation collapse mechanisms associated with a plastic analysis method, 
influence of the soil's support on the pile shall be addressed.
    (e) Gravity platforms foundations--(1) General. The following 
requirements apply to soil foundations for gravity platforms. Section 
250.138 of this part shall be consulted regarding the design of the base 
slab.
    (i) The influence of hydraulic and slope instability, if any, shall 
be determined for the structural loading cases that include the design 
environmental loading.
    (ii) The effects of adjacent platforms and the variation of soil 
properties in the horizontal direction shall be considered, as 
appropriate.
    (iii) The stability of the foundation with regard to bearing and 
sliding failure modes shall be investigated by employing the soil shear 
strengths determined with consideration of paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(2) 
of this section.
    (iv) When an underpressure or overpressure is experienced by the 
seafloor under the platform, provisions shall be made to prevent piping 
that could impair the integrity of the foundation.
    (v) Initial, consolidation, and secondary settlements, as well as 
permanent horizontal displacements, shall be determined.
    (vi) If the intended site is not level, the predicted tilt of the 
overall platform shall be based on the average bottom slope of the 
seafloor and the tolerance of the measuring device used in the site-
investigation program. Differential settlement shall also be calculated 
and the tilting of the platform caused by this settlement shall be 
combined with the predicted structural tilt of the overall platform. Any 
increased loading effects caused by tilting of the platform shall be 
addressed in stability requirements specified for the foundation.
    (2) Stability. (i) The bearing capacity and lateral resistance shall 
be calculated by considering the most unfavorable combination of loads. 
The long-term redistribution of bearing pressures under the base slab 
shall be considered to ensure that the maximum edge pressures are used 
in the design of the base.
    (ii) The lateral resistance of the platform shall be investigated 
considering various potential shearing planes. The presence of any soft 
layers shall require special consideration.
    (iii) Calculations for overturning moment and vertical forces 
induced by the passage of a wave shall include the vertical pressure 
distribution across the

[[Page 350]]

top of the foundation and along the seafloor. The foundation shall not 
lose contact with the soil due to uplift created by the maximum 
overturning moment.
    (iv) The capacity of the foundation to resist a deep-seated bearing 
failure shall be analyzed.
    (v) Where present, the additional effects of penetrating walls or 
skirts that transfer vertical and lateral loads to the soil shall be 
investigated for their contribution to bearing load capacity and lateral 
resistance.
    (3) Soil reaction on the platform. (i) For conditions during and 
after installation, the reaction of the soil against all structural 
members seated on or penetrating into the seafloor shall be determined 
and accounted for in the design of these members.
    (ii) The distribution of soil reactions shall be based on the 
results obtained in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) of this section, and 
the calculations of soil reactions shall account for any deviation from 
a plane surface, the load-deflection characteristics of the soil, and 
the geometry of the platform base.
    (iii) Where applicable, effects of local soil stiffening, 
nonhomogeneous soil properties, and boulders and other obstructions 
shall be addressed in the design. During installation, the possibility 
of local contact pressures due to irregular contact between the base and 
the seafloor shall be considered. Contact pressures shall be added to 
the hydrostatic pressure.
    (iv) The penetration resistance of structural elements projecting 
into the seafloor below the foundation structure shall be analyzed. The 
design of the ballasting system shall reflect uncertainties associated 
with achieving the required penetration of the platform.

[[Page 357]]

    (b)(1) Pipelines shall be hydrostatically tested with water at a 
stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at least 8 hours 
when installed, relocated, uprated, or reactivated after being out-of-
service for more than 1 year.
    (2) Prior to returning a pipeline to service after a repair, the 
pipeline shall be pressure tested with water or processed natural gas at 
a minimum stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at 
least 2 hours.
    (3) Pipelines shall not be pressure tested at a pressure which 
produces a stress in the pipeline in excess of 95 percent of the 
specified minimum-yield strength of the pipeline. A temperature recorder 
measuring test fluid temperature synchronized with a pressure recorder 
along with deadweight test readings shall be employed for all pressure 
testing. When a pipeline is pressure tested, no observable leakage shall 
be allowed. Pressure gauges and recorders shall be of sufficient 
accuracy to verify that leakage is not occurring.
    (4) The Regional Supervisor may require pressure testing of 
pipelines to verify the integrity of the system when the Regional 
Supervisor determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
line has been damaged or weakened by external or internal conditions.
    (c) When a pipeline is repaired utilizing a clamp, the clamp shall 
be a full encirclement clamp able to withstand the anticipated pipeline 
pressure.

flow safety valve (FSV).
    (ii) For sulphur operations, incoming pipelines delivering gas to 
the power plant platform may be equipped with high- and low-pressure 
sensors (PSHL), which activate audible and visual alarms in lieu of 
requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The PSHL shall be 
set at 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above and below the 
normal operating pressure range.
    (2) Incoming pipelines boarding to a production platform shall be 
equipped with an automatic shutdown valve (SDV) immediately upon 
boarding the platform. The SDV shall be connected to the automatic- and 
remote-emergency shut-in systems.
    (3) Departing pipelines receiving production from production 
facilities shall be protected by high- and low-pressure sensors (PSHL) 
to directly or indirectly shut in all production facilities. The PSHL 
shall be set not to exceed 15 percent above and below the normal 
operating pressure range. However, high pilots shall not be set above 
the pipeline's MAOP.
    (4) Crossing pipelines on production or manned nonproduction 
platforms which do not receive production from the platform shall be 
equipped with an SDV immediately upon boarding the platform. The SDV 
shall be operated by a PSHL on the departing pipelines and connected to 
the platform automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.
    (5) The Regional Supervisor may require that oil pipelines be 
equipped with a metering system to provide a continuous volumetric 
comparison between the input to the line at the structure(s) and the 
deliveries onshore. The system shall include an alarm system and shall 
be of adequate sensitivity to detect variations between input and 
discharge volumes. In lieu of the foregoing, a system capable of 
detecting leaks in the pipeline may be substituted with the approval of 
the Regional Supervisor.
    (6) Pipelines incoming to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with a 
block valve and an FSV. Bidirectional pipelines connected to a subsea 
tie-in shall be equipped with only a block valve.
    (7) Gas-lift or water-injection pipelines on unmanned platforms need 
only be equipped with an FSV installed immediately upstream of each 
casing annulus or the first inlet valve on the christmas tree.

[[Page 358]]

    (8) Bidirectional pipelines shall be equipped with a PSHL and an SDV 
immediately upon boarding each platform.
    (9) Pipeline pumps shall comply with Section A7 of API RP 14C. The 
setting levels for the PSHL devices are specified in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section.
    (c) If the required safety equipment is rendered ineffective or 
removed from service on pipelines which are continued in operation, an 
equivalent degree of safety shall be provided. The safety equipment 
shall be identified by the placement of a sign on the equipment stating 
that the equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service.

Sec. 250.1009  General requirements for a pipeline right-of-way grant.

    (a)(1) In addition to applicable requirements of Secs. 250.1000 
through 250.1008 and other regulations of this part, regulations of the 
Department of Transportation, Department of the Army, and the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), when a pipeline qualifies as a 
right-of-way pipeline, the pipeline shall not be installed until a 
right-of-way has been requested and granted in accordance with this 
subpart. The right-of-way grant is issued pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 1334(e) 
and may be acquired and held only by citizens and nationals of the 
United States; aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the 
United States as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20); private, public, or 
municipal corporations organized under the laws of the United States or 
territory thereof, the District of Columbia, or of any State; or 
associations of such citizens, nationals, resident aliens, or private, 
public, or municipal corporations, States, or political subdivisions of 
States.
    (2) A right-of-way shall include the site on which the pipeline and 
associated structures are to be situated, shall not exceed 200 feet in 
width unless safety and environmental factors during construction and 
operation of the associated right-of-way pipeline require a greater 
width, and shall be limited to the area reasonably necessary for pumping 
stations or other accessory structures.
    (b)(1) When you apply for, or are the holder of, a right-of-way, you 
must:
    (i) Provide and maintain a $300,000 bond (in addition to the bond 
coverage required in part 256) that guarantees compliance with all the 
terms and conditions of the rights-of-way you hold in an OCS area; and
    (ii) Provide additional security if the Regional Director determines 
that a bond in excess of $300,000 is needed.
    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph, listed below are the four 
areas:
    (i) The Alaska OCS Region,
    (ii) The Atlantic OCS Region,
    (iii) The Gulf of Mexico OCS Region, and
    (iv) The Pacific OCS Region
    (3) If, as the result of a default, the surety on a right-of-way 
grant bond makes payment to the Government of any indebtedness under a 
grant secured by the bond, the face amount of such bond and the surety's 
liability shall be reduced by the amount of such payment.
    (4) After a default, a new bond in the amount of $300,000 shall be 
posted within 6 months or such shorter period as the Regional Supervisor 
may direct. Failure to post a new bond shall be grounds for forfeiture 
of all grants covered by the defaulted bond.
    (c) An applicant, by accepting a right-of-way grant, agrees to 
comply with the following requirements:

[[Page 361]]

    (1) The right-of-way holder shall comply with applicable laws and 
regulations and the terms of the grant.
    (2) For the first calendar year, or fraction thereof, and annually 
thereafter, the right-of-way holder shall pay MMS, in advance, an annual 
rental of $15 for each statute mile, or fraction thereof, traversed by 
the right-of-way and $75 for each area to be used as a site for an 
accessory to the right-of-way pipeline including, but not limited to, a 
platform. Payments may be on an annual basis, for a 5-year period, or 
for multiples of 5 years.
    (3) The granting of the right-of-way shall be subject to the express 
condition that the rights granted shall not prevent or interfere in any 
way with the management, administration, or the granting of other rights 
by the United States, either prior or subsequent to the granting of the 
right-of-way. Moreover, the holder agrees to allow the occupancy and use 
by the United States, its lessees, or other right-of-way holders, of any 
part of the right-of-way grant not actually occupied or necessarily 
incident to its use for any necessary operations involved in the 
management, administration, or the enjoyment of such other granted 
rights.
    (4) If the right-of-way holder discovers any archaeological resource 
while conducting operations within the right-of-way, the right-of-way 
holder shall immediately halt operations within the area of the 
discovery and report the discovery to the Regional Director. If 
investigations determine that the resource is significant, the Regional 
Director will inform the lessee how to protect it.
    (5) The Regional Supervisor shall be kept informed at all times of 
the right-of-way holder's address and, if a corporation, the address of 
its principal place of business and the name and address of the officer 
or agent authorized to be served with process.
    (6) The right-of-way holder shall pay the United States or its 
lessees or right-of-way holders, as the case may be, the full value of 
all damages to the property of the United States or its said lessees or 
right-of-way holders and shall indemnify the United States against any 
and all liability for damages to life, person, or property arising from 
the occupation and use of the area covered by the right-of-way grant.
    (7)(i) The holder of a right-of-way oil or gas pipeline shall 
transport or purchase oil or natural gas produced from submerged lands 
in the vicinity of the pipeline without discrimination and in such 
proportionate amounts as the FERC may, after a full hearing with due 
notice thereof to the interested parties, determine to be reasonable, 
taking into account, among other things, conservation and the prevention 
of waste.
    (ii) Unless otherwise exempted by FERC pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 
1334(f)(2), the holder shall--
    (A) Provide open and nondiscriminatory access to a right-of-way 
pipeline to both owner and nonowner shippers, and
    (B) Comply with the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 1334(f)(1)(B) under 
which FERC may order an expansion of the throughput capacity of a right-
of-way pipeline which is approved after September 18, 1978, and which is 
not located in the Gulf of Mexico or the Santa Barbara Channel.
    (8) The area covered by a right-of-way and all improvements thereon 
shall be kept open at all reasonable times for inspection by the 
Minerals Management Service (MMS). The right-of-way holder shall make 
available all records relative to the design, construction, operation, 
maintenance and repair, and investigations on or with regard to such 
area.
    (9) Upon relinquishment, forfeiture, or cancellation of a right-of-
way grant, the right-of-way holder shall remove all platforms, 
structures, domes over valves, pipes, taps, and valves along the right-
of-way. All of these improvements shall be removed by the holder within 
1 year of the effective date of the relinquishment, forfeiture, or 
cancellation unless this requirement is waived in writing by the 
Regional Supervisor. All such improvements not removed within the time 
provided herein shall become the property of the United States but that 
shall not relieve the holder of liability for the cost of their removal 
or for restoration of the site. Furthermore, the holder is responsible 
for accidents or damages which

[[Page 362]]

might occur as a result of failure to timely remove improvements and 
equipment and restore a site. An application for relinquishment of a 
right-of-way grant shall be filed in accordance with Sec. 250.1014 of 
this part.
    (d) Failure to comply with the Act, regulations, or any conditions 
of the right-of-way grant prescribed by the Regional Supervisor shall be 
grounds for forfeiture of the grant in an appropriate judicial 
proceeding instituted by the United States in any U.S. District Court 
having jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 1349.
    (e) Any right-of-way granted under the provisions of this subpart 
remains in effect as long as the associated pipeline is properly 
maintained and used for the purpose for which the grant was made, unless 
otherwise expressly stated in the grant. Temporary cessation or 
suspension of pipeline operations shall not cause the grant to expire. 
However, if the purpose of the grant ceases to exist or use of the 
associated pipeline is permanently discontinued for any reason, the 
grant shall be deemed to have expired.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1011  Granting a pipeline right-of-way.

    (a) In considering an application for a right-of-way, the Regional 
Supervisor shall consider the potential effect of the associated 
pipeline on the human, marine, and coastal environments, life (including 
aquatic life), property, and mineral resources in the entire area during 
construction and operational phases. The Regional Supervisor shall 
prepare an environmental analysis in accordance with applicable policies 
and guidelines. To aid in the evaluation and determinations, the 
Regional Supervisor may request and consider views and recommendations 
of appropriate Federal Agencies, hold public meetings after appropriate 
notice, and consult, as appropriate, with State agencies, organizations, 
industries, and individuals. Before granting a pipeline right-of-way, 
the Regional Supervisor shall give consideration to any recommendation 
by the intergovernmental planning program, or similar process, for the 
assessment and management of OCS oil and gas transportation.
    (b) Should the proposed route of a right-of-way adjoin and 
subsequently cross any State submerged lands, the applicant shall submit 
evidence to the Regional Supervisor that the State(s) so affected has 
reviewed the application. The applicant shall also submit any comment 
received as a result of that review. In the event of a State 
recommendation to relocate the proposed route, the Regional Supervisor 
may consult with the appropriate State officials.
    (c)(1) The applicant shall submit photocopies of return receipts to 
the Regional Supervisor that indicate the date that each lessee or 
right-of-way holder referenced in Sec. 250.1010(c) of this part has 
received a copy of the application. Letters of no objection may be 
submitted in lieu of the return receipts.
    (2) The Regional Supervisor shall not take final action on a right-
of-way application until the Regional Supervisor is satisfied that each 
such lessee or right-of-way holder has been afforded at least 30 days 
from the date determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in which to 
submit comments.
    (d) If a proposed right-of-way crosses any lands not subject to 
disposition by mineral leasing or restricted from oil and gas 
activities, it shall be rejected by the Regional Supervisor unless the 
Federal Agency with jurisdiction over such excluded or restricted area 
gives its consent to the granting of the right-of-way. In such case, the 
applicant, upon a request filed within 30 days after receipt of the 
notification of such rejection, shall be allowed an opportunity to 
eliminate the conflict.
    (e)(1) If the application and other required information are found 
to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the right-of-
way may be granted. The Regional Supervisor may prescribe, as conditions 
to the right-of-way grant, stipulations necessary to protect human, 
marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), 
property, and mineral resources located on or adjacent to the right-of-
way.
    (2) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a change in the 
application should be made, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the

Sec. 250.1012  Requirements for construction under a right-of-way grant.

    (a) Failure to construct the associated right-of-way pipeline within 
5 years of the date of the granting of a right-of-way shall cause the 
grant to expire.
    (b)(1) A right-of-way holder shall ensure that the right-of-way 
pipeline is constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the 
right-of-way as granted.
    (2) If, after constructing the right-of-way pipeline, it is 
determined that a deviation from the proposed right-of-way as granted 
has occurred, the right-of-way holder shall--
    (i) Notify the operators of all leases and holders of all right-of-
way grants in which a deviation has occurred, and within 60 days of the 
date of the acceptance by the Regional Supervisor of the completion of 
pipeline construction report, provide the Regional Supervisor with 
evidence of such notification; and
    (ii) Relinquish any unused portion of the right-of-way.
    (3) Substantial deviation of a right-of-way pipeline as constructed 
from the proposed right-of-way as granted may be grounds for forfeiture 
of the right-of-way.
    (c) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a significant change 
in conditions has occurred subsequent to the granting of a right-of-way 
but prior to the commencement of construction of the associated 
pipeline, the Regional Supervisor may suspend or temporarily prohibit 
the commencement of construction until the right-of-way grant is 
modified to the extent necessary to address the changed conditions.

Sec. 250.1013  Assignment of a right-of-way grant.

    (a) Assignment may be made of a right-of-way grant, in whole or of 
any lineal segment thereof, subject to the approval of the Regional 
Supervisor. An application for approval of an assignment of a right-of-
way or of a lineal segment thereof, shall be filed in triplicate with 
the Regional Supervisor.
    (b) Any application for approval for an assignment, in whole or in 
part, of any right, title, or interest in a right-of-way grant shall be 
accompanied by the same showing of qualifications of the assignees as is 
required of an applicant for a right-of-way in Sec. 250.1010 of this 
subpart and shall be supported by a statement that the assignee agrees 
to comply with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the right-
of-way grant. The assignee shall satisfy the bonding requirements in 
Sec. 250.1009(b) of this part. No transfer shall be recognized unless 
and until it is first approved, in writing, by the Regional Supervisor. 
A nonrefundable filing fee of $60 must accompany the application for the 
approval of an assignment. MMS periodically will amend the filing fee 
based on its experience with the costs for administering pipeline right-
of-way assignment applications. If the costs increase by more than the 
CPI ``U,'' MMS will provide notice and opportunity for comment before 
changing the filing fee. For lesser cost increases or cost reductions 
MMS will change the fee without such procedures.

                 Subpart K--Oil and Gas Production Rates


<R05>
Sec. 250.1100  Definitions for production rates.

    Terms used in this subpart shall have meanings given below:
    Enhanced recovery operations means pressure maintenance operations, 
secondary and tertiary recovery, cycling, and similar recovery 
operations which alter the natural forces in a reservoir

[[Page 365]]

to increase the ultimate recovery of oil or gas.
    Gas reservoir means a reservoir that contains hydrocarbons 
predominantly in a gaseous (single-phase) state.
    Gas-well completion means a well completed in a gas reservoir or in 
the gas cap of an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap.
    Maximum Efficient Rate (MER) means the maximum sustainable daily oil 
or gas withdrawal rate from a reservoir which will permit economic 
development and depletion of that reservoir without detriment to 
ultimate recovery.
    Maximum Production Rate (MPR) means the approved maximum daily rate 
at which oil or gas may be produced from a specified oil-well or gas-
well completion.
    Nonsensitive reservoir means a reservoir in which ultimate recovery 
is not decreased by high reservoir production rates.
    Oil reservoir means a reservoir that contains hydrocarbons 
predominantly in a liquid (single-phase) state.
    Oil reservoir with an associated gas cap means a reservoir that 
contains hydrocarbons in both a liquid and gaseous (two-phase) state.
    Oil-well completion means a well completed in an oil reservoir or in 
the oil accumulation of an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap.
    Sensitive reservoir means a reservoir in which ultimate recovery is 
decreased by high reservoir production rates. A high reservoir 
production rate is one which exceeds the MER.
    Waste of oil and gas means: (1) The physical waste of oil and gas; 
(2) the inefficient, excessive, or improper use of, or the unnecessary 
dissipation of reservoir energy; (3) the locating, spacing, drilling, 
equipping, operating, or producing of any oil or gas well(s) in a manner 
which causes or tends to cause a reduction in the quantity of oil or gas 
ultimately recoverable from a pool under prudent and proper operations 
or which causes or tends to cause unnecessary or excessive surface loss 
or destruction of oil or gas; or (4) the inefficient storage of oil.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1101  General requirements and classification of reservoirs.

    (a) Wells and reservoirs shall be produced at rates that will 
provide economic development and depletion of the hydrocarbon resources 
in a manner that would maximize the ultimate recovery without adversely 
affecting correlative rights.
    (b) For directionally drilled wells in which the completed interval 
is closer than 500 feet from a unit or lease line or for vertically 
drilled wells in which the surface location is closer than 500 feet from 
a unit or lease line, for which the unit, lease, or royalty interests 
are not the same, the prior approval by the Regional Supervisor is 
required before production is commenced. An operator requesting such an 
approval shall furnish the Regional Supervisor with letters expressing 
acceptance or objection from operators of offset properties.
    (c) The lessee shall propose a classification for each reservoir as 
an oil reservoir, an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap or a gas 
reservoir, and as sensitive or nonsensitive.
    (d) All oil reservoirs with associated gas caps shall be initially 
classified as sensitive and shall require establishing a maximum 
efficient production rate and balancing of production in accordance with 
Sec. 250.1102(a) (1) and (5) of this part. All other oil reservoirs and 
all gas reservoirs shall be initially classified as nonsensitive.
    (e) A reservoir may be reclassified by the Minerals Management 
Service (MMS) as to type and sensitivity at any time during its 
productive life when information becomes available showing that 
reclassification is warranted.

29486, May 29, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 250.1102  Oil and gas production rates.

    (a) MER. (1) The lessee shall submit a proposed MER for each 
producing sensitive reservoir on Form MMS-127, Request for Reservoir 
Maximum Efficient Rate (MER), along with appropriate supporting 
information to the Regional Supervisor within 45 days after discovering 
that a reservoir is sensitive.
    (2) The lessee may propose to revise an MER by submitting Form MMS-
127

[[Page 366]]

with appropriate supporting information.
    (3) The effective date of an MER for a reservoir or revision thereof 
shall be the first day of the month in which Form MMS-127 is submitted.
    (4) When approved, the MER shall not be exceeded, except as provided 
in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (5) If a reservoir is produced at a rate in excess of the MER for 
any month, the lessee should initiate measures necessary to balance 
production (offset overproduction by underproduction) during the next 
succeeding month. All overproduction shall be balanced by the end of the 
next succeeding calendar quarter following the quarter in which the 
overproduction occurred. Any operation in an overproduction status in 
any reservoir for two successive calendar quarters shall be shut in from 
that reservoir until the actual production is equal to that which would 
have occurred under the approved MER, unless an alternative plan is 
approved by the Regional Supervisor.
    (6) The lessee shall review the MER for each producing sensitive 
reservoir at least once a year and submit Form MMS-127 with appropriate 
supporting information.
    (7) The lessee may request the reclassification of a reservoir from 
sensitive to nonsensitive and request approval for termination of an MER 
by submitting Form MMS-127 with information supporting the 
reclassification and termination.
    (8) At the request of the Regional Supervisor, the lessee shall 
furnish the information specified on Form MMS-127 for any producing 
nonsensitive reservoir.
    (9) Public information copies of Form MMS-127 shall be submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 250.117.
    (b) MPR. (1) The lessee shall propose an MPR for each producing well 
completion together with full information on the method used in its 
determination. The MPR shall be based on well tests and any limitations 
imposed by well and surface equipment, sand production, gas-oil and 
water-oil ratios, location of perforated intervals, and prudent 
operating practices. The sum of the MPR's of wells completed in a 
sensitive reservoir shall not exceed the approved MER.
    (2) The lessee shall conduct a well-flow potential test within 30 
days of the date of first continuous production on all new, recompleted, 
and reworked well completions. Within 15 days after the end of the test 
period, the lessee shall submit a proposed MPR with well potential test 
for the individual well completion on Form MMS-126, Well Potential Test 
Report and Request for Maximum Production Rate (MPR). The initial MPR 
shall not exceed 110 percent of the test rate submitted and shall be 
effective on the first day of the month following the end of the test 
period if approved by the Regional Supervisor. During the 30-day period 
allowed for testing, the lessee may produce a new, recompleted, or 
reworked completion at rates necessary to establish the MPR. After the 
30-day period and prior to approval of the initial MPR, a well 
completion may be produced at a rate not to exceed the proposed rate. 
The lessee shall report the total production obtained during the test 
period and shall identify all other wells completed in the reservoir on 
Form MMS-126.
    (3) At least one well test shall be conducted during a calendar half 
for producing oil-well and gas-well completions and results submitted on 
Form MMS-128, Semiannual Well Test Report. Well tests shall be submitted 
within 45 days of the day the test was conducted.
    (4) Unless otherwise ordered by the Regional Supervisor, a revised 
MPR shall automatically be approved for each well completion for each 
well test submitted equal to 110 percent of the test rate. The revised 
MPR will be effective on the first day of the month following the date 
the well test was conducted. Prior to the approval of a proposed 
increase of the MPR, a well completion may be produced at a rate not to 
exceed the proposed increased rate.
    (5) When a well test is not submitted during a calendar half for a 
producing oil-well or gas-well completion, the MPR will be automatically 
canceled effective on the first day of the appropriate following 
calendar half.
    (6) When the results of a semiannual well test for an oil-well or 
gas-well

[[Page 367]]

completion cannot be submitted within the specified time, the lessee 
shall request an extension of time for submitting those test results. 
The extension must be approved in advance by the Regional Supervisor to 
continue production under the last approved MPR.
    (7) When approved by the Regional Supervisor, an MPR shall not be 
exceeded, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this 
section.
    (8) Public Information copies of Form MMS-126 shall be submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 250.117.
    (9) Public information copies of Form MMS-128 shall be submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 250.117.
    (c) Temporary rates. Temporary production rates resulting from 
normal variations and fluctuations exceeding a well MPR or reservoir MER 
shall not be considered a violation, provided that such production in 
excess of an approved MER is balanced by production in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1103  Well production testing.

    (a) The required well testing shall be conducted for a period of not 
less than four consecutive hours. Immediately prior to the 4-hour test 
period, the well completion shall have produced under stabilized 
conditions for a period of not less than six consecutive hours. The 6-
hour pretest period shall not begin until after the recovery of a volume 
of fluid equivalent to the amount of fluids introduced into the 
formation during completion, recompletion, reworking, or treatment 
operations. Measured gas volumes shall be adjusted to the standard 
conditions of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) (15.025 psia 
in the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region) and 60  deg. F for all tests. When 
orifice meters are used, a specific gravity for the gas shall be 
obtained or estimated, and a specific gravity-correction factor shall be 
applied to the orifice coefficient. The Regional Supervisor may require 
a prolonged test or retest of a well completion if the test is 
determined to be necessary for the establishment of a well MPR or a 
reservoir MER. The Regional Supervisor may approve test periods of less 
than 4 hours and pretest stabilization periods of less than 6 hours for 
well completions provided that test reliability can be demonstrated 
under such procedures.
    (b) At the request of the Regional Supervisor, the lessee shall 
conduct a multipoint back-pressure test to determine the theoretical 
open-flow potential of a gas well. The test shall be conducted within 30 
days of the Regional Supervisor's request or within the time period 
specified by the Regional Supervisor.
    (c) An MMS representative may witness any well test of oil-well and 
gas-well completions. Upon request, a lessee shall provide advance 
notice to the Regional Supervisor of the time and date of well tests.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1104  Bottomhole pressure survey.

    (a) For each new reservoir, the lessee shall conduct a static 
bottomhole pressure survey within 3 months after the date of first 
continuous production.
    (b) For each producing reservoir with three or more producing 
completions, the lessee shall conduct annual static bottomhole pressure 
surveys in a sufficient number of key wells to establish an average 
reservoir pressure. The Regional Supervisor may require that a survey be 
performed on specific wells.
    (c) The results of all static bottomhole pressure surveys obtained 
by the lessee shall be filed with the Regional Supervisor within 60 days 
after the date of the survey.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1105  Flaring or venting gas and burning liquid hydrocarbons.

    (a) Lessees may flare or vent oil-well gas or gas-well gas without 
receiving prior approval from the Regional Supervisor only in the 
following situations:
    (1) When gas vapors are flared or vented in small volumes from 
storage vessels or other low-pressure production vessels and cannot be 
economically recovered.
    (2) During an equipment failure or to relieve system pressures. The 
lessee must comply with the following conditions:
    (i) Lessees must not flare or vent oil-well gas for more than 48 
continuous hours unless the Regional Supervisor

[[Page 368]]

approves. The Regional Supervisor may specify a limit of less than 48 
hours to prevent air quality degradation.
    (ii) Lessees must not flare or vent gas from a facility for more 
than 144 cumulative hours during any calendar month unless the Regional 
Supervisor approves.
    (iii) Lessees must not flare or vent gas-well gas beyond the time 
required to eliminate an emergency unless the Regional Supervisor 
approves.
    (3) During the unloading or cleaning of a well, drill-stem testing, 
production testing, or other well-evaluation testing. Flaring or venting 
must not exceed 48 cumulative hours per testing operation on a single 
completion. The Regional Supervisor may allow less time to prevent air 
quality degradation or more time if lessees need additional time to 
evaluate reservoir parameters.
    (b) Lessees may flare or vent oil-well gas for up to 1 year when the 
Regional Supervisor approves the request for one of the following 
reasons:
    (1) The lessee initiated an action which, when completed, will 
eliminate flaring and venting; or
    (2) The lessee submitted an evaluation supported by engineering, 
geologic, and economic data indicating that either:
    (i) The oil and gas produced from the well(s) will not economically 
support the facilities necessary to save and/or sell the gas; or
    (ii) There is not enough gas to market.
    (c) Lessees may burn produced liquid hydrocarbons only if the 
Regional Supervisor approves. To burn produced liquid hydrocarbons, the 
lessee must demonstrate that the amounts to burn would be minimal, or 
that the alternatives are infeasible or pose a significant risk that may 
harm offshore personnel or the environment. Alternatives to burning 
liquid hydrocarbons include transporting the liquids or storing and re-
injecting them into a producible zone.
    (d) Lessees must prepare records detailing gas flaring or venting 
and liquid hydrocarbon burning for each facility. The records must 
include, at a minimum:
    (1) Daily volumes of gas flared or vented and liquid hydrocarbons 
burned;
    (2) Number of hours of flaring, venting, or burning on a daily 
basis;
    (3) Reasons for flaring, venting, or burning; and
    (4) A list of the wells contributing to flaring, venting, or 
burning, along with the gas-oil ratio data.
    (e) Lessees must keep these records for at least 2 years. Lessees 
must allow Minerals Management Service representatives to inspect the 
records at the lessees' field office that is nearest the Outer 
Continental Shelf facility, or at another location agreed to by the 
Regional Supervisor. If the Regional Supervisor requests to see the 
records, lessees must provide a copy.
    (f) Requirements for flaring and venting of gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF> S--(1) Flaring of gas containing H<INF>2</INF> S. (i) The 
Regional Supervisor may, for safety or air pollution prevention 
purposes, further restrict the flaring of gas containing H<INF>2</INF> 
S. The Regional Supervisor will use information provided in the lessee's 
H<INF>2</INF> S Contingency Plan (Sec. 250.417(f)), Exploration Plan or 
Development and Production Plan, and associated documents in determining 
the need for such restrictions.
    (ii) If the Regional Supervisor determines that flaring at a 
facility or group of facilities may significantly affect the air quality 
of an onshore area, the Regional Supervisor may require the operator(s) 
to conduct an air quality modeling analysis to determine the potential 
effect of facility emissions on onshore ambient concentrations of 
SO<INF>2</INF>. The Regional Supervisor may require monitoring and 
reporting or may restrict or prohibit flaring pursuant to Secs. 250.303 
and 250.304.
    (2) Venting of gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S. You must not vent gas 
containing H<INF>2</INF> S except for minor releases during maintenance 
and repair activities that do not result in a 15-minute time weighted 
average atmospheric concentration of H<INF>2</INF> S of 20 ppm or higher 
anywhere on the platform.
    (3) Reporting flared gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S. In addition to 
the recordkeeping requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section, when required by the Regional Supervisor, the operator must 
submit to the Regional Supervisor a monthly report of flared and vented

[[Page 369]]

gas containing H<INF>2</INF> S. The report must contain the following 
information:
    (i) On a daily basis, the volume and duration of each flaring 
episode;
    (ii) H<INF>2</INF> S concentration in the flared gas; and
    (iii) Calculated amount of SO<INF>2</INF> emitted.

Sec. 250.1106  Downhole commingling.

    (a) An application to commingle hydrocarbons produced from multiple 
reservoirs within a common wellbore shall be submitted to the Regional 
Supervisor for approval and shall include all pertinent well 
information, geologic and reservoir engineering data, and a schematic 
diagram of well equipment. The application shall provide the estimated 
recoverable reserves as well as any available alternate drainage points 
which might be used to produce the reservoirs separately.
    (b) For a competitive reservoir, notice of intent to submit the 
application shall be sent by the applicant to all other lessees having 
an interest in the reservoir prior to submitting the application to the 
Regional Supervisor.
    (c) The application shall specify the well-completion number to be 
used for subsequent reporting purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1107  Enhanced oil and gas recovery operations.

    (a) The lessee shall timely initiate enhanced oil and gas recovery 
operations for all competitive and noncompetitive reservoirs where such 
operations would result in an increased ultimate recovery of oil or gas 
under sound engineering and economic principles.
    (b) A proposed plan for pressure maintenance, secondary and tertiary 
recovery, cycling, and similar recovery operations to increase the 
ultimate recovery of oil and/or gas from a reservoir shall be submitted 
to the Regional Supervisor for approval before such operations are 
initiated.
    (c) Periodic reports of the volumes of oil, gas, or other substances 
injected, produced, or reproduced shall be submitted as required by the 
Regional Supervisor.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1300  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart explains how Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases are 
unitized. If you are an OCS lessee, use the regulations in this subpart 
for both competitive reservoir and unitization situations. The purpose 
of joint development and unitization is to:
    (a) Conserve natural resources;
    (b) Prevent waste; and/or
    (c) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1301  What are the requirements for unitization?

    (a) Voluntary unitization. You and other OCS lessees may ask the 
Regional Supervisor to approve a request for voluntary unitization. The 
Regional Supervisor may approve the request for voluntary unitization if 
unitized operations:
    (1) Promote and expedite exploration and development; or
    (2) Prevent waste, conserve natural resources, or protect 
correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, of a reasonably 
delineated and productive reservoir.
    (b) Compulsory unitization. The Regional Supervisor may require you 
and other lessees to unitize operations if unitized operations are 
necessary to:
    (1) Prevent waste;
    (2) Conserve natural resources; or
    (3) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, 
of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir.
    (c) Unit area. The area that a unit includes is the minimum number 
of leases that will allow the lessees to minimize the number of 
platforms, facility installations, and wells necessary for efficient 
exploration, development, and production of mineral deposits, oil and 
gas reservoirs, or potential hydrocarbon accumulations. A unit may 
include whole leases or portions of leases.
    (d) Unit agreement. You, the other lessees, and the unit operator 
must enter into a unit agreement. The unit agreement must: allocate 
benefits to unitized leases, designate a unit operator, and specify the 
effective date of the unit agreement. The unit agreement must terminate 
when: the unit no longer produces unitized substances, and the unit 
operator no longer conducts drilling or well-workover operations 
(Sec. 250.113) under the unit agreement, unless the Regional Supervisor 
orders or approves a suspension of production under Sec. 250.110.
    (e) Unit operating agreement. The unit operator and the owners of 
working interests in the unitized leases must enter into a unit 
operating agreement. The unit operating agreement must describe how all 
the unit participants will apportion all costs and liabilities incurred 
maintaining or conducting operations. When a unit involves one or more 
net-profit-share leases, the unit operating agreement must describe how 
to attribute costs and credits to the net-profit-share lease(s), and 
this part of the agreement must be approved by the Regional Supervisor. 
Otherwise, you must provide a copy of the unit operating agreement to 
the Regional Supervisor, but the Regional Supervisor does not need to 
approve the unit operating agreement.
    (f) Extension of a lease covered by unit operations. If your unit 
agreement expires or terminates, or the unit area adjusts so that no 
part of your lease remains within the unit boundaries, your lease 
expires unless:
    (1) Its initial term has not expired;
    (2) You conduct drilling, production, or well-reworking operations 
on your lease consistent with applicable regulations; or
    (3) MMS orders or approves a suspension of production or operations 
for your lease.
    (g) Unit operations. If your lease, or any part of your lease, is 
subject to a unit agreement, the entire lease continues for the term 
provided in the lease, and as long thereafter as any portion of your 
lease remains part of

[[Page 377]]

the unit area, and as long as operations continue the unit in effect.
    (1) If you drill, produce or perform well-workover operations on a 
lease within a unit, each lease, or part of a lease, in the unit will 
remain active in accordance with the unit agreement. Following a 
discovery, if your unit ceases drilling activities for a reasonable time 
period between the delineation of one or more reservoirs and the 
initiation of actual development drilling or production operations and 
that time period would extend beyond your lease's primary term or any 
extension under Sec. 250.113, the unit operator must request and obtain 
MMS approval of a suspension of production under Sec. 250.110 in order 
to keep the unit from terminating.
    (2) When a lease in a unit agreement is beyond the primary term and 
the lease or unit is not producing, the lease will expire unless:
    (i) You conduct a continuous drilling or well reworking program 
designed to develop or restore the lease or unit production; or
    (ii) MMS orders or approves a suspension of operations under 
Sec. 250.110.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1302  What if I have a competitive reservoir on a lease?

    (a) The Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct development 
and production operations in a competitive reservoir under either a 
joint Development and Production Plan or a unitization agreement. A 
competitive reservoir has one or more producing or producible well 
completions on each of two or more leases, or portions of leases, with 
different lease operating interests. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
producible well completion is a well which is capable of production and 
which is shut in at the well head or at the surface but not necessarily 
connected to production facilities and from which the operator plans 
future production.
    (b) You may request that the Regional Supervisor make a preliminary 
determination whether a reservoir is competitive. When you receive the 
preliminary determination, you have 30 days (or longer if the Regional 
Supervisor allows additional time) to concur or to submit an objection 
with supporting evidence if you do not concur. The Regional Supervisor 
will make a final determination and notify you and the other lessees.
    (c) If you conduct drilling or production operations in a reservoir 
determined competitive by the Regional Supervisor, you and the other 
affected lessees must submit for approval a joint plan of operations. 
You must submit the joint plan within 90 days after the Regional 
Supervisor makes a final determination that the reservoir is 
competitive. The joint plan must provide for the development and/or 
production of the reservoir. You may submit supplemental plans for the 
Regional Supervisor's approval.
    (d) If you and the other affected lessees cannot reach an agreement 
on a joint Development and Production Plan within the approved period of 
time, each lessee must submit a separate plan to the Regional 
Supervisor. The Regional Supervisor will hold a hearing to resolve 
differences in the separate plans. If the differences in the separate 
plans are not resolved at the hearing and the Regional Supervisor 
determines that unitization is necessary under Sec. 250.1301(b), MMS 
will initiate unitization under Sec. 250.1304.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1303  How do I apply for voluntary unitization?

    (a) You must file a request for a voluntary unit with the Regional 
Supervisor. Your request must include:
    (1) A draft of the proposed unit agreement;
    (2) A proposed initial plan of operation;
    (3) Supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and
    (4) Other information that may be necessary to show that the 
unitization proposal meets the criteria of Sec. 250.1300.
    (b) The unit agreement must comply with the requirements of this 
part. MMS will maintain and provide a model unit agreement for you to 
follow. If MMS revises the model, MMS will publish the revised model in 
the Federal Register. If you vary your

[[Page 378]]

unit agreement from the model agreement, you must obtain the approval of 
the Regional Supervisor.
    (c) After the Regional Supervisor accepts your unitization proposal, 
you, the other lessees, and the unit operator must sign and file copies 
of the unit agreement, the unit operating agreement, and the initial 
plan of operation with the Regional Supervisor for approval.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1304  How will MMS require unitization?

    (a) If the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization of 
operations within a proposed unit area is necessary to prevent waste, 
conserve natural resources of the OCS, or protect correlative rights, 
including Federal royalty interests, the Regional Supervisor may require 
unitization.
    (b) If you ask MMS to require unitization, you must file a request 
with the Regional Supervisor. You must include a proposed unit agreement 
as described in Secs. 250.1301(d) and 250.1303(b); a proposed unit 
operating agreement; a proposed initial plan of operation; supporting 
geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and any other information 
that may be necessary to show that unitization meets the criteria of 
Sec. 250.1300. The proposed unit agreement must include a counterpart 
executed by each lessee seeking compulsory unitization. Lessees who seek 
compulsory unitization must simultaneously serve on the nonconsenting 
lessees copies of:
    (1) The request;
    (2) The proposed unit agreement with executed counterparts;
    (3) The proposed unit operating agreement; and
    (4) The proposed initial plan of operation.
    (c) If the Regional Supervisor initiates compulsory unitization, MMS 
will serve all lessees of the proposed unit area with a proposed 
unitization plan and a statement of reasons for the proposed 
unitization.
    (d) The Regional Supervisor will not require unitization until MMS 
provides all lessees of the proposed unit area written notice and an 
opportunity for a hearing. If you want MMS to hold a hearing, you must 
request it within 30 days after you receive written notice from the 
Regional Supervisor or after you are served with a request for 
compulsory unitization from another lessee.
    (e) MMS will not hold a hearing under this paragraph until at least 
30 days after MMS provides written notice of the hearing date to all 
parties owning interests that would be made subject to the unit 
agreement. The Regional Supervisor must give all lessees of the proposed 
unit area an opportunity to submit views orally and in writing and to 
question both those seeking and those opposing compulsory unitization. 
Adjudicatory procedures are not required. The Regional Supervisor will 
make a decision based upon a record of the hearing, including any 
written information made a part of the record. The Regional Supervisor 
will arrange for a court reporter to make a verbatim transcript. The 
party seeking compulsory unitization must pay for the court reporter and 
pay for and provide to the Regional Supervisor within 10 days after the 
hearing three copies of the verbatim transcript.
    (f) The Regional Supervisor will issue an order that requires or 
rejects compulsory unitization. That order must include a statement of 
reasons for the action taken and identify those parts of the record 
which form the basis of the decision. Any adversely affected party may 
appeal the final order of the Regional Supervisor under 30 CFR part 290.

    (a) The alternative training must teach methods to operate equipment 
that result in safe and clean operations.
    (b) MMS will determine, through onsite MMS reviews and unannounced 
audits during the provisional period, if the:
    (1) Training environment is conducive to learning;
    (2) Trainees interact effectively with the moderator or training 
administrator,
    (3) Trainees function as a team (for well control only); and
    (4) Tests are challenging and cover all important safety concepts 
and practical procedures to ensure safety.
    (c) MMS may also speak with the trainees to determine if the 
trainees felt the training met their needs for their job.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1514  Who may accredit training organizations to teach?

    MMS may accredit a training organization or program.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1515  How long is a training organization's accreditation valid?

    An accreditation is valid for a maximum of 4 years. A training 
organization may apply to MMS before the fourth anniversary of the 
effective accreditation date. The training organization must state the 
changes (additions and deletions) to the last approved training 
curriculum and plan.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1516  What information must a training organization submit to MMS?

    (a) Two copies of the detailed plan that includes the:

trainee for 5 years. For example, if a trainee completed a well-control 
course in 1996, the training organization may destroy the records at the 
end of the year 2001. The training organization must keep the following 
trainee record information:
    (1) Daily attendance record including complete student sign-in sheet 
and makeup time;
    (2) Written test and retest (including simulator test);
    (3) Evaluation of the trainee's simulator test or retest;
    (4) ``Kill sheets'' for simulator test or retest; and
    (5) Copy of the trainee's certificate.
    (b) Keep records of the training program for 5 years. The 5-year 
timeframe starts with the program approval date. For example, if a 
training program was accredited in 1995, at the end of the year 2000, 
the training organization may destroy the records for 1995. Keep the 
following training record information:
    (1) Complete and current training program plan and a technical 
manual;
    (2) A copy of each class roster; and
    (3) Copies of schedules and schedule changes.
    (c) Supply trainees with current copies of Government regulations on 
the training subject matter.
    (d) Provide a certificate to each trainee who successfully completes 
training.
    (e) Ensure that the subsea training option has an additional 4 hours 
of training and covers problems in well control when drilling with a 
subsea blowout preventer (BOP) stack including:
    (1) Choke line friction determinations;
    (2) Using marine risers;
    (3) Riser collapse;
    (4) Removing trapped gas from the BOP after controlling a well kick; 
and
    (5) ``U'' tube effect as gas hits the choke line.
    (f) Ensure that trainees who are absent from any part of a course 
make up the missed portion within 14 days after the end of the course 
before providing a written or simulator test to the trainee.
    (g) Ensure that classes contain 18 or fewer candidates.
    (h) Furnish a copy of the training program and plan to MMS personnel 
for their use during an onsite review.

Sec. 250.1521  If MMS tests employees at my worksite, what must I do?

    (a) You must allow MMS to test employees at your worksite.
    (b) You must identify your employees by:
    (1) Current job classification;
    (2) Name of the operator;
    (3) Name of the most recent basic or advanced course taken by your 
employees for their current job; and
    (4) Name of the training organization.
    (c) You must correct any deficiencies found by MMS. Steps for 
correcting deficiencies may include:
    (1) Isolating problems by doing more testing; and
    (2) Reassigning employees or conducting training (MMS will not 
identify the employees it tests).


<R05>
Sec. 250.1522  If MMS test trainees at a training organization's facility, what must occur?

    (a) Training organizations must allow MMS to test trainees.
    (b) The trainee must pass the MMS-conducted test or a retest in 
order for MMS to consider that the trainee completed the training.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1523  Why might MMS conduct its own tests?

    MMS needs to identify the effectiveness of a training program that 
provides for safe and clean operations.

[[Page 391]]


<R05>
Sec. 250.1524  Can a training organization lose its accreditation?

    Yes, an accredited organization can lose its accreditation. MMS may 
revoke or suspend an organization's accreditation for noncompliance with 
regulations or conditions of its accredited program, or assess civil 
penalties under subpart N of this part.

Sec. 250.1605  Drilling requirements.

    (a) Lessees of OCS sulphur leases shall conduct drilling operations 
in accordance with Secs. 250.1605 through 250.1619 of this subpart and 
with other requirements of this part, as appropriate.
    (b) Fitness of drilling unit. (1) Drilling units shall be capable of 
withstanding the oceanographic and meteorological conditions for the 
proposed season and location of operations.
    (2) Prior to commencing operation, drilling units shall be made 
available for a complete inspection by the District Supervisor.
    (3) The lessee shall provide information and data on the fitness of 
the drilling unit to perform the proposed drilling operation. The 
information shall be submitted with, or prior to, the submission of Form 
MMS-123, Application for Permit to Drill (APD), in

[[Page 393]]

accordance with Sec. 250.1617 of this subpart. After a drilling unit has 
been approved by an MMS district office, the information required in 
this paragraph need not be resubmitted unless required by the District 
Supervisor or there are changes in the equipment that affect the rated 
capacity of the unit.
    (c) Oceanographic, meteorological, and drilling unit performance 
data. Where oceanographic, meteorological, and drilling unit performance 
data are not otherwise readily available, lessees shall collect and 
report such data upon request to the District Supervisor. The type of 
information to be collected and reported will be determined by the 
District Supervisor in the interests of safety in the conduct of 
operations and the structural integrity of the drilling unit.
    (d) Foundation requirements. When the lessee fails to provide 
sufficient information pursuant to Secs. 250.203 and 250.204 of this 
part to support a determination that the seafloor is capable of 
supporting a specific bottom-founded drilling unit under the site-
specific soil and oceanographic conditions, the District Supervisor may 
require that additional surveys and soil borings be performed and the 
results submitted for review and evaluation by the District Supervisor 
before approval is granted for commencing drilling operations.
    (e) Tests, surveys, and samples. (1) Lessees shall drill and take 
cores and/or run well and mud logs through the objective interval to 
determine the presence, quality, and quantity of sulphur and other 
minerals (e.g., oil and gas) in the cap rock and the outline of the 
commercial sulphur deposit.
    (2) Inclinational surveys shall be obtained on all vertical wells at 
intervals not exceeding 1,000 feet during the normal course of drilling. 
Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be 
obtained on all directionally drilled wells at intervals not exceeding 
500 feet during the normal course of drilling and at intervals not 
exceeding 200 feet in all planned angle-change portions of the borehole.
    (3) Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be 
obtained on both vertically and directionally drilled wells at intervals 
not exceeding 500 feet prior to or upon setting a string of casing, or 
production liner, and at total depth. Composite directional surveys 
shall be prepared with the interval shown from the bottom of the 
conductor casing. In calculating all surveys, a correction from the true 
north to Universal-Transverse-Mercator-Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north 
shall be made after making the magnetic-to-true-north correction. A 
composite dipmeter directional survey or a composite measurement while-
drilling directional survey will be acceptable as fulfilling the 
applicable requirements of this paragraph.
    (4) Wells are classified as vertical if the calculated average of 
inclination readings weighted by the respective interval lengths between 
readings from surface to drilled depth does not exceed 3 degrees from 
the vertical. When the calculated average inclination readings weighted 
by the length of the respective interval between readings from the 
surface to drilled depth exceeds 3 degrees, the well is classified as 
directional.
    (5) At the request of a holder of an adjoining lease, the Regional 
Supervisor may, for the protection of correlative rights, furnish a copy 
of the directional survey to that leaseholder.
    (f) Fixed drilling platforms. Applications for installation of fixed 
drilling platforms or structures including artificial islands shall be 
submitted in accordance with the provisions of subpart I, Platforms and 
Structures, of this part. Mobile drilling units that have their jacking 
equipment removed or have been otherwise immobilized are classified as 
fixed bottom founded drilling platforms.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1606  Control of wells.

    The lessee shall take necessary precautions to keep its wells under 
control at all times. Operations shall be conducted in a safe and 
workmanlike manner. The lessee shall utilize the best available and 
safest drilling technologies and state-of-the-art methods to evaluate 
and minimize the potential for a well to flow or kick. The lessee shall 
utilize personnel who are trained and competent and shall utilize and 
maintain equipment and materials necessary to assure the safety and 
protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the 
environment.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1607  Field rules.

    When geological and engineering information in a field enables a 
District Supervisor to determine specific operating requirements, field 
rules may be established for drilling, well completion, or well workover 
on the District Supervisor's initiative or in response to a request from 
a lessee; such rules may modify the specific requirements of this 
subpart. After field rules have been established, operations in the 
field shall be conducted in accordance with such rules and other 
requirements of this subpart. Field rules may be amended or canceled for 
cause at any time upon the initiative of the District Supervisor or upon 
the request of a lessee.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1608  Well casing and cementing.

    (a) General requirements. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the 
several casing strings in order of normal installation are:
    (i) Drive or structural,
    (ii) Conductor,
    (iii) Cap rock casing,
    (iv) Bobtail cap rock casing (required when the cap rock casing does 
not penetrate into the cap rock),
    (v) Second cap rock casing (brine wells), and
    (vi) Production liner.
    (2) The lessee shall case and cement all wells with a sufficient 
number of strings of casing cemented in a manner necessary to prevent 
release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore (directly or 
indirectly) into the sea, protect freshwater aquifers from 
contamination, support unconsolidated sediments, and otherwise provide a 
means of control of the formation pressures and fluids. Cement 
composition, placement techniques, and waiting time shall be designed 
and conducted so that the cement in place behind the bottom 500 feet of 
casing or total length of annular cement fill, if less, attains a 
minimum compressive strength of 160 pounds per square inch (psi).
    (3) The lessee shall install casing designed to withstand the 
anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling 
loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations 
thereof. Safety factors in the drilling and casing program designs shall 
be of sufficient magnitude to provide well control during drilling and 
to assure safe operations for the life of the well.
    (4) In cases where cement has filled the annular space back to the 
mud line, the cement may be washed out or displaced to a depth not 
exceeding the depth of the structural casing shoe to facilitate casing 
removal upon well abandonment if the District Supervisor determines that 
subsurface protection against damage to freshwater aquifers and against 
damage caused by adverse loads, pressures, and fluid flows is not 
jeopardized.
    (5) If there are indications of inadequate cementing (such as lost 
returns, cement channeling, or mechanical failure of equipment), the 
lessee shall evaluate the adequacy of the cementing operations by 
pressure testing the casing shoe. If the test indicates inadequate 
cementing, the lessee shall initiate remedial action as approved by

[[Page 395]]

the District Supervisor. For cap rock casing, the test for adequacy of 
cementing shall be the pressure testing of the annulus between the cap 
rock and the conductor casings. The pressure shall not exceed 70 percent 
of the burst pressure of the conductor casing or 70 percent of the 
collapse pressure of the cap rock casing.
    (b) Drive or structural casing. This casing shall be set by driving, 
jetting, or drilling to a minimum depth of 100 feet below the mud line 
or such other depth, as may be required or approved by the District 
Supervisor, in order to support unconsolidated deposits and to provide 
hole stability for initial drilling operations. If this portion of the 
hole is drilled, a quantity of cement sufficient to fill the annular 
space back to the mud line shall be used.
    (c) Conductor and cap rock casing setting and cementing 
requirements. (1) Conductor and cap rock casing design and setting 
depths shall be based upon relevant engineering and geologic factors 
including the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, 
and water depths. The proposed casing setting depths may be varied, 
subject to District Supervisor approval, to permit the casing to be set 
in a competent formation or through formations determined desirable to 
be isolated from the wellbore by casing for safer drilling operations. 
However, the conductor casing shall be set immediately prior to drilling 
into formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon 
encountering such formations. Cap rock casing shall be set and cemented 
through formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon 
encountering such formations. Upon encountering unexpected formation 
pressures, the lessee shall submit a revised casing program to the 
District Supervisor for approval.
    (2) Conductor casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement 
that fills the calculated annular space back to the mud line. Cement 
fill shall be verified by the observation of cement returns. In the 
event that observation of cement returns is not feasible, additional 
quantities of cement shall be used to assure fill to the mud line.
    (3) Cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that 
fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet inside the 
conductor casing. When geologic conditions such as near surface 
fractures and faulting exist, cap rock casing shall be cemented with a 
quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to the mud 
line, unless otherwise approved by the District Supervisor. In brine 
wells, the second cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of 
cement that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet 
above the setting depth of the first cap rock casing.
    (d) Bobtail cap rock casing setting and cementing requirements. (1) 
Bobtail cap rock casing shall be set on or just in cap rock and lapped a 
minimum of 100 feet into the previous casing string.
    (2) Sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the 
top of the bobtail cap rock casing.
    (e) Production liner setting and cementing requirements. (1) 
Production liners for sulphur wells and bleedwells shall be set in cap 
rock at or above the bottom of the open hole (hole that is open in cap 
rock, below the bottom of the cap rock casing) and lapped into the 
previous casing string or to the surface. For brine wells, the liner 
shall be set in salt and lapped into the previous casing string or to 
the surface.
    (2) The production liner is not required to be cemented unless the 
cap rock contains oil or gas. If the cap rock contains oil or gas, 
sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the top of 
the production liner.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1609  Pressure testing of casing.

    (a) Prior to drilling the plug after cementing, all casing strings, 
except the drive or structural casing, shall be pressure tested. The 
conductor casing shall be tested to at least 200 psi. All casing strings 
below the conductor casing shall be tested to 500 psi or 0.22 psi/ft, 
whichever is greater. (When oil or gas is not present in the cap rock, 
the production liner need not be cemented in place; thus, it would not 
be subject to pressure testing.) If the pressure declines more than 10 
percent in 30 minutes or if there is another indication of a leak, the 
casing shall be recemented, repaired, or an additional casing string run 
and the casing tested again. The above procedures shall be repeated

[[Page 396]]

until a satisfactory test is obtained. The time, conditions of testing, 
and results of all casing pressure tests shall be recorded in the 
driller's report.
    (b) After cementing any string of casing other than structural, 
drilling shall not be resumed until there has been a timelapse of at 
least 8 hours under pressure for the conductor casing string or 12 hours 
under pressure for all other casing strings. Cement is considered under 
pressure if one or more float valves are shown to be holding the cement 
in place or when other means of holding pressure are used.

    (2) Before drilling out each string of casing or before continuing 
operations in cases where cement is not drilled out;
    (3) At least once each week, but not exceeding 7 days between 
pressure tests, alternating between control stations. If either control 
system is not functional, further drilling operations shall be suspended 
until that system becomes operable. A period of more than 7 days between 
BOP tests is allowed when there is a stuck drill pipe or there are 
pressure control operations and remedial efforts are being performed, 
provided that the pressure tests are conducted as soon as possible and 
before normal operations resume. The date, time, and reason for 
postponing pressure testing shall be entered into the driller's report. 
Pressure testing shall be performed at intervals to allow each drilling 
crew to operate the equipment. The weekly pressure test is not required 
for blind and blind-shear rams;
    (4) Bind and blind-shear rams shall be actuated at least once every 
7 days. Closing pressure on the blind and blind-shear rams greater than 
necessary to indicate proper operation of the rams is not required;
    (5) Variable bore-pipe rams shall be pressure tested against all

transmittal to the Governor of each affected coastal State and the 
coastal zone management agency of each affected coastal State that has 
an approved program under the Coastal Zone Management Act. (The Regional 
Director will make the drilling plan and environmental report available 
to appropriate Federal agencies and the public according to the 
Department of the Interior's policies and procedures).
    (4) Certification of coastal zone management program consistency and 
State concurrence. When required under an approved coastal zone 
management program of an affected State, your drilling plan must include 
a certification that the proposed activities described in the plan 
comply with enforceable policies of, and will be conducted in a manner 
consistent with such State's program. The Regional Director may not 
approve any of the activities described in the drilling plan unless the 
State concurs with the consistency certification or the Secretary of 
Commerce makes the finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of 
the Coastal Zone Management Act.
    (5) Protecting archaeological resources. If the Regional Director 
believes that an archaeological resource may exist in the area that may 
be affected by drilling, the Regional Director will notify you of the 
need to prepare an archaeological report.

[[Page 415]]

    (i) If the evidence suggests that an archaeological resource may be 
present, you must:
    (A) Locate the site of the drilling so as to not adversely affect 
the area where the archaeological resources may be, or
    (B) Establish to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that an 
archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely affected 
by drilling. This must be done by further archaeological investigation, 
conducted by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using survey equipment 
and techniques deemed necessary by the Regional Director. A report on 
the investigation must be submitted to the Regional Director for review.
    (ii) If the Regional Director determines that an archaeological 
resource is likely to be present in the area that may be affected by 
drilling, and may be adversely affected by drilling, the Regional 
Director will notify you immediately. You must take no action that may 
adversely affect the archaeological resource unless further 
investigations determine that the resource is not archaeologically 
significant.
    (iii) If you discover any archaeological resource while drilling, 
you must immediately halt drilling and report the discovery to the 
Regional Director. If investigations determine that the resource is 
significant, the Regional Director will inform you how to protect it.
    (6) Application for permit to drill (APD). Before commencing deep 
stratigraphic test drilling activities under an approved drilling plan, 
you must submit an APD (Form MMS-123) and receive approval. You must 
comply with all regulations relating to drilling operations in 30 CFR 
part 250.
    (7) Revising an approved drilling plan. Before you revise an 
approved drilling plan, you must obtain the Regional Director's 
approval.
    (8) After drilling. When you complete the test activities, you must 
permanently plug and abandon the boreholes of all deep stratigraphic 
tests in compliance with 30 CFR part 250. If the tract on which you 
conducted a deep stratigraphic test is leased to another party for 
exploration and development, and if the lessee has not disturbed the 
borehole, MMS will hold you and not the lessee responsible for problems 
associated with the test hole.
    (9) Deadline for completing a deep stratigraphic test. If your deep 
stratigraphic test well is within 50 geographic miles of a tract that 
MMS has identified for a future lease sale, as listed on the currently 
approved OCS leasing schedule, you must complete all drilling activities 
and submit the data and information to the Regional Director at least 60 
days before the first day of the month in which MMS schedules the lease 
sale. However, the Regional Director may extend your permit duration to 
allow you to complete drilling activities and submit data and 
information if the extension is in the national interest.
    (c) Group participation in test drilling. MMS encourages group 
participation for deep stratigraphic tests.
    (1) Purpose of group participation. The purpose is to minimize 
duplicative G&G activities involving drilling into the seabed of the 
OCS.
    (2) Providing opportunity for participation in a deep stratigraphic 
test. When you propose to drill a deep stratigraphic test, you must give 
all interested persons an opportunity to participate in the test 
drilling through a signed agreement on a cost-sharing basis. You may 
include a penalty for late participation of not more than 100 percent of 
the cost to each original participant in addition to the original share 
cost.
    (i) The participants must assess and distribute late participation 
penalties in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
    (ii) For a significant hydrocarbon occurrence that the Regional 
Director announces to the public, the penalty for subsequent late 
participants may be raised to not more than 300 percent of the cost of 
each original participant in addition to the original share cost.
    (3) Providing opportunity for participation in a shallow test 
drilling project. When you apply to conduct shallow test drilling 
activities, you must, if ordered by the Regional Director or required by 
the permit, give all interested persons an opportunity to participate in 
the test activity on a cost-

[[Page 416]]

sharing basis. You may include a penalty provision for late 
participation of not more than 50 percent of the cost to each original 
participant in addition to the original share cost.
    (4) Procedures for group participation in drilling activities. You 
must:
    (i) Publish a summary statement that describes the approved activity 
in a relevant trade publication;
    (ii) Forward a copy of the published statement to the Regional 
Director;
    (iii) Allow at least 30 days from the summary statement publication 
date for other persons to join as original participants;
    (iv) Compute the estimated cost by dividing the estimated total cost 
of the program by the number of original participants; and
    (v) Furnish the Regional Director with a complete list of all 
participants before starting operations, or at the end of the 
advertising period if you begin operations before the advertising period 
is over. The names of any subsequent or late participants must also be 
furnished to the Regional Director.
    (5) Changes to the original application for test drilling. If you 
propose changes to the original application and the Regional Director 
determines that the changes are significant, the Regional Director will 
require you to publish the changes for an additional 30 days to give 
other persons a chance to join as original participants.
    (d) Bonding requirements. You must submit a bond under this part 
before you may start a deep stratigraphic test.
    (1) Before MMS issues a permit authorizing the drilling of a deep 
stratigraphic test, you must either:
    (i) Furnish to MMS a bond of not less than $200,000 that guarantees 
compliance with all the terms and conditions of the permit; or
    (ii) Maintain a $1 million bond that guarantees compliance with all 
the terms and conditions of the permit you hold for the OCS area where 
you propose to drill.
    (2) You must provide additional security to MMS if the Regional 
Director determines that it is necessary for the permit or area.
    (3) The Regional Director may require you to provide a bond, in an 
amount the Regional Director prescribes, before authorizing you to drill 
a shallow test well.
    (4) Your bond must be on a form approved by the Associate Director 
for Offshore Minerals Management.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 254.1  Who must submit a spill-response plan?

    (a) If you are the owner or operator of an oil handling, storage, or 
transportation facility, and it is located seaward of the coast line, 
you must submit a spill-response plan to MMS for approval. Your spill-
response plan must demonstrate that you can respond quickly and 
effectively whenever oil is discharged from your facility. Refer to 
Sec. 254.6 for the definitions of ``oil,'' ``facility,'' and ``coast 
line'' if you have any doubts about whether to submit a plan.
    (b) You must maintain a current response plan for an abandoned 
facility until you physically remove or dismantle the facility or until 
the Regional Supervisor notifies you in writing that a plan is no longer 
required.
    (c) Owners or operators of offshore pipelines carrying essentially 
dry gas do not need to submit a plan. You must, however, submit a plan 
for a pipeline that carries:
    (1) Oil;
    (2) Condensate that has been injected into the pipeline; or
    (3) Gas and naturally occurring condensate.
    (d) If you are in doubt as to whether you must submit a plan for an 
offshore facility or pipeline, you should check with the Regional 
Supervisor.
    (e) If your facility is located landward of the coast line, but you 
believe your facility is sufficiently similar to OCS facilities that it 
should be regulated by MMS, you may contact the Regional Supervisor, 
offer to accept MMS jurisdiction over your facility, and request that 
MMS seek from the agency with jurisdiction over your facility a 
relinquishment of that jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 254.2  When must I submit a response plan?

    (a) You must submit, and MMS must approve, a response plan that 
covers each facility located seaward of the coast line before you may 
use that facility. To continue operations, you must operate the facility 
in compliance with the plan.
    (b) Despite the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, you may 
operate your facility after you submit your plan while MMS reviews it 
for approval. To operate a facility without an approved plan, you must 
certify in writing to the Regional Supervisor that you have the 
capability to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst 
case discharge or a substantial threat of such a discharge. The 
certification must show that you have ensured by contract, or other 
means approved by the Regional Supervisor, the availability of private 
personnel and equipment necessary to respond to the discharge. 
Verification from the organization(s) providing the personnel and 
equipment must accompany the certification. MMS will not allow you to 
operate a facility for more than 2 years without an approved plan.
    (c) If you have a plan that MMS already approved, you are not 
required to immediately rewrite the plan to comply with this part. You 
must, however, submit the information this regulation requires when 
submitting your first plan revision (see Sec. 254.30) after the 
effective date of this rule. The Regional Supervisor may extend this 
deadline upon request.

[[Page 429]]


<R05>
Sec. 254.3  May I cover more than one facility in my response plan?

    (a) Your response plan may be for a single lease or facility or a 
group of leases or facilities. All the leases or facilities in your plan 
must have the same owner or operator (including affiliates) and must be 
located in the same MMS Region (see definition of Regional Response Plan 
in Sec. 254.6).
    (b) Regional Response Plans must address all the elements required 
for a response plan in Subpart B, Oil Spill Response Plans for Outer 
Continental Shelf Facilities, or Subpart D, Oil Spill Response 
Requirements for Facilities Located in State Waters Seaward of the Coast 
Line, as appropriate.
    (c) When developing a Regional Response Plan, you may group leases 
or facilities subject to the approval of the Regional Supervisor for the 
purposes of:
    (1) Calculating response times;
    (2) Determining quantities of response equipment;
    (3) Conducting oil-spill trajectory analyses;
    (4) Determining worst case discharge scenarios; and
    (5) Identifying areas of special economic and environmental 
importance that may be impacted and the strategies for their protection.
    (d) The Regional Supervisor may specify how to address the elements 
of a Regional Response Plan. The Regional Supervisor also may require 
that Regional Response Plans contain additional information if necessary 
for compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 254.4  May I reference other documents in my response plan?

    You may reference information contained in other readily accessible 
documents in your response plan. Examples of documents that you may 
reference are the National Contingency Plan (NCP), Area Contingency Plan 
(ACP), MMS environmental documents, and Oil Spill Removal Organization 
(OSRO) documents that are readily accessible to the Regional Supervisor. 
You must ensure that the Regional Supervisor possesses or is provided 
with copies of all OSRO documents you reference. You should contact the 
Regional Supervisor if you want to know whether a reference is 
acceptable.


<R05>
Sec. 254.5  General response plan requirements.

    (a) The response plan must provide for response to an oil spill from 
the facility. You must immediately carry out the provisions of the plan 
whenever there is a release of oil from the facility. You must also 
carry out the training, equipment testing, and periodic drills described 
in the plan, and these measures must be sufficient to ensure the safety 
of the facility and to mitigate or prevent a discharge or a substantial 
threat of a discharge.
    (b) The plan must be consistent with the National Contingency Plan 
and the appropriate Area Contingency Plan(s).
    (c) Nothing in this part relieves you from taking all appropriate 
actions necessary to immediately abate the source of a spill and remove 
any spills of oil.
    (d) In addition to the requirements listed in this part, you must 
provide any other information the Regional Supervisor requires for 
compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 254.42  Exercises for your response personnel and equipment.

    (a) You must exercise your entire response plan at least once every 
3 years (triennial exercise). You may satisfy this requirement by 
conducting separate exercises for individual parts of the plan over the 
3-year period; you do not have to exercise your entire response plan at 
one time.
    (b) In satisfying the triennial exercise requirement, you must, at a 
minimum, conduct:
    (1) An annual spill management team tabletop exercise. The exercise 
must test the spill management team's organization, communication, and 
decisionmaking in managing a response. You must not reveal the spill 
scenario to team members before the exercise starts.
    (2) An annual deployment exercise of response equipment identified 
in your plan that is staged at onshore locations. You must deploy and 
operate each type of equipment in each triennial period. However, it is 
not necessary to deploy and operate each individual piece of equipment.
    (3) An annual notification exercise for each facility that is manned 
on a 24- hour basis. The exercise must test the ability of facility 
personnel to communicate pertinent information in a timely manner to the 
qualified individual.
    (4) A semiannual deployment exercise of any response equipment which 
the MMS Regional Supervisor requires an owner or operator to maintain at 
the facility or on dedicated vessels. You must deploy and operate each 
type of this equipment at least once each year. Each type need not be 
deployed and operated at each exercise.
    (c) During your exercises, you must simulate conditions in the area 
of operations, including seasonal weather variations, to the extent 
practicable. The exercises must cover a range of scenarios over the 3-
year exercise period, simulating responses to large continuous spills, 
spills of short duration and limited volume, and your worst case 
discharge scenario.
    (d) MMS will recognize and give credit for any documented exercise 
conducted that satisfies some part of the required triennial exercise. 
You will receive this credit whether the owner or operator, an OSRO, or 
a Government regulatory agency initiates the exercise. MMS will give you 
credit for an actual spill response if you evaluate the response and 
generate a proper record. Exercise documentation should include the 
following information:
    (1) Type of exercise;
    (2) Date and time of the exercise;
    (3) Description of the exercise;
    (4) Objectives met; and
    (5) Lessons learned.
    (e) All records of spill-response exercises must be maintained for 
the complete 3-year exercise cycle. Records should be maintained at the 
facility or at a corporate location designated in the plan. Records 
showing that OSRO's and oil spill removal cooperatives have deployed 
each type of equipment also must be maintained for the 3-year cycle.
    (f) You must inform the Regional Supervisor of the date of any 
exercise required by paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (4) of this section at 
least 30 days before the

[[Page 437]]

exercise. This will allow MMS personnel the opportunity to witness any 
exercises.
    (g) The Regional Supervisor periodically will initiate unannounced 
drills to test the spill response preparedness of owners and operators.
    (h) The Regional Supervisor may require changes in the frequency or 
location of the required exercises, equipment to be deployed and 
operated, or deployment procedures or strategies. The Regional 
Supervisor may evaluate the results of the exercises and advise the 
owner or operator of any needed changes in response equipment, 
procedures, or strategies.
    (i) Compliance with the National Preparedness for Response Exercise 
Program (PREP) Guidelines will satisfy the exercise requirements of this 
section. Copies of the PREP document may be obtained from the Regional 
Supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 254.43  Maintenance and periodic inspection of response equipment.

    (a) You must ensure that the response equipment listed in your 
response plan is inspected at least monthly and is maintained, as 
necessary, to ensure optimal performance.
    (b) You must ensure that records of the inspections and the 
maintenance activities are kept for at least 2 years and are made 
available to any authorized MMS representative upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 254.44  Calculating response equipment effective daily recovery capacities.

    (a) You are required by Sec. 254.26(d)(1) to calculate the effective 
daily recovery capacity of the response equipment identified in your 
response plan that you would use to contain and recover your worst case 
discharge. You must calculate the effective daily recovery capacity of 
the equipment by multiplying the manufacturer's rated throughput 
capacity over a 24-hour period by 20 percent. This 20 percent efficiency 
factor takes into account the limitations of the recovery operations due 
to available daylight, sea state, temperature, viscosity, and 
emulsification of the oil being recovered. You must use this calculated 
rate to determine if you have sufficient recovery capacity to respond to 
your worst case discharge scenario.
    (b) If you want to use a different efficiency factor for specific 
oil recovery devices, you must submit evidence to substantiate that 
efficiency factor. Adequate evidence includes verified performance data 
measured during actual spills or test data gathered according to the 
provisions of Sec. 254.45 (b) and (c).


<R05>
Sec. 254.45  Verifying the capabilities of your response equipment.

    (a) The Regional Supervisor may require performance testing of any 
spill-response equipment listed in your response plan to verify its 
capabilities if the equipment:
    (1) Has been modified;
    (2) Has been damaged and repaired; or
    (3) Has a claimed effective daily recovery capacity that is 
inconsistent with data otherwise available to MMS.
    (b) You must conduct any required performance testing of booms in 
accordance with MMS-approved test criteria. You may use the document 
``Test Protocol for the Evaluation of Oil-Spill Containment Booms,'' 
available from MMS, for guidance. Performance testing of skimmers also 
must be conducted in accordance with MMS approved test criteria. You may 
use the document ``Suggested Test Protocol for the Evaluation of Oil 
Spill Skimmers for the OCS,'' available from MMS, for guidance.
    (c) You are responsible for any required testing of equipment 
performance and for the accuracy of the information submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 254.46  Whom do I notify if an oil spill occurs?

    (a) You must immediately notify the National Response Center (1-800-
424-8802) if you observe:
    (1) An oil spill from your facility;
    (2) An oil spill from another offshore facility; or
    (3) An offshore spill of unknown origin.
    (b) In the event of a spill of 1 barrel or more from your facility, 
you must orally notify the Regional Supervisor without delay. You also 
must report spills from your facility of unknown size but thought to be 
1 barrel or more.

[[Page 438]]

    (1) If a spill from your facility not originally reported to the 
Regional Supervisor is subsequently found to be 1 barrel or more, you 
must then report it without delay.
    (2) You must file a written followup report for any spill from your 
facility of 1 barrel or more. The Regional Supervisor must receive this 
confirmation within 15 days after the spillage has been stopped. All 
reports must include the cause, location, volume, and remedial action 
taken. Reports of spills of more than 50 barrels must include 
information on the sea state, meteorological conditions, and the size 
and appearance of the slick. The Regional Supervisor may require 
additional information if it is determined that an analysis of the 
response is necessary.
    (c) If you observe a spill resulting from operations at another 
offshore facility, you must immediately notify the responsible party and 
the Regional Supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 254.47  Determining the volume of oil of your worst case discharge scenario.

    You must calculate the volume of oil of your worst case discharge 
scenario as follows:
    (a) For an oil production platform facility, the size of your worst 
case discharge scenario is the sum of the following:
    (1) The maximum capacity of all oil storage tanks and flow lines on 
the facility. Flow line volume may be estimated; and
    (2) The volume of oil calculated to leak from a break in any 
pipelines connected to the facility considering shutdown time, the 
effect of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces and 
other factors; and
    (3) The daily production volume from an uncontrolled blowout of the 
highest capacity well associated with the facility. In determining the 
daily discharge rate, you must consider reservoir characteristics, 
casing/production tubing sizes, and historical production and reservoir 
pressure data. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well 
flowing for 30 days as required by Sec. 254.26(d)(1).
    (b) For exploratory or development drilling operations, the size of 
your worst case discharge scenario is the daily volume possible from an 
uncontrolled blowout. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must 
consider any known reservoir characteristics. If reservoir 
characteristics are unknown, you must consider the characteristics of 
any analog reservoirs from the area and give an explanation for the 
selection of the reservoir(s) used. Your scenario must discuss how to 
respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by 
Sec. 254.26(d)(1).
    (c) For a pipeline facility, the size of your worst case discharge 
scenario is the volume possible from a pipeline break. You must 
calculate this volume as follows:
    (1) Add the pipeline system leak detection time to the shutdown 
response time.
    (2) Multiply the time calculated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
by the highest measured oil flow rate over the preceding 12-month 
period. For new pipelines, you should use the predicted oil flow rate in 
the calculation.
    (3) Add to the volume calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
the total volume of oil that would leak from the pipeline after it is 
shut in. Calculate this volume by taking into account the effects of 
hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces, length of 
pipeline segment, tie-ins with other pipelines, and other factors.
    (d) If your facility which stores, handles, transfers, processes, or 
transports oil does not fall into the categories listed in paragraph 
(a), (b), or (c) of this section, contact the Regional Supervisor for 
instructions on the calculation of the volume of your worst case 
discharge scenario.

    (1) Be consistent with the requirements of the National Contingency 
Plan and appropriate Area Contingency Plan(s).
    (2) Identify a qualified individual and require immediate 
communication between that person and appropriate Federal officials and 
response personnel if there is a spill.
    (3) Identify any private personnel and equipment necessary to 
remove, to the maximum extent practicable, a worst case discharge as 
defined in Sec. 254.47. The plan must provide proof of contractual 
services or other evidence of a contractual agreement with any OSRO's or 
spill management team members who are not employees of the owner or 
operator.
    (4) Describe the training, equipment testing, periodic unannounced 
drills, and response actions of personnel at the facility. These must 
ensure both the safety of the facility and the mitigation or prevention 
of a discharge or the substantial threat of a discharge.
    (5) Describe the procedures you will use to periodically update and 
resubmit the plan for approval of each significant change.
    (b) Your plan developed under State requirements also must include 
the following information:
    (1) A list of the facilities and leases the plan covers and a map 
showing their location;
    (2) A list of the types of oil handled, stored, or transported at 
the facility;
    (3) Name and address of the State agency to whom the plan was 
submitted;
    (4) Date you submitted the plan to the State;
    (5) If the plan received formal approval, the name of the approving 
organization, the date of approval, and a copy of the State agency's 
approval letter if one was issued; and
    (6) Identification of any regulations or standards used in preparing 
the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 254.54  Spill prevention for facilities located in State waters seaward of the coast line.

    In addition to your response plan, you must submit to the Regional 
Supervisor a description of the steps you are taking to prevent spills 
of oil or mitigate a substantial threat of such a discharge. You must 
identify all State or Federal safety or pollution prevention 
requirements that apply to the prevention of oil spills from your 
facility, and demonstrate your compliance with these requirements. You 
also should include a description of industry safety and pollution 
prevention standards your facility meets. The Regional Supervisor may 
prescribe additional equipment or procedures for spill prevention if it 
is determined that your efforts to prevent spills do not reflect good 
industry practices.

Sec. 256.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of these regulations is to establish the procedures 
under which the Secretary of the Interior will exercise the authority 
granted to administer a leasing program for minerals and grant rights-
of-way on the submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf.


<R05>
Sec. 256.2  Policy.

    The management of Outer Continental Shelf resources is to be 
conducted in accordance with the findings, purposes and policy 
directions provided by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments 
of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1332, 1801, 1802), and other Executive, legislative, 
judicial and Departmental guidance. The Secretary of the Interior shall 
consider available environmental information in making decisions 
affecting Outer Continental Shelf resources.


<R05>
Sec. 256.4  Authority.

    The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act as amended, (43 U.S.C. 1331 et 
seq.) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue, on a 
competitive basis, leases for oil and gas, and sulphur, in submerged 
lands of the Outer Continental Shelf. The act authorizes the Secretary 
of the Interior to grant rights-of-way through the submerged lands of 
the Outer Continental Shelf. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 
1975 (42 U.S.C. 6213), prohibits joint bidding by major oil and gas 
producers.

<R05>
Sec. 256.52  Bond requirements for an oil and gas or sulphur lease.

    This section establishes bond requirements for the lessee of an OCS 
oil and gas or sulphur lease.
    (a) Before MMS will issue a new lease or approve the assignment of 
an existing lease to you as lessee, you or another record title owner 
for the lease must:

[[Page 455]]

    (1) Maintain with the Regional Director a $50,000 lease bond that 
guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease; or
    (2) Maintain a $300,000 areawide bond that guarantees compliance 
with all the terms and conditions of all your oil and gas and sulphur 
leases in the area where the lease is located; or
    (3) Maintain a lease or areawide bond in the amount required in 
Sec. 256.53(a) or (b) of this part.
    (b) For the purpose of this section, there are four areas:
    (1) The Gulf of Mexico;
    (2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, 
Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii;
    (3) The area offshore the Coast of Alaska; and
    (4) The area offshore the Atlantic Coast.
    (c) The requirement to maintain a lease bond (or substitute security 
instruments) under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and Sec. 256.53 (a) 
and (b) is satisfied if your operator provides a lease bond in the 
required amount that guarantees compliance with all the terms and 
conditions of the lease. Your operator may not use an areawide bond 
under this paragraph to satisfy your bond obligation.
    (d) If a surety makes payment to the United States under a bond or 
alternate form of security maintained under this section, the surety's 
remaining liability under the bond or alternate form of security is 
reduced by the amount of that payment. See paragraph (e) of this section 
for the requirement to replace the reduced bond coverage.
    (e) If the value of your surety bond or alternate security is 
reduced because of a default, or for any other reason, you must provide 
additional bond coverage sufficient to meet the security required under 
this subpart within 6 months, or such shorter period of time as the 
Regional Director may direct.
    (f) You may pledge U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) 
securities instead of a bond. The Treasury securities you pledge must be 
negotiable for an amount of cash equal to the value of the bond they 
replace.
    (1) If you pledge Treasury securities under this paragraph (f), you 
must monitor their value. If their market value falls below the level of 
bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional 
Treasury securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the 
required amount.
    (2) If you pledge Treasury securities, you must include authority 
for the Regional Director to sell them and use the proceeds when the 
Regional Director determines that you fail to satisfy any lease 
obligation.
    (g) You may pledge alternate types of security instruments instead 
of providing a bond if the Regional Director determines that the 
alternate security protects the interests of the United States to the 
same extent as the required bond.
    (1) If you pledge an alternate type of security under this 
paragraph, you must monitor the security's value. If its market value 
falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you 
must pledge additional securities to raise the value of the securities 
pledged to the required amount.
    (2) If you pledge an alternate type of security, you must include 
authority for the Regional Director to sell the security and use the 
proceeds when the Regional Director determines that you failed to 
satisfy any lease obligation.
    (h) If you fail to replace a deficient bond or to provide additional 
bond coverage upon demand, the Regional Director may:
    (1) Assess penalties under part 250, subpart N of this chapter;
    (2) Suspend production and other operations on your leases in 
accordance with Sec. 250.10 of this chapter; and
    (3) Initiate action to cancel your lease.

    (a) This paragraph explains what bonds the lessee must provide 
before lease exploration activities commence.
    (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director a $200,000 bond that

    (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director a $500,000 bond that 
guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by

    (d) The Regional Director may determine that additional security 
(i.e., security above the amounts prescribed in Secs. 256.52(a) and 
256.53 (a) and (b) of this part) is necessary to ensure compliance with 
the obligations under your lease and the regulations in this chapter.

anticipated lease and other obligations, as evidenced by audited 
financial statements (including auditor's certificate, balance sheet,

abandon wells, remove platforms and facilities, and clear the seafloor 
of obstructions in the Regional Director's case-specific analysis.
    (f) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities either 
increase or decrease, the Regional Director may adjust the amount of 
supplemental bond required.

evidence you submit is convincing, he/she may reduce the amount of 
supplemental bond required.

Sec. 256.58  Termination of the period of liability and cancellation of a bond.

    This section defines the terms and conditions under which the 
Regional Director may terminate the period of liability of a bond or 
cancel a bond.

period of liability under its bond, the Regional Director will terminate

release the surety of that bond.
    (2) Your surety is responsible for all obligations and liabilities 
that accrue before the effective date of the Regional Director's 
termination of the period of liability under its bond.
    (b) The Regional Director's cancellation or release of a bond may

    (i) In which your new surety agrees to assume all outstanding 
liabilities under the bond that is to be canceled; and

the payment is insolvent, bankrupt, subject to reorganization, or placed 
in receivership; or

false when the bond is canceled, or released.

forfeited upon his/her estimate of the total cost of corrective action 
to bring your lease into compliance.
    (2) Advise you, your third-party guarantor, and any surety, that 
you, your guarantor, and any surety may avoid forfeiture if, within 5 
working days:

into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director 
prescribes;

    (d) If the Regional Director finds you are in default, he/she may 
cause the forfeiture of any bonds and other security deposited as your 
guarantee of compliance with the terms and conditions of your lease and 
the regulations in this chapter.
    (e) If the Regional Director determines that your bond and/or other 
security is forfeited, the Regional Director will:
    (1) Collect the forfeited amount; and
    (2) Use the funds collected to bring your leases into compliance and 
to correct any default.
    (f) If the amount the Regional Director collects under your bond and 
other security is insufficient to pay the full cost of corrective 
actions he/she may:
    (1) Take or direct action to obtain full compliance with your lease 
and the regulations in this chapter; and
    (2) Recover from you, any co-lessee, operating rights owner, and/or 
any third-party guarantor responsible under this subpart all costs in 
excess of the amount he/she collects under your forfeited bond and other 
security.
    (g) The amount that the Regional Director collects under your 
forfeited bond and other security may exceed the costs of taking the 
corrective actions required to obtain full compliance with the terms and 
conditions of your lease and the regulations in this chapter. In this 
case, the Regional Director will return the excess funds to the party 
from whom they were collected.

    (2) You provide the bond coverage required under subpart I of this 
part; and
    (3) The Regional Director approves the assignment.

cause a bid to be disqualified.
    (c) Any approved assignment shall be deemed to be effective on the 
first day of the lease month following its filing in the appropriate 
office of the MMS, unless at the request of the parties, an earlier date 
is specified in the approval.
    (d) You, as assignor, are liable for all obligations that accrue 
under your lease before the date that the Regional Director approves 
your request for assignment of the record title in the lease. The 
Regional Director's approval of the assignment does not relieve you of 
accrued lease obligations that your assignee, or a subsequent assignee, 
fails to perform.
    (e) Your assignee and each subsequent assignee are liable for all 
obligations that accrue under the lease after the date that the Regional 
Director approves the governing assignment. They must:

regulations issued under the Act; and
    (2) Remedy all existing environmental problems on the tract, 
properly abandon all wells, and reclaim the lease site in accordance 
with part 250, subpart G.
    (f) If your assignee, or a subsequent assignee, fails to perform any

Regional Director may require you to bring the lease into compliance to 
the extent that the obligation accrued before the Regional Director 
approved the assignment of your interest in the lease.

instruments that create or transfer ownership of a lease interest.
    (1) You must submit two copies of the instruments that create or 
transfer an interest. Each instrument that creates or transfers an 
interest must describe by officially designated subdivision the interest 
you propose to create or transfer.
    (2) You must submit your proposal to create or transfer an interest, 
or create or transfer separate operating rights, subleases, and record 
title interests within 90 days of the last date that a party executes 
the transfer agreement.
    (3) The transferee must meet the citizenship and other qualification 
criteria specified in Sec. 256.35 of this part. When you submit an 
instrument to create or transfer an interest as an association, you must 
include a statement signed by the transferee about the transferee's 
citizenship and qualifications to own a lease.
    (4) Your instrument to create or transfer an interest must contain 
all of the terms and conditions to which you and the other parties 
agree.
    (5) You do not gain a release of any nonmonetary obligation under 
your lease or the regulations in this chapter by creating a sublease or 
transferring operating rights.
    (6) You do not gain a release from any accrued obligation under your 
lease or the regulations in this chapter by assigning your record title 
interest in the lease.
    (7) You may create or transfer carried working interests, overriding 
royalty interests, or payments out of production without obtaining the 
Regional Director's approval. However,

[[Page 463]]

you must file instruments creating or transferring carried working 
interests, overriding royalty interests, or payments out of production 
with the Regional Director for record purposes.
    (8) A nonrefundable filing fee of $185 must accompany an application 
for approval of any instrument of transfer required to be filed. MMS 
periodically will amend the filing fee based on its experience with the 
costs for administering lease transfer applications. If the costs 
increase by more than the CPI ``U,'' MMS will provide notice and 
opportunity for comment before changing the filing fee. For lesser cost 
increases or cost reductions MMS will change the fee without such 
procedures. Any document not required to be filed by these regulations 
but submitted for record purposes shall be accompanied by a 
nonrefundable fee of $25 per lease affected. Such documents may be 
rejected at the discretion of the authorized officer.
    (b) An attorney in fact, in behalf of the holder of a lease, 
operating rights or sublease, shall furnish evidence of authority to 
execute the assignment or application for approval and the statement 
required by Sec. 256.46 of this part.
    (c) When you request approval for an assignment that assigns all 
your record title interest in a lease or that creates a segregated 
lease, your assignee must furnish a bond in the amount prescribed in 
Secs. 256.52 and 256.53 of this part.
    (d) When you request approval for an assignment that assigns less 
than all the record title of a lease and that does not create a separate 
lease, the assignee may, with the surety's consent, become a joint 
principal on the surety instrument that guarantees compliance with all 
the terms and conditions of the lease.
    (e) An heir or devisee of a deceased holder of a lease, or any 
interest therein, shall be recognized as the lawful successor to such 
lease or interest, if evidence of status as an heir or devisee is 
furnished in the form of:
    (1) A certified copy of an appropriate order or decree of the court 
having jurisdiction of the distribution of the estate or,
    (2) If no court action is necessary, the statements of two 
disinterested parties having knowledge of the facts or a certified copy 
of the will.
    (f) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this 
section, the heirs or devisees shall file statements that they are the 
persons named as successors to the estate with evidence of their 
qualifications as provided in Sec. 256.46 of this part.
    (g) In the event an heir or devisee is unable to qualify to hold the 
lease or interest, the heir or devisee shall be recognized as the lawful 
successor of the deceased and be entitled to hold the lease for a period 
of not to exceed 2 years from the date of death of the predecessor in 
interest.
    (h) Your heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns 
are bound to comply with each obligation under any lease and under the 
regulations in this chapter.
    (1) You are jointly and severally liable for the performance of each 
nonmonetary obligation under the lease and under the regulations in this 
chapter with each prior lessee and with each operating rights owner 
holding an interest at the time the obligation accrued, unless this 
chapter provides otherwise.
    (2) Sublessees and operating rights owners are jointly and severally 
liable for the performance of each nonmonetary obligation under the 
lease and under the regulations in this chapter to the extent that:
    (i) The obligation relates to the area embraced by the sublease;
    (ii) Those owners held their respective interest at the time the 
obligation accrued; and
    (iii) This chapter does not provide otherwise.
    (i) Where the proposed assignment or transfer is by a person who, at 
the time of acquisition of an interest in the lease, was on the List of 
Restricted Joint Bidders, and that assignment or transfer is of less 
than the entire interest of the assignor or transferor, to a person or 
persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders, the assignor or 
transferor shall file a copy, prior to approval of the assignment, of 
all

[[Page 464]]

agreements applicable to the acquisition of that lease or a fractional 
interest.

<R05>
Sec. 256.65  Attorney General review.

    Prior to the approval of an assignment or transfer, the Secretary 
shall consult with and give due consideration to the views of the 
Attorney General. The Secretary may act on an assignment or transfer if 
the Attorney General has not responded to the request for consultation 
within 30 days of said request.


<R05>
Sec. 256.67  Separate filings for assignments.

    A separate instrument of assignment shall be filed for each lease. 
When transfers to the same person, association or corporation, involving 
more than one lease are filed at the same time for approval, one request

shall be sufficient.


<R05>
Sec. 256.68  Effect of assignment of a particular tract.

    (a) When an assignment is made of all the record title to a portion 
of the acreage in a lease, the assigned and retained portions become 
segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such a case, the 
assignee becomes a lessee of the Government as to the segregated tract 
that is the subject of assignment, and is bound by the terms of the 
lease as though the lease had been obtained from the United States in 
the assignee's own name, and the assignment, after its approval, shall 
be the basis of a new record. Royalty, minimum royalty and rental 
provisions of the original lease shall apply separately to each 
segregated portion.
    (b) For assignments of a portion of an oil and gas lease approved 
after the effective date of ths section, each segregated lease shall 
continue in full force and effect for the primary term of the original 
lease and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced from that 
segregated portion of the leased area in paying quantities or drillng or 
well reworking operations as approved by the Secretary are conducted.
    (c) For those assignments approved prior to the effective date of 
this section, each segregated lease shall continue in full force and 
effect for the primary term of the original lease and so long thereafter 
as oil and gas may be produced from the original leased area in paying 
quantities or drilling or well reworking operations, as approved by the 
Secretary, are conducted.


<R05>
Sec. 256.70  Extension of lease by drilling or well reworking operations.

    The term of a lease shall be extended beyond the primary term so 
long as drilling or well reworking operations are approved by the 
Secretary according to the conditions set forth in 30 CFR 250.13.
[44 FR 38276, June 29, 1979, as amended at 55 FR 32908, Aug. 13, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 256.71  Directional drilling.

    In accordance with an approved exploration plan or development and 
production plan, a lease may be maintained in force by directional wells 
drilled under the leased area from surface locations on adjacent or 
adjoining land not covered by the lease. In such circumstances, drilling 
shall be considered to have commenced on the leased area when drilling 
is commenced on the adjacent or adjoining land for the purpose of 
directional drilling under the leased area through any directional well 
surfaced on adjacent or adjoining land. Production, drillling or 
reworking of any such directional well shall be considered production or 
drilling or reworking operations on the leased area for all purposes of 
the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 256.72  Compensatory payments as production.

    If an oil and gas lessee makes compensatory payments and if the 
lease is not being maintained in force by other production of oil or gas 
in paying quantities or by other approved drilling or reworking 
operations, such payments shall be considered as the equivalent of 
production in paying quantities for all purposes of the lease.

Sec. 256.73  Effect of suspensions on lease term.

    (a) If the Regional Supervisor directs the suspension of either 
operations or production, or both, under the provisions of 30 CFR 250.10 
(a), (b)(2) through (b)(7), or (c) with respect to any lease in its 
primary term, the primary term of the lease shall be extended by a 
period equivalent to the period of the suspension.
    (b) If the Regional Supervisor orders or approves the suspension of 
either operations or production, or both, under the provision for 30 CFR 
250.10 (a), (b)(2) through (b)(7), or (c) with respect to any lease 
extended beyond its primary term, the term of the lease shall not be 
deemed to expire so long as the suspension remains in effect.

    A lease or any officially designated subdivision thereof may be 
surrendered by the record title holder by filing a written 
relinquishment, in triplicate, with the appropriate OCS office of the 
MMS. No filing fee is required. A relinquishment shall take effect on 
the date it is filed subject to the continued obligation of the lessee 
and the surety to make all payments due, including any accrued rentals, 
royalties and deferred bonuses and to abandon all wells and condition or 
remove all platforms and other facilities on the land to be relinquished 
to the satisfaction of the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 256.77  Cancellation of leases.

    (a) Any nonproducing lease issued under the act may be cancelled by 
the authorized officer whenever the lessee fails to comply with any 
provision of the act or lease or applicable regulations, if such failure 
to comply continues for 30 days after mailing of notice by registered or 
certified letter to the lease owner at the owner's record post office 
address. Any such cancellation is subject to judicial review as provided 
in section 23(b) of the Act.
    (b) Producing leases issued under the Act may be cancelled by the 
Secretary whenever the lessee fails to comply with any provision of the 
Act, applicable regulations or the lease only after judicial proceedings 
as prescribed by section 5(d) of the Act.
    (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, shall 
be canceled by the authorized officer upon proof that it was obtained by 
fraud or misrepresentation, and after notice and opportunity to be heard 
has been afforded to the lessee.
    (d) Pursuant to section 5(a) of the Act, the Secretary may cancel a 
lease when:
    (1) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause 
serious harm or damage to life, property, any mineral, national security 
or defense, or to the marine, coastal or human environment;
    (2) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
    (3) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of 
continuing such lease or permit in force. Procedures and conditions 
contained in 30 CFR 250.12 shall apply as appropriate.

                       Subpart L--Section 6 Leases


<R05>
Sec. 256.79  Effect of regulations on lease.

    (a) All regulations in this part, insofar as they are applicable, 
shall supersede the provisions of any lease which is maintained under 
section 6(a) of the Act. However, the provisions of a lease relating to 
area, minerals, rentals, royalties (subject to sections 6(a) (8) and (9) 
of the Act), and term (subject to section 6(a)(10) of the Act and, as to 
sulfur, subject to section 6(b)(2) of the Act) shall continue in effect, 
and, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency, shall take 
precedence over these regulations.
    (b) A lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act shall also be 
subject to

[[Page 466]]

all operating and conservation regulations applicable to the OCS. In 
addition, the regulations relating to geophysical and geological 
exploratory operations and to pipeline rights-of-way are applicable, to 
the extent that those regulations are not contrary to or inconsistent 
with the lease provisions relating to area, the minerals, rentals, 
royalties and term. The lessee shall comply with any provision of the 
lease as validated, the subject matter of which is not covered in the 
regulations in this part.

<R05>
Sec. 256.80  Leases of other minerals.

    The existence of a lease that meets the requirements of section 6(a) 
of the Act shall not preclude the issuance of other leases of the same 
area for deposits of other minerals. However, no other lease of minerals 
shall authorize or permit the lessee thereunder unreasonably to 
interfere with or endanger operations under the existing lease. No 
sulphur leases shall be granted by the United States on any area while 
such area is included in a lease covering sulphur under section 6(b) of 
the Act.

                           Subpart M--Studies


<R05>
Sec. 256.82  Environmental studies.

    (a) The Director shall conduct a study of any area or region 
included in any lease sale in order to establish information needed for 
assessment and management of impacts on the human, marine and coastal 
environments which may be affected by OCS oil and gas activities in such 
area or region. Any study shall, to the extent practicable, be designed 
to predict environmental impacts of pollutants introduced into the 
environments and of the impacts of offshore activities on the seabed and 
affected coastal areas.
    (b) Studies shall be planned and carried out in cooperation with the 
affected States and interested parties and, to the extent possible, 
shall not duplicate studies done under other laws. Where appropriate, 
the Director shall, to the maximum extent practicable, enter into 
agreements with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 
executing the environmental studies responsibilities. By agreement, the 
Director may also utilize services, personnel or facilities of any 
Federal, State or local government agency in the conduct of such study.
    (c) Any study of an area or region required by paragraph (a) of this 
section for a lease sale shall be commenced not later than six months 
prior to holding a lease sale for that area. The Director may utilize 
information collected in any prior study. The Director may initiate 
studies for areas or regions not identified in the leasing program.
    (d) After the leasing and developing of any area or region, the 
Director shall conduct such studies as are deemed necessary to establish 
additional information and shall monitor the human, marine and coastal 
environments of such area or region in a manner designed to provide 
information which can be compared with the results of studies conducted 
prior to OCS oil and gas development. This shall be done to identify any 
significant changes in the quality and productivity of such 
environments, to establish trends in the areas studies, and to design 
experiments identifying the causes of such changes. Findings from such 
studies shall be used to recommend modifications in practices which are 
employed to mitigate the effects of OCS activities and to enhance the 
data/information base for predicting impacts which might result from a 
single lease sale or cumulative OCS activities.
    (e) Information available or collected by the studies program shall, 
to the extent practicable, be provided in a form and in a timeframe that 
can be used in the decision-making process associated with a specific 
leasing action or with longer term OCS minerals management 
responsibilities.

Sec. 260.110  Bidding systems.

    (a) A single bidding system selected from those listed in this 
paragraph shall be applied to each tract included in an OCS lease sale.
    (1) Cash bonus bid with a fixed royalty rate of not less than 12\1/
2\ per centum in amount or value of the production saved, removed or 
sold and an annual rental. (i) The royalty rate to be paid by the 
highest responsible qualified bidder shall be a percentage of the amount 
or value of the production saved, removed or sold. Such royalty rate 
shall not be less than 12\1/2\ per centum at the beginning of the lease 
period in amount or value of production and shall be specified in the 
notice of OCS lease sale published in the Federal Register.
    (ii) The amount of cash bonus to be paid is determined by the 
qualified bidder submitting the bid. Any deferment and the schedule of 
payments shall be included in the notice of OCS lease sale published in 
the Federal Register.
    (iii) The annual rental to be paid by the highest responsible 
qualified bidder and any amounts creditable against future royalties 
shall be specified in the notice of sale published in the Federal 
Register.
    (2) Royalty rate bid based on per centum in amount or value of the 
production saved, removed or sold, with a fixed cash bonus and an annual 
rental. (i) The royalty rate to be paid is determined by the qualified 
bidder submitting the bid and shall be based on a percentage of the 
amount or value of the production saved, removed, or sold.
    (ii) The cash bonus to be paid by the highest responsible qualified 
bidder shall be an amount specified in the notice of OCS lease sale 
published in the Federal Register.
    (iii) Rental payment amounts must be as specified in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Cash bonus bid with diminishing or sliding royalty rate of not 
less than 12\1/2\ per centum at the beginning of the lease period in 
amount or value of the production saved, removed, or sold, and annual 
rental. (i)(A) The royalty rate to be paid by the highest responsible 
qualified bidder shall be a percentage of the amount or value of the 
production saved, removed or sold. The royalty rate shall be calculated 
by utilizing either a sliding scale formula, which relates the royalty 
rate established thereby to the adjusted value of the oil and gas 
produced during the production period, or a schedule that establishes 
the royalty rate that will be applied to specified ranges of adjusted 
value of production. The description of the sliding scale formula or 
schedule shall include the relationship between adjusted value of 
production and royalty rate, and a stipulation of the lowest royalty 
rate and highest royalty rate. The sliding scale formula or schedule 
shall be included in the lease issued to the person who is the 
successful bidder as one of the lease terms and conditions.
    (B) The royalty rate shall not be less than 12\1/2\ per centum at 
the beginning of the lease period in amount or value of the production 
saved, removed or sold and shall be specified in the notice of OCS lease 
sale published in the Federal Register.
    (C) Royalty payment calculation. (1) The royalty rate utilized in 
the calculation of royalty payments is based on an adjusted value of 
production, and is established through application of a sliding scale 
formula or a schedule to the adjusted value of production.
    (2) The adjusted value of production shall be determined by applying 
an inflation factor to the actual value of production.
    (3) The established royalty rate is applied to the actual value of 
production, which results in the determination of amount in dollars to 
be paid to the United States by the person awarded the lease or the 
amount of royalty oil and gas to be taken in kind by the United States.
    (4) The production period, inflation factor and procedures for 
making the inflation adjustment and for determining the value or amount 
of production shall be stated in the notice of sale published in the 
Federal Register.

[[Page 470]]

qualified bidder submitting the bid. Any deferment and the schedule of 
payments shall be included in the notice of OCS lease sale published in 
the Federal Register.
    (iii) Rental payment amounts must be as specified in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (4) Cash bonus bid with a fixed share of the net profits of no less 
than 30 per centum to be derived from the production of oil and gas from 
the lease area and a fixed annual rental--(i) Net profit share payment 
calculation. The amount of the net profit share payment to the United 
States by the person awarded the lease shall be determined for each 
month by multiplying the net profit share base times the net profit 
share rate, in accordance with Sec. 220.022.
    (A) Net profit share base. (1) The net profit share base shall be 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 220.021.

for capital recovery, in accordance with Sec. 220.020, shall be 
specified in the notice of OCS lease sale published in the Federal 
Register and may vary from tract to tract.
    (B) Net profit share rate. The net profit share rate, which 
determines the fixed share of the net profits owed to the United States, 
shall be a percentage that is specified in the notice of OCS lease sale 
published in the Federal Register. Such net profit share rate shall not 
be less than 30 percent of the net profit share base and may vary from 
tract to tract.
    (ii) The amount of cash bonus to be paid is determined by the person 
submitting the bid. Any deferment and the schedule of payments shall be 
included in the notice of OCS lease sale published in the Federal 
Register.
    (iii) The annual rental to be paid by the person awarded the lease 
shall be the amount specified in the notice of OCS lease sale published 
in the Federal Register.
    (5) Cash bonus bid with a variable royalty rate or rates during one 
or more production periods in amount or value of the production saved, 
removed or sold, and an annual rental. MMS may suspend or defer the 
royalty due for a period, volume, or value of production. Such

or schedule(s) during one or more production periods in amount or value 
of the production saved, removed or sold, and an annual rental. Royalty 
may be suspended or deferred for a period, volume, or value of 
production. Such a suspension or deferral may vary based on changes in 
the prices of oil and/or gas as specified in the notice of sale 
published in the Federal Register.
    (i) The royalty due on production shall be specified as a percentage 
of the amount or value of the production saved, removed, or sold. When 
the value of production is used, by unit or in aggregate, the royalty 
rate will be determined based on prices for oil and/or gas as specified 
in the notice of sale published in the Federal Register.
    (A) The lessee must calculate the royalty due using the formula or 
schedule specified in the lease based on the adjusted amount or indexed 
value of the oil and gas produced. The formula or schedule will describe 
the relationship between the adjusted or actual amount of production, 
indexed value, or indexed price, and the royalty rate. It will stipulate 
the lowest and highest royalty rates.

centum fixed in amount or value of the production saved, removed or 
sold, and with suspension of royalties for a period, volume, or value of 
production, and an annual rental. Royalty may be suspended for a period, 
volume, or value of production. Such a suspension may vary based on 
changes in the prices of oil and/or gas as specified in the notice of 
sale published in the Federal Register.
    (i) Except for a period of suspension, the royalty rate due on 
production will be specified as a percentage of the amount or value of 
the production saved, removed, or sold. The applicable royalty rate 
shall be specified in the notice of the lease sale published in the 
Federal Register. When the royalty rate is applied to the value of 
production, by unit or in aggregate, the royalty rate will be determined 
based on the prices for oil and/or gas as specified in the notice of 
sale published in the Federal Register.
    (A) The lessee must calculate the royalty due using the formula or 
schedule specified in the lease agreement based on the adjusted amount 
or indexed value of the oil and gas produced. The formula or schedule 
will describe the relationship between adjusted or actual amount of 
production, indexed value, or indexed price, and the royalty rate. It 
will stipulate the lowest and highest royalty rates that may apply.
    (B) The formula or schedule for royalty due on production and the 
suspension magnitudes or formulas shall be specified in the notice of 
sale published in the Federal Register.
    (ii) The amount and the procedure for payment of a cash bonus must

(a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (b) The value basis for determining the actual value of production 
and for purposes of computing royalty in accordance with the bidding 
systems established by paragraph (a) of this section shall be as 
described in 30 CFR 206.102, 206.152, and 206.153; Provided, however, 
That with respect to oil, the first sale of which is controlled under 10 
CFR part 212, the value shall not exceed the lawful first sale price of 
such oil; and Provided further, That with respect to gas, the value 
shall not exceed the sale price established by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.
    (c) MMS may, by rule, add to or modify the bidding systems listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, in accordance with the procedural 
requirements of OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., as amended by Pub. L. 95-
372, 92 Stat. 629.
    (d) This paragraph explains how the royalty-suspension volumes in 
section 304 of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief 
Act, Public Law 104-58, apply to eligible leases. For purposes of this 
paragraph, any volumes of production that are not royalty bearing under 
the lease or the regulations in this chapter do not count against 
royalty-suspension volumes. Also, for

[[Page 472]]

the purposes of this paragraph, production includes volumes allocated to 
a lease under an approved unit agreement.
    (1) Your eligible lease may receive a royalty-suspension volume only 
if your lease is in a field where no current lease produced oil or gas 
(other than test production) before November 28, 1995. Paragraph (d) of 
this section applies only to eligible leases in fields that meet this 
condition.
    (2) We will assign your lease to an existing field or designate a 
new field and will notify you and other affected lessees of that 
assignment. Within 15 days of that notification, you or any of the other 
affected lessees may file a written request with the Director, MMS, for 
reconsideration accompanied by a statement of reasons. The Director will 
respond in writing either affirming or reversing the assignment 
decision. The Director's decision is final for the Department and is not 
subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR 
part 290 and 43 CFR part 4.
    (3) The Final Notice of Sale will specify the water depth for each 
eligible lease. Our determination of water depth for each lease is final 
once we issue the lease. The Notice also will specify the royalty-
suspension volume applicable to each water depth. The minimum royalty-
suspension volumes for fields are:
    (i) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) in 200 to 400 
meters of water;
    (ii) 52.5 MMBOE in 400 to 800 meters of water; and
    (iii) 87.5 MMBOE in more than 800 meters of water.
    (4) When production (other than test production) first occurs from 
any of the eligible leases in a field, we will determine what royalty-
suspension volume applies to the eligible lease(s) in that field. The 
determination is based on the royalty-suspension volumes specified in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (5) If a new field consists of eligible leases in different water 
depth categories, the royalty-suspension volume associated with the 
deepest eligible lease applies.
    (6) If your eligible lease is the only eligible lease in a field, 
you do not owe royalty on the production from your lease up to the 
applicable royalty-suspension volume.
    (7) If a field consists of more than one eligible lease, payment of 
royalties on the eligible leases' initial production is suspended until 
their cumulative production equals the field's established royalty-
suspension volume. The royalty-suspension volume for each eligible lease 
is equal to each lease's actual production (or production allocated 
under an approved unit agreement) until the field's established royalty-
suspension volume is reached.
    (8) If an eligible lease is added to a field that has an established 
royalty-suspension volume as the result of an approved application for 
royalty relief submitted under 30 CFR part 203 or as the result of one 
or more eligible leases having been assigned previously to the field, 
the field's royalty-suspension volume will not change even if the added 
lease is in deeper water. If a royalty-suspension volume has been 
granted under 30 CFR part 203 that is larger than the minimum specified 
for that water depth, the added eligible lease may share in the larger 
suspension volume. The lease may receive a royalty-suspension volume 
only to the extent of its production before the cumulative production 
from all leases in the field entitled to share in the suspension volume 
equals the field's previously established royalty-suspension volume.
    (9) If a pre-Act lease(s) receives a royalty-suspension volume under 
30 CFR part 203 for a field that already has a royalty-suspension volume 
due to eligible leases, then the eligible and pre-Act leases will share 
a single royalty-suspension volume. (Pre-Act leases are OCS leases 
issued as a result of a sale held before November 28, 1995; in a water 
depth of at least 200 meters; and in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87 
degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. See 30 CFR part 203). The field's 
royalty-suspension volume will be the larger of the volume for the 
eligible leases or the volume MMS grants in response to the pre-Act 
leases' application. The suspension volume for each lease will be its 
actual production from the field until cumulative production from all 
leases

[[Page 473]]

in the field equals the suspension volume.
    (10) A royalty-suspension volume will continue through the end of 
the month in which cumulative production from leases in a field entitled 
to share the royalty-suspension volume reaches that volume.
    (11) If we reassign a well on an eligible lease to another field, 
the past production from that well will count toward the royalty-
suspension volume, if any, specified for the field to which it is 
reassigned. The past production will not count toward the royalty 
suspension volume, if any, for the field from which it was reassigned.
    (12) You may receive a royalty-suspension volume only if your entire 
lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. A field that 
lies on both sides of this meridian will receive a royalty-suspension 
volume only for those eligible leases lying entirely west of the 
meridian.
    (13) Your lease may obtain more than one royalty-suspension volume. 
If a new field is discovered on your eligible lease that already 
benefits from the royalty-suspension volume for another field, 
production from that new field receives a separate royalty suspension.
    (14) You must measure natural gas production subject to the royalty-
suspension volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, 
measured in accordance with 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one 
barrel of oil equivalent.

may, in its discretion, consider the following purposes and policies, 
recognizing that each of the purposes and policies may not be 
specifically applicable to the selection process for a particular 
bidding system and tract or may present a conflict that will have to be 
resolved in the process of bidding system selection, and that the order 
of listing does not denote a ranking:
    (1) Providing fair return to the Federal Government;
    (2) Increasing competition;
    (3) Assuring competent and safe operations;
    (4) Avoiding undue speculation;
    (5) Avoiding unnecessary delays in exploration, development, and 
production;
    (6) Discovering and recovering oil and gas;
    (7) Developing new oil and gas resources in an efficient and timely 
manner;
    (8) Limiting administrative burdens on Government and industry; and
    (9) Providing an opportunity to experiment with various bidding 
systems to enable the identification of those that are the most 
appropriate for the satisfaction of the objectives of the United States 
in OCS lease sales.
    (b) In performing the analysis referred to in paragraph (a), MMS 
may, in its discretion, take into account the following in relation to 
their impact upon the purposes and policies enumerated in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (c) The bidding systems listed in Sec. 260.110(a) (2) and (3) shall 
be applied to not less than 20 per centum and not more than 60 per 
centum of the total area offered for leasing each year during the five-
year period commencing on September 18, 1978, unless DOI determines that 
the maximum and minimum per centum limitations set forth in this section 
are inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the OCSLA.

<R05>
Sec. 281.13  Joint State/Federal coordination.

    (a) The Secretary may invite the adjacent State Governor(s) to join 
in, or the adjacent State Governor(s) may request that the Secretary 
join in, the establishment of a State/Federal task force or some other 
joint planning or coordination arrangement when industry interest exists 
for OCS mineral leasing or geological information appears to support the 
leasing of OCS minerals in specific areas. Participation in joint State/
Federal task forces or other arrangements will afford the adjacent State 
Governor(s) opportunity for access to available data and information 
about the area; knowledge of progress made in the leasing process and of 
the results of subsequent exploration and development activities; 
facilitate the resolution of issues of mutual interest; and provide a 
mechanism for planning, coordination, consultation, and other activities 
which the Secretary and the Governor(s) may identify as contributing to 
the leasing process.
    (b) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangement are to be 
constituted pursuant to such terms and conditions (consistent with 
Federal law and these regulations) as the Secretary and the adjacent 
State Governor(s) may agree.
    (c) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements will 
provide a forum which the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) may 
use for planning, consultation, and coordination on concerns associated 
with the offering of OCS minerals other than oil, gas, or sulphur for 
lease.
    (d) With respect to the activities authorized under these 
regulations each State/Federal task force may make recommendations to 
the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) concerning:
    (1) The identification of areas in which OCS minerals might be 
offered for lease;
    (2) The potential for conflicts between the exploration and 
development of OCS mineral resources, other users and uses of the area, 
and means for resolution or mitigation of these conflicts;
    (3) The economic feasibility of developing OCS mineral resources in 
the area proposed for leasing;
    (4) Potential environmental problems and measures that might be 
taken to mitigate these problems;
    (5) Development of guidelines and procedures for safe, 
environmentally responsible exploration and development practices; and
    (6) Other issues of concern to the Secretary and adjacent State 
Governor(s).
    (e) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements might also 
be used to conduct or oversee research, studies, or reports (e.g., 
Environmental Impact Statements).


<R05>

the tracts to be considered for offering for lease. The selected tracts 
will be considered in the environmental analysis conducted for the 
proposed lease offering.


<R05>
Sec. 281.15  Tract size.

    The size of the tracts to be offered for lease shall be as 
determined by the Secretary and specified in the leasing notice. It is 
intended that tracts offered for lease be sufficiently large to include 
potentially minable OCS mineral orebodies. When the presence of any 
minable orebody is unknown and additional prospecting is needed to 
discover and delineate OCS minerals, the size of tracts specified in the 
leasing notice may be relatively large.


<R05>
Sec. 281.16  Proposed leasing notice.

    (a) Prior to offering OCS minerals in an area for lease, the 
Director shall assess the available information including 
recommendations of any joint State/Federal task force established

to be prescribed and to develop a proposed leasing notice which sets out 
the proposed primary term of the OCS mineral leases to be offered; lease 
stipulations including measures to mitigate potentially adverse impacts 
on the environment; and such rental, royalty, and other terms and 
conditions as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice.
    (b) The proposed leasing notice shall be sent to the Governor(s) of 
any adjacent State(s), and a Notice of its availability shall be 
published in the Federal Register at least 60 days prior to the

purpose of opening bids is to publicly announce and record the bids 
received, and no bids shall be accepted or rejected at that time.
    (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject any and all sealed 
bids received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.
    (3) In the event the highest bids are tie bids when using sealed 
bidding procedures, the tied bidders may be permitted to submit oral 
bids to determine the highest cash bonus bidder.
    (c)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of oral bids, oral 
bids shall be received at the place, time, and date and in accordance 
with the procedures specified in the leasing notice.
    (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject all oral bids 
received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.
    (d) When the leasing notice specifies the use of deferred cash bonus

Sec. 281.19  Lease term.

    An OCS mineral lease for OCS minerals other than sand and gravel 
shall be for a primary term of not less than 20 years as stipulated in 
the leasing notice. The primary lease term for each OCS mineral shall be 
determined based on exploration and development requirements for the OCS 
minerals being offered by the Secretary. An OCS mineral lease for sand 
and gravel shall be for a primary term of 10 years unless otherwise 
stipulated in the leasing notice. A lease will continue beyond the 
specified primary term for so long thereafter as leased OCS minerals are 
being produced in accordance with an approved mining operation or the 
lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of the lease and the 
regulations in this chapter under which a lessee can earn continuance of 
the OCS mineral lease in effect.

<R04>
                   Subpart C--Financial Considerations


<R05>
Sec. 281.26  Payments.

    (a) For sealed bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage 
of the total amount bid is required to be submitted with the bid. The 
percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in 
the leasing notice. The remittance may be made in cash or by Federal 
Reserve check, commerical check, bank draft, money order, certified 
check, or cashier's check made payable to ``Department of the Interior--
MMS.'' Payment of this portion of the bonus bid may not be made by 
Electronic Funds Transfer.
    (b) For oral bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage of 
the total amount bid must be submitted to the official designated in the 
leasing notice following the completion of the oral bidding. The 
percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in 
the leasing notice. Payment of this portion of the bonus bid shall be 
made by Electronic Fund Transfer within the timeframe specified in the 
leasing notice.
    (c) The deposit received from high bidders will be placed in a 
Treasury account pending acceptance or rejection of the bid. Other bids 
submitted under paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the 
bidders. If the high bid is subsequently rejected, an amount equal to 
that deposited with the high bid will be returned according to 
applicable regulations.
    (d) The balance of the winning bonus bid and all rentals and 
royalties must be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
this part, the Leasing Notice, and Subchapter A of this chapter.
    (e) For each lease issued pursuant to this subpart, there shall be 
one person identified who shall be solely responsible for all payments 
due and payable under the provisions of the lease. The single 
responsible person shall be designated as the payor for the lease and 
shall be so identified on the Solid Minerals Payor Information Form 
(MMS-4030) in accordance with Sec. 210.201 of this title. The designated 
person shall be responsible for all bonus, rental, and royalty payments.

[[Page 490]]

    (f) Royalty shall be computed at the rate specified in the leasing 
notice, and paid in value unless the Secretary elects to have the 
royalty delivered in kind.
    (g) For leases which provide for minimum royalty payments, each 
lessee shall pay the minimum royalty specified in the lease at the end 
of each lease year beginning with the lease year in which production 
royalty is paid (whether the full amount specified in the lease or \1/2\ 
the amount specified in the lease pursuant to Sec. 281.28(b) on this 
part) of OCS minerals produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise 
disposed of) from the leasehold.
    (h) Unless stated otherwise in the lease, product valuation will be 
in accordance with the regulations of this chapter. The value used in 
the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director. The 
value, for royalty purposes, shall be the gross proceeds received by the 
lessee for produced substances at the point the product is produced and 
placed in its first marketable condition, consistent with prevailing 
practices in the industry. In establishing the value, the Director shall 
consider, in this order: (1) The price received by the lessee; (2) 
commodity and spot market transactions; (3) any other valuation method 
proposed by the lessee and approved by the Director; and (4) value or 
cost netback. For non-arm's length transactions, the first benchmark 
will only be accepted if it is not less than the second benchmark.
    (i) All payors must submit payments and payment information forms 
and maintain auditable records in accordance with the following Royalty 
Management regulations of this title:

Section 210.200--Required recordkeeping.

Sec. 281.27  Annual rental.

    (a) The annual lease rental shall be due and payable in accordance 
with the provisions of this section. No rental shall be due or payable 
under a lease commencing with the first lease anniversary date following 
the commencement of royalty payments on leasehold production computed on 
the basis of the royalty rate specified in the lease except that annual 
rental shall be due for any year in which production from the leasehold 
is not subject to royalty pursuant to Sec. 281.28.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice and 
subsequently issued lease, no annual rental payment shall be due during 
the first 5 years in the life of a lease.
    (c) The leasee shall pay an annual rental in the amount specified in 
the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease not later than the last 
day prior to the commencement of the rental year.
    (d) A rental adjustment schedule and amount may be specified in a 
leasing notice and subsequently issued lease when a variance is 
warranted by geologic, geographic, technical, or economic conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 281.28  Royalty.

    (a) The royalty due the lessor on OCS minerals produced (i.e., sold, 
transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from a lease shall be set 
out in a separate schedule attached to and made a part of each lease and 
shall be as specified in the leasing notice. The royalty due on 
production shall be based on a percentage of the value or amount of the 
OCS mineral(s) produced, a sum assessed per unit of product, or other 
such method as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice. When 
the royalty specified is a sum assessed per unit of product, the amount 
of the royalty shall be subject to an annual adjustment based on changes 
in the appropriate price index, when specified in the leasing notice. 
When the royalty is

[[Page 491]]

specified as a percentage of the value or amount of the OCS minerals 
produced, the Secretary will notify the lessee when and where royalty is 
to be delivered in kind.
    (b) When prescribed in the leasing notice and subsequently issued 
lease, royalty due on OCS minerals produced from a leasehold will be 
reduced for up to any 5 consecutive years, as specified by the lessee 
prior to the commencement of production, during the 1st through 15th 
year in the life of the lease. No royalty shall be due in any year of 
the specified 5-year period that occurs during the 1st through 10th 
years in the life of the lease, and a royalty of one-half the amount 
specified in the lease shall be due in any year of the specified 5-year 
period that occurs in the 11th through 15th year in the life of the 
lease. The lessee shall pay the amount specified in the lease rental for 
any royalty free year. The minimum royalty specified in the lease shall 
apply during any year of reduced royalty.


<R05>
Sec. 281.29  Royalty valuation.

    The method of valuing the product from a leasehold shall be in 
accordance with regulations of this chapter and procedures prescribed in 
the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease.


<R05>
Sec. 281.30  Minimum royalty.

    Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice, each lease issued 
pursuant to the regulations in this part shall require the payment of a 
specified minimum annual royalty beginning with the year in which OCS 
minerals are produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed 
of) from the leasehold except that the annual rentals shall apply during 
any year that royalty free production is in effect pursuant to 
Sec. 281.28(b). Minimum royalty payments shall be offset by royalty paid 
on production during the lease year. Minimum royalty payments are due at 
the beginning of the lease year and payable by the end of the month 
following the end of the lease year for which they are due.


<R05>
Sec. 281.31  Overriding royalties.

    (a) Subject to the approval of the Secretary, an overriding royalty 
interest may be created by an assignment pursuant to section 8(e) of the 
Act. The Secretary may deny approval of an assignment which creates an 
overriding royalty on a lease whenever that denial is determined to be 
in the interest of conservation, necessary to prevent premature 
abandonment of a producing mine, or to make possible the mining of 
economically marginal or low-grade ore deposits. In any case, the total 
of applicable overriding royalties may not exceed 2.5 percent or one-
half the base royalty due the Federal Government, whichever is less.
    (b) No transfer or agreement may be made which creates an overriding 
royalty interest unless the owner of that interest files an agreement in 
writing that such interest is subject to the limitations provided in 
Sec. 281.30 of this part, paragraph (a) of this section, and Sec. 281.32 
of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 281.32  Waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, minimum royalty or production royalty.

    (a) The Secretary may waive, suspend, or reduce the rental, minimum 
royalty, and/or production royalty prescribed in a lease for a specified 
time period when the Secretary determines that it is in the national 
interest, it will result in the conservation of natural resources of the 
OCS, it will promote development, or the mine cannot be successfully 
operated under existing conditions.
    (b) An application for waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, 
minimum royalty, or production royalty under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be filed in duplicate with the Director. The application 
shall contain the serial number(s) of the lease(s), the name of the 
lessee(s) of record, and the operator(s) if applicable. The application 
shall either:
    (1)(i) Show the location and extent of all mining operations and a 
tabulated statement of the minerals mined and subject to royalty for 
each of the last 12 months immediately prior to filing the application:
    (ii) Contain a detailed statement of expenses and costs of operating 
the lease, the income from the sale of any lease products, and the 
amount of all overriding royalties and payments out

[[Page 492]]

of production paid to others than the United States; and
    (iii) All facts showing whether or not the mine(s) can be 
successfully operated under the royalty fixed in the lease; or
    (2) If no production has occurred from the lease, show that the 
lease cannot be successfully operated under the rental, royalty, and 
other conditions specified in the lease.
    (c) The applicant for a waiver, suspension, or reduction under this 
section shall file documentation that the lessee and the royalty holders 
agree to a reduction of all other royalties from the lease so that the 
aggregate of all other royalties does not exceed one-half the amount of 
the reduced royalties that would be paid to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 281.33  Bonds and bonding requirements.

    (a) When the leasing notice specifies that payment of a portion of 
the bonus bid can be deferred, the lessee shall be required to submit a 
surety or personal bond to guarantee payment of a deferred portion of 
the bid. Upon the payment of the full amount of the cash bonus bid, the 
lessee's bond will be released.
    (b) All bonds to guarantee payment of the deferred portion of the 
high cash bonus bid furnished by the lessee must be in a form or on a 
form approved by the Associate Director for Offshore Minerals 
Management. A single copy of the required form is to be executed by the 
principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an 
acceptable surety.
    (1) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies 
approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted. (See 
Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or 
replacement circulars.)
    (2) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to 
the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be 
accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to 
sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms 
and conditions of the lease.
    (c) Prior to the commencement of any activity on a lease(s), the 
lessee shall submit a surety or personal bond as described in 
Sec. 282.40 of this title. Prior to the approval of a Delineation, 
Testing, or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted, if 
appropriate, to cover the operations and activities described in the 
proposed plan.

anyone qualified to hold a lease.
    (b) Any approved assignment shall be deemed to be effective on the 
first day of the lease month following the date that it is submitted to 
the Director for approval unless by written request the parties request 
that the effective date be the first of the month in which the Director 
approves the assignment.
    (c) The assignor shall be liable for all obligations under the lease 
occurring prior to the effective date of an assignment.
    (d) The assignee shall be liable for all obligations under the lease 
occurring on or after the effective date of an assignment and shall 
comply with all terms and conditions of the lease and applicable 
regulations issued under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 281.41  Requirements for filing for transfers.

    (a)(1) All instruments of transfer of a lease or of an interest 
therein including subleases and assignments of record interest shall be 
filed in triplicate for approval within 90 days from the date of final 
execution. They shall include a statement over the transferee's own 
signature with respect to citizenship and qualifications similar to that 
required of a lessee and shall contain all of the terms and conditions 
agreed upon by the parties thereto.
    (2) An application for approval of any instrument required to be 
filed shall not be accepted unless accompanied by

[[Page 493]]

a nonrefundable fee of $50. Any document not required to be filed by 
these regulations but submitted for record purposes shall be accompanied 
by a nonrefundable fee of $50 per lease affected. Such documents may be 
rejected at the discretion of the authorized officer.
    (b) An attorney in fact signing on behalf of the holder of a lease 
or sublease, shall furnish evidence of authority to execute the 
assignment or application for approval and the statement required by 
Sec. 281.20 of this part.
    (c) Where an assignment creates separate leases, a bond shall be 
furnished for each of the resulting leases in the amount prescribed in 
Sec. 282.40 of this title. Where an assignment does not create separate 
leases, the assignee, if the assignment so provides and the surety 
consents, may become a joint principal on the bond with the assignor.
    (d) An heir or devisee of a deceased holder of a lease or any 
interest therein shall be recognized as the lawful successor to such 
lease or interest if evidence of status as an heir or devisee is 
furnished in the form of:
    (1) A certified copy of an appropriate order or decree of the court 
having jurisdiction over the distribution of the estate, or
    (2) If no court action is necessary, the statement of two 
disinterested persons having knowledge of the fact or a certified copy

interest.
    (g) Each obligation under any lease and under the regulations in 
this part shall inure to the heirs, executors, administrators, 
successors, or assignees of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 281.42  Effect of assignment on particular lease.

    (a) When an assignment is made of all the record title to a portion 
of the acreage in a lease, the assigned and retained portions of the 
lease area become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such 
a case, the assignee becomes a lessee of the Government as to the 
segregated tract that is the subject of the assignment and is bound by 
the terms of the lease as though the lease had been obtained from the 
United States in the assignee's own name, and the assignment, after its 
approval, shall be the basis of a new record. Royalty, minimum royalty, 
and annual rental provisions of the lease shall apply separately to each 
segregated portion.
    (b) Each lease of an OCS mineral created by the segregation of a 
lease under paragraph (a) of this section shall continue in full force 
and effect for the remainder of the primary term of the original lease 
and so long thereafter as minerals are produced from the portion of the 
lease created by segregation in accordance with operations approved by 
the Director or the lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of 
the lease or regulations for earning the continuation of the lease in 
effect.


<R05>
Sec. 281.43  Effect of suspensions on lease term.

any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued 
under the Act, and the default continues for a period of 30 days after 
mailing of notice by registered or certified letter to the lease owner 
at the owner's record post office address, the Secretary may cancel the

proceedings pursuant to section 5(d) of the Act, and the lessee shall 
not be entitled to compensation.
    (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, may be 
canceled by the Secretary upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or 
misrepresentation and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been 
afforded to the lessee.
    (d) The Secretary may cancel a lease in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Cancellation may occur at any time if the Secretary determines 
after a hearing that:
    (i) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause 
serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), 
to property, to any mineral (in areas leased or not leased), to the 
national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human 
environment;
    (ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and

such lease shall have been under suspension or temporary prohibition by 
the Secretary, with due extension of any lease term continuously for a 
period of 5 years, or for a lesser period upon request of the lessee; 
and
    (3) Cancellation shall entitle the lessee to receive such 
compensation as is shown to the Secretary as being equal to the lesser 
of:
    (i) The fair value of the canceled rights as of the date of 
cancellation, taking into account both anticipated revenues from the 
lease and anticipated costs, including costs of compliance with all 
applicable regulations and operating orders, liability for cleanup costs 
or damages, or both, and all other costs reasonably anticipated on the 
lease, or
    (ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenues from the lease 
(plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of 
reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct 
expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease 
and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to 
the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures 
from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case 
of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more 
partners to exercise due diligence, the innocent parties shall have the 
right to seek damages for such loss from the responsible party or 
parties and the right to acquire the interests of the negligent party or 
parties and be issued the lease in question.

[[Page 495]]

    (iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of 
the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:
    (A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to 
section (5)(d) of the Act;
    (B) A Testing Plan or Mining Plan is disapproved because of the 
lessee's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 
applicable Federal Law; or
    (C) The lessee(s) of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with a 
provision of the Act, the lease, or regulations issued under the Act, 
and the noncompliance continues for a period of 30 days or more after 
the mailing of a notice of noncompliance by registered or certified 
letter to the lessee(s).

<R05>
Sec. 282.10  Jurisdiction and responsibilities of Director.

    Subject to the authority of the Secretary, the following activities 
are subject to the regulations in this part and are under the 
jurisdiction of the Director: Exploration, testing, and mining 
operations together with the associated environmental protection 
measures needed to permit those activities to be conducted in an 
environmentally responsible manner; handling, measurement, and 
transportation of OCS minerals; and other operations and activities 
conducted pursuant to a lease issued under part 281 of this chapter, or 
pursuant to a right of use and easement granted under this part, by or 
on behalf of a lessee or the holder of a right of use and easement.


<R05>
Sec. 282.11  Director's authority.

    (a) In the exercise of jurisdiction under Sec. 282.10, the Director 
is authorized and directed to act upon the requests, applications, and 
notices submitted under the regulations in this part; to issue either 
written or oral orders to govern lease operations; and to require 
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and lease terms so that 
all operations conform to sound conservation practices and are conducted 
in a manner which is consistent with the following:
    (1) Make such OCS minerals available to meet the nation's needs in a 
timely manner;
    (2) Balance OCS mineral resource development with protection of the 
human, marine, and coastal environments;
    (3) Ensure the public a fair and equitable return on OCS minerals 
leased on the OCS; and
    (4) Foster and encourage private enterprise.
    (b)(1) The Director is to be provided ready access to all OCS 
mineral resource data and all environmental data acquired by the lessee 
or holder of a right of use and easement in the course

[[Page 500]]

of operations on a lease or right of use and easement and may require a 
lessee or holder to obtain additional environmental data when deemed 
necessary to assure adequate protection of the human, marine, and 
coastal environments.
    (2) The Director is to be provided an opportunity to inspect, cut, 
and remove representative portions of all samples acquired by a lessee 
in the course of operations on the lease.
    (c) In addition to the rights and privileges granted to a lessee 
under any lease issued or maintained under the Act, on request, the 
Director may grant a lessee, subject to such conditions as the Director 
may prescribe, a right of use and easement to construct and maintain 
platforms, artificial islands, and/or other installations and devices 
which are permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed and which 
are needed for the conduct of leasehold exploration, testing, 
development, production, and processing activities or other leasehold 
related operations whether on or off the lease.
    (d)(1) The Director may approve the consolidation of two or more OCS 
mineral leases or portions of two or more OCS mineral leases into a

natural resources of the OCS or the prevention of waste. A mining unit 
may also include all or portions of one or more OCS mineral leases with 
all or portions of one or more adjacent State leases for minerals in a 
common orebody. A single unit operator shall be responsible for 
submission of required Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans covering 
OCS mineral operations for an approved mining unit.
    (2) Operations such as exploration, testing, and mining activities 
conducted in accordance with an approved plan on any lease or portion of 
a lease which is subject to an approved mining unit shall be considered 
operations on each of the leases that is made subject to the approved 
mining unit.
    (3) Minimum royalty paid pursuant to a Federal lease, which is 
subject to an approved mining unit, is creditable against the production 
royalties allocated to that Federal lease during the lease year for 
which the minimum royalty is paid.
    (4) Any OCS minerals produced from State and Federal leases which 
are subject to an approved mining unit shall be accounted for separately 
unless a method of allocating production between State and Federal 
leases has been approved by the Director and the appropriate State 
official.


<R05>
Sec. 282.12  Director's responsibilities.

    (a) The Director is responsible for the regulation of activities to 
assure that all operations conducted under a lease or right of use and 
easement are conducted in a manner that protects the environment and 
promotes orderly development of OCS mineral resources. Those activities 
are to be designed to prevent serious harm or damage to, or waste of, 
any natural resource (including OCS mineral deposits and oil, gas, and 
sulphur resources in areas leased or not leased), any life (including 
fish and other aquatic life), property, or the marine, coastal, or human

assessment or other NEPA document prepared pursuant to the regulations 
implementing NEPA or within 30 days following the comment period 
provided in Sec. 282.4(b) of this part, the Director shall:
    (i) Approve any Delineation Plan which is consistent with the 
criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Require the lessee to modify any Delineation Plan that is 
inconsistent with the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or
    (iii) Disapprove a Delineation Plan when it is determined that an 
activity proposed in the plan would probably cause serious harm or 
damage to life

[[Page 501]]

(including fish and other aquatic life); to property; to natural 
resources of the OCS including mineral deposits (in areas leased or not 
leased); or to the marine, coastal, or human environment, and the 
proposed activity cannot be modified to avoid the conditions.
    (3) The Director shall notify the lessee in writing of the reasons 
for disapproving a Delineation Plan or for requiring modification of a 
plan and the conditions that must be met for plan approval.
    (c)(1) In the evaluation of a Testing Plan, the Director shall 
consider whether the plan is consistent with:
    (i) The provisions of the lease;
    (ii) The provisions of the Act;

in Sec. 282.4(c) of this part, the Director shall:
    (i) Approve any Testing Plan which is consistent with the criteria 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Require the lessee to modify any Testing Plan which is 
inconsistent with the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or
    (iii) Disapprove any Testing Plan when the Director determines the 
existence of exceptional geological conditions in the lease area, 
exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or 
other exceptional circumstances and that (A) implementation of the 
activities described in the plan would probably cause serious harm and 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to 
any mineral deposit (in areas leased or not leased), to the national 
security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environments; 
(B) that the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and (C) the 
advantages of disapproving the Testing Plan outweigh the advantages of 
development and production of the OCS mineral resources.
    (3) The Director shall notify the lessee in writing of the reason(s)

exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or 
other exceptional circumstances, and that--
    (A) Implementation of the activities described in the plan would 
probably cause serious harm and damage to life (including fish and other 
aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposit (in areas leased or 
not leased), to the national security or defense, or to the marine, 
coastal, or human environments;
    (B) That the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease 
to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and

[[Page 502]]

    (C) The advantages of disapproving the Mining Plan outweigh the 
advantages of development and production of the OCS mineral resources.
    (3) The Director shall notify the lessee in writing of the reason(s) 
for disapproving a Mining Plan or for requiring modification of a Mining 
Plan and the conditions that must be met for approval of the plan.
    (e) The Director shall assure that a scheduled onsite compliance 
inspection of each facility which is subject to regulations in this part 
is conducted at least once a year. The inspection shall be to determine 
that the lessee is in compliance with the requirements of the law; 
provisions of the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining 
Plan; and the regulations in this part. Additional unscheduled onsite 
inspections shall be conducted without advance notice to the lessee to 
assure compliance with the provisions of applicable law; the lease; the

pursuant to the provisions of this part; issue orders to govern lease 
operations; and require compliance with applicable provisions of the 
law, the regulations, the lease, and the approved Delineation, Testing, 
or Mining Plans. The Director may give oral orders or approvals whenever 
prior approval is required before the commencement of an operation or 
activity. Oral orders or approvals given in response to a written 
request shall be confirmed in writing within 3 working days after 
issuance of the order or granting of the oral approval.
    (2) The Director shall, after completion of the technical and 
environmental evaluations, approve, disapprove, or require modification, 
as appropriate, of the design plan, fabrication plan, and installation 
plan for platforms, artificial islands, and other installations and 
devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed. The approval, 
disapproval, or requirement to modify such plans may take the form of a 
condition of granting a right of use and easement under paragraph (a) of 
this section or as authorized under any lease issued or maintained under 
the Act.
    (g) The Director shall establish practices and procedures to govern

life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, or the marine, 
coastal, or human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 282.13  Suspension of production or other operations.

    (a) The Director may direct the suspension or temporary prohibition 
of production or any other operation or activity on all or any part of a 
lease when it has been determined that such suspension or temporary 
prohibition is in the national interest to:
    (1) Facilitate proper development of a lease including a reasonable 
time to develop a mine and construct necessary support facilities, or
    (2) Allow for the construction or negotiation for use of 
transportation facilities.
    (b) The Director may also direct or, at the request of the lessee, 
approve a suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other 
operation or activity, if:
    (1) The lessee failed to comply with a provision of applicable law, 
regulation, order, or the lease;
    (2) There is a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any 
mineral deposit, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
    (3) The suspension or temporary prohibition is in the interest of 
national security or defense;
    (4) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary for the 
initiation

[[Page 503]]

and conduct of an environmental evaluation to define mitigation measures 
to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.
    (5) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to 
facilitate the installation of equipment necessary for safety of 
operations and protection of the environment;
    (6) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to allow 
for undue delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits 
or consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or appeals;
    (7) The Director determines that continued operations would result 
in premature abandonment of a producing mine, resulting in the loss of 
otherwise recoverable OCS minerals;
    (8) The Director determines that the lessee cannot successfully 
operate a producing mine due to market conditions that are either 
temporary in nature or require temporary shutdown and reinvestment in 
order for the lessee to adapt to the conditions; or
    (9) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to comply 
with judicial decrees prohibiting production or any other operation or 
activity, or the permitting of those activities, effective the date set 
by the court for that prohibition.
    (c) When the Director orders or approves a suspension or a temporary 
prohibition of operation or activity including production on all of a 
lease pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the term of the 
lease shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time 
that the suspension or temporary prohibition is in effect, except that 
no lease shall be so extended when the suspension or temporary 
prohibition is the result of the lessee's gross negligence or willful 
violation of a provision of the lease or governing regulations.
    (d) The Director may, at any time within the period prescribed for a 
suspension or temporary prohibition issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, require the lessee to submit a Delineation, Testing, or 
Mining Plan for approval in accordance with the requirements for the 
approval of such plans in this part.
    (e)(1) When the Director orders or issues a suspension or a 
temporary prohibition pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
Director may require the lessee to conduct site-specific studies to 
identify and evaluate the cause(s) of the hazard(s) generating the 
suspension or temporary prohibition, the potential for damage from the 
hazard(s), and the measures available for mitigating the hazard(s). The 
nature, scope, and content of any study shall be subject to approval by 
the Director. The lessee shall furnish copies and all results of any 
such study to the Director. The cost of the study shall be borne by the 
lessee unless the Director arranges for the cost of the study to be 
borne by a party other than the lessee. The Director shall make results 
of any such study available to interested parties and to the public as 
soon as practicable after the completion of the study and submission of 
the results thereof.
    (2) When the Director determines that measures are necessary, on the 
basis of the results of the studies conducted in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and other information available to and 
identified by the Director, the lessee shall be required to take 
appropriate measures to mitigate, avoid, or minimize the damage or 
potential damage on which the suspension or temporary prohibition is 
based. When deemed appropriate by the Director, the lessee shall submit 
a revised Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan to incorporate the 
mitigation measures required by the Director. In choosing between 
alternative mitigation measures, the Director shall balance the cost of 
the required measures against the reduction or potential reduction in 
damage or threat of damage or harm to life (including fish and other 
aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or 
not leased), to the national security or defense, or to the marine, 
coastal, or human environment.
    (f)(1) If under the provisions of paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) 
of this section, the Director, with respect to any lease, directs the 
suspension of production or other operations on the entire

[[Page 504]]

leasehold, no payment of rental or minimum royalty shall be due for or 
during the period of the directed suspension and the time for the lessee 
specify royalty free period of a period of reduced royalty pursuant to 
Sec. 281.28(b) of this subchapter will be extended for the period of 
directed suspension. If under the provisions of paragraphs (b) (2), (3), 
and (4) of this section the Director, with respect to a lease on which 
there has been no production, directs the suspension of operations on 
the entire leasehold, no payment of rental shall be due during the 
period of the directed suspension.
    (2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director grants the 
request of a lessee for a suspension of production or other operations, 
the lessee's obligations to pay rental, minimum royalty, or royalty 
shall continue to apply during the period of the approved suspension, 
unless the Director's approval of the lessee's request for suspension 
authorizes the payment of a lesser amount during the period of approved 
suspension. If under the provision of this section, the Director grants 
a lessee's request for a suspension of production or other operations 
for a lease which includes provisions for a time period which the lessee 
may specify during which production from the leasehold would be royalty 
free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation pursuant to 
Sec. 281.28(b) of this subchapter, the time during which production from 
a leasehold may be royalty free or subject to a reduced royalty 
obligation shall not be extended unless the Director's approval of the 
suspension specifies otherwise.
    (3) If the lease anniversary date falls within a period of 
suspension for which no rental or minimum royalty payments are required 
under paragraph (a) of this section, the prorated rentals or minimum 
royalties are due and payable as of the date the suspension period 
terminates. These amounts shall be computed and notice thereof given the 
lessee. The lessee shall pay the amount due within 30 days after receipt 
of such notice. The anniversary date of a lease shall not change by 
reason of any period of lease suspension or rental or royalty relief 
resulting therefrom.


<R05>
Sec. 282.14  Noncompliance, remedies, and penalties.

    (a)(1) If the Director determines that a lessee has failed to comply 
with applicable provisions of law; the regulations in this part; other 
applicable regulations; the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or 
Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and the Director 
determines that such noncompliance poses a threat of immediate, serious, 
or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine or the deposit being 
mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other resources, the 
Director shall order the lessee to take immediate and appropriate 
remedial action to alleviate the threat. Any oral orders shall be 
followed up by service of a notice of noncompliance upon the lessee by 
delivery in person to the lessee or agent, or by certified or registered 
mail addressed to the lessee at the last known address.
    (2) If the Director determines that the lessee has failed to comply 
with applicable provisions of law; the regulations in this part; other 
applicable regulations; the lease; the requirements of an approved 
Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or 
instructions, and such noncompliance does not pose a threat of 
immediate, serious, or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine 
or the deposit being mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other 
resources, the Director shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the 
lessee by delivery in person to the lessee or agent or by certified or 
registered mail addressed to the lessee at the last known address.
    (b) A notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect(s) the 
lessee has failed to comply with the provisions of applicable law; 
regulations; the lease; the requirements of an approved Delineation, 
Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and 
shall specify the action(s) which must be taken to correct the 
noncompliance and the time limits within which such action must be 
taken.
    (c) Failure of a lessee to take the actions specified in the notice 
of noncompliance within the time limit specified shall be grounds for a 
suspension

[[Page 505]]

of operations and other appropriate actions, including but not limited 
to the assessment of a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day for each 
violation that is not corrected within the time period specified (43 
U.S.C. 1350(b)).
    (d) Whenever the Director determines that a violation of or failure 
to comply with any provision of the Act; or any provision of a lease, 
license, or permit issued pursuant to the Act; or any provision of any 
regulation promulgated under the Act probably occurred and that such 
apparent violation continued beyond notice of the violation and the 
expiration of the reasonable time period allowed for corrective action, 
the Director shall follow the procedures concerning remedies and 
penalties in subpart N, Remedies and Penalties, of part 250 of this 
title to determine and assess an appropriate penalty.
    (e) The remedies and penalties prescribed in this section shall be 
concurrent and cumulative, and the exercise of one shall not preclude 
the exercise of the other. Further, the remedies and penalties 
prescribed in this section shall be in addition to any other remedies 
and penalties afforded by any other law or regulation (43 U.S.C. 
1350(e)).


<R05>
Sec. 282.15  Cancellation of leases.

    (a) Whenever the owner of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with 
any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued 
under the Act, and the default continues for a period of 30 days after 
mailing of notice by registered or certified letter to the lease owner 
at the owner's record post office address, the Secretary may cancel the 
lease pursuant to section 5(c) of the Act, and the lessee shall not be 
entitled to compensation. Any such cancellation is subject to judicial 
review as provided by section 23(b) of the Act.
    (b) Whenever the owner of any producing lease fails to comply with

incorporate the results of recent research or improved monitoring 
techniques.
    (5) When prototype test mining is proposed, the lessee shall include 
a monitoring strategy for assessing the impacts of the testing 
activities and for developing a strategy for monitoring commercial-scale 
recovery and mitigating the impacts of commercial-scale recovery more 
effectively. At a minimum, the proposed monitoring activities shall 
address specific concerns expressed in the lease-sale environmental 
analysis.
    (6) When required, the monitoring plan shall specify:
    (i) The sampling techniques and procedures to be used to acquire the 
needed data and information;
    (ii) The format to be used in analysis and presentation of the data 
and information;
    (iii) The equipment, techniques, and procedures to be used in 
carrying out the monitoring program; and

Sec. 282.30  Right of use and easement.

    (a) A right of use and easement that includes any area subject to a 
lease issued or maintained under the Act shall be granted only after the 
lessee has been notified by the requestor and afforded the opportunity 
to comment on the request. A holder of a right under a right of use and 
easement shall exercise that right in accordance with the requirements 
of the regulations in this part. A right of use and easement shall be 
exercised only in a manner which does not interfere unreasonably with 
operations of any lessee on its lease.
    (b) Once a right of use and easement has been exercised, the right 
shall continue, beyond the termination of any lease on which it may be 
situated, as long as it is demonstrated to the Director that the right 
of use and easement is being exercised by the holder of the right and 
that the right of use and easement continues to serve the purpose 
specified in the grant. If the right of use and easement extends beyond 
the termination of any lease on which the right may be situated or if it 
is situated on an unleased portion of the OCS, the rights of all 
subsequent lessees shall be subject to such right. Upon termination of a 
right of use and easement, the holder of the right shall abandon the 
premises in the same manner that a lessee abandons activities on a lease 
to the satisfaction of the Director.

shall submit a surety or personal bond to cover the lessee's royalty and 
other obligations under the lease as specified in this section.
    (b) All bonds furnished by a lessee or operator must be in a form 
approved by the Associate Director for Offshore Minerals Management. A 
single copy of the required form is to be executed by the principal or, 
in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable 
surety.
    (c) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies 
approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted. (See 
Department of Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or 
replacement circulars.)
    (d) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to 
the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be 
accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to 
sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms 
and conditions of the lease.
    (e) A bond in the minimum amount of $50,000 to cover the lessee's 
obligations under the lease shall be submitted prior to the commencement 
of any activity on a leasehold. A $50,000 bond shall not be required on 
a lease if the lessee already maintains or furnishes a $300,000 bond 
conditioned on compliance with the terms of leases for OCS minerals 
other than oil, gas, and sulphur held by the lessee on the OCS for the 
area in which the lease is located. A bond submitted pursuant to 
Sec. 256.58(a) of this chapter may be amended to include the 
aforementioned condition for compliance. Prior to approval of a 
Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted,

    (g) A separate bond shall be required for each area. An operator's 
bond may be submitted for a specific lease(s) in the same amount as the 
lessee's bond(s) applicable to the lease(s) involved.
    (h) Where, upon a default, the surety makes a payment to the United 
States of an obligation incurred under a lease, the face amount of the 
surety bond and the surety's liability thereunder shall be reduced by 
the amount of such payment.
    (i) After default, the principal shall, within 6 months after notice 
or within such shorter period as may be fixed by the Director, either 
post a new bond or increase the existing bond to the amount previously 
held. In lieu thereof, the principal may, within that time, file 
separate or substitute bonds for each lease. Failure to meet these 
requirements may result in a suspension of operations including 
production on leases covered by such bonds.
    (j) The Director shall not consent to termination of the period of 
liability of any bond unless an acceptable alternative bond has been 
filed or until all the terms and conditions of the lease covered by the 
bond have been met.

    2.1  This contract shall be effective on the date heretofore stated 
and shall remain effective for a period of three (3) years thereafter 
unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided in section 6.2 or for 
default.

           Article III--Bureau Helium Distribution Contractor

    3.1  The Bureau Helium Distribution Contractor (hereafter styled 
Contractor) shall deliver only Bureau of Mines helium to supply: (1) 
major helium requirements of a Federal agency without regard as to 
whether or not Bureau of Mines helium is specified by the agency, (2) 
any quantity of helium to a Federal agency if procurement documents 
specify in any manner that Bureau of Mines helium be furnished, (3) any 
quantity of helium to private helium purchasers if procurement documents 
specify in any manner the intent that Bureau of Mines helium be 
furnished, (4) any quantity of helium to another Bureau helium 
distribution contractor if certification as Bureau of Mines helium is 
required or furnished.
    3.2  Helium delivered for Federal use under the terms of this 
contract shall conform to the quality, quantity, and delivery 
requirements agreed to between the Contractor and the purchasing Federal 
Agency or private helium purchaser.
    3.3  Each delivery of helium that requires Bureau of Mines helium in 
accordance with Sec. 3.1 of this contract shall be made only from an 
inventory of Bureau of Mines helium on hand except as provided in Sec. 
3.4 of this contract.
    3.4  Helium is a fungible commodity; therefore, the Contractor may 
commingle Bureau of Mines helium with helium from other sources. For 
purposes of Bureau helium accounting records, as much of the 
Contractor's helium inventory will be considered Bureau of Mines helium 
as is equal to the volume of: (1) helium purchased from the Bureau of 
Mines and delivered to the Contractor, plus (2) helium delivered to the 
Contractor by another Bureau helium distribution contractor and 
certified as Bureau of Mines helium in accordance with Sec. 3.11 of this 
contract, less (3) helium deliveries in accordance with Sec. 3.1 of this 
contract. The Contractor may, except as restricted by Sec. 3.6 of this 
contract, sell as Bureau of Mines helium volumes of helium from its 
inventory even though its inventory does not contain, at the time of 
sale, sufficient helium purchased from the Bureau of Mines or helium 
received from and certified as Bureau of Mines helium by another Bureau 
helium distribution contractor to meet the Bureau of Mines helium 
requirements of the purchaser; however, the Contractor shall report such 
sales as sales of Bureau of Mines helium and shall, within thirty (30) 
calendar days following the end of a reporting period or discovery of a 
negative inventory of Bureau of Mines helium, whichever is sooner, place 
a firm procurement order with the Bureau of Mines or another Bureau 
helium distribution contractor for sufficient Bureau of Mines helium to 
restore its Bureau of Mines helium inventory to a positive value. 
Failure to order sufficient helium within the thirty (30) day period 
shall be sufficient grounds to terminate this contract for cause, 
according to Sec. 3.7.
    3.5  The Contractor's opening inventory of Bureau of Mines helium on 
its initial report to the Bureau shall be any Bureau of Mines helium 
received and not delivered in accordance with the provisions of this 
contract within the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the 
effective date of this contract, except that, in the event that the 
Contractor was an Eligible Private Helium Distributor at the time of 
entering into this

[[Page 546]]

contract, opening inventories under this contract will be determined by 
the Bureau of Mines based on the Eligible Distributor's reports for the 
previous reporting periods and examination of Eligible Distributor's 
helium accounting records by a Bureau representative.
    3.6  The inventory balance of Bureau helium at the end of an annual 
reporting period may be carried forward as the opening inventory for the 
subsequent period, provided, however, that at no time shall the 
inventory of Bureau helium exceed the total volume of helium in physical 
inventory.
    3.7  At the end of each annual reporting period, the Contractor 
shall have a positive or zero balance of Bureau of Mines helium in its 
inventory. Negative closing balances of Bureau of Mines helium at the 
end of the annual reporting period, whether reported by the Contractor 
on its ``Bureau of Mines Helium'' (Addendum C), or revealed through 
Bureau of Mines examination of the Contractor's Bureau helium accounting 
records, if not changed to a positive value within thirty (30) days 
according to Sec. 3.4, shall be sufficient cause for termination of this 
contract.
    3.8  The Contractor shall not add or delete shipping points 
designated in the original application (Addendum A) except through 
amendment of this contract. The Contracting Officer, upon receipt of a 
written request from the Contractor to amend the contract to add or 
delete shipping points, along with a full explanation of the reason 
therefor, may send a contract amendment to the Contractor for execution 
or notify the Contractor of rejection of the request.
    3.9  The Contractor shall keep Bureau helium accounting records 
necessary to show compliance with this contract. Such records shall be 
kept in a central location and shall be retained for one (1) year 
following the last day of the applicable annual reporting period. Helium 
accounting records shall include but are not limited to the following: 
(1) records of sales of Bureau of Mines helium to each Federal agency 
and to each private helium purchaser, (2) all pertinent documents 
supporting sales of Bureau of Mines helium, (3) helium sales contracts 
between the Contractor and another Federal Agency Contractor who, in the 
opinion of the Contracting Officer, may reasonably be considered a 
Federal Agency Contractor, (4) all pertinent documents supporting any 
contention that a Federal Agency Contractor was not required to use 
Bureau of Mines helium to meet the requirements of a Federal Agency, or 
a Federal Agency Contractor whose order intended delivery of Bureau of 
Mines helium in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, (5) certificates 
of Resale of Bureau of Mines helium certifying the resale of helium as 
required by Sec. 3.11 of this contract.
    3.10  The Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative 
shall have access to and the right to examine, during the Contractor's 
normal business hours, any pertinent books, documents, records, and 
physical facilities involving transactions related in any way to this
