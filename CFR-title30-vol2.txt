                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2011), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 203.0  What definitions apply to this part?

    Authorized field means a field:
    (1) Located in a water depth of at least 200 meters and in the Gulf 
of Mexico (GOM) west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude;
    (2) That includes one or more pre-Act leases; and
    (3) From which no current pre-Act lease produced, other than test 
production, before November 28, 1995.
    Certified unsuccessful well means an original well or a sidetrack 
with a sidetrack measured depth (i.e., length) of at least 10,000 feet, 
on your lease that:
    (1) You begin drilling on or after March 26, 2003, and before May 3, 
2009, on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 
200 meters deep and that is not a non-converted lease, or on or after 
May 18, 2007, and before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in 
water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters 
deep;
    (2) You begin drilling before your lease produces gas or oil from a 
well with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet 
true vertical depth subsea (TVD SS), (i.e., below the datum at mean sea 
level);
    (3) You drill to at least 18,000 feet TVD SS with a target reservoir 
on your lease, identified from seismic and related data, deeper than 
that depth;
    (4) Fails to meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 250, 
subpart A, and does not produce gas or oil, or meets those producibility 
requirements and MMS agrees it is not commercially producible; and
    (5) For which you have provided the notices and information required 
under Sec. 203.47.
    Complete application means an original and two copies of the six 
reports consisting of the data specified in 30 CFR 203.81, 203.83 and 
203.85 through

[[Page 7]]

203.89, along with one set of digital information, which MMS has 
reviewed and found complete.
    Deep well means either an original well or a sidetrack with a 
perforated interval the top of which is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS and 
less than 20,000 feet TVD SS. A deep well subsequently re-perforated at 
less than 15,000 feet TVD SS in the same reservoir is still a deep well.
    Determination means the binding decision by MMS on whether your 
field qualifies for relief or how large a royalty-suspension volume must 
be to make the field economically viable.
    Development project means a project to develop one or more oil or 
gas reservoirs located on one or more contiguous leases that have had no 
production (other than test production) before the current application 
for royalty relief and are either:
    (1) Located in a planning area offshore Alaska; or
    (2) Located in the GOM in a water depth of at least 200 meters and 
wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, and were issued in 
a sale held after November 28, 2000.
    Draft application means the preliminary set of information and 
assumptions you submit to seek a nonbinding assessment on whether a 
field could be expected to qualify for royalty relief.
    Eligible lease means a lease that:
    (1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 
1995, and before November 28, 2000;
    (2) Is located in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths of 200 meters 
or deeper;
    (3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; and
    (4) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension volume.
    Expansion project means a project that meets the following 
requirements:
    (1) You must propose the project in a Development and Production 
Plan, a Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD), or a 
Supplement to a DOCD, approved by the Secretary of the Interior after 
November 28, 1995.
    (2) The project must be located on either:
    (i) A pre-Act lease in the GOM, or a lease in the GOM issued in a 
sale held after November 28, 2000, located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 
minutes West longitude; or
    (ii) A lease in a planning area offshore Alaska.
    (3) On a pre-Act lease in the GOM, the project:
    (i) Must significantly increase the ultimate recovery of resources 
from one or more reservoirs that have not previously produced (extending 
recovery from reservoirs already in production does not constitute a 
significant increase); and
    (ii) Must involve a substantial capital investment (e.g., fixed-leg 
platform, subsea template and manifold, tension-leg platform, multiple 
well project, etc.).
    (4) For a lease issued in a planning area offshore Alaska, or in the 
GOM after November 28, 2000, the project must involve a new well drilled 
into a reservoir that has not previously produced.
    (5) On a lease in the GOM, the project must not include a reservoir 
the production from which an RSV under Sec. Sec. 203.30 through 203.36 
or Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.48 would be applied.
    Fabrication (or start of construction) means evidence of an 
irreversible commitment to a concept and scale of development. Evidence 
includes copies of a binding contract between you (as applicant) and a 
fabrication yard, a letter from a fabricator certifying that continuous 
construction has begun, and a receipt for the customary down payment.
    Field means an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple 
reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same general geological 
structural feature or stratigraphic trapping condition. Two or more 
reservoirs may be in a field, separated vertically by intervening 
impervious strata or laterally by local geologic barriers, or both.
    Lease means a lease or unit.
    New production means any production from a current pre-Act lease 
from which no royalties are due on production, other than test 
production, before November 28, 1995. Also, it means any additional 
production resulting from new lease-development activities on a lease 
issued in a sale after November 28, 2000, or a current pre-Act lease

[[Page 8]]

under a DOCD or a Supplement approved by the Secretary of the Interior 
after November, 28, 1995.
    Nonbinding assessment means an opinion by MMS of whether your field 
could qualify for royalty relief. It is based on your draft application 
and does not entitle the field to relief.
    Non-converted lease means a lease located partly or entirely in 
water less than 200 meters deep issued in a lease sale held after 
January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, whose original lease terms 
provided for an RSV for deep gas production and the lessee has not 
exercised the option under Sec. 203.49 to replace the lease terms for 
royalty relief with those in Sec. 203.0 and Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 
203.48.
    Original well means a well that is drilled without utilizing an 
existing wellbore. An original well includes all sidetracks drilled from 
the original wellbore either before the drilling rig moves off the well 
location or after a temporary rig move that MMS agrees was forced by a 
weather or safety threat and drilling resumes within 1 year. A bypass 
from an original well (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole 
or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the original well.
    Participating area means that part of the unit area that MMS 
determines is reasonably proven by drilling and completion of producible 
wells, geological and geophysical information, and engineering data to 
be capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities.
    Performance conditions means minimum conditions you must meet, after 
we have granted relief and before production begins, to remain qualified 
for that relief. If you do not meet each one of these performance 
conditions, we consider it a change in material fact significant enough 
to invalidate our original evaluation and approval.
    Phase 1 ultra-deep well means an ultra-deep well on a lease that is 
located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep for which 
drilling began before May 18, 2007, and that begins production before 
May 3, 2009, or that meets the requirements to be a certified 
unsuccessful well.
    Phase 2 ultra-deep well means an ultra-deep well for which drilling 
began on or after May 18, 2007; and that either meets the requirements 
to be a certified unsuccessful well or that begins production:
    (1) Before the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date 
on a non-converted lease; or
    (2) Before May 3, 2009, on all other leases located in water partly 
or entirely less than 200 meters deep; or
    (3) Before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely 
more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
    Phase 3 ultra-deep well means an ultra-deep well for which drilling 
began on or after May 18, 2007, and that begins production:
    (1) On or after the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance 
date on a non-converted lease; or
    (2) On or after May 3, 2009, on all other leases located in water 
partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep; or
    (3) On or after May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water 
entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
    Pre-Act lease means a lease that:
    (1) Results from a sale held before November 28, 1995;
    (2) Is located in the GOM in water depths of 200 meters or deeper; 
and
    (3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.
    Production means all oil, gas, and other relevant products you save, 
remove, or sell from a tract or those quantities allocated to your tract 
under a unitization formula, as measured for the purposes of determining 
the amount of royalty payable to the United States.
    Project means any activity that requires at least a permit to drill.
    Qualified deep well means:
    (1) On a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 
200 meters deep that is not a non-converted lease, a deep well for which 
drilling began on or after March 26, 2003, that produces natural gas 
(other than test production), including gas associated with oil 
production, before May 3, 2009, and for which you have met the 
requirements prescribed in Sec. 203.44;
    (2) On a non-converted lease, a deep well that produces natural gas 
(other than test production) before the date which is 5 years after the 
lease

[[Page 9]]

issuance date from a reservoir that has not produced from a deep well on 
any lease; or
    (3) On a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 
meters but entirely less than 400 meters deep, a deep well for which 
drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, that produces natural gas 
(other than test production), including gas associated with oil 
production before May 3, 2013, and for which you have met the 
requirements prescribed in Sec. 203.44.
    Qualified ultra-deep well means:
    (1) On a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 
200 meters deep that is not a non-converted lease, an ultra-deep well 
for which drilling began on or after March 26, 2003, that produces 
natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with 
oil production, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed 
in Sec. 203.35 or Sec. 203.44, as applicable; or
    (2) On a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 
meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep, or on a non-converted 
lease, an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 
2007, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including 
gas associated with oil production, and for which you have met the 
requirements prescribed in Sec. 203.35.
    Qualified well means either a qualified deep well or a qualified 
ultra-deep well.
    Redetermination means our reconsideration of our determination on 
royalty relief because you request it after:
    (1) We have rejected your application;
    (2) We have granted relief but you want a larger suspension volume;
    (3) We withdraw approval; or
    (4) You renounce royalty relief.
    Renounce means action you take to give up relief after we have 
granted it and before you start production.
    Reservoir means an underground accumulation of oil or natural gas, 
or both, characterized by a single pressure system and segregated from 
other such accumulations.
    Royalty suspension (RS) lease means a lease that:
    (1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 
2000;
    (2) Is in locations or planning areas specified in a particular 
Notice of OCS Lease Sale offering that lease; and
    (3) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension specified in a Notice 
of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register.
    Royalty suspension supplement (RSS) means a royalty suspension 
volume resulting from drilling a certified unsuccessful well that is 
applied to future natural gas and oil production generated at any 
drilling depth on, or allocated under an MMS-approved unit agreement to, 
the same lease.
    Royalty suspension volume (RSV) means a volume of production from a 
lease that is not subject to royalty under the provisions of this part.
    Sidetrack means, for the purpose of this subpart, a well resulting 
from drilling an additional hole to a new objective bottom-hole location 
by leaving a previously drilled hole. A sidetrack also includes drilling 
a well from a platform slot reclaimed from a previously drilled well or 
re-entering and deepening a previously drilled well. A bypass from a 
sidetrack (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole, or to 
straighten crooked holes) is part of the sidetrack.
    Sidetrack measured depth means the actual distance or length in feet 
a sidetrack is drilled beginning where it exits a previously drilled 
hole to the bottom hole of the sidetrack, that is, to its total depth.
    Sunk costs for an authorized field means the after-tax eligible 
costs that you (not third parties) incur for exploration, development, 
and production from the spud date of the first discovery on the field to 
the date we receive your complete application for royalty relief. The 
discovery well must be qualified as producible under part 250, subpart A 
of this title. Sunk costs include the rig mobilization and material 
costs for the discovery well that you incurred before its spud date.
    Sunk costs for an expansion or development project means the after-
tax eligible costs that you (not third parties) incur for only the first 
well that encounters hydrocarbons in the reservoir(s) included in the 
application and that meets the producibility requirements under part 
250, subpart A of

[[Page 10]]

this chapter on each lease participating in the application. Sunk costs 
include rig mobilization and material costs for the discovery wells that 
you incurred before their spud dates.
    Ultra-deep well means either an original well or a sidetrack 
completed with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 20,000 
feet TVD SS. An ultra-deep well subsequently re-perforated less than 
20,000 feet TVD SS in the same reservoir is still an ultra-deep well.
    Withdraw means action we take on a field that has qualified for 
relief if you have not met one or more of the performance conditions.

Sec. 203.1  What is MMS's authority to grant royalty relief?

    The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337, as 
amended by the OCS Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA), Public Law 
104-58 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Public Law 109-058 authorizes 
us to grant royalty relief in four situations.
    (a) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(A), we may reduce or eliminate any 
royalty or a net profit share specified for an OCS lease to promote 
increased production.
    (b) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(B), we may reduce, modify, or 
eliminate any royalty or net profit share to promote development, 
increase production, or encourage production of marginal resources on 
certain leases or categories of leases. This authority is restricted to 
leases in the GOM that are west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West 
longitude, and in the planning areas offshore Alaska.
    (c) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), we may suspend royalties for 
designated volumes of new production from any lease if:
    (1) Your lease is in deep water (water at least 200 meters deep);
    (2) Your lease is in designated areas of the GOM (west of 87 
degrees, 30 minutes West longitude);
    (3) Your lease was acquired in a lease sale held before the DWRRA 
(before November 28, 1995);
    (4) We find that your new production would not be economic without 
royalty relief; and
    (5) Your lease is on a field that did not produce before enactment 
of the DWRRA, or if you propose a project to significantly expand 
production under a Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) 
or a supplementary DOCD, that MMS approved after November 28, 1995.
    (d) Under 42 U.S.C. 15904-15905, we may suspend royalties for 
designated volumes of gas production from deep and ultra-deep wells on a 
lease if:
    (1) Your lease is in shallow water (water less than 400 meters deep) 
and you produce from an ultra-deep well (top of the perforated interval 
is at least 20,000 feet TVD SS) or your lease is in waters entirely more 
than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep and you produce 
from a deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 15,000 feet 
TVD SS);
    (2) Your lease is in the designated area of the GOM (wholly west of 
87 degrees, 30 minutes west longitude); and
    (3) Your lease is not eligible for deep water royalty relief.

Sec. 203.2  How can I obtain royalty relief?

    We may reduce or suspend royalties for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) 
leases or projects that meet the criteria in the following table.

Sec. 203.3  Do I have to pay a fee to request royalty relief?

    When you submit an application or ask for a preview assessment, you 
must include a fee to reimburse us for our costs of processing your 
application or assessment. Federal policy and law require us to recover 
the cost of services that confer special benefits to identifiable non-
Federal recipients. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act (31 U.S.C. 
9701), Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25, and the Omnibus 
Appropriations Bill (Pub. L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, April 26, 1996) 
authorize us to collect these fees.
    (a) We will specify the necessary fees for each of the types of 
royalty relief applications and possible MMS audits in a Notice to 
Lessees. We will periodically update the fees to reflect changes in 
costs, as well as provide other information necessary to administer 
royalty relief.
    (b) You must file all payments electronically through the Pay.gov 
Web site and you must include a copy of the Pay.gov confirmation receipt 
page with your application or assessment. The Pay.gov Web site may be 
accessed through a link on the MMS Offshore Web site at: http://
www.mms.gov/offshore/ homepage or directly through Pay.gov at: https://
www.pay.gov/paygov/.

Sec. 203.4  How do the provisions in this part apply to different types 

of leases and projects?

    The tables in this section summarize the similar application and 
approval provisions for the discretionary end-of-life and deep water 
royalty relief programs in Sec. Sec. 203.50 to 203.91. Because royalty 
relief for deep gas on leases not subject to deep water royalty relief, 
as provided for under Sec. Sec. 203.40 to 203.48, does not involve an 
application, its provisions do not parallel the other two royalty relief 
programs and are not summarized in this section.

    (a) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the 
information collection requirements in this part under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq., and assigned OMB Control Number 1010-0071. The title of this 
information collection is ``30 CFR part 203, Relief or Reduction in 
Royalty Rates.''
    (b) The MMS collects this information to make decisions on the 
economic viability of leases requesting a suspension or elimination of 
royalty or net profit share. Responses are required to obtain a benefit 
or are mandatory according to 43 U.S.C. 1331 et

[[Page 14]]

seq. The MMS will protect information considered proprietary under 
applicable law and under regulations at 30 CFR 203.63, ``How do I assess 
my chances for getting relief?'' and 250.197, ``Data and information to

 Royalty Relief for Drilling Ultra-Deep Wells on Leases Not Subject to 
                        Deep Water Royalty Relief

    Source: 73 FR 69506, Nov. 18, 2008, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 203.30  Which leases are eligible for royalty relief as a 

result of drilling a phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?

    Your lease may receive a royalty suspension volume (RSV) under 
Sec. Sec. 203.31 through 203.36 if the lease meets all the requirements 
of this section.
    (a) The lease is located in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 
minutes West longitude in water depths entirely less than 400 meters 
deep.
    (b) The lease has not produced gas or oil from a deep well or an 
ultra-deep well, except as provided in Sec. 203.31(b).
    (c) If the lease is located entirely in more than 200 meters and 
entirely less than 400 meters of water, it must either:
    (1) Have been issued before November 28, 1995, and not been granted 
deep water royalty relief under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), added by 
section 302 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or
    (2) Have been issued after November 28, 2000, and not been granted 
deep water royalty relief under Sec. Sec. 203.60 through 203.79.


<R05>
Sec. 203.31  If I have a qualified phase 2 or qualified 

phase 3 ultra-deep well, what royalty relief would that well earn for my lease?

    (a) Subject to the administrative requirements of Sec. 203.35 and 
the price conditions in Sec. 203.36, your qualified well earns your 
lease an RSV shown in the following table in billions of cubic feet 
(BCF) or in thousands of cubic feet (MCF) as prescribed in Sec. 203.33:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you have a qualified phase 2 or
 qualified phase 3 ultra-deep well     Then your lease earns an RSV on
              that is:                  this volume of gas production:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) An original well,                35 BCF.
(2) A sidetrack with a sidetrack     35 BCF.
 measured depth of at least 20,000
 feet,
(3) An ultra-deep short sidetrack    4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack
 that is a phase 2 ultra-deep well,   measured depth (rounded to the
                                      nearest 100 feet) but no more than
                                      25 BCF.
(4) An ultra-deep short sidetrack    0 BCF.
 that is a phase 3 ultra-deep well,
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b)(1) This paragraph applies if your lease:
    (i) Has produced gas or oil from a deep well with a perforated 
interval the top of which is less than 18,000 feet TVD SS;
    (ii) Was issued in a lease sale held between January 1, 2004, and 
December 31, 2005; and
    (iii) The terms of your lease expressly incorporate the provisions 
of Sec. Sec. 203.41 through 203.47 as they existed at the time the 
lease was issued.

[[Page 15]]

    (2) Subject to the administrative requirements of Sec. 203.35 and 
the price conditions in Sec. 203.36, your qualified well earns your 
lease an RSV shown in the following table in BCF or MCF as prescribed in 
Sec. 203.33:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you have a qualified phase 2      Then your lease earns an RSV on
    ultra-deep well that is . .         this volume of gas production:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i) An original well or a sidetrack  10 BCF.
 with a sidetrack measured depth of
 at least 20,000 feet TVD SS,
(ii) An ultra-deep short sidetrack,  4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack
                                      measured depth (rounded to the
                                      nearest 100 feet) but no more than
                                      10 BCF.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Lessees may request a refund of or recoup royalties paid on 
production from qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep wells that:
    (1) Occurs before December 18, 2008 and
    (2) Is subject to application of an RSV under either Sec. 203.31 or 
Sec. 203.41.
    (d) The following examples illustrate how this section applies. 
These examples assume that your lease is located in the GOM west of 87 
degrees, 30 minutes West longitude and in water less than 400 meters 
deep (see Sec. 203.30(a)), has no existing deep or ultra-deep wells and 
that the price thresholds prescribed in Sec. 203.36 have not been 
exceeded.

    Example 1: In 2008, you drill and begin producing from an ultra-deep 
well with a perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS, 
and your lease has had no prior production from a deep or ultra-deep 
well. Assuming your lease has no deepwater royalty relief (see Sec. 
203.30(c)), your lease is eligible (according to Sec. 203.30(b)) to 
earn an RSV under Sec. 203.31 because it has not yet produced from a 
deep well. Your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF under this section when 
this well begins producing. According to Sec. 203.31(a), your 25,000 
foot well qualifies your lease for this RSV because the well was drilled 
after the relief authorized here became effective (when the proposed 
version of this rule was published on May 18, 2007) and produced from an 
interval that meets the criteria for an ultra-deep well (i.e., is a 
phase 2 ultra-deep well as defined in Sec. 203.0). Then in 2014, you 
drill and produce from another ultra-deep well with a perforated 
interval the top of which is 29,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no 
additional RSV under this section when this second ultra-deep well 
produces, because your lease no longer meets the condition in Sec. 
203.30(b)) of no production from a deep well. However, any remaining RSV 
earned by the first ultra-deep well on your lease would be applied to 
production from both the first and the second ultra-deep wells as 
prescribed in Sec. 203.33(a)(2), or Sec. 203.33(b)(2) if your lease is 
part of a unit.
    Example 2: In 2005, you spudded and began producing from an ultra-
deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 23,000 feet TVD 
SS. Your lease earns no RSV under this section from this phase 1 ultra-
deep well (as defined in Sec. 203.0) because you spudded the well 
before the publication date (May 18, 2007) of the proposed rule when 
royalty relief under Sec. 203.31(a) became effective. However, this 
ultra-deep well may earn an RSV of 25 BCF for your lease under Sec. 
203.41 (that became effective May 3, 2004), if the lease is located in 
water depths partly or entirely less than 200 meters and has not 
previously produced from a deep well (Sec. 203.30(b)).
    Example 3: In 2000, you began producing from a deep well with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and your 
lease is located in water 100 meters deep. Then in 2008, you drill and 
produce from a new ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of 
which is 24,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no RSV under either this 
section or Sec. 203.41 because the 16,000-foot well was drilled before 
we offered any way to earn an RSV for producing from a deep well (see 
dates in the definition of qualified well in Sec. 203.0) and because 
the existence of the 16,000-foot well means the lease is not eligible 
(see Sec. 203.30(b)) to earn an RSV for the 24,000-foot well. Because 
the lease existed in the year 2000, it cannot be eligible for the 
exception to this eligibility condition provided in Sec. 203.31(b).
    Example 4: In 2008, you spud and produce from an ultra-deep well 
with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,000 feet TVD SS, your 
lease is located in water 300 meters deep, and your lease has had no 
previous production from a deep or ultra-deep well. Your lease earns an 
RSV of 35 BCF under this section when this well begins producing because 
your lease meets the conditions in Sec. 203.30 and the well fits the 
definition of a phase 2 ultra-deep well (in Sec. 203.0). Then in 2010, 
you spud and produce from a deep well with a perforated interval the top 
of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS. Your 16,000-foot well earns no RSV 
because it is on a lease that already has a producing well at least 
18,000 feet subsea (see Sec. 203.42(a)), but any remaining RSV earned 
by the ultra-deep well would also be applied to production from the deep 
well as prescribed in Sec. 203.33(a)(2), or Sec. 203.33(b)(2) if

[[Page 16]]

your lease is part of a unit and Sec. 203.43(a)(2), or Sec. 
203.43(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit. However, if the 16,000-
foot deep well does not begin production until 2016 (or if your lease 
were located in water less than 200 meters deep), then the 16,000-foot 
well would not be a qualified deep well because this well does not begin 
production within the interval specified in the definition of a 
qualified well in Sec. 203.0, and the RSV earned by the ultra-deep well 
would not be applied to production from this (unqualified) deep well.
    Example 5: In 2008, you spud a deep well with a perforated interval 
the top of which is 17,000 feet TVD SS that becomes a qualified well and 
earns an RSV of 15 BCF under Sec. 203.41 when it begins producing. Then 
in 2011, you spud an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top 
of which is 26,000 feet TVD SS. Your 26,000-foot well becomes a 
qualified ultra-deep well because it meets the date and depth conditions 
in this definition under Sec. 203.0 when it begins producing, but your 
lease earns no additional RSV under this section or Sec. 203.41 because 
it is on a lease that already has production from a deep well (see Sec. 
203.30(b)). Both the qualified deep well and the qualified ultra-deep 
well would share your lease's total RSV of 15 BCF in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. Sec. 203.33 and 203.43.
    Example 6: In 2008, you spud a qualified ultra-deep well that is a 
sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of 21,000 feet and a 
perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS. This well 
meets the definition of an ultra-deep well but is too long to be 
classified an ultra-deep short sidetrack in Sec. 203.0. If your lease 
is located in 150 meters of water and has not previously produced from a 
deep well, your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF because it was drilled 
after the effective date for earning this RSV. Further, this RSV applies 
to gas production from this and any future qualified deep and qualified 
ultra-deep wells on your lease, as prescribed in Sec. 203.33. The 
absence of an expiration date for earning an RSV on an ultra-deep well 
means this long sidetrack well becomes a qualified well whenever it 
starts production. If your sidetrack has a sidetrack measured depth of 
14,000 feet and begins production in March 2009, it earns an RSV of 12.4 
BCF under this section because it meets the definitions of a phase 2 
ultra-deep well (production begins before the expiration date for the 
pre-existing relief in its water depth category) and an ultra-deep short 
sidetrack in Sec. 203.0. However, if it does not begin production until 
2010, it earns no RSV because it is too short as a phase 3 ultra-deep 
well to be a qualified ultra-deep well.
    Example 7: Your lease was issued in June 2004 and expressly 
incorporates the provisions of Sec. Sec. 203.41 through 203.47 as they 
existed at that time. In January 2005, you spud a deep well (well no. 1) 
with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,800 feet TVD SS that 
becomes a qualified well and earns an RSV of 15 BCF under Sec. 203.41 
when it begins producing. Then in February 2008, you spud an ultra-deep 
well (well no. 2) with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,300 
feet that begins producing in November 2008, after well no. 1 has 
started production. Well no. 2 earns your lease an additional RSV of 10 
BCF under paragraph (b) of this section because it begins production in 
time to be classified as a phase 2 ultra-deep well. If, on the other 
hand, well no. 2 had begun producing in June 2009, it would earn no 
additional RSV for the lease because it would be classified as a phase 3 
ultra-deep well and thus is not entitled to the exception under 
paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 203.32  What other requirements or restrictions

apply to royalty relief for a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?

    (a) If a qualified ultra-deep well on your lease is within a 
unitized portion of your lease, the RSV earned by that well under this 
section applies only to your lease and not to other leases within the 
unit or to the unit as a whole.
    (b) If your qualified ultra-deep well is a directional well (either 
an original well or a sidetrack) drilled across a lease line, then 
either:
    (1) The lease with the perforated interval that initially produces 
earns the RSV or
    (2) If the perforated interval crosses a lease line, the lease where 
the surface of the well is located earns the RSV.
    (c) Any RSV earned under Sec. 203.31 is in addition to any royalty 
suspension supplement (RSS) for your lease under Sec. 203.45 that 
results from a different wellbore.
    (d) If your lease earns an RSV under Sec. 203.31 and later produces 
from a deep well that is not a qualified well, the RSV is not forfeited 
or terminated, but you may not apply the RSV earned under Sec. 203.31 
to production from the non-qualified well.
    (e) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your 
lease terms notwithstanding any RSVs allowed under paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of Sec. 203.31.
    (f) Unused RSVs transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the 
lease.

[[Page 17]]


<R05>
Sec. 203.33  To which production do I apply the RSV earned 

by qualified phase 2 and phase 3 ultra-deep wells on my lease or in my unit?

    (a) You must apply the RSV allowed in Sec. 203.31(a) and (b) to gas 
volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 18, 2007, reported 
on the Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part A (OGOR-A) for your lease 
under Sec. 216.53. All gas production from qualified wells reported on 
the OGOR-A, including production not subject to royalty, counts toward 
the total lease RSV earned by both deep or ultra-deep wells on the 
lease.
    (b) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified phase 2 or 
phase 3 ultra-deep well that is not within an MMS-approved unit. Subject 
to the price conditions of Sec. 203.36, you must apply the RSV 
prescribed in Sec. 203.31 as required under the following paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring 
on and after the later of May 18, 2007, or the date the first qualified 
phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns your lease the RSV begins 
production (other than test production).
    (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified 
wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met 
the requirements in Sec. 203.35 or Sec. 203.44.
    (c) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified phase 2 or 
phase 3 ultra-deep well where all or part of the lease is within an MMS-
approved unit. Under the unit agreement, a share of the production from 
all the qualified wells in the unit participating area would be 
allocated to your lease each month according to the participating area 
percentages. Subject to the price conditions of Sec. 203.36, you must 
apply the RSV prescribed in Sec. 203.31 as follows:
    (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring 
on and after the later of May 18, 2007, or the date that the first 
qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns your lease the 
RSV begins production (other than test production).
    (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production:
    (i) From qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, 
regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in 
Sec. 203.35 or Sec. 203.44; and
    (ii) Allocated to your lease under an MMS-approved unit agreement 
from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on other leases 
in participating areas of the unit, regardless of their depth, for which 
the requirements in Sec. 203.35 or Sec. 203.44 have been met. The 
allocated share under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section does not 
increase the RSV for your lease.

    Example: The east half of your lease A is unitized with all of lease 
B. There is one qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on the non-unitized 
portion of lease A that earns lease A an RSV of 35 BCF under Sec. 
203.31, one qualified deep well on the unitized portion of lease A 
(drilled after the ultra-deep well on the non-unitized portion of that 
lease) and a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on lease B that earns 
lease B a 35 BCF RSV under Sec. 203.31. The participating area 
percentages allocate 40 percent of production from both of the unit 
qualified wells to lease A and 60 percent to lease B. If the non-
unitized qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on lease A produces 12 BCF, 
and the unitized qualified well on lease A produces 18 BCF, and the 
qualified well on lease B produces 37 BCF, then the production volume 
from and allocated to lease A to which the lease A RSV applies is 34 BCF 
[12 + (18 + 37)(0.40)]. The production volume allocated to lease B to 
which the lease B RSV applies is 33 BCF [(18 + 37)(0.60)]. None of the 
volumes produced from a well that is not within a unit participating 
area may be allocated to other leases in the unit.

    (d) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production 
of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your 
lease under paragraph (b) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV 
allowed under Sec. 203.31 or Sec. 203.41. For the month in which 
cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion 
of gas production from or allocated to your lease that exceeds the RSV 
remaining at the beginning of that month.


<R05>
Sec. 203.34  To which production may an RSV earned 

by qualified phase 2 and phase 3 ultra-deep wells on my lease not be applied?

    You may not apply an RSV earned under Sec. 203.31:

[[Page 18]]

    (a) To production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, 
except in cases where the qualified well is re-perforated in the same 
reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;
    (b) To production from a deep well or ultra-deep well on any other 
lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of Sec. 203.33;
    (c) To any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or
    (d) To production from a deep well or ultra-deep well that commenced 
drilling before:
    (1) March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in 
water less than 200 meters deep; or
    (2) May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more 
than 200 meters deep.


<R05>
Sec. 203.35  What administrative steps must I take to use the RSV earned 

by a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?

    To use an RSV earned under Sec. 203.31:
    (a) You must notify the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and 
Development in writing of your intent to begin drilling operations on 
all your ultra-deep wells.
    (b) Before beginning production, you must meet any production 
measurement requirements that the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production 
and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, 
subpart L.
    (c)(1) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from any wells 
that would become qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep wells by 
satisfying the requirements of this section:
    (i) Provide written notification to the MMS Regional Supervisor for 
Production and Development that production has begun; and
    (ii) Request confirmation of the size of the RSV earned by your 
lease.
    (2) If you produced from a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep 
well before December 18, 2008, you must provide the information in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section no later than January 20, 2009.
    (d) If you cannot produce from a well that otherwise meets the 
criteria for a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well that is an ultra-deep 
short sidetrack before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located entirely 
or partly in water less than 200 meters deep, or before May 3, 2013, on 
a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters but less 
than 400 meters deep, the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and 
Development may extend the deadline for beginning production for up to 1 
year, based on the circumstances of the particular well involved, if it 
meets all the following criteria.
    (1) The delay occurred after drilling reached the total depth in 
your well.
    (2) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin 
from the well before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located entirely or 
partly in water less than 200 meters deep or before May 3, 2013, on a 
lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters but less 
than 400 meters deep. You must provide a credible activity schedule with 
supporting documentation.
    (3) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your 
control, such as adverse weather and accidents which MMS deems were 
unavoidable.


<R05>
Sec. 203.36  Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?

    (a) You must pay royalties on all gas production to which an RSV 
otherwise would be applied under Sec. 203.33 for any calendar year in 
which the average daily closing New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) 
natural gas price exceeds the applicable threshold price shown in the 
following table.

                                               prescribe a different price threshold; and
                                              (v) Any RSV earned under Sec.  203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep
                                               well on a lease in water entirely more than 200 meters deep and

 (4) $5.83 per MMBtu........................  (i) The first 20 BCF of RSV earned by a well that is located on a
                                               non-converted lease issued in OCS Lease Sales 180, 182, 184, 185,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, determine the 
threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by:
    (1) Determining the percentage of change during the year in the 
Department of Commerce's implicit price deflator for the gross domestic 
product; and
    (2) Adjusting the threshold price for the previous year by that 
percentage.
    (c) The following examples illustrate how this section applies.

    Example 1: Assume that a lessee drills and begins producing from a 
qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well in 2008 on a lease issued in 2004 in 
less than 200 meters of water that earns the lease an RSV of 35 BCF. 
Further, assume the well produces a total of 18 BCF by the end of 2009 
and in both of those years, the average daily NYMEX closing natural gas 
price is less than $10.15 (adjusted for inflation after 2007). The 
lessee does not pay royalty on the 18 BCF because the gas price 
threshold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to the first 25 
BCF of this RSV earned by this phase 2 ultra-deep well. In 2010, the 
well produces another 13 BCF. In that year, the average daily closing 
NYMEX natural gas price is greater than $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for 
inflation after 2007), but less than $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for 
inflation after 2007). The first 7 BCF produced in 2010 will exhaust the 
first 25 BCF (that is subject to the $10.15 threshold) of the 35 BCF RSV 
that the well earned. The lessee must pay royalty on the remaining 6 BCF 
produced in 2010, because it is subject to the $4.55 per MMBtu threshold 
under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section which was exceeded.
    Example 2: Assume that a lessee:
    (1) Drills and produces from well no.1, a qualified deep well in 
2008 to a depth of 15,500 feet TVD SS that earns a 15 BCF RSV for the 
lease under Sec. 203.41, which would be subject to a price threshold of 
$10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007), meaning the lease 
is partly or entirely in less than 200 meters of water;
    (2) Later in 2008 drills and produces from well no. 2, a second 
qualified deep well to a depth of 17,000 feet TVD SS that earns no 
additional RSV (see Sec. 203.41(c)(1)); and
    (3) In 2015, drills and produces from well no. 3, a qualified phase 
3 ultra-deep well that earns no additional RSV since the lease already 
has an RSV established by prior deep well production. Further assume 
that in 2015, the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds 
$4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) but does not exceed 
$10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007). In 2015, any 
remaining RSV earned by well no. 1 (which would have been applied to 
production from well nos. 1 and 2 in the intervening years), would be 
applied to production from all three qualified wells. Because the price 
threshold applicable to that RSV was not exceeded, the production from 
all three qualified wells would be royalty-free until the 15 BCF RSV 
earned by well no. 1 is exhausted.
    Example 3: Assume the same initial facts regarding the three wells 
as in Example 2. Further assume that well no. 1 stopped producing in 
2011 after it had produced 8 BCF, and that well no. 2 stopped producing 
in 2012 after it had produced 5 BCF. Two BCF of the RSV earned by well 
no. 1 remain. That RSV would be applied to production from well no. 3 
until it is exhausted, and the lessee therefore would not pay royalty on 
those 2 BCF produced in 2015, because the $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for 
inflation after 2007) price threshold is not exceeded. The determination 
of which price threshold applies to deep gas production depends on when 
the first qualified well earned the RSV for the lease, not on which 
wells use the RSV.
    Example 4: Assume that in February 2010 a lessee completes and 
begins producing from an ultra-deep well (at a depth of 21,500 feet

[[Page 20]]

TVD SS) on a lease located in 325 meters of water with no prior 
production from any deep well and no deep water royalty relief. The 
ultra-deep well would be a phase 2 ultra-deep well (see definition in 
Sec. 203.0), and would earn the lease an RSV of 35 BCF under Sec. Sec. 
203.30 and 203.31. Further assume that the average daily closing NYMEX 
natural gas price exceeds $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 
2007) but does not exceed $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 
2007) during 2010. Because the lease is located in more than 200 but 
less than 400 meters of water, the $4.55 per MMBtu price threshold 
applies to the whole RSV (see paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section), and 
the lessee will owe royalty on all gas produced from the ultra-deep well 
in 2010.

    (d) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than 
March 31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe 
royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment 
interest under Sec. 218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.
    (e) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this 
section count as part of your RSV.

Royalty Relief for Drilling Deep Gas Wells on Leases Not Subject to Deep 
                          Water Royalty Relief

    Source: 69 FR 3510, Jan. 26, 2004, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 203.40  Which leases are eligible for royalty relief as a result 

of drilling a deep well or a phase 1 ultra-deep well?

    Your lease may receive an RSV under Sec. Sec. 203.41 through 
203.44, and may receive an RSS under Sec. Sec. 203.45 through 203.47, 
if it meets all the requirements of this section.
    (a) The lease is located in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 
minutes West longitude in water depths entirely less than 400 meters 
deep.
    (b) The lease has not produced gas or oil from a well with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper 
that commenced drilling either:
    (1) Before March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located partly or 
entirely in water less than 200 meters deep; or
    (2) Before May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located in water 
entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
    (c) In the case of a lease located partly or entirely in water less 
than 200 meters deep, the lease was issued in a lease sale held either:
    (1) Before January 1, 2001;
    (2) On or after January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, and, in 
cases where the original lease terms provided for an RSV for deep gas 
production, the lessee has exercised the option provided for in Sec. 
203.49; or
    (3) On or after January 1, 2004, and the lease terms provide for 
royalty relief under Sec. Sec. 203.41 through 203.47 of this part. 
(Note: Because the original Sec. 203.41 has been divided into new 
Sec. Sec. 203.41 and 203.42 and subsequent sections have been 
redesignated as Sec. Sec. 203.43 through 203.48, royalty relief in 
lease terms for leases issued on or after January 1, 2004, should be 
read as referring to Sec. Sec. 203.41 through 203.48.)
    (d) If the lease is located entirely in more than 200 meters and 
less than 400 meters of water, it must either:
    (1) Have been issued before November 28, 1995, and not been granted 
deep water royalty relief under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), added by 
section 302 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or
    (2) Have been issued after November 28, 2000, and not been granted 
deep water royalty relief under Sec. Sec. 203.60 through 203.79.

Sec. 203.41  If I have a qualified deep well or a qualified 

phase 1 ultra-deep well, what royalty relief would my lease earn?

    (a) To qualify for a suspension volume under paragraphs (b) or (c) 
of this section, your lease must meet the requirements in Sec. 203.40 
and the requirements in the following table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               And if it later . .   Then your lease . .
 If your lease has not . . .            .                     .

                               deeper or a
                               qualified phase 1
                               ultra-deep well,.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) If your lease meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, it earns the RSV prescribed in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you have a qualified deep well
 or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep     Then your lease earns an RSV on
           well that is:                this volume of gas production:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) An original well with a          15 BCF.
 perforated interval the top of
 which is from 15,000 to less than
 18,000 feet TVD SS,
(2) A sidetrack with a perforated    4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack
 interval the top of which is from    measured depth (rounded to the
 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet      nearest 100 feet) but no more than
 TVD SS,                              15 BCF.
(3) An original well with a          25 BCF.
 perforated interval the top of
 which is at least 18,000 feet TVD
 SS,
(4) A sidetrack with a perforated    4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack
 interval the top of which is at      measured depth (rounded to the
 least 18,000 feet TVD SS,            nearest 100 feet) but no more than
                                      25 BCF.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) If your lease meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, it earns the RSV prescribed in the following table. The RSV 
specified in this paragraph is in addition to any RSV your lease already 
may have earned from a qualified deep well with a perforated interval 
whose top is from 15,000 feet to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you have a qualified deep well or a
qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well that is . .        Then you earn an RSV on this amount of gas production:
                      .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) An original well or a sidetrack with a     0 BCF.

 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
(2) An original well with a perforated         10 BCF.

 SS or deeper,
(3) A sidetrack with a perforated interval     4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the
 the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or      nearest 100 feet) but no more than 10 BCF.
 deeper,
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Lessees may request a refund of or recoup royalties paid on 
production from qualified wells on a lease that is located in water 
entirely deeper than 200 meters but entirely less than 400 meters deep 
that:
    (1) Occurs before December 18, 2008; and
    (2) Is subject to application of an RSV under either Sec. 203.31 or 
Sec. 203.41.
    (e) The following examples illustrate how this section applies, 
assuming your lease meets the location, prior production, and lease 
issuance conditions in Sec. 203.40 and paragraph (a) of this section:

    Example 1: If you have a qualified deep well that is an original 
well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, 
your lease earns an RSV of 15 BCF under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. This RSV must be applied to gas production from all qualified 
wells on your lease, as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 203.43 and 203.48. 
However, if the top of the perforated interval is 18,500 feet TVD SS, 
the RSV is 25 BCF according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    Example 2: If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, 
with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a 
sidetrack measured depth of 6,789 feet, we round the measured depth to 
6,800 feet and your lease earns an RSV of 8.08 BCF under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. This RSV would be applied to gas production from 
all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 203.43 
and 203.48.
    Example 3: If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, 
with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a 
sidetrack measured depth of 19,500 feet, your lease earns an RSV of 15 
BCF. This RSV would be applied to gas production from all qualified 
wells on your lease, as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 203.43 and 203.48, even 
though 4 BCF plus 600 MCF per foot of sidetrack measured depth equals 
15.7 BCF because paragraph

[[Page 22]]

(b)(2) of this section limits the RSV for a sidetrack at the amount an 
original well to the same depth would earn.
    Example 4: If you have drilled and produced a deep well with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS before March 
26, 2003 (and the well therefore is not a qualified well and has earned 
no RSV under this section), and later drill:
    (i) A deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 
17,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns no RSV (see paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section);
    (ii) A qualified deep well that is an original well with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, your lease 
earns an RSV of 10 BCF under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This RSV 
would be applied to gas production from qualified wells on your lease, 
as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 203.43 and 203.48; or
    (iii) A qualified deep well that is a sidetrack with a perforated 
interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack 
measured depth of 7,000 feet, your lease earns an RSV of 8.2 BCF under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This RSV would be applied to gas 
production from qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in 
Sec. Sec. 203.43 and 203.48.
    Example 5: If you have a qualified deep well that is an original 
well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, 
and later drill a second qualified well that is an original well with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, we increase 
the total RSV for your lease from 15 BCF to 25 BCF under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. We will apply that RSV to gas production from 
all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 203.43 
and 203.48. If the second well has a perforated interval the top of 
which is 22,000 feet TVD SS (instead of 19,000 feet), the total RSV for 
your lease would increase to 25 BCF only in 2 situations: (1) If the 
second well was a phase 1 ultra-deep well, i.e., if drilling began 
before May 18, 2007, or (2) the exception in Sec. 203.31(b) applies. In 
both situations, your lease must be partly or entirely in less than 200 
meters of water and production must begin on this well before May 3, 
2009. If drilling of the second well began on or after May 18, 2007, the 
second well would be qualified as a phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well 
and, unless the exception in Sec. 203.31(b) applies, would not earn any 
additional RSV (as prescribed in Sec. 203.30), so the total RSV for 
your lease would remain at 15 BCF.
    Example 6: If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, 
with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a 
sidetrack measured depth of 4,000 feet, and later drill a second 
qualified well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top 
of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 8,000 
feet, we increase the total RSV for your lease from 6.4 BCF [4 + (600 * 
4,000)/1,000,000] to 15.2 BCF {6.4 + [4 + (600 * 8,000)/
1,000,000)]{time}  under paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. 
We would apply that RSV to gas production from all qualified wells on 
your lease, as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 203.43 and 203.48. The 
difference of 8.8 BCF represents the RSV earned by the second sidetrack 
that has a perforated interval the top of which is deeper than 18,000 
feet TVD SS.

    Example to paragraph (b): If your first qualified deep well is a 
sidetrack with a perforated interval whose top is 16,000 feet TVD SS and 
earns an RSV of 12.5 BCF, and you later drill a qualified original deep 
well to 17,000 feet TVD SS, the RSV for your lease remains at 12.5 BCF 
and does not increase to 15 BCF. However, under paragraph (c) of Sec. 
203.41, if you subsequently drill a qualified deep well to a depth of 
18,000 feet or greater TVD SS, you may earn an additional RSV.

Sec. 203.43  To which production do I apply the RSV earned from 

qualified deep wells or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep wells on my lease?

    (a) You must apply the RSV prescribed in Sec. 203.41(b) and (c) to 
gas volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 3, 2004, 
reported on the OGOR-A for your lease under Sec. 216.53, as and to the 
extent prescribed in Sec. Sec. 203.43 and 203.48.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all gas 
production from qualified wells reported on the OGOR-A, including 
production that is not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSV.
    (2) Production to which an RSS applies under Sec. Sec. 203.45 and 
203.46 does not count toward the lease RSV.
    (b) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well 
or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when no part of the lease is within 
an MMS-approved unit. Subject to the price conditions in Sec. 203.48, 
you must apply the RSV prescribed in Sec. 203.41 as required under the 
following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring 
on and after the later of:
    (i) May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well or 
qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or 
partly in water less than 200 meters deep;
    (ii) May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a 
lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or
    (iii) The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease 
the RSV begins production (other than test production).
    (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified 
wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met 
the requirements in Sec. 203.35 or Sec. 203.44.

    Example 1: On a lease in water less than 200 meters deep, you began 
drilling an original deep well with a perforated interval the top of 
which is 18,200 feet TVD SS in September 2003, that became a qualified 
deep well in July 2004, when it began producing and using the RSV that 
it earned. You subsequently drill another original deep well with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 16,600 feet TVD SS, which 
becomes a qualified deep well when production begins in August 2008. The 
first well earned an RSV of 25 BCF (see Sec. 203.41(a)(1) and (b)(3)). 
You must apply any remaining RSV each month beginning in August 2008 to 
production from both wells until the 25 BCF RSV is fully utilized 
according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the second well had 
begun production in August 2009, it would not be a qualified deep well 
because it started production after expiration in May 2009 of the 
ability to qualify for royalty relief in this water depth, and could not 
share any of the remaining RSV (see definition of a qualified deep well 
in Sec. 203.0).
    Example 2: On a lease in water between 200 and 400 meters deep, you 
begin drilling an original deep well with a perforated interval the top 
of which is 17,100 feet TVD SS in November 2010 that becomes a qualified 
deep well in June 2011 when it begins producing and using the RSV. You 
subsequently drill another original deep well with a perforated interval 
the top of which is 15,300 feet TVD SS which becomes a qualified deep 
well by beginning production in October 2011 (see definition of a 
qualified deep well in Sec. 203.0). Only the first well earns an RSV 
equal to 15 BCF (see Sec. 203.41(a) and (b)). You must apply any 
remaining RSV each month beginning in October 2011 to production from 
both qualified deep wells until the 15 BCF RSV is fully utilized 
according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (c) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well 
or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when all or part of the lease is 
within an MMS-approved unit. Under the unit

[[Page 24]]

agreement, a share of the production from all the qualified wells in the 
unit participating area would be allocated to your lease each month 
according to the participating area percentages. Subject to the price 
conditions in Sec. 203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed under 
Sec. 203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring 
on and after the later of:
    (i) May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified well or qualified 
phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in 
water less than 200 meters deep;
    (ii) May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a 
lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or
    (iii) The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease 
the RSV begins production (other than test production).
    (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production:
    (i) From all qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, 
regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in 
Sec. 203.35 or Sec. 203.44; and,
    (ii) Allocated to your lease under an MMS-approved unit agreement 
from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on unitized 
areas of other leases in the unit, regardless of their depth, for which 
the requirements in Sec. 203.35 or Sec. 203.44 have been met.
    (3) The allocated share under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section 
does not increase the RSV for your lease. None of the volumes produced 
from a well that is not within a unit participating area may be 
allocated to other leases in the unit.

    Example: The east half of your lease A is unitized with all of lease 
B. There is one qualified 19,000-foot TVD SS deep well on the non-
unitized portion of lease A, one qualified 18,500-foot TVD SS deep well 
on the unitized portion of lease A, and a qualified 19,400-foot TVD SS 
deep well on lease B. The participating area percentages allocate 32 
percent of production from both of the unit qualified deep wells to 
lease A and 68 percent to lease B. If the non-unitized qualified deep 
well on lease A produces 12 BCF and the unitized qualified deep well on 
lease A produces 15 BCF, and the qualified deep well on lease B produces 
10 BCF, then the production volume from and allocated to lease A to 
which the lease an RSV applies is 20 BCF [12 + (15 + 10) * (0.32)]. The 
production volume allocated to lease B to which the lease B RSV applies 
is 17 BCF [(15 + 10) * (0.68)].

    (d) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production 
of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your 
lease under paragraph (c) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV 
allowed under Sec. 203.31 or Sec. 203.41. For the month in which 
cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion 
of gas production that exceeds the RSV remaining at the beginning of 
that month.
    (e) You may not apply the RSV allowed under Sec. 203.41 to:
    (1) Production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, except 
in cases where the qualified deep well is re-perforated in the same 
reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;
    (2) Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well on any 
other lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (3) Any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or
    (4) Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well that 
commenced drilling before:
    (i) March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in 
water less than 200 meters deep, or
    (ii) May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more 
than 200 meters deep.

Sec. 203.44  What administrative steps must I take to use the royalty suspension volume?

    (a) You must notify the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and 
Development in writing of your intent to begin drilling operations on 
all deep wells and phase 1 ultra-deep wells; and
    (b) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from all wells 
that would become qualified wells by satisfying the requirements of this 
section, you must:

[[Page 25]]

    (1) Provide written notification to the MMS Regional Supervisor for 
Production and Development that production has begun; and
    (2) Request confirmation of the size of the royalty suspension 
volume earned by your lease.
    (c) Before beginning production, you must meet any production 
measurement requirements that the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production 
and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, 
subpart L.
    (d) You must provide the information in paragraph (b) of this 
section by January 20, 2009 if you produced before December 18, 2008 
from a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a 
lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters and less 
than 400 meters deep.
    (e) The MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and Development may 
extend the deadline for beginning production for up to one year for a 
well that cannot begin production before the applicable date prescribed 
in the definition of ``qualified deep well'' in Sec. 203.0 if it meets 
all of the following criteria.
    (1) The well otherwise meets the criteria in the definition of a 
qualified deep well in Sec. 203.0.
    (2) The delay in production occurred after reaching total depth in 
the well.
    (3) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin 
from the well before the applicable deadline in the definition of a 
qualified deep well in Sec. 203.0. You must provide a credible activity 
schedule with supporting documentation.
    (4) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your 
control, such as adverse weather and accidents which MMS deems were 
unavoidable.

<R05>
Sec. 203.45  If I drill a certified unsuccessful well, what royalty relief 

will my lease earn?

    Your lease may earn a royalty suspension supplement. Subject to 
paragraph (d) of this section, the royalty suspension supplement is in 
addition to any royalty suspension volume your lease may earn under 
Sec. 203.41.
    (a) If you drill a certified unsuccessful well and you satisfy the 
administrative requirements of Sec. 203.47, subject to the price 
conditions in Sec. 203.48, your lease earns an RSS shown in the 
following table. The RSS is shown in billions of cubic feet of gas 
equivalent (BCFE) or in thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent (MCFE) 
and is applicable to oil and gas production as prescribed in Sec. 
204.46.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you have a certified unsuccessful well        Then your lease earns an RSS on this volume of oil and gas
                   that is:                       production as prescribed in this section and Sec.  203.46:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) An original well and your lease has not    5 BCFE.
 produced gas or oil from a deep well or an
 ultra-deep well,
(2) A sidetrack (with a sidetrack measured     0.8 BCFE plus 120 MCFE times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to
 depth of at least 10,000 feet) and your        the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 5 BCFE.
 lease has not produced gas or oil from a
 deep well or an ultra-deep well,
(3) An original well or a sidetrack (with a    2 BCFE.
 sidetrack measured depth of at least 10,000
 feet) and your lease has produced gas or oil
 from a deep well with a perforated interval
 the top of which is from 15,000 to less than
 18,000 feet TVD SS,
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) This paragraph applies to oil and gas volumes you report on the 
OGOR-A for your lease under Sec. 216.53.
    (1) You must apply the RSS prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, in accordance with the requirements in Sec. 203.46, to all oil 
and gas produced from the lease:
    (i) On or after December 18, 2008, if your lease is located in water 
more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep; or
    (ii) On or after May 3, 2004, if your lease is located in water 
partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep.
    (2) Production to which an RSV applies under Sec. Sec. 203.31 
through 203.33 and Sec. Sec. 203.41 through 203.43 does not count 
toward the lease RSS. All other production, including production that is

[[Page 26]]

not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSS.

    Example 1: If you drill a certified unsuccessful well that is an 
original well to a target 19,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns an RSS of 
5 BCFE that would be applied to gas and oil production if your lease has 
not previously produced from a deep well or an ultra-deep well, or you 
earn an RSS of 2 BCFE of gas and oil production if your lease has 
previously produced from a deep well with a perforated interval from 
15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS, as prescribed in Sec. 203.46.
    Example 2: If you drill a certified unsuccessful well that is a 
sidetrack that reaches a target 19,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack 
measured depth of 12,545 feet, and your lease has not produced gas or 
oil from any deep well or ultra-deep well, MMS rounds the sidetrack 
measured depth to 12,500 feet and your lease earns an RSS of 2.3 BCFE of 
gas and oil production as prescribed in Sec. 203.45.

    (c) The conversion from oil to gas for using the royalty suspension 
supplement is specified in Sec. 203.73.
    (d) Each lease is eligible for up to two royalty suspension 
supplements. Therefore, the total royalty suspension supplement for a 
lease cannot exceed 10 BCFE.
    (1) You may not earn more than one royalty suspension supplement 
from a single wellbore.
    (2) If you begin drilling a certified unsuccessful well on one lease 
but the completion target is on a second lease, the entire royalty 
suspension supplement belongs to the second lease. However, if the 
target straddles a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well 
is located earns the royalty suspension supplement.
    (e) If the same wellbore that earns an RSS as a certified 
unsuccessful well later produces from a perforated interval the top of 
which is 15,000 feet TVD or deeper and becomes a qualified well, it will 
be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Beginning on the date production starts, you must stop applying 
the royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore to your lease 
production.
    (2) If the completion of this qualified well is on your lease or, in 
the case of a directional well, is on another lease, then you must 
subtract from the royalty suspension volume earned by that qualified 
well the royalty suspension supplement amounts earned by that wellbore 
that have already been applied either on your lease or any other lease. 
The difference represents the royalty suspension volume earned by the 
qualified well.
    (f) If the same wellbore that earned a royalty suspension supplement 
later has a sidetrack drilled from that wellbore, you are not required 
to subtract any royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore 
from the royalty suspension volume that may be earned by the sidetrack.
    (g) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your 
lease terms notwithstanding any royalty suspension supplements under 
this section.

Sec. 203.46  To which production do I apply the royalty suspension 

supplements from drilling one or two certified unsuccessful wells on my lease?

    (a) Subject to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 203.40, 203.43, 
203.45, 203.47, and 203.48, you must apply an RSS in Sec. 203.45 to the 
earliest oil and gas production:
    (1) Occurring on and after the day you file the information under 
Sec. 204.47(b),
    (2) From, or allocated under an MMS-approved unit agreement to, the 
lease on which the certified unsuccessful well was drilled, without 
regard to the drilling depth of the well producing the gas or oil.
    (b) If you have a royalty suspension volume for the lease under 
Sec. 203.41, you must use the royalty suspension volumes for gas 
produced from qualified wells on the lease before using royalty 
suspension supplements for gas produced from qualified wells.

    Example to paragraph (b): You have two shallow oil wells on your 
lease. Then you drill a certified unsuccessful well and earn a royalty 
suspension supplement of 5 BCFE. Thereafter, you begin production from 
an original well that is a qualified well that earns a royalty 
suspension volume of 15 BCF. You use only 2 BCFE of the royalty 
suspension supplement before the oil wells deplete. You must use up the 
15 BCF of royalty suspension volume before you use the remaining

[[Page 27]]

3 BCFE of the royalty suspension supplement for gas produced from the 
qualified well.

    (c) If you have no current production on which to apply the RSS 
allowed under Sec. 203.45, your RSS applies to the earliest subsequent 
production of gas and oil from, or allocated under an MMS-approved unit 
agreement to, your lease.
    (d) Unused royalty suspension supplements transfer to a successor 
lessee and expire with the lease.
    (e) You may not apply the RSS allowed under Sec. 203.45 to 
production from any other lease, except for production allocated to your 
lease from an MMS-approved unit agreement. If your certified 
unsuccessful well is on a lease subject to an MMS-approved unit 
agreement, the lessees of other leases in the unit may not apply any 
portion of the RSS for your lease to production from the other leases in 
the unit.
    (f) You must begin or resume paying royalties when cumulative gas 
and oil production from, or allocated under an MMS-approved unit 
agreement to, your lease (excluding any gas produced from qualified 
wells subject to a royalty suspension volume allowed under Sec. 203.41) 
reaches the applicable royalty suspension supplement. For the month in 
which the cumulative production reaches this royalty suspension 
supplement, you owe royalties on the portion of gas or oil production 
that exceeds the amount of the royalty suspension supplement remaining 
at the beginning of that month.

Sec. 203.47  What administrative steps do I take to obtain and use the royalty 

suspension supplement?

    (a) Before you start drilling a well on your lease targeted to a 
reservoir at least 18,000 feet TVD SS, you must notify, in writing, the 
MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and Development of your intent to 
begin drilling operations and the depth of the target.
    (b) After drilling the well, you must provide the MMS Regional 
Supervisor for Production and Development within 60 days after reaching 
the total depth in your well:
    (1) Information that allows MMS to confirm that you drilled a 
certified unsuccessful well as defined under Sec. 203.0, including:
    (i) Well log data, if your original well or sidetrack does not meet 
the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 250, subpart A; or
    (ii) Well log, well test, seismic, and economic data, if your well 
does meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 250, subpart A; 
and
    (2) Information that allows MMS to confirm the size of the royalty 
suspension supplement for a sidetrack, including sidetrack measured 
depth and supporting documentation.
    (c) If you commenced drilling a well that otherwise meets the 
criteria for a certified unsuccessful well on a lease located entirely 
in more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters of water on or 
after May 18, 2007, and finished it before December 18, 2008, you must

Sec. 203.49  May I substitute the deep gas drilling provisions in 

Sec. 203.0 and Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.47 for the deep gas royalty relief provided in 
          my lease terms?

    (a) You may exercise an option to replace the applicable lease terms 
for royalty relief related to deep-well drilling with those in Sec. 
203.0 and Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.48 if you have a lease issued 
with royalty relief provisions for deep-well drilling. Such leases:
    (1) Must be issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after January 
1, 2001, and before April 1, 2004; and
    (2) Must be located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West 
longitude in the GOM entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters 
deep.
    (b) To exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this section, you 
must notify, in writing, the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and 
Development of your decision before September 1, 2004 or 180 days after 
your lease is issued, whichever is later, and specify the lease and 
block number.
    (c) Once you exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this 
section, you are subject to all the activity, timing, and administrative 
requirements pertaining to deep gas royalty relief as specified in 
Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.48.
    (d) Exercising the option under paragraph (a) of this section is 
irrevocable. If you do not exercise this option, then the terms of your 
lease apply.

                  Royalty Relief for End-of-life Leases


<R05>
Sec. 203.50  Who may apply for end-of-life royalty relief?

    You may apply for royalty relief in two situations.
    (a) Your end-of-life lease (as defined in Sec. 203.2) is an oil and 
gas lease and has average daily production of at least 100 barrels of 
oil equivalent (BOE) per month (as calculated in Sec. 203.73) in at 
least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are 
considered the qualifying months. These 12 months should reflect the 
basic operation you intend to use until your resources are depleted. If 
you changed your operation significantly (e.g., begin re-injecting 
rather than recovering gas) during the qualifying months, or if you do 
so while we are processing your application, we may defer action on your 
application until you revise it to show the new circumstances.
    (b) Your end-of-life lease is other than an oil and gas lease (e.g., 
sulphur) and has production in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The 
most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998, as amended at 63 FR 57249, Oct. 27, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 203.51  How do I apply for end-of-life royalty relief?

    You must submit a complete application and the required fee to the 
appropriate MMS Regional Director. Your MMS regional office will provide 
specific guidance on the report formats. A

[[Page 29]]

complete application for relief includes:
    (a) An administrative information report (specified in Sec. 203.83) 
and
    (b) A net revenue and relief justification report (specified in 
Sec. 203.84).


<R05>
Sec. 203.52  What criteria must I meet to get relief?

    (a) To qualify for relief, you must demonstrate that the sum of 
royalty payments over the 12 qualifying months exceeds 75 percent of the 
sum of net revenues (before-royalty revenues minus allowable costs, as 
defined in Sec. 203.84).
    (b) To re-qualify for relief, e.g., either applying for additional 
relief on top of relief already granted, or applying for relief sometime 
after your earlier agreement terminated, you must demonstrate that:
    (1) You have met the criterion listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, and
    (2) The 12 required qualifying months of operation have occurred 
under the current royalty arrangement.


<R05>
Sec. 203.53  What relief will MMS grant?

    (a) If we approve your application and you meet certain conditions, 
we will reduce the pre-application effective royalty rate by one-half on 
production up to the relief volume amount. If you produce more than the 
relief volume amount:
    (1) We will impose a royalty rate equal to 1.5 times the effective 
royalty rate on your additional production up to twice the relief volume 
amount; and
    (2) We will impose a royalty rate equal to the effective rate on all 
production greater than twice the relief volume amount.
    (b) Regardless of the level of production or prices (see Sec. 
203.54), royalty payments due under end-of-life relief will not exceed 
the royalty obligations that would have been due at the effective 
royalty rate.
    (1) The effective royalty rate is the average lease rate paid on 
production during the 12 qualifying months.
    (2) The relief volume amount is the average monthly BOE production 
for the 12 qualifying months.


<R05>
Sec. 203.54  How does my relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease operate if prices rise sharply?

    In those months when your current reference price rises by at least 
25 percent above your base reference price, you must pay the effective 
royalty rate on all monthly production.
    (a) Your current reference price is a weighted average of daily 
closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas 
over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
    (b) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing 
prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas during the 
qualifying months; and
    (c) Your weighting factors are the proportions of your total 
production volume (in BOE) provided by oil and gas during the qualifying 
months.


<R05>
Sec. 203.55  Under what conditions can my end-of-life royalty relief

arrangement for an oil and gas lease be ended?

    (a) If you have an end-of-life royalty relief arrangement, you may 
renounce it at any time. The lease rate will return to the effective 
rate during the qualifying period in the first full month following our 
receipt of your renouncement of the relief arrangement.
    (b) If you pay the effective lease rate for 12 consecutive months, 
we will terminate your relief. The lease rate will return to the 
effective rate in the first full month following this termination.
    (c) We may stipulate in the letter of approval for individual cases 
certain events that would cause us to terminate relief because they are 
inconsistent with an end-of-life situation.


<R05>
Sec. 203.56  Does relief transfer when a lease is assigned?

    Yes. Royalty relief is based on the lease circumstances, not 
ownership. It transfers upon lease assignment.

  Royalty Relief for Pre-Act Deep Water Leases and for Development and 
                           Expansion Projects


<R05>
Sec. 203.60  Who may apply for royalty relief on a 

case-by-case basis in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico or offshore of Alaska?

    You may apply for royalty relief under Sec. Sec. 203.61(b) and 
203.62 for an individual lease, unit or project if you:
    (a) Hold a pre-Act lease (as defined in Sec. 203.0) that we have 
assigned to an authorized field (as defined in Sec. 203.0);
    (b) Propose an expansion project (as defined in Sec. 203.0); or
    (c) Propose a development project (as defined in Sec. 203.0).

[73 FR 69515, Nov. 18, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 203.61  How do I assess my chances for getting relief?

    You may ask for a nonbinding assessment (a formal opinion on whether 
a field would qualify for royalty relief) before turning in your first 
complete application on an authorized field. This field must have a 
qualifying well under 30 CFR part 250, subpart A, or be on a lease that 
has allocated production under an approved unit agreement.
    (a) To request a nonbinding assessment, you must:
    (1) Submit a draft application in the format and detail specified in 
guidance from the MMS regional office for the GOM;
    (2) Propose to drill at least one more appraisal well if you get a 
favorable assessment; and
    (3) Pay a fee under Sec. 203.3.
    (b) You must wait at least 90 days after receiving our assessment to 
apply for relief under Sec. 203.62.
    (c) This assessment is not binding because a complete application 
may contain more accurate information that does not support our original 
assessment. It will help you decide whether your proposed inputs for 
evaluating economic viability and your supporting data and assumptions 
are adequate.


<R05>
Sec. 203.62  How do I apply for relief?

    (a) You must send a complete application and the required fee to the 
MMS Regional Director for your region.
    (b) Your application for royalty relief offshore Alaska or in deep 
water in the GOM must include an original and two copies (one set of 
digital information) of:
    (1) Administrative information report;
    (2) Economic Viability and relief justification report;
    (3) G&G report;
    (4) Engineering report;
    (5) Production report; and
    (6) Cost report.
    (c) Section 203.82 explains why we are authorized to require these 
reports.
    (d) Sections 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89 describe what 
these reports must include. The MMS regional office for your region will 
guide you on the format for the required reports, and we encourage you 
to contact this office before preparing your application for this 
guidance.

[73 FR 69515, Nov. 18, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 203.63  Does my application have to include all leases in the field?

    (a) For authorized fields, we will accept only one joint application 
for all leases that are part of the designated field on the date of 
application, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and 
Sec. 203.64. However, we will evaluate all acreage that may eventually 
become part of the authorized field. Therefore, if you have any other 
leases that you believe may eventually be part of the authorized field, 
you must submit data for these leases according to Sec. 203.81.
    (1) The Regional Director maintains a Field Names Master List with 
updates of all leases in each designated field.
    (2) To avoid sharing proprietary data with other lessees on the 
field, you may submit your proprietary G&G report separately from the 
rest of your application. Your application is not complete until we 
receive all the required information for each lease on the field. We 
will not disclose proprietary data when explaining our assumptions and 
reasons for our determinations under Sec. 203.67.
    (3) We will not require a joint application if you show good cause 
and honest effort to get all lessees in the field to participate. If you 
must exclude a lease from your application because its lessee will not 
participate, that lease is

[[Page 31]]

ineligible for the royalty relief for the designated field.
    (b) If your application seeks only relief for a development project 
or an expansion project, your application does not have to include all 
leases in the field.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 1875, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.64  How many applications may I file on a field or a development project?

    You may file one complete application for royalty relief during the 
life of the field or for a development project or an expansion project 
designed to produce a reservoir or set of reservoirs. However, you may 
send another application if:
    (a) You are eligible to apply for a redetermination under Sec. 
203.74;
    (b) You apply for royalty relief for an expansion project;
    (c) You withdraw the application before we make a determination; or
    (d) You apply for end-of-life royalty relief.

<R05>
Sec. 203.65  How long will MMS take to evaluate my application?

    (a) We will determine within 20 working days if your application for 
royalty relief is complete. If your application is incomplete, we will 
explain in writing what it needs. If you withdraw a complete 
application, you may reapply.
    (b) We will evaluate your first application on a field within 180 
days, evaluate your first application on a development project or an 
expansion project within 150 days and evaluate a redetermination under 
Sec. 203.75 within 120 days after we determine that it is complete.

<R05>
Sec. 203.69  If my application is approved, what royalty relief will I receive?

    If we approve your application, subject to certain conditions, we 
will not collect royalties on a specified suspension volume for your 
field, development project, or expansion project. Suspension volumes 
include volumes allocated to a lease under an approved unit agreement, 
but exclude any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-
bearing under the lease or the regulations of this chapter (e.g., fuel 
gas).
    (a) For authorized fields, the minimum royalty-suspension volumes 
are:
    (1) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) for fields in 200 
to 400 meters of water;
    (2) 52.5 MMBOE for fields in 400 to 800 meters of water; and
    (3) 87.5 MMBOE for fields in more than 800 meters of water.
    (b) For development projects, any relief we grant applies only to 
project wells and replaces the royalty relief, if any, with which we 
issued your lease.
    (c) If your project is economic given the royalty relief with which 
we issued your lease, we will reject the application.
    (d) If the lease has earned or may earn deep gas royalty relief 
under Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.49 or ultra-deep gas royalty relief 
under Sec. Sec. 203.30 through 203.36, we will take the deep gas 
royalty relief or ultra-deep gas royalty relief into account in 
determining whether further royalty relief for a development project is 
necessary for production to be economic.
    (e) If neither paragraph (c) nor (d) of this section apply, the 
minimum royalty

suspension volumes are as shown in the following table:

    (f) If your application includes pre-Act leases in different 
categories of water depth, we apply the minimum royalty suspension 
volume for the deepest such lease then assigned to the field. We base 
the water depth and makeup of a field on the water-depth delineations in 
the ``Lease Terms and Economic Conditions'' map and the ``Fields 
Directory'' documents and updates in effect at the time your application 
is deemed complete. These publications are available from the MMS Gulf 
of Mexico Regional Office.
    (g) You will get a royalty suspension volume above the minimum if we 
determine that you need more to make the field or development project 
economic.
    (h) For expansion projects, the minimum royalty suspension volume 
equals 10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable 
resources upon which we based approval of your application from all 
reservoirs included in your project plus any suspension volumes required 
under Sec. 203.66. If we determine that your expansion project may be 
economic only with more relief, we will determine and grant you the 
royalty suspension volume necessary to make the project economic.
    (i) The royalty suspension volume applicable to specific leases will 
continue through the end of the month in which cumulative production 
reaches that volume. You must calculate cumulative production from all 
the leases in the authorized field or project that are entitled to share 
the royalty suspension volume.

Sec. 203.71  How does MMS allocate a field's suspension volume between

my lease and other leases on my field?

    The allocation depends on when production occurs, when we issued the 
lease, when we assigned it to the field, and whether we award the volume 
suspension by an approved application or establish it in the lease 
terms, as prescribed in this section.
    (a) If your authorized field has an approved royalty suspension 
volume under Sec. Sec. 203.67 and 203.69, we will suspend payment of 
royalties on production from all leases in the field that participate in 
the application until their cumulative production equals the approved 
volume. The following conditions also apply:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) When a project has more than one lease, the royalty suspension 
volume for each lease equals that lease's actual production from the 
project (or production allocated under an approved unit agreement) until 
total production for all leases in the project equals the project's 
approved royalty suspension volume.
    (c) You may receive a royalty-suspension volume only if your entire 
lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. If the field 
lies on both sides of this meridian, only leases located entirely west 
of the meridian will receive a royalty-suspension volume.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 1877, Jan. 15, 2002; 73 
FR 58472, Oct. 7, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 203.72  Can my lease receive more than one suspension volume?

    Yes. You may apply for royalty relief that involves more than one 
suspension volume under Sec. 203.62 in two circumstances.
    (a) Each field that includes your lease may receive a separate 
royalty-suspension volume, if it meets the evaluation criteria of Sec. 
203.67.
    (b) An expansion project on your lease may receive a separate 
royalty-suspension volume, even if we have already granted a royalty-
suspension volume to the field that encompasses the project. But the 
reserves associated with the project must not have been part of our 
original determination, and the project must meet the evaluation 
criteria of Sec. 203.67.


<R05>
Sec. 203.73  How do suspension volumes apply to natural gas?

    You must measure natural gas production under the royalty-suspension 
volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured in 
accordance with 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil 
equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 203.74  When will MMS reconsider its determination?

    You may request a redetermination after we withdraw approval or 
after you renounce royalty relief, unless we withdraw approval due to 
your providing false or intentionally inaccurate information. Under 
certain conditions you may also request a redetermination if we deny 
your application or if you want your approved royalty suspension volume 
to change. In these instances, to be eligible for a redetermination, at 
least one of the following four conditions must occur.
    (a) You have significant new G&G data and you previously have not 
either requested a redetermination or reapplied for relief after we 
withdrew approval or you relinquished royalty relief. ``Significant'' 
means that the new G&G data:
    (1) Results from drilling new wells or getting new three-dimensional 
seismic data and information (but not reinterpreting old data);
    (2) Did not exist at the time of the earlier application; and
    (3) Changes your estimates of gross resource size, quality, or 
projected flow rates enough to materially affect the results of our 
earlier determination.
    (b) You demonstrate in your new application that the technology that 
most efficiently develops this field or lease was not considered or 
deemed feasible in the original application. Your newly proposed 
technology must improve the profitability, under equivalent market 
conditions, of the field or lease relative to the development system 
proposed in the prior application.

[[Page 36]]

    (c) Your current reference price decreases by more than 25 percent 
from your base reference price as calculated under this paragraph.
    (1) Your current reference price is a weighted-average of daily 
closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas 
over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
    (2) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing 
prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas for the 
full 12 calendar months preceding the date of your most recently 
approved application for this royalty relief; and
    (3) The weighting factors are the proportions of the total 
production volume (in BOE) for oil and gas associated with the most 
likely scenario (identified in Sec. Sec. 203.85 and 203.88) from your 
most recently approved application for this royalty relief.
    (d) Before starting to build your development and production system, 
you have revised your estimated development costs, and they are more 
than 120 percent of the eligible development costs associated with the 
most likely scenario from your most recently approved application for 
this royalty relief.

FR 1878, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.75  What risk do I run if I request a redetermination?

    If you request a redetermination after we have granted you a 
suspension volume, you could lose some or all of the previously granted 
relief. This can happen because you must file a new complete application 
and pay the required fee, as discussed in Sec. 203.62. We will evaluate 
your application under Sec. 203.67 using the conditions prevailing at 
the time of your redetermination request. In our evaluation, we may find 
that you should receive a larger, equivalent, smaller, or no suspension 
volume. This means we could find that you do not qualify for the amount 
of relief previously granted or for any relief at all.


<R05>
Sec. 203.76  When might MMS withdraw or reduce the approved size of my relief?

    We will withdraw approval of relief for any of the following 
reasons.
    (a) You change the type of development system proposed in your 
application (e.g., change from a fixed platform to floating production 
system, or from an independent development and production system to one 
with subsea wells tied back to a host production facility, etc.).
    (b) You do not start building the proposed development and 
production system within18 months of the date we approved your 
application, unless the MMS Director grants you an extension under Sec. 
203.79(c). If you start building the proposed system and then suspend 
its construction before completion, and you do not restart continuous 
building of the proposed system within 18 months of our approval, we 
will withdraw the relief we granted.
    (c) Your actual development costs are less than 80 percent of the 
eligible development costs estimated in your application's most likely 
scenario, and you do not report that fact in your post-production 
development report (Sec. 203.70). Development costs are those 
expenditures defined in Sec. 203.89(b) incurred between the application 
submission date and start of production. If you report this fact in the 
post-production development report, you may retain the lesser of 50 
percent of the original royalty suspension volume or 50 percent of the 
median of the distribution of the potentially recoverable resources 
anticipated in your application.
    (d) We granted you a royalty-suspension volume after you qualified 
for a redetermination under Sec. 203.74(c), and we find out your actual 
development costs are less than 90 percent of the eligible development 
costs associated with your application's most likely scenario. 
Development costs are those expenditures defined in Sec. 203.89(b) 
incurred between your application submission date and start of 
production.
    (e) You do not send us the fabrication confirmation report or the 
post-production development report, or you provide false or 
intentionally inaccurate information that was material to our

[[Page 37]]

granting royalty relief under this section. You must pay royalties and 
late-payment interest determined under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and Sec. 218.54 
of this chapter on all volumes for which you used the royalty 
suspension. You also may be subject to penalties under other provisions 
of law.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 1878, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.77  May I voluntarily give up relief if conditions change?

    Yes, you may voluntarily give up relief by sending a letter to that 
effect to the MMS Regional office for your region.

[73 FR 69516, Nov. 18, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 203.78  Do I keep relief approved by MMS under 

Sec. Sec. 203.60-203.77 for my lease, unit or project if prices rise significantly?

    If prices rise above a base price threshold for light sweet crude 
oil or natural gas, you must pay full royalties on production otherwise 
subject to royalty relief approved by MMS under Sec. Sec. 203.60-203.77 
for your lease, unit or project as prescribed in this section.
    (a) The following table shows the base price threshold for various 
types of leases, subject to paragraph (b) of this section. Note that, 
for post-November 2000 deepwater leases in the GOM, price thresholds 
apply on a lease basis, so different leases on the same development 
project or expansion project approved for royalty relief may have 
different price thresholds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  For . . .                                    The base price threshold is . . .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Pre-Act leases in the GOM,                 set by statute.
(2) Post-November 2000 deep water leases in    indicated in your original lease agreement or, if none, those in
 the GOM or leases offshore of Alaska for       the Notice of Sale under which your lease was issued.
 which the lease or Notice of Sale set a base
 price threshold,
(3) Post-November 2000 deep water leases in    the threshold set by statute for pre-Act leases.
 the GOM or leases offshore of Alaska for
 which the lease or Notice of Sale did not
 set a base price threshold,
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) An exception may occur if we determine that the price thresholds 
in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) mean the royalty suspension volume set 
under Sec. 203.69 and in lease terms would provide inadequate 
encouragement to increase production or development, in which 
circumstance we could specify a different set of price thresholds on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (c) Suppose your base oil price threshold set under paragraph (a) is 
$28.00 per barrel, and the daily closing NYMEX light sweet crude oil 
prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $28.00 per barrel, as 
adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section. In this case, we retract the 
royalty relief authorized in this subpart and you must:
    (1) Pay royalties on all oil production for the previous year at the 
lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 
Sec. 218.54 of this chapter) by March 31 of the current calendar year, 
and
    (2) Pay royalties on all your oil production in the current year.
    (d) Suppose your base gas price threshold set under paragraph (a) is 
$3.50 per million British thermal units (Btu), and the daily closing 
NYMEX light sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year 
exceeds $3.50 per million Btu, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this 
section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in this 
subpart and you must:
    (1) Pay royalties on all gas production for the previous year at the 
lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 
Sec. 218.54 of this chapter) by March 31 of the current calendar year, 
and
    (2) Pay royalties on all your gas production in the current year.
    (e) Production under both paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section 
counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume.
    (f) You are entitled to a refund or credit, with interest, of 
royalties paid on any production (that counts as part of the royalty-
suspension volume):
    (1) Of oil if the arithmetic average of the closing prices for the 
current calendar year is $28.00 per barrel or less,

[[Page 38]]

as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section, and
    (2) Of gas if the arithmetic average of the closing natural gas 
prices for the current calendar year is $3.50 per million Btu or less, 
as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g) You must follow our regulations in part 230 of this chapter for 
receiving refunds or credits.
    (h) We change the prices referred to in paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) 
of this section periodically. For pre-Act leases, these prices change 
during each calendar year after 1994 by the percentage that the implicit 
price deflator for the gross domestic product changed during the 
preceding calendar year. For post-November 2000 deepwater leases, these 
prices change as indicated in the lease instrument or in the Notice of 
Sale under which we issued the lease.

[73 FR 69516, Nov. 18, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 203.79  How do I appeal MMS's decisions related to royalty 

relief for a deepwater lease or a development or expansion project?

    (a) Once we have designated your lease as part of a field and 
notified you and other affected operators of the designation, you can 
request reconsideration by sending the MMS Director a letter within 15 
days that also states your reasons. The MMS Director's response is the 
final agency action.
    (b) Our decisions on your application for relief from paying royalty 
under Sec. 203.67 and the royalty-suspension volumes under Sec. 203.69 
are final agency actions.
    (c) If you cannot start construction by the deadline in Sec. 
203.76(b) for reasons beyond your control (e.g., strike at the 
fabrication yard), you may request an extension up to 1 year by writing 
the MMS Director and stating your reasons. The MMS Director's response 
is the final agency action.
    (d) We will notify you of all final agency actions by certified 
mail, return receipt requested. Final agency actions are not subject to 
appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 290 and 
43 CFR part 4. They are judicially reviewable under section 10(a) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 702) only if you file an action 
within 30 days of the date you receive our decision.


<R05>
Sec. 203.80  When can I get royalty relief if I am not eligible for royalty 

relief under other sections in the subpart?

    We may grant royalty relief when it serves the statutory purposes 
summarized in Sec. 203.1 and our formal relief programs, including but 
not limited to the applicable levels of the royalty suspension volumes 
and price thresholds, provide inadequate encouragement to promote 
development or increase production. Unless your lease lies offshore of 
Alaska or wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the 
GOM, your lease must be producing to qualify for relief. Before you may 
apply for royalty relief apart from our programs for end-of-life leases 
or for pre-Act deep water leases and development and expansion projects, 
we must agree that your lease or project has two or more of the 
following characteristics:
    (a) The lease has produced for a substantial period and the lessee 
can recover significant additional resources. Significant additional 
resources means enough to allow production for at least a year more than 
would be profitable without royalty relief.
    (b) Valuable facilities (e.g., a platform or pipeline that would be 
removed upon lease relinquishment) exist that we do not expect a 
successor lessee to use. If the facilities are located off the lease, 
their preservation must depend on continued production from the lease 
applying for royalty relief. We will only consider an allocable share of 
costs for off-lease facilities in the relief application.
    (c) A substantial risk exists that no new lessee will recover the 
resources.
    (d) The lessee made major efforts to reduce operating costs too 
recently to use the formal program for royalty relief (e.g., recent 
significant change in operations).
    (e) Circumstances beyond the lessee's control, other than water 
depth, preclude reliance on one of the existing royalty relief programs.

Sec. 203.82  What is MMS's authority to collect this information?

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information 
collection requirements in part 203 under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and 
assigned OMB control number 1010-0071.
    (a) We use the information to determine whether royalty relief will 
result in production that wouldn't otherwise occur. We rely largely on 
your information to make these determinations.
    (1) Your application for royalty relief must contain enough 
information on finances, economics, reservoirs, G&G characteristics, 
production, and engineering estimates for us to determine whether:
    (i) We should grant relief under the law, and
    (ii) The requested relief will ultimately recover more resources and 
return a reasonable profit on project investments.
    (2) Your fabricator confirmation and post-production development 
reports must contain enough information for us to verify that your 
application reasonably represented your plans.
    (b) Applicants (respondents) are Federal OCS oil and gas lessees. 
Applications are required to obtain or retain a benefit. Therefore, if 
you apply for royalty relief, you must provide this information. We will 
protect information considered proprietary under applicable law and 
under regulations at Sec. 203.63(b) and part 250 of this chapter.

[[Page 40]]

    (c) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires us to inform you 
that we may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond 
to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    (d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of 
information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Minerals 
Management Service, Mail Stop 5438, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC

thickness;
    (4) Most likely values for porosity, salt water saturation, volume 
factor for oil formation, and volume factor for gas formation;
    (5) Distributions or point estimates (accompanied by explanations of 
why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for

aggregated distribution. The range at the low end of the distribution 
will be associated with the conservative development and production 
scenario; the middle range will be related to the most likely 
development and production scenario; and, the high end range will be 
consistent with the optimistic development and production scenario.

producing State as of December 20, 2006; and
    (2) Not more than 200 nautical miles from the geographic center of 
any leased tract.
    Coastline means the line of ordinary low water along that portion of 
the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line 
marking the seaward limit of inland waters. This is the same definition 
used in section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301).
    Distance means the minimum great circle distance.
    Eastern Planning Area means the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area 
of the Outer Continental Shelf, as designated in the document entitled,

section 6 or 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for the purpose 
of drilling for, developing, and producing oil or natural gas resources.
    Military Mission Line means the north-south line at 86[deg]41[min] 
W. longitude.
    Qualified OCS revenues mean--
    (1) The term qualified OCS revenues means, in the case of each of 
fiscal years 2007 through 2016, all rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and 
other sums received by the U.S. from leases entered into on or after 
December 20, 2006, located:
    (i) In the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area; and
    (ii) In the 181 South Area.
    (iii) For applicable leased tracts intersected by the planning area 
administrative boundary line (e.g., separating the GOM Central Planning 
Area from the Eastern Planning Area), only the percent of revenues 
equivalent to the percent of surface acreage in the 181 Area in the 
Eastern Planning Area will be considered qualified OCS revenues.
    (2) Exclusions to the term qualified OCS revenues include:
    (i) Revenues from the forfeiture of a bond or other surety securing 
obligations other than royalties;
    (ii) Civil penalties;
    (iii) Royalties taken by the Secretary in-kind and not sold;
    (iv) User fees; and
    (v) Lease revenues explicitly circumscribed from GOMESA revenue 
sharing by statute or appropriations law.


<R05>
Sec. 219.412  How will the qualified OCS revenues be divided?

    For each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2016, 50 percent of the 
qualified OCS revenues will be placed in a special U.S. Treasury account 
from which 75 percent of the revenues will be disbursed to the Gulf 
producing States, and 25 percent will be disbursed to the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. Each Gulf producing State will receive at least 10 
percent of the qualified OCS revenues available for allocation to the 
Gulf producing States each fiscal year.

<R05>
Sec. 219.413  How will the coastal political subdivisions of Gulf

producing States share in the qualified OCS revenues?

    Of the revenues allocated to a Gulf producing State, 20 percent will 
be distributed to the coastal political subdivisions within that State.

[[Page 47]]


<R05>
Sec. 219.414  How will MMS determine each Gulf producing State's share of the qualified OCS revenues?

    (a) The MMS will determine the geographic centers of each applicable 
leased tract and, using the great circle distance method, will determine 
the closest distance from the geographic centers of each applicable 
leased tract to each Gulf producing State's coastline.
    (b) Based on these distances, we will calculate the qualified OCS 
revenues to be disbursed to each Gulf producing State using the 
following procedure:
    (1) For each Gulf producing State, we will calculate and total, over 
all applicable leased tracts, the mathematical inverses of the distances 
between the points on the State's coastline that are closest to the 
geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts and the geographic 
centers of the applicable leased tracts. For applicable leased tracts 
intersected by the planning area administrative boundary line, the 
geographic center used for the inverse distance determination will be 
the geographic center of the entire lease as if it were not intersected.
    (2) For each Gulf producing State, we will divide the sum of each 
State's inverse distances, from all applicable leased tracts, by the sum 
of the inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts across all 
four Gulf producing States. We will multiply the result by the amount of 
qualified OCS revenues to be shared as shown below. In the formulas, 
IAL, ILA, IMS, and ITX represent the sum of the inverses of the closest 
distances between Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and all 
applicable leased tracts, respectively.

Alabama Share = (IAL / (IAL + ILA + IMS + ITX)) x Qualified OCS Revenues
Louisiana Share = (ILA / (IAL + ILA + IMS + ITX)) x Qualified OCS 
    Revenues
Mississippi Share = (IMS / (IAL + ILA + IMS + ITX)) x Qualified OCS 
    Revenues
Texas Share = (ITX / (IAL + ILA + IMS + ITX)) x Qualified OCS Revenues

    (3) If in any fiscal year, this calculation results in less than a 
10 percent allocation of the qualified OCS revenues to any Gulf 
producing State, we will recalculate the distribution. We will allocate 
10 percent of the qualified OCS revenues to the State and recalculate 
the other States' shares of the remaining qualified OCS revenues 
omitting the State receiving the 10 percent minimum share and its 10 
percent share from the calculation.


<R05>
Sec. 219.415  How will bonus and royalty credits affect revenues allocated 

to Gulf producing States?

    If bonus and royalty credits issued under Section 104(c) of the Gulf 
of Mexico Energy Security Act are used to pay bonuses or royalties on 
leases in the 181 Area located in the Eastern Planning Area and the 181 
South Area, then there will be a corresponding reduction in qualified 
OCS revenues available for distribution.


<R05>
Sec. 219.416  How will the qualified OCS revenues be 

allocated to coastal political subdivisions within the Gulf producing States?

    The MMS will disburse funds to the coastal political subdivisions in 
accordance with the following criteria:
    (a) Twenty-five percent of the qualified OCS revenues will be 
allocated to a Gulf producing State's coastal political subdivisions in 
the proportion that each coastal political subdivision's population 
bears to the population of all coastal political subdivisions in the 
producing State;
    (b) Twenty-five percent of the qualified OCS revenues will be 
allocated to a Gulf producing State's coastal political subdivisions in 
the proportion that each coastal political subdivision's miles of 
coastline bears to the number of miles of coastline of all coastal 
political subdivisions in the producing State. Except that, for the 
State of Louisiana, proxy coastline lengths for coastal political 
subdivisions without a coastline will be considered to be \1/3\ the 
average length of the coastline of all political subdivisions within 
Louisiana having a coastline.
    (c) Fifty percent of the revenues will be allocated to a Gulf 
producing State's coastal political subdivisions in amounts that are 
inversely proportional to the respective distances between the 
geographic center of each applicable leased tract and the point in each 
coastal political subdivision that is closest to the geographic center 
of each applicable leased tract. Except that, an applicable leased tract 
will be

[[Page 48]]

excluded from this calculation if any portion of the tract is located in 
a geographic area that was subject to a leasing moratorium on January 1, 
2005, unless that tract was in production on that date.


<R05>
Sec. 219.417  How will MMS disburse qualified OCS revenues to the coastal 

political subdivisions if, during any fiscal year, there are no applicable leased 
          tracts in the 181 Area in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning 
          Area?

    If, during any fiscal year, there are no applicable leased tracts in 
the 181 Area in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, MMS will 
disburse funds to the coastal political subdivisions in accordance with 
the following criteria:
    (a) Fifty percent of the revenues will be allocated to a Gulf 
producing State's coastal political subdivisions in the proportion that 
each coastal political subdivision's population bears to the population 
of all coastal political subdivisions in the State; and
    (b) Fifty percent of the revenues will be allocated to a Gulf 
producing State's coastal political subdivisions in the proportion that 
each coastal political subdivision's miles of coastline bears to the 
number of miles of coastline of all coastal political subdivisions in 
the State. Except that, for the State of Louisiana, proxy coastline 
lengths for coastal political subdivisions without a coastline will be 
considered to be \1/3\ the average length of the coastline of all 
political subdivisions within Louisiana having a coastline.


<R05>
Sec. 219.418  When will funds be disbursed to Gulf producing States and 

eligible coastal political subdivisions?

    (a) The MMS will disburse allocated funds in the fiscal year after 
MMS collects the qualified OCS revenues. For example, MMS will disburse 
funds in fiscal year 2010 from the qualified OCS revenues collected 
during fiscal year 2009.
    (b) We intend to disburse funds on or before March 31st of the year 
following the fiscal year of qualified OCS revenues.

[[Page 72]]


<R05>
Sec. 250.143  How do I designate an operator?

    (a) You must provide the Regional Supervisor an executed Designation 
of Operator form (Form MMS-1123) unless you are the only lessee and are 
the only person conducting lease operations. When there is more than one 
lessee, each lessee must submit the Designation of Operator form and the 
Regional Supervisor must approve the designation before the designated 
operator may begin operations on the leasehold.
    (b) This designation is authority for the designated operator to act 
on your behalf and to fulfill your obligations under the Act, the lease, 
and the regulations in this part.
    (c) You, or your designated operator, must immediately provide the 
Regional Supervisor a written notification of any change of address.
    (d) If you change the designated operator on your lease, you must 
pay the service fee listed in Sec. 250.125 of this subpart with your 
request for a change in designation of operator. Should there be 
multiple lessees, all designation of operator forms must be collected by 
one lessee and submitted to MMS in a single submittal, which is subject 
to only one filing fee.

72 FR 25200, May 4, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 250.144  How do I designate a new operator when a designation of operator terminates?

    (a) When a Designation of Operator terminates, the Regional 
Supervisor must approve a new designated operator before you may 
continue operations. Each lessee must submit a new executed Designation 
of Operator form.
    (b) If your Designation of Operator is terminated, or a controversy 
develops between you and your designated operator, you and your 
designated operator must protect the lessor's interests.


<R05>
Sec. 250.145  How do I designate an agent or a local agent?

    (a) You or your designated operator may designate for the Regional 
Supervisor's approval, or the Regional Director may require you to

    (b) You or your designated operator may designate for the Regional 
Supervisor's approval a local agent empowered to receive notices and 
submit requests, applications, notices, or supplemental information.


<R05>
Sec. 250.146  Who is responsible for fulfilling leasehold obligations?

    (a) When you are not the sole lessee, you and your co-lessee(s) are 
jointly and severally responsible for fulfilling your obligations under 
the provisions of 30 CFR parts 250 through 282, unless otherwise 
provided in these regulations.
    (b) If your designated operator fails to fulfill any of your 
obligations under 30 CFR parts 250 through 282, the Regional Supervisor 
may require you or any or all of your co-lessees to fulfill those 
obligations or other operational obligations under the Act, the lease, 
or the regulations.
    (c) Whenever the regulations in 30 CFR parts 250 through 282 require 
the lessee to meet a requirement or perform an action, the lessee, 
operator (if one has been designated), and the person actually 
performing the activity to which the requirement applies are jointly and 
severally responsible for complying with the regulation.

  Naming and Identifying Facilities and Wells (Does Not Include MODUs)


<R05>
Sec. 250.150  How do I name facilities and wells in the Gulf of Mexico Region?

    (a) Assign each facility a letter designation except for those types 
of facilities identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For 
example, A, B, CA, or CB.
    (1) After a facility is installed, rename each predrilled well that 
was assigned only a number and was suspended temporarily at the mudline 
or at the surface. Use a letter and number designation. The letter used 
must be the same as that of the production facility, and the number used 
must correspond to the order in which the well was completed, not 
necessarily the number assigned when it was drilled. For example, the 
first well completed for production on Facility A would be

[[Page 73]]

renamed Well A-1, the second would be Well A-2, and so on; and
    (2) When you have more than one facility on a block, each facility 
installed, and not bridge-connected to another facility, must be named 
using a different letter in sequential order. For example, EC 222A, EC 
222B, EC 222C.
    (3) When you have more than one facility on multiple blocks in a 
local area being co-developed, each facility installed and not connected 
with a walkway to another facility should be named using a different 
letter in sequential order with the block number corresponding to the 
block on which the platform is located. For example, EC 221A, EC 222B 
and EC 223C.
    (b) In naming multiple well caissons, you must assign a letter 
designation.
    (c) In naming single well caissons, you must use certain criteria as 
follows:
    (1) For single well caissons not attached to a facility with a 
walkway, use the well designation. For example, Well No. 1;
    (2) For single well caissons attached to a facility with a walkway, 
use the same designation as the facility. For example, rename Well No.10 
as A-10; and
    (3) For single well caissons with production equipment, use a letter 
designation for the facility name and a letter plus number designation 
for the well. For example, the Well No. 1 caisson would be designated as 
Facility A, and the well would be Well A-1.


<R05>
Sec. 250.151  How do I name facilities in the Pacific Region?

    The operator assigns a name to the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 250.152  How do I name facilities in the Alaska Region?

    Facilities will be named and identified according to the Regional 
Director's directions.


<R05>
Sec. 250.153  Do I have to rename an existing facility or well?

    You do not have to rename facilities installed and wells drilled 
before January 27, 2000, unless the Regional Director requires it.


<R05>
Sec. 250.154  What identification signs must I display?

    (a) You must identify all facilities, artificial islands, and mobile 
offshore drilling units with a sign maintained in a legible condition.
    (1) You must display an identification sign that can be viewed from 
the waterline on at least one side of the platform. The sign must use at

      Primary Lease Requirements, Lease Term Extensions, and Lease 
                              Cancellations


<R05>
Sec. 250.180  What am I required to do to keep my lease term in effect?

    (a) If your lease is in its primary term:
    (1) You must submit a report to the District Manager according to 
paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section whenever production begins 
initially, whenever production ceases during the last 180 days of the 
primary term, and whenever production resumes during the last 180 days 
of the primary term.
    (2) Your lease expires at the end of its primary term unless you are 
conducting operations on your lease (see 30 CFR part 256). For purposes 
of this section, the term operations means, drilling, well-reworking, or 
production in paying quantities. The objective of the drilling or well-
reworking must be to establish production in paying quantities on the 
lease.
    (b) If you stop conducting operations during the last 180 days of 
your primary lease term, your lease will expire unless you either resume 
operations or receive an SOO or an SOP from the Regional Supervisor 
under Sec. Sec. 250.172, 250.173, 250.174, or 250.175 before the end of 
the 180th day after you stop operations.
    (c) If you extend your lease term under paragraph (b) of this 
section, you must pay rental or minimum royalty, as appropriate, for 
each year or part of the year during which your lease continues in force 
beyond the end of the primary lease term.

beyond its primary term, your lease will expire unless you resume 
operations or receive an SOO or an SOP from the Regional Supervisor 
under Sec. 250.172, 250.173, 250.174, or 250.175 before the end of the 
180th day after you stop operations.
    (e) You may ask the Regional Supervisor to allow you more than 180 
days to resume operations on a lease continued beyond its primary term 
when operating conditions warrant. The request must be in writing and 
explain the operating conditions that warrant a longer period. In 
allowing additional

[[Page 79]]

time, the Regional Supervisor must determine that the longer period is 
in the national interest, and it conserves resources, prevents waste, or 
protects correlative rights.
    (f) When you begin conducting operations on a lease that has 
continued beyond its primary term, you must immediately notify the 
District Manager either orally or by fax or e-mail and follow up with a 
written report according to paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) If your lease is continued beyond its primary term, you must 
submit a report to the District Manager under paragraphs (h) and (i) of 
this section whenever production begins initially, whenever production 
ceases, whenever production resumes before the end of the 180-day period 
after having ceased, or whenever drilling or well-reworking operations 
begin before the end of the 180-day period.
    (h) The reports required by paragraphs (a) and (g) of this section 
must contain:
    (1) Name of lessee or operator;
    (2) The well number, lease number, area, and block;
    (3) As appropriate, the unit agreement name and number; and
    (4) A description of the operation and pertinent dates.
    (i) You must submit the reports required by paragraphs (a) and (g) 
of this section within the following timeframes:
    (1) Initialization of production--within 5 days of initial 
production.
    (2) Cessation of production--within 15 days after the first full 
month of zero production.
    (3) Resumption of production--within 5 days of resuming production 
after ceasing production under paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
    (4) Drilling or well reworking operations--within 5 days of 
beginning and completing the leaseholding operations.
    (j) For leases continued beyond the primary term, you must 
immediately report to the District Manager if operations do not begin 
before the end of the 180-day period.


<R05>
Sec. 250.181  When may the Secretary cancel my lease and when am I compensated for cancellation?

    If the Secretary cancels your lease under this part or under 30 CFR

subpart B, if the Regional Supervisor determines that the proposed 
activities may cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and 
other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits, the national 
security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment, 
and that the proposed activity cannot be modified to avoid the 
condition(s). The Secretary may cancel the lease if:
    (a) The primary lease term has not expired (or if the lease term has 
been extended) and exploration has been prohibited for 5 years following 
the disapproval; or
    (b) You request cancellation at an earlier time.


<R05>
Sec. 250.183  When may MMS or the Secretary extend or cancel a lease at

sworn written statement in lieu of oral testimony.
    (b) Only panel members, and any experts the panel deems necessary, 
may address questions to any person giving testimony.
    (c) The chairperson may issue subpoenas to persons to appear and 
provide testimony or documents at a panel meeting. A subpoena may not 
require a person to attend a panel meeting held at a location more than 
100 miles from where a subpoena is served.
    (d) Any person giving testimony may request compensation for 
mileage, and fees for services, within 90 days after the panel meeting.

    (a) You must submit evacuation statistics to the Regional Supervisor 
for a natural occurrence, such as a hurricane, a tropical storm, or an 
earthquake. Statistics include facilities and rigs evacuated and the 
amount of production shut-in for gas and oil. You must:
    (1) Submit the statistics by fax or e-mail (for activities in the 
MMS GOM OCS Region, use Form MMS-132) as soon as possible when 
evacuation occurs. In lieu of submitting your statistics by fax or e-
mail, you may submit them electronically in accordance with 30 CFR 
250.186(a)(3);
    (2) Submit the statistics on a daily basis by 11 a.m., as conditions

within 48 hours after you complete your initial evaluation of the 
damage. You must use Form MMS-143, Facility/Equipment Damage Report, to 
make this and all subsequent reports. In lieu of submitting Form MMS-143 
by fax or e-mail, you may submit the damage report electronically in 
accordance with 30 CFR 250.186(a)(3). In the report, you must:
    (i) Name the items damaged (e.g., platform or other structure, 
production equipment, pipeline);
    (ii) Describe the damage and assess the extent of the damage (major, 
medium, minor); and

Sec. 250.193  Reports and investigations of apparent violations.

    Any person may report to MMS an apparent violation or failure to 
comply with any provision of the Act, any provision of a lease, license, 
or permit issued under the Act, or any provision of any regulation or

Sec. 250.194  How must I protect archaeological resources?

    (a) If the Regional Director has reason to believe that an 
archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, the Regional 
Director will require in writing that your EP, DOCD, or DPP be 
accompanied by an archaeological report. If the archaeological report 
suggests that an archaeological resource may be present, you must 
either:
    (1) Locate the site of any operation so as not to adversely affect 
the area where the archaeological resource may be; or
    (2) Establish to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that an 
archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely affected 
by operations. This requires further archaeological investigation, 
conducted by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using survey equipment 
and techniques the Regional Director considers appropriate. You must 
submit the investigation report to the Regional Director for review.
    (b) If the Regional Director determines that an archaeological 
resource

[[Page 84]]

is likely to be present in the lease area and may be adversely affected 
by operations, the Regional Director will notify you immediately. You 
must not take any action that may adversely affect the archaeological 
resource until the Regional Director has told you how to protect the 
resource.
    (c) If you discover any archaeological resource while conducting 
operations in the lease or right-of-way area, you must immediately halt 
operations within the area of the discovery and report the discovery to 
the Regional Director. If investigations determine that the resource is 
significant, the Regional Director will tell you how to protect it.

[70 FR 51501, Aug. 30, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 18585, Apr. 13, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 250.271  For what reasons will MMS disapprove the DPP or DOCD?

    The Regional Supervisor will disapprove your proposed DPP or DOCD if 
one of the four reasons in this section applies:
    (a) Non-compliance. The Regional Supervisor determines that you have 
failed to demonstrate that you can comply with the requirements of the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (Act), implementing 
regulations, or other applicable Federal laws.
    (b) No consistency concurrence. (1) An affected State has not yet 
issued a final decision on your coastal zone consistency certification 
(see 15 CFR 930.78(a)); or
    (2) An affected State objects to your coastal zone consistency 
certification, and the Secretary of Commerce, under section 
307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)), has not 
found that each activity described in the DPP or DOCD is consistent with 
the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise necessary in the interest of 
national security.
    (3) If the Regional Supervisor disapproved your DPP or DOCD for the 
sole reason that an affected State either has not yet issued a final 
decision on, or has objected to, your coastal zone consistency 
certification (see paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) in this section), the 
Regional Supervisor will approve your DPP or DOCD upon receipt of 
concurrence by the affected State, at the time concurrence of the 
affected State is conclusively presumed, or when the Secretary of 
Commerce makes a finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the 
CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in your 
DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is 
otherwise necessary in the

[[Page 120]]

interest of national security. In that event, you do not need to 
resubmit your DPP or DOCD for approval under Sec. 250.273(b).
    (c) National security or defense conflicts. Your proposed activities 
would threaten national security or defense.
    (d) Exceptional circumstances. The Regional Supervisor determines 
because of exceptional geological conditions, exceptional resource 
values in the marine or coastal environment, or other exceptional 
circumstances that all of the following apply:
    (1) Implementing your DPP or DOCD would cause serious harm or damage 
to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral 
deposits (in areas leased or not leased), the national security or 
defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
    (2) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
    (3) The advantages of disapproving your DPP or DOCD outweigh the 
advantages of development and production.


<R05>
Sec. 250.272  If a State objects to the DPP's or DOCD's coastal zone consistency 

certification, what can I do?

    If an affected State objects to the coastal zone consistency 
certification accompanying your proposed or disapproved DPP or DOCD, you 
may do one of the following:
    (a) Amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD. Amend or resubmit your DPP 
or DOCD to accommodate the State's objection and submit the amendment or 
resubmittal to the Regional Supervisor for approval. The amendment or 
resubmittal needs to only address information related to the State's 
objections.
    (b) Appeal. Appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of 
Commerce using the procedures in 15 CFR part 930, subpart H. The 
Secretary of Commerce will either:
    (1) Grant your appeal by finding under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of 
the CZMA (16 U.S.C.1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in 
detail in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the 
CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national security; or
    (2) Deny your appeal, in which case you may amend or resubmit your 
DPP or DOCD, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Withdraw your DPP or DOCD. Withdraw your DPP or DOCD if you 
decide not to conduct your proposed development and production 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 250.273  How do I submit a modified DPP or DOCD or resubmit a disapproved DPP or DOCD?

    (a) Modified DPP or DOCD. If the Regional Supervisor requires you to 
modify your proposed DPP or DOCD under Sec. 250.270(b)(2), you must 
submit the modification(s) to the Regional Supervisor in the same manner 
as for a new DPP or DOCD. You need submit only information related to 
the proposed modification(s).
    (b) Resubmitted DPP or DOCD. If the Regional Supervisor disapproves 
your DPP or DOCD under Sec. 250.270(b)(3), and except as provided in 
Sec. 250.271(b)(3), you may resubmit the disapproved DPP or DOCD if 
there is a change in the conditions that were the basis of its 
disapproval.
    (c) MMS review and timeframe. The Regional Supervisor will use the 
performance standards in Sec. 250.202 to either approve, require you to 
further modify, or disapprove your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD. 
The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 60 calendar days 
after the Regional Supervisor deems your modified or resubmitted DPP or 
DOCD to be submitted, or receives the last amendment to your modified or 
resubmitted DPP or DOCD, whichever occurs later.

          Post-Approval Requirements for the EP, DPP, and DOCD


<R05>
Sec. 250.280  How must I conduct activities under the approved EP, DPP, or DOCD?

under your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD including those identified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, are not subject to separate State CZMA 
consistency review.
    (d) Approval restrictions for permits for activities conducted under 
EPs. The District Manager or Regional Supervisor will not approve any 
APDs or other applications for licenses, approvals, or permits under 
your approved EP until either:
    (1) All affected States with approved coastal zone management 
programs concur, or are conclusively presumed to concur, with the 
coastal zone consistency certification accompanying your EP under 
section 307(c)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(i) 
and (ii)); or
    (2) The Secretary of Commerce finds, under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) 
of the CZMA (16 U.S.C.1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity covered by 
the EP is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise 
necessary in the interest of national security;
    (3) If an affected State objects to the coastal zone consistency 
certification accompanying your approved EP after MMS has approved your 
EP, you may either:
    (i) Revise your EP to accommodate the State's objection and submit 
the revision to the Regional Supervisor for approval; or
    (ii) Appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of Commerce using 
the procedures in 15 CFR part 930 subpart H. The Secretary of Commerce 
will either:
    (A) Grant your appeal by making the finding described in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section; or
    (B) Deny your appeal, in which case you may revise your EP as 
described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.

    (7) Change the location of your onshore support base either from one 
State to another or to a new base or a base requiring expansion; or
    (8) Change any other activity specified by the Regional Supervisor.
    (b) Supplemental OCS plans. You must supplement your approved EP, 
DPP, or DOCD when you propose to conduct activities on your lease(s) or 
unit that require approval of a license or permit which is not described 
in your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD. These types of changes are called 
supplemental OCS plans.


<R05>
Sec. 250.284  How will MMS require revisions to the approved EP, DPP, or DOCD?

    (a) Periodic review. The Regional Supervisor will periodically 
review the activities you conduct under your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD 
and may require you to submit updated information on your activities. 
The frequency and extent of this review will be based on the 
significance of any changes in available information and onshore or 
offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities in your 
approved EP, DPP, or DOCD.
    (b) Results of review. The Regional Supervisor may require you to 
revise your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD based on this review. In such 
cases, the Regional Supervisor will inform you of the reasons for the 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 250.285  How do I submit revised and supplemental EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs?

    (a) Submittal. You must submit to the Regional Supervisor any 
revisions and supplements to approved EPs, DPPs, or DOCDs for approval, 
whether you initiate them or the Regional Supervisor orders them.
    (b) Information. Revised and supplemental EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs need 
include only information related to or affected by the proposed changes, 
including information on changes in expected environmental impacts.
    (c) Procedures. All supplemental EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs, and those 
revised EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs that the Regional Supervisor determines are 
likely to result in a significant change in the impacts previously 
identified and evaluated, are subject to all of the procedures under 
Sec. 250.231 through Sec. 250.235 for EPs and Sec. 250.266 through 
Sec. 250.273 for DPPs and DOCDs.

                    Deepwater Operations Plans (DWOP)


<R05>
Sec. 250.286  What is a DWOP?

    (a) A DWOP is a plan that provides sufficient information for MMS to 
review a deepwater development project, and any other project that uses 
non-conventional production or completion technology, from a total 
system approach. The DWOP does not replace, but supplements other 
submittals required by the regulations such as Exploration Plans, 
Development and Production Plans, and Development Operations 
Coordination Documents. MMS

[[Page 123]]

will use the information in your DWOP to determine whether the project 
will be developed in an acceptable manner, particularly with respect to 
operational safety and environmental protection issues involved with 
non-conventional production or completion technology.
    (b) The DWOP process consists of two parts: a Conceptual Plan and 
the DWOP. Section 250.289 prescribes what the Conceptual Plan must 
contain, and Sec. 250.292 prescribes what the DWOP must contain.


<R05>
Sec. 250.287  For what development projects must I submit a DWOP?

    You must submit a DWOP for each development project in which you 
will use non-conventional production or completion technology, 
regardless of water depth. If you are unsure whether MMS considers the 
technology of your project non-conventional, you must contact the 
Regional Supervisor for guidance.


<R05>
Sec. 250.288  When and how must I submit the Conceptual Plan?

    You must submit four copies, or one hard copy and one electronic 
version, of the Conceptual Plan to the Regional Director after you have 
decided on the general concept(s) for development and before you begin 
engineering design of the well safety control system or subsea 
production systems to be used after well completion.


<R05>
Sec. 250.289  What must the Conceptual Plan contain?

    In the Conceptual Plan, you must explain the general design basis 
and philosophy that you will use to develop the field. You must include 
the following information:
    (a) An overview of the development concept(s);
    (b) A well location plat;
    (c) The system control type (i.e., direct hydraulic or electro-
hydraulic); and
    (d) The distance from each of the wells to the host platform.


<R05>
Sec. 250.290  What operations require approval of the Conceptual Plan?

    You may not complete any production well or install the subsea 
wellhead and well safety control system (often called the tree) before 
MMS has approved the Conceptual Plan.


<R05>
Sec. 250.291  When and how must I submit the DWOP?

    You must submit four copies, or one hard copy and one electronic 
version, of the DWOP to the Regional Director after you have 
substantially completed safety system design and before you begin to 
procure or fabricate the safety and operational systems (other than the 
tree), production platforms, pipelines, or other parts of the production 
system.


<R05>
Sec. 250.292  What must the DWOP contain?

    You must include the following information in your DWOP:
    (a) A description and schematic of the typical wellbore, casing, and 
completion;
    (b) Structural design, fabrication, and installation information for 
each surface system, including host facilities;
    (c) Design, fabrication, and installation information on the mooring 
systems for each surface system;
    (d) Information on any active stationkeeping system(s) involving 
thrusters or other means of propulsion used with a surface system;
    (e) Information concerning the drilling and completion systems;
    (f) Design and fabrication information for each riser system (e.g., 
drilling, workover, production, and injection);
    (g) Pipeline information;
    (h) Information about the design, fabrication, and operation of an 
offtake system for transferring produced hydrocarbons to a transport 
vessel;
    (i) Information about subsea wells and associated systems that 
constitute all or part of a single project development covered by the 
DWOP;
    (j) Flow schematics and Safety Analysis Function Evaluation (SAFE) 
charts (API RP 14C, subsection 4.3c, incorporated by reference in Sec. 
250.198) of the production system from the Surface Controlled Subsurface 
Safety Valve (SCSSV) downstream to the first item of separation 
equipment;

[[Page 124]]

    (k) A description of the surface/subsea safety system and emergency 
support systems to include a table that depicts what valves will close, 
at what times, and for what events or reasons;
    (l) A general description of the operating procedures, including a 
table summarizing the curtailment of production and offloading based on 
operational considerations;
    (m) A description of the facility installation and commissioning 
procedure;
    (n) A discussion of any new technology that affects hydrocarbon 
recovery systems;
    (o) A list of any alternate compliance procedures or departures for 
which you anticipate requesting approval; and
    (p) Payment of the service fee listed in Sec. 250.125.

<R05>
Sec. 250.293  What operations require approval of the DWOP?

    You may not begin production until MMS approves your DWOP.


<R05>
Sec. 250.294  May I combine the Conceptual Plan and the DWOP?

    If your development project meets the following criteria, you may 
submit a combined Conceptual Plan/DWOP on or before the deadline for 
submitting the Conceptual Plan.
    (a) The project is located in water depths of less than 400 meters 
(1,312 feet); and
    (b) The project is similar to projects involving non-conventional 
production or completion technology for which you have obtained approval 
previously.


<R05>
Sec. 250.295  When must I revise my DWOP?

    You must revise either the Conceptual Plan or your DWOP to reflect 
changes in your development project that materially alter the 
facilities, equipment, and systems described in your plan. You must 
submit the revision within 60 days after any material change to the 
information required for that part of your plan.

                Conservation Information Documents (CID)


<R05>
Sec. 250.296  When and how must I submit a CID or a revision to a CID?

    (a) You must submit one original and two copies of a CID to the 
appropriate OCS Region at the same time you first submit your DOCD or 
DPP for any development of a lease or leases located in water depths 
greater than 400 meters (1,312 feet). You must also submit a CID for a 
Supplemental DOCD or DPP when requested by the Regional Supervisor. The 
submission of your CID must be accompanied by payment of the service fee 
listed in Sec. 250.125.
    (b) If you decide not to develop a reservoir you committed to 
develop in your CID, you must submit one original and two copies of a 
revision to the CID to the appropriate OCS Region. The revision to the 
CID must be submitted within 14 calendar days after making your decision 
not to develop the reservoir and before the reservoir is bypassed. The 
Regional Supervisor will approve or disapprove any such revision to the 
original CID. If the Regional Supervisor disapproves the revision, you 
must develop the reservoir as described in the original CID.

[70 FR 51501, Aug. 30, 2005, as amended at 71 FR 40911, July 19, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 250.297  What information must a CID contain?

    (a) You must base the CID on wells drilled before your CID 
submittal, that define the extent of the reservoirs. You must notify MMS 
of any well that is drilled to total depth during the CID evaluation 
period and you may be required to update your CID.
    (b) You must include all of the following information if available. 
Information must be provided for each hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir that 
is penetrated by a well that would meet the producibility requirements 
of Sec. 250.115 or Sec. 250.116:
    (1) General discussion of the overall development of the reservoir;
    (2) Summary spreadsheets of well log data and reservoir parameters 
(i.e., sand tops and bases, fluid contacts, net pay, porosity, water 
saturations, pressures, formation volume factor);

[[Page 125]]

    (3) Appropriate well logs, including digital well log (i.e., gamma 
ray, resistivity, neutron, density, sonic, caliper curves) curves in an 
acceptable digital format;
    (4) Sidewall core/whole core and pressure-volume-temperature 
analysis;
    (5) Structure maps, with the existing and proposed penetration 
points and subsea depths for all wells penetrating the reservoirs, fluid 
contacts (or the lowest or highest known levels in the absence of actual 
contacts), reservoir boundaries, and the scale of the map;
    (6) Interpreted structural cross sections and corresponding 
interpreted seismic lines or block diagrams, as necessary, that include 
all current wellbores and planned wellbores on the leases or units to be 
developed, the reservoir boundaries, fluid contacts, depth scale, 
stratigraphic positions, and relative biostratigraphic ages;
    (7) Isopach maps of each reservoir showing the net feet of pay for 
each well within the reservoir identified at the penetration point, 
along with the well name, labeled contours, and scale;
    (8) Estimates of original oil and gas in-place and anticipated 
recoverable oil and gas reserves, all reservoir parameters, and risk 
factors and assumptions;
    (9) Plat map at the same scale as the structure maps with existing 
and proposed well paths, as well as existing and proposed penetrations;
    (10) Wellbore schematics indicating proposed perforations;
    (11) Proposed wellbore utility chart showing all existing and 
proposed wells, with proposed completion intervals indicated for each 
borehole;
    (12) Appropriate pressure data, specified by date, and whether 
estimated or measured;

    (i) A statement explaining the reason(s) you will not develop the 
reservoir, and
    (ii) Economic justification, including costs, recoverable reserve 
estimate, production profiles, and pricing assumptions; and
    (16) Any other appropriate data you used in performing your 
reservoir evaluations and preparing your reservoir development 
strategies.


<R05>
Sec. 250.298  How long will MMS take to evaluate and make a decision on the CID?

    (a) The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 150 calendar 
days of receiving your CID. If MMS does not act within 150 calendar 
days, your CID is considered approved.
    (b) MMS may suspend the 150-calendar-day evaluation period if there 
is missing, inconclusive, or inaccurate data, or when a well reaches 
total depth during the evaluation period. MMS may also suspend the 
evaluation period when a well penetrating a hydrocarbon-bearing 
structure reaches total depth during the evaluation period and the data 
from that well is needed for the CID. You will receive written 
notification from the Regional Supervisor describing the additional 
information that is needed, and the evaluation period will resume once 
MMS receives the requested information.
    (c) The Regional Supervisor will approve or deny your CID request 
based on your commitment to develop economically producible reservoirs 
according to sound conservation, engineering, and economic practices.

               Subpart C_Pollution Prevention and Control


<R05>
Sec. 250.300  Pollution prevention.

    (a) During the exploration, development, production, and 
transportation of oil and gas or sulphur, the lessee shall take measures 
to prevent unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the offshore 
waters. The lessee shall not create conditions that will pose 
unreasonable risk to public health, life,

[[Page 126]]

property, aquatic life, wildlife, recreation, navigation, commercial 
fishing, or other uses of the ocean.
    (1) When pollution occurs as a result of operations conducted by or 
on behalf of the lessee and the pollution damages or threatens to damage 
life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral 
deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or 
human environment, the control and removal of the pollution to the 
satisfaction of the District Manager shall be at the expense of the 
lessee. Immediate corrective action shall be taken in all cases where 
pollution has occurred. Corrective action shall be subject to 
modification when directed by the District Manager.
    (2) If the lessee fails to control and remove the pollution, the 
Director, in cooperation with other appropriate Agencies of Federal, 
State, and local governments, or in cooperation with the lessee, or 
both, shall have the right to control and remove the pollution at the 
lessee's expense. Such action shall not relieve the lessee of any 
responsibility provided for by law.
    (b)(1) The District Manager may restrict the rate of drilling fluid 
discharges or prescribe alternative discharge methods. The District 
Manager may also restrict the use of components which could cause 
unreasonable degradation to the marine environment. No petroleum-based 
substances, including diesel fuel, may be added to the drilling mud 
system without prior approval of the District Manager.
    (2) Approval of the method of disposal of drill cuttings, sand, and 
other well solids shall be obtained from the District Manager.
    (3) All hydrocarbon-handling equipment for testing and production 
such as separators, tanks, and treaters shall be designed, installed, 
and operated to prevent pollution. Maintenance or repairs which are 
necessary to prevent pollution of offshore waters shall be undertaken 
immediately.
    (4) Curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains shall be installed in deck 
areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants not authorized 
for discharge. Oil drainage shall be piped to a properly designed, 
operated, and maintained sump system which will automatically maintain 
the oil at a level sufficient to prevent discharge of oil into offshore 
waters. All gravity drains shall be equipped with a water trap or other 
means to prevent gas in the sump system from escaping through the 
drains. Sump piles shall not be used as processing devices to treat or 
skim liquids but may be used to collect treated-produced water, treated-
produced sand, or liquids from drip pans and deck drains and as a final 
trap for hydrocarbon liquids in the event of equipment upsets. 
Improperly designed, operated, or maintained sump piles which do not 
prevent the discharge of oil into offshore waters shall be replaced or 
repaired.
    (5) On artificial islands, all vessels containing hydrocarbons shall 
be placed inside an impervious berm or otherwise protected to contain 
spills. Drainage shall be directed away from the drilling rig to a sump. 
Drains and sumps shall be constructed to prevent seepage.
    (6) Disposal of equipment, cables, chains, containers, or other 
materials into offshore waters is prohibited.
    (c) Materials, equipment, tools, containers, and other items used in 
the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which are of such shape or

<R05>
Sec. 250.302  Definitions concerning air quality.

    For purposes of Sec. Sec. 250.303 and 250.304 of this part:
    Air pollutant means any combination of agents for which the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established, pursuant to 
section 109 of the Clean Air Act, national primary or secondary ambient 
air quality standards.
    Attainment area means, for any air pollutant, an area which is shown 
by monitored data or which is calculated by air quality modeling (or 
other methods determined by the Administrator of EPA to be reliable) not 
to exceed any primary or secondary ambient air quality standards 
established by EPA.
    Best available control technology (BACT) means an emission 
limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction for each air 
pollutant subject to regulation, taking into account energy, 
environmental and economic impacts, and other costs. The BACT shall be 
verified on a case-by-case basis by the Regional Supervisor and may 
include reductions achieved through the application of processes, 
systems, and techniques for the control of each air pollutant.
    Emission offsets means emission reductions obtained from facilities, 
either onshore or offshore, other than the facility or facilities 
covered by the proposed Exploration Plan or Development and Production 
Plan.
    Existing facility is an OCS facility described in an Exploration 
Plan or a Development and Production Plan submitted or approved prior to 
June 2, 1980.
    Facility means any installation or device permanently or temporarily 
attached to the seabed which is used for exploration, development, and 
production activities for oil, gas, or sulphur and which emits or has 
the potential to emit any air pollutant from one or more sources. All 
equipment directly associated with the installation or device shall be 
considered part of a single facility if the equipment is dependent on, 
or affects the processes of, the installation or device. During 
production, multiple installations or devices will be considered to be a 
single facility if the installations or devices are directly related to 
the production of oil, gas, or sulphur at a single site. Any vessel used 
to transfer production from an offshore facility shall be considered 
part of the facility while physically attached to it.
    Nonattainment area means, for any air pollutant, an area which is 
shown by monitored data or which is calculated by air quality modeling 
(or other methods determined by the Administrator of EPA to be reliable) 
to exceed any primary or secondary ambient air quality standard 
established by EPA.
    Projected emissions means emissions, either controlled or 
uncontrolled, from a source(s).
    Source means an emission point. Several sources may be included 
within a single facility.
    Temporary facility means activities associated with the construction 
of platforms offshore or with facilities related to exploration for or 
development of offshore oil and gas resources which are conducted in one 
location for less than 3 years.
    Volatile organic compound (VOC) means any organic compound which is 
emitted to the atmosphere as a vapor. The unreactive compounds are 
exempt from the above definition.

<R05>
Sec. 250.303  Facilities described in a new or revised Exploration Plan or 

Development and Production Plan.

    (a) New plans. All Exploration Plans and Development and Production 
Plans shall include the information required to make the necessary 
findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section, and the 
lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.
    (b) Applicability of Sec. 250.303 to existing facilities. (1) The 
Regional Supervisor may review any Exploration Plan or Development and 
Production Plan to determine whether any facility described in the plan 
should be subject to review under this section and has the potential to 
significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area. To make these 
decisions, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the distance of the 
facility from shore, the size of the facility, the number of sources 
planned for the facility and their operational status, and the air 
quality status of the onshore area.
    (2) For a facility identified by the Regional Supervisor in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall require 
the lessee to refer to the information required in Sec. 250.218 or 
Sec. 250.249 of this part and to submit only that information required 
to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this 
section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the 
Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at 
the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with 
the requirements of this section as necessary.
    (c) Revised facilities. All revised Exploration Plans and 
Development and Production Plans shall include the information required 
to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this 
section. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section 
as necessary.
    (d) Exemption formulas. To determine whether a facility described in 
a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or Development and 
Production Plan is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee 
shall use the highest annual-total amount of emissions from the facility 
for each air pollutant calculated in Sec. 250.249(a) or Sec. 
250.218(a) of this part and compare these emissions to the emission 
exemption amount ``E'' for each air pollutant calculated using the 
following formulas: E=3400D<SUP>2/3</SUP> for carbon monoxide (CO); and 
E=33.3D for total suspended particulates (TSP), sulphur dioxide 
(SO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), and VOC (where E is 
the emission exemption amount expressed in tons per year, and D is the 
distance of the proposed facility from the closest onshore area of a 
State expressed in statute miles). If the amount of these projected 
emissions is less than or equal to the emission exemption amount ``E'' 
for the air pollutant, the facility is exempt from further air quality 
review required under paragraphs (e) through (i) of this section.
    (e) Significance levels. For a facility not exempt under paragraph 
(d) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall 
use an approved air quality model to determine whether the projected 
emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore 
ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:

    Significance Levels: Air pollutant concentrations ([micro]g/m\3\)

CO........................................  .......  ..  500  ..   2,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Significance determinations. (1) The projected emissions of any 
air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which result in an 
onshore ambient air concentration above the significance level 
determined under paragraph (e) of this section for that air pollutant, 
shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area for that air pollutant.
    (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not 
exempt under paragraph (d) of this section for that air pollutant shall 
be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area 
for VOC.
    (g) Controls required. (1) The projected emissions of any air 
pollutant other than VOC from any facility, except a temporary facility, 
which significantly

[[Page 129]]

affect the quality of a nonattainment area, shall be fully reduced. This 
shall be done through the application of BACT and, if additional 
reductions are necessary, through the application of additional emission 
controls or through the acquisition of offshore or onshore offsets.
    (2) The projected emissions of any air pollutant other than VOC from 
any facility which significantly affect the air quality of an attainment 
or unclassifiable area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (i) Except for temporary facilities, the lessee also shall use an 
approved air quality model to determine whether the emissions of TSP or 
SO<INF>2</INF> that remain after the application of BACT cause the 
following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentrations 
established in 40 CFR 52.21 to be exceeded in the attainment or 
unclassifiable area:

No concentration of an air pollutant shall exceed the concentration 
permitted under the national secondary ambient air quality standard or 
the concentration permitted under the national primary air quality 
standard, whichever concentration is lowest for the air pollutant for 
the period of exposure. For any period other than the annual period, the 
applicable maximum allowable increase may be exceeded during one such 
period per year at any one onshore location.
    (ii) If the maximum allowable increases are exceeded, the lessee 
shall apply whatever additional emission controls are necessary to 
reduce or offset the remaining emissions of TSP or SO<INF>2</INF> so 
that concentrations in the onshore ambient air of an attainment or 
unclassifiable area do not exceed the maximum allowable increases.
    (3)(i) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility, except a 
temporary facility, which significantly affect the onshore air quality 
of a nonattainment area shall be fully reduced. This shall be done 
through the application of BACT and, if additional reductions are 
necessary, through the application of additional emission controls or 
through the acquisition of offshore or onshore offsets.
    (ii) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which 
significantly affect the onshore air quality of an attainment area shall 
be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (4)(i) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect 
the onshore air quality of both a nonattainment and an attainment or 
unclassifiable area, the regulatory requirements applicable to projected 
emissions significantly affecting a nonattainment area shall apply.
    (ii) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect the 
onshore air quality of more than one class of attainment area, the 
lessee must reduce projected emissions to meet the maximum allowable 
increases specified for each class in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (h) Controls required on temporary facilities. The lessee shall 
apply BACT to reduce projected emissions of any air pollutant from a 
temporary facility which significantly affect the air quality of an 
onshore area of a State.
    (i) Emission offsets. When emission offsets are to be obtained, the 
lessee must demonstrate that the offsets are equivalent in nature and 
quantity to the projected emissions that must be reduced after the 
application of BACT; a binding commitment exists between the lessee and 
the owner or owners of the source or sources; the appropriate air 
quality control jurisdiction has been notified of the need to revise the 
State Implementation Plan to include the information regarding the 
offsets; and the required offsets come from sources which affect the air 
quality of the area significantly affected by the lessee's offshore 
operations.

[[Page 130]]

    (j) Review of facilities with emissions below the exemption amount. 
If, during the review of a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or 
Development and Production Plan, the Regional Supervisor determines or 
an affected State submits information to the Regional Supervisor which 
demonstrates, in the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected 
emissions from an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or 
in combination with other facilities in the area, significantly affect 
the air quality of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall 
require the lessee to submit additional information to determine whether 
emission control measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the 
opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which 
demonstrates that the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the 
air quality of an onshore area of the State.
    (k) Emission monitoring requirements. The lessee shall monitor, in a 
manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from 
the facility. The lessee shall submit this information monthly in a 
manner and form approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
    (l) Collection of meteorological data. The Regional Supervisor may 
require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner 
approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit 
meteorological data from a facility.

<R05>
Sec. 250.304  Existing facilities.

    (a) Process leading to review of an existing facility. (1) An 
affected State may request that the Regional Supervisor supply basic 
emission data from existing facilities when such data are needed for the 
updating of the State's emission inventory. In submitting the request, 
the State must demonstrate that similar offshore and onshore facilities 
in areas under the State's jurisdiction are also included in the 
emission inventory.
    (2) The Regional Supervisor may require lessees of existing 
facilities to submit basic emission data to a State submitting a request 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) The State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section may submit information from its emission inventory which 
indicates that emissions from existing facilities may be significantly 
affecting the air quality of the onshore area of the State. The lessee 
shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional 
Supervisor which demonstrates that the facility is not significantly 
affecting the air quality of the State.
    (4) The Regional Supervisor shall evaluate the information submitted 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and shall determine, based on the 
basic emission data, available meteorological data, and the distance of 
the facility or facilities from the onshore area, whether any existing 
facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of 
the onshore area of the State.
    (5) If the Regional Supervisor determines that no existing facility 
has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the State of and explain 
the reasons for this finding.
    (6) If the Regional Supervisor determines that an existing facility 
has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore 
area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to refer to 
the information requirements under Sec. 250.218 or 250.249 of this part 
and submit only that information required to make the necessary findings 
under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. The lessee shall 
submit this information within 120 days of the Regional Supervisor's 
determination or within a longer period of time at the discretion of the 
Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of 
this section as necessary.
    (b) Exemption formulas. To determine whether an existing facility is 
exempt from further air quality review, the

[[Page 131]]

lessee shall use the highest annual total amount of emissions from the 
facility for each air pollutant calculated in Sec. 250.218(a) or 
250.249(a) of this part and compare these emissions to the emission 
exemption amount ``E'' for each air pollutant calculated using the 
following formulas: E=3400D<SUP>2/3</SUP> for CO; and E=33.3D for TSP, 
SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF>, and VOC (where E is the emission 
exemption amount expressed in tons per year, and D is the distance of 
the facility from the closest onshore area of the State expressed in 
statute miles). If the amount of projected emissions is less than or 
equal to the emission exemption amount ``E'' for the air pollutant, the 
facility is exempt for that air pollutant from further air quality 
review required under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
    (c) Significance levels. For a facility not exempt under paragraph 
(b) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall 
use an approved air quality model to determine whether projected 
emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore 
ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:

    Significance Levels: Air Pollutant Concentrations ([micro]G/M\3\)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Significance determinations. (1) The projected emissions of any 
air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which result in an 
onshore ambient air concentration above the significance levels 
determined under paragraph (c) of this section for that air pollutant 
shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area for that air pollutant.
    (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not 
exempt under paragraph (b) of this section for that air pollutant shall 
be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area 
for VOC.
    (e) Controls required. (1) The projected emissions of any air 
pollutant which significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area 
shall be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (2) The lessee shall submit a compliance schedule for the 
application of BACT. If it is necessary to cease operations to allow for 
the installation of emission controls, the lessee may apply for a 
suspension of operations under the provisions of Sec. 250.174 of this 
part.
    (f) Review of facilities with emissions below the exemption amount. 
If, during the review of the information required under paragraph (a)(6) 
of this section, the Regional Supervisor determines or an affected State 
submits information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates, in 
the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected emissions from 
an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or in combination 
with other facilities in the area, significantly affect the air quality 
of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall require the 
lessee to submit additional information to determine whether control 
measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to 
present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that 
the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of an 
onshore area of the State.
    (g) Emission monitoring requirements. The lessee shall monitor, in a 
manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from 
the facility following the installation of emission controls. The lessee 
shall submit this information monthly in a manner and form approved or 
prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
    (h) Collection of meteorological data. The Regional Supervisor may 
require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner 
approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit 
meteorological data from a facility.

Sec. 250.422  When may I resume drilling after cementing?

    (a) After cementing surface, intermediate, or production casing (or 
liners), you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under 
pressure for 12 hours. For conductor casing, you may resume drilling 
after the cement has been held under pressure for 8 hours. One 
acceptable method of holding cement under pressure is to use float 
valves to hold the cement in place.
    (b) If you plan to nipple down your diverter or BOP stack during the 
8- or 12-hour waiting time, you must determine, before nippling down, 
when it will be safe to do so. You must base your determination on a 
knowledge of formation conditions, cement composition, effects of 
nippling down, presence of potential drilling hazards, well conditions 
during drilling, cementing, and post cementing, as well as past 
experience.

Sec. 250.423  What are the requirements for pressure testing casing?

    (a) The table in this section describes the minimum test pressures 
for each string of casing. You may not resume drilling or other down-
hole operations until you obtain a satisfactory pressure test. If the 
pressure declines more than 10 percent in a 30-minute test, or if there 
is another indication of a leak, you must re-cement, repair the casing, 
or run additional casing to provide a proper seal. The District Manager 
may approve or require other casing test pressures.

    (1) You must ensure that the latching mechanisms or lock down 
mechanisms are engaged upon installation of each casing string or liner.
    (2) You must perform a pressure test on the casing seal assembly to 
ensure proper installation of casing or liner. You must perform this 
test for the intermediate and production casing strings or liner.
    (3) You must submit for approval with your APD, test procedures and 
criteria for a successful test.
    (4) You must document all your test results and make them available 
to BOEMRE upon request.
    (c) You must perform a negative pressure test on all wells to ensure 
proper casing installation. You must perform this test for the 
intermediate and production casing strings.

    (1) Caliper or pressure test the casing; and
    (2) Report the results of your evaluation to the District Manager 
and obtain approval of those results before resuming operations.
    (b) If casing integrity has deteriorated to a level below minimum 
safety factors, you must:
    (1) Repair the casing or run another casing string; and
    (2) Obtain approval from the District Manager before you begin 
repairs.

<R05>
Sec. 250.425  What are the requirements for pressure testing liners?

    (a) You must test each drilling liner (and liner-lap) to a pressure 
at least equal to the anticipated pressure to which the liner will be 
subjected during the formation pressure-integrity test below that liner 
shoe, or subsequent liner shoes if set. The District Manager may approve 
or require other liner test pressures.
    (b) You must test each production liner (and liner-lap) to a minimum 
of 500 psi above the formation fracture pressure at the casing shoe into 
which the liner is lapped.
    (c) You may not resume drilling or other down-hole operations until 
you obtain a satisfactory pressure test. If the pressure declines more 
than 10 percent in a 30-minute test or if there is another indication of 
a leak, you must re-cement, repair the liner, or run additional casing/
liner to provide a proper seal.

Sec. 250.426  What are the recordkeeping requirements for casing and liner pressure tests?

    You must record the time, date, and results of each pressure test in 
the driller's report maintained under standard industry practice. In 
addition, you must record each test on a pressure chart and have your 
onsite representative sign and date the test as being correct.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.427  What are the requirements for pressure integrity tests?

    You must conduct a pressure integrity test below the surface casing 
or liner and all intermediate casings or liners. The District Manager 
may require you to run a pressure-integrity test at the conductor casing 
shoe if warranted by local geologic conditions or the planned casing 
setting depth. You must conduct each pressure integrity test after 
drilling at least 10 feet but no more than 50 feet of new hole below the 
casing shoe. You must test to either the formation leak-off pressure or 
to an equivalent drilling fluid weight if identified in an approved APD.
    (a) You must use the pressure integrity test and related hole-
behavior observations, such as pore-pressure test results, gas-cut 
drilling fluid, and well kicks to adjust the drilling fluid program and 
the setting depth of the next casing string. You must record all test 
results and hole-behavior observations made during the course of 
drilling related to formation integrity and pore pressure in the 
driller's report.
    (b) While drilling, you must maintain the safe drilling margin 
identified in the approved APD. When you cannot maintain this safe 
margin, you must suspend drilling operations and remedy the situation.

                      Diverter System Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 250.430  When must I install a diverter system?

    You must install a diverter system before you drill a conductor or 
surface hole. The diverter system consists of a diverter sealing 
element, diverter lines, and control systems. You must design, install, 
use, maintain, and test the diverter system to ensure proper diversion 
of gases, water, drilling fluid, and other materials away from 
facilities and personnel.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.431  What are the diverter design and installation requirements?

    You must design and install your diverter system to:
    (a) Use diverter spool outlets and diverter lines that have a 
nominal diameter of at least 10 inches for surface wellhead 
configurations and at least 12 inches for floating drilling operations;
    (b) Use dual diverter lines arranged to provide for downwind 
diversion capability;
    (c) Use at least two diverter control stations. One station must be 
on the drilling floor. The other station must be in a readily accessible 
location away from the drilling floor;
    (d) Use only remote-controlled valves in the diverter lines. All 
valves in the diverter system must be full-opening. You may not install 
manual or butterfly valves in any part of the diverter system;
    (e) Minimize the number of turns (only one 90-degree turn allowed 
for each line for bottom-founded drilling units) in the diverter lines, 
maximize the radius of curvature of turns, and target all right angles 
and sharp turns;
    (f) Anchor and support the entire diverter system to prevent 
whipping and vibration; and
    (g) Protect all diverter-control instruments and lines from possible 
damage by thrown or falling objects.

Sec. 250.433  What are the diverter actuation and testing requirements?

    When you install the diverter system, you must actuate the diverter 
sealing element, diverter valves, and diverter-control systems and 
control stations. You must also flow-test the vent lines.
    (a) For drilling operations with a surface wellhead configuration, 
you must actuate the diverter system at least once every 24-hour period 
after the initial test. After you have nippled up on conductor casing, 
you must pressure-test the diverter-sealing element and diverter valves 
to a minimum of 200 psi. While the diverter is installed, you must 
conduct subsequent pressure tests within 7 days after the previous test.
    (b) For floating drilling operations with a subsea BOP stack, you

Sec. 250.447  When must I pressure test the BOP system?

    You must pressure test your BOP system (this includes the choke 
manifold, kelly valves, inside BOP, and drill-string safety valve):
    (a) When installed;
    (b) Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test. 
You must begin to test your BOP system before midnight on the 14th day 
following the conclusion of the previous test. However, the District 
Manager may require more frequent testing if conditions or BOP 
performance warrant; and
    (c) Before drilling out each string of casing or a liner. The 
District Manager may allow you to omit this test if you didn't remove 
the BOP stack to run the casing string or liner and the required BOP 
test pressures for the next section of the hole are not greater than the 
test pressures for the previous BOP test. You must indicate in your APD 
which casing strings and liners meet these criteria.

<R05>
Sec. 250.448  What are the BOP pressure tests requirements?

    When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low-
pressure and a high-pressure test for each BOP component. You must 
conduct the low-pressure test before the high-pressure test. Each 
individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate 
that the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. Required test 
pressures are as follows:
    (a) Low-pressure test. All low-pressure tests must be between 200 
and 300 psi. Any initial pressure above 300 psi must be bled back to a 
pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the 
initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and 
reinitiate the test.
    (b) High-pressure test for ram-type BOPs, the choke manifold, and 
other BOP components. The high-pressure test must equal the rated 
working pressure of the equipment or be 500 psi greater than your 
calculated maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP) for the 
applicable section of hole. Before you may test BOP equipment to the 
MASP plus 500 psi, the District Manager must

[[Page 146]]

have approved those test pressures in your APD.
    (c) High pressure test for annular-type BOPs. The high pressure test 
must equal 70 percent of the rated working pressure of the equipment or 
to a pressure approved in your APD.
    (d) Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required 
pressure for 5 minutes. However, for surface BOP systems and surface 
equipment of a subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable 
if you record your test pressures on the outermost half of a 4-hour 
chart, on a 1-hour chart, or on a digital recorder. If the equipment 
does not hold the required pressure during a test, you must correct the 
problem and retest the affected component(s).

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.449  What additional BOP testing requirements must I meet?

    You must meet the following additional BOP testing requirements:
    (a) Use water to test a surface BOP system;
    (b) Stump test a subsea BOP system before installation. You must use 
water to conduct this test. You may use drilling fluids to conduct 
subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system;
    (c) Alternate tests between control stations and pods;
    (d) Pressure test the blind or blind-shear ram BOP during stump 
tests and at all casing points;
    (e) The interval between any blind or blind-shear ram BOP pressure 
tests may not exceed 30 days;
    (f) Pressure test variable bore-pipe ram BOPs against the largest 
and smallest sizes of pipe in use, excluding drill collars and bottom-
hole tools;
    (g) Pressure test affected BOP components following the 
disconnection or repair of any well-pressure containment seal in the 
wellhead or BOP stack assembly;
    (h) Function test annular and ram BOPs every 7 days between pressure 
tests;
    (i) Actuate safety valves assembled with proper casing connections 
before running casing;
    (j) Test all ROV intervention functions on your subsea BOP stack 
during the stump test. You must also test at least one set of rams 
during the initial test on the seafloor. You must submit test procedures 
with your APD or APM for District Manager approval. You must:
    (1) ensure that the ROV hot stabs are function tested and are 
capable of actuating, at a minimum, one set of pipe rams and one set of 
blind-shear rams and unlatching the LMRP; and
    (2) document all your test results and make them available to BOEMRE 
upon request;
    (k) Function test autoshear and deadman systems on your subsea BOP 
stack during the stump test. You must also test the deadman system 
during the initial test on the seafloor.

                       Drilling Fluid Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 250.455  What are the general requirements for a drilling fluid program?

    You must design and implement your drilling fluid program to prevent 
the loss of well control. This program must address drilling fluid safe 
practices, testing and monitoring equipment, drilling fluid quantities, 
and drilling fluid-handling areas.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.456  What safe practices must the drilling fluid program follow?

    Your drilling fluid program must include the following safe 
practices:
    (a) Before starting out of the hole with drill pipe, you must 
properly condition the drilling fluid. You must circulate a volume of 
drilling fluid equal to the annular volume with the drill pipe just off-
bottom. You may omit this practice if documentation in the driller's 
report shows:
    (1) No indication of formation fluid influx before starting to pull 
the drill pipe from the hole;
    (2) The weight of returning drilling fluid is within 0.2 pounds per 
gallon (1.5 pounds per cubic foot) of the drilling fluid entering the 
hole; and
    (3) Other drilling fluid properties are within the limits 
established by the program approved in the APD.
    (b) Record each time you circulate drilling fluid in the hole in the 
driller's report;
    (c) When coming out of the hole with drill pipe, you must fill the 
annulus with drilling fluid before the hydrostatic pressure decreases by 
75 psi, or every five stands of drill pipe, whichever gives a lower 
decrease in hydrostatic pressure. You must calculate the number of 
stands of drill pipe and drill collars that you may pull before you must 
fill the hole. You must also calculate the equivalent drilling fluid 
volume needed to fill the hole. Both sets of numbers must be posted near 
the driller's station. You must use a mechanical, volumetric, or 
electronic device to measure the drilling fluid required to fill the 
hole;
    (d) You must run and pull drill pipe and downhole tools at 
controlled rates so you do not swab or surge the well;

[[Page 148]]

    (e) When there is an indication of swabbing or influx of formation 
fluids, you must take appropriate measures to control the well. You must 
circulate and condition the well, on or near-bottom, unless well or 
drilling-fluid conditions prevent running the drill pipe back to the 
bottom;
    (f) You must calculate and post near the driller's console the 
maximum pressures that you may safely contain under a shut-in BOP for 
each casing string. The pressures posted must consider the surface 
pressure at which the formation at the shoe would break down, the rated 
working pressure of the BOP stack, and 70 percent of casing burst (or 
casing test as approved by the District Manager). As a minimum, you must 
post the following two pressures:
    (1) The surface pressure at which the shoe would break down. This 
calculation must consider the current drilling fluid weight in the hole; 
and
    (2) The lesser of the BOP's rated working pressure or 70 percent of 
casing-burst pressure (or casing test otherwise approved by the District 
Manager);
    (g) You must install an operable drilling fluid-gas separator and 
degasser before you begin drilling operations. You must maintain this 
equipment throughout the drilling of the well;
    (h) Before pulling drill-stem test tools from the hole, you must 
circulate or reverse-circulate the test fluids in the hole. If 
circulating out test fluids is not feasible, you may bullhead test 
fluids out of the drill-stem test string and tools with an appropriate 
kill weight fluid;
    (i) When circulating, you must test the drilling fluid at least once 
each tour, or more frequently if conditions warrant. Your tests must 
conform to industry-accepted practices and include density, viscosity, 
and gel strength; hydrogenion concentration; filtration; and any other 
tests the District Manager requires for monitoring and maintaining 
drilling fluid quality, prevention of downhole equipment problems and 
for kick detection. You must record the results of these tests in the 
drilling fluid report;
    (j) Before displacing kill-weight drilling fluid from the wellbore, 
you must obtain prior approval from the District Manager. To obtain 
approval, you must submit with your APD or APM your reasons for 
displacing the kill-weight drilling fluid and provide detailed step-by-
step written procedures describing how you will safely displace these 
fluids. The step-by-step displacement procedures must address the 
following:
    (1) Number and type of independent barriers that are in place for 
each flow path,
    (2) Tests you will conduct to ensure integrity of independent 
barriers,
    (3) BOP procedures you will use while displacing kill weight fluids, 
and
    (4) Procedures you will use to monitor fluids entering and leaving 
the wellbore; and
    (k) In areas where permafrost and/or hydrate zones are present or 
may be present, you must control drilling fluid temperatures to drill 
safely through those zones.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003; 68 FR 14274, Mar. 24, 2003, as amended at 75 
FR 63374, Oct. 14, 2010]


<R05>
Sec. 250.457  What equipment is required to monitor drilling fluids?

    Once you establish drilling fluid returns, you must install and 
maintain the following drilling fluid-system monitoring equipment 
throughout subsequent drilling operations. This equipment must have the 
following indicators on the rig floor:
    (a) Pit level indicator to determine drilling fluid-pit volume gains 
and losses. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible 
warning device;
    (b) Volume measuring device to accurately determine drilling fluid 
volumes required to fill the hole on trips;
    (c) Return indicator devices that indicate the relationship between 
drilling fluid-return flow rate and pump discharge rate. This indicator 
must include both a visual and an audible warning device; and
    (d) Gas-detecting equipment to monitor the drilling fluid returns. 
The indicator may be located in the drilling fluid-logging compartment 
or on the rig floor. If the indicators are only in the logging 
compartment, you must continually man the equipment and

[[Page 149]]

have a means of immediate communication with the rig floor. If the 
indicators are on the rig floor only, you must install an audible alarm.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.458  What quantities of drilling fluids are required?

    (a) You must use, maintain, and replenish quantities of drilling 
fluid and drilling fluid materials at the drill site as necessary to 
ensure well control. You must determine those quantities based on known 
or anticipated drilling conditions, rig storage capacity, weather 
conditions, and estimated time for delivery.
    (b) You must record the daily inventories of drilling fluid and 
drilling fluid materials, including weight materials and additives in 
the drilling fluid report.
    (c) If you do not have sufficient quantities of drilling fluid and 
drilling fluid material to maintain well control, you must suspend 
drilling operations.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.459  What are the safety requirements for drilling fluid-handling areas?

    You must classify drilling fluid-handling areas according to API RP 
500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical 
Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class I, Division 1 
and Division 2 (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 
250.198); or API RP 505, Recommended Practice for Classification of 
Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, 
Classified as Class 1, Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 (incorporated by 
reference as specified in Sec. 250.198). In areas where dangerous 
concentrations of combustible gas may accumulate, you must install and 
maintain a ventilation system and gas monitors. Drilling fluid-handling 
areas must have the following safety equipment:
    (a) A ventilation system capable of replacing the air once every 5 
minutes or 1.0 cubic feet of air-volume flow per minute, per square foot 
of area, whichever is greater. In addition:
    (1) If natural means provide adequate ventilation, then a mechanical 
ventilation system is not necessary;
    (2) If a mechanical system does not run continuously, then it must 
activate when gas detectors indicate the presence of 1 percent or more 
of combustible gas by volume; and
    (3) If discharges from a mechanical ventilation system may be 
hazardous, then you must maintain the drilling fluid-handling area at a 
negative pressure. You must protect the negative pressure area by using 
at least one of the following: a pressure-sensitive alarm, open-door 
alarms on each access to the area, automatic door-closing devices, air 
locks, or other devices approved by the District Manager;
    (b) Gas detectors and alarms except in open areas where adequate 
ventilation is provided by natural means. You must test and recalibrate 
gas detectors quarterly. No more than 90 days may elapse between tests;
    (c) Explosion-proof or pressurized electrical equipment to prevent 
the ignition of explosive gases. Where you use air for pressuring 
equipment, you must locate the air intake outside of and as far as 
practicable from hazardous areas; and
    (d) Alarms that activate when the mechanical ventilation system 
fails.

<R05>
Sec. 250.461  What are the requirements for directional and inclination surveys?

    For this subpart, MMS classifies a well as vertical if the 
calculated average of inclination readings does not exceed 3 degrees 
from the vertical.
    (a) Survey requirements for a vertical well. (1) You must conduct 
inclination surveys on each vertical well and record the results. Survey 
intervals may not exceed 1,000 feet during the normal course of 
drilling;
    (2) You must also conduct a directional survey that provides both 
inclination and azimuth, and digitally record the results in electronic 
format:
    (i) Within 500 feet of setting surface or intermediate casing;
    (ii) Within 500 feet of setting any liner; and
    (iii) When you reach total depth.
    (b) Survey requirements for directional well. You must conduct 
directional surveys on each directional well and digitally record the 
results. Surveys must give both inclination and azimuth at intervals not 
to exceed 500 feet during the normal course of drilling. Intervals 
during angle-changing portions of the hole may not exceed 100 feet.
    (c) Measurement while drilling. You may use measurement-while-
drilling technology if it meets the requirements of this section.
    (d) Composite survey requirements. (1) Your composite directional 
survey must show the interval from the bottom of the conductor casing to 
total depth. In the absence of conductor casing, the survey must show 
the interval from the bottom of the drive or structural casing to total 
depth; and
    (2) You must correct all surveys to Universal-Transverse-Mercator-
Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north after making the magnetic-to-true-north 
correction. Surveys must show the magnetic and grid corrections used and 
include a listing of the directionally computed inclinations and 
azimuths.
    (e) If you drill within 500 feet of an adjacent lease, the Regional 
Supervisor may require you to furnish a copy of the well's directional 
survey to the affected leaseholder. This could occur when the adjoining 
leaseholder requests a copy of the survey for the protection of 
correlative rights.

    (i) Scavengers. You must have scavengers for control of 
H<INF>2</INF>S available on the facility. When H<INF>2</INF>S is 
detected, you must add scavengers as needed. You must suspend drilling 
until the scavenger is circulated throughout the system.
    (ii) Control pH. You must add additives for the control of pH to 
water-base well-control fluids in sufficient quantities to maintain pH 
of at least 10.0.
    (iii) Corrosion inhibitors. You must add additives to the well-
control fluid system as needed for the control of corrosion.
    (5) You must degas well-control fluids containing H<INF>2</INF>S at 
the optimum location for the particular facility. You must collect the 
gases removed and

[[Page 159]]

burn them in a closed flare system conforming to paragraph (q)(6) of 
this section.
    (n) What must I do in the event of a kick? In the event of a kick, 
you must use one of the following alternatives to dispose of the well-
influx fluids giving consideration to personnel safety, possible 
environmental damage, and possible facility well-equipment damage:
    (1) Contain the well-fluid influx by shutting in the well and 
pumping the fluids back into the formation.
    (2) Control the kick by using appropriate well-control techniques to 
prevent formation fracturing in an open hole within the pressure limits 
of the well equipment (drill pipe, work string, casing, wellhead, BOP 
system, and related equipment). The disposal of H<INF>2</INF>S and other 
gases must be through pressurized or atmospheric mud-separator equipment 
depending on volume, pressure and concentration of H<INF>2</INF>S. The 
equipment must be designed to recover well-control fluids and burn the 
gases separated from the well-control fluid. The well-control fluid must 
be treated to neutralize H<INF>2</INF>S and restore and maintain the 
proper quality.
    (o) Well testing in a zone known to contain H<INF>2</INF>S. When 
testing a well in a zone with H<INF>2</INF>S present, you must do all of 
the following:
    (1) Before starting a well test, conduct safety meetings for all 
personnel who will be on the facility during the test. At the meetings, 
emphasize the use of protective-breathing equipment, first-aid 
procedures, and the Contingency Plan. Only competent personnel who are 
trained and are knowledgeable of the hazardous effects of H<INF>2</INF>S 
must be engaged in these tests.
    (2) Perform well testing with the minimum number of personnel in the 
immediate vicinity of the rig floor and with the appropriate test 
equipment to safely and adequately perform the test. During the test, 
you must continuously monitor H<INF>2</INF>S levels.
    (3) Not burn produced gases except through a flare which meets the 
requirements of paragraph (q)(6) of this section. Before flaring gas 
containing H<INF>2</INF>S, you must activate SO<INF>2</INF> monitoring 
equipment in accordance with paragraph (j)(11) of this section. If you 
detect SO<INF>2</INF> in excess of 2 ppm, you must implement the 
personnel protective measures in your H<INF>2</INF>S Contingency Plan, 
required by paragraph (f) of this section. You must also follow the 
requirements of Sec. 250.1164. You must pipe gases from stored test 
fluids into the flare outlet and burn them.
    (4) Use downhole test tools and wellhead equipment suitable for 
H<INF>2</INF>S service.
    (5) Use tubulars suitable for H<INF>2</INF>S service. You must not 
use drill pipe for well testing without the prior approval of the 
District Manager. Water cushions must be thoroughly inhibited in order 
to prevent H<INF>2</INF>S attack on metals. You must flush the test 
string fluid treated for this purpose after completion of the test.
    (6) Use surface test units and related equipment that is designed 
for H<INF>2</INF>S service.
    (p) Metallurgical properties of equipment. When operating in a zone 
with H<INF>2</INF>S present, you must use equipment that is constructed 
of materials with metallurgical properties that resist or prevent 
sulfide stress cracking (also known as hydrogen embrittlement, stress 
corrosion cracking, or H<INF>2</INF>S embrittlement), chloride-stress 
cracking, hydrogen-induced cracking, and other failure modes. You must 
do all of the following:
    (1) Use tubulars and other equipment, casing, tubing, drill pipe, 
couplings, flanges, and related equipment that is designed for 
H<INF>2</INF>S service.
    (2) Use BOP system components, wellhead, pressure-control equipment, 
and related equipment exposed to H\2\S-bearing fluids in conformance 
with NACE Standard MR0175-03 (incorporated by reference as specified in 
Sec. 250.198).
    (3) Use temporary downhole well-security devices such as retrievable 
packers and bridge plugs that are designed for H<INF>2</INF>S service.
    (4) When producing in zones bearing H<INF>2</INF>S, use equipment 
constructed of materials capable of resisting or preventing sulfide 
stress cracking.
    (5) Keep the use of welding to a minimum during the installation or 
modification of a production facility. Welding must be done in a manner 
that ensures resistance to sulfide stress cracking.

[[Page 160]]

    (q) General requirements when operating in an H<INF>2</INF>S zone--
(1) Coring operations. When you conduct coring operations in 
H<INF>2</INF>S-bearing zones, all personnel in the working area must 
wear protective-breathing equipment at least 10 stands in advance of 
retrieving the core barrel. Cores to be transported must be sealed and 
marked for the presence of H<INF>2</INF>S.
    (2) Logging operations. You must treat and condition well-control 
fluid in use for logging operations to minimize the effects of 
H<INF>2</INF>S on the logging equipment.
    (3) Stripping operations. Personnel must monitor displaced well-
control fluid returns and wear protective-breathing equipment in the 
working area when the atmospheric concentration of H<INF>2</INF>S 
reaches 20 ppm or if the well is under pressure.
    (4) Gas-cut well-control fluid or well kick from H<INF>2</INF>S-
bearing zone. If you decide to circulate out a kick, personnel in the 
working area during bottoms-up and extended-kill operations must wear 
protective-breathing equipment.
    (5) Drill- and workover-string design and precautions. Drill- and 
workover-strings must be designed consistent with the anticipated depth, 
conditions of the hole, and reservoir environment to be encountered. You 
must minimize exposure of the drill- or workover-string to high stresses 
as much as practical and consistent with well conditions. Proper 
handling techniques must be taken to minimize notching and stress 
concentrations. Precautions must be taken to minimize stresses caused by 
doglegs, improper stiffness ratios, improper torque, whip, abrasive wear 
on tool joints, and joint imbalance.
    (6) Flare system. The flare outlet must be of a diameter that allows 
easy nonrestricted flow of gas. You must locate flare line outlets on 
the downside of the facility and as far from the facility as is 
feasible, taking into account the prevailing wind directions, the wake 
effects caused by the facility and adjacent structure(s), and the height 
of all such facilities and structures. You must equip the flare outlet 
with an automatic ignition system including a pilot-light gas source or 
an equivalent system. You must have alternate methods for igniting the 
flare. You must pipe to the flare system used for H<INF>2</INF>S all 
vents from production process equipment, tanks, relief valves, burst 
plates, and similar devices.
    (7) Corrosion mitigation. You must use effective means of monitoring 
and controlling corrosion caused by acid gases (H<INF>2</INF>S and 
CO<INF>2</INF>) in both the downhole and surface portions of a 
production system. You must take specific corrosion monitoring and 
mitigating measures in areas of unusually severe corrosion where 
accumulation of water and/or higher concentration of H<INF>2</INF>S 
exists.
    (8) Wireline lubricators. Lubricators which may be exposed to fluids 
containing H<INF>2</INF>S must be of H<INF>2</INF>S-resistant materials.
    (9) Fuel and/or instrument gas. You must not use gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF>S for instrument gas. You must not use gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF>S for fuel gas without the prior approval of the District 
Manager.
    (10) Sensing lines and devices. Metals used for sensing line and 
safety-control devices which are necessarily exposed to H<INF>2</INF>S-
bearing fluids must be constructed of H<INF>2</INF>S-corrosion resistant 
materials or coated so as to resist H<INF>2</INF>S corrosion.
    (11) Elastomer seals. You must use H<INF>2</INF>S-resistant 
materials for all seals which may be exposed to fluids containing 
H<INF>2</INF>S.
    (12) Water disposal. If you dispose of produced water by means other 
than subsurface injection, you must submit to the District Manager an 
analysis of the anticipated H<INF>2</INF>S content of the water at the 
final treatment vessel and at the discharge point. The District Manager 
may require that the water be treated for removal of H<INF>2</INF>S. The 
District Manager may require the submittal of an updated analysis if the 
water disposal rate or the potential H<INF>2</INF>S content increases.
    (13) Deck drains. You must equip open deck drains with traps or 
similar devices to prevent the escape of H<INF>2</INF>S gas into the 
atmosphere.
    (14) Sealed voids. You must take precautions to eliminate sealed 
spaces in piping designs (e.g., slip-on flanges, reinforcing pads) which 
can be invaded

    (b) BOP test pressures. When you test the BOP system, you must 
conduct a low pressure and a high pressure test for each BOP component. 
Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to 
demonstrate that the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. 
The District Manager may approve or require other test pressures or 
practices. Required test pressures are as follows:
    (1) All low pressure tests must be between 200 and 300 psi. Any 
initial pressure above 300 psi must be bled back to a pressure between 
200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the initial pressure 
exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and reinitiate the test. 
You must conduct the low pressure test before the high pressure test.
    (2) For ram-type BOP's, choke manifold, and other BOP equipment, the 
high pressure test must equal the rated working pressure of the 
equipment.
    (3) For annular-type BOP's, the high pressure test must equal 70 
percent of the rated working pressure of the equipment.
    (c) Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required 
pressure for 5 minutes.
    (1) For surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP 
system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if you record your test 
pressures on the outermost half of a 4-hour

[[Page 165]]

chart, on a 1-hour chart, or on a digital recorder.
    (2) If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a 
test, you must remedy the problem and retest the affected component(s).
    (d) Additional BOP testing requirements. You must:
    (1) Use water to test the surface BOP system;
    (2) Stump test a subsurface BOP system before installation. You must 
use water to stump test a subsea BOP system. You may use drilling or 
completion fluids to conduct subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system;
    (3) Alternate tests between control stations and pods. If a control 
station or pod is not functional, you must suspend further completion 
operations until that station or pod is operable;
    (4) Pressure test the blind or blind-shear ram at least every 30 
days;
    (5) Function test annulars and rams every 7 days;
    (6) Pressure-test variable bore-pipe rams against all sizes of pipe 
in use, excluding drill collars and bottom-hole tools;
    (7) Test affected BOP components following the disconnection or 
repair of any well-pressure containment seal in the wellhead or BOP 
stack assembly;
    (8) Test all ROV intervention functions on your subsea BOP stack 
during the stump test. You must also test at least one set of rams 
during the initial test on the seafloor. You must submit test procedures 
with your APM for District Manager approval. You must:
    (i) Ensure that the ROV hot stabs are function tested and are 
capable of actuating, at a minimum, one set of pipe rams and one set of 
blind-shear rams and unlatching the LMRP;
    (ii) Document all your test results and make them available to 
BOEMRE upon request; and
    (9) Function test autoshear and deadman systems on your subsea BOP 
stack during the stump test. You must also test the deadman system 
during the initial test on the seafloor.
    (i) You must submit test procedures with your APM for District 
Manager approval.
    (ii) You must document all your test results and make them available 
to BOEMRE upon request.
    (e) Postponing BOP tests. You may postpone a BOP test if you have 
well-control problems. You must conduct the required BOP test as soon as 
possible (i.e., first trip out of the hole) after the problem has been 
remedied. You must record the reason for postponing any test in the 
driller's report.
    (f) Weekly crew drills. You must conduct a weekly drill to 
familiarize all personnel engaged in well-completion operations with 
appropriate safety measures.
    (g) BOP inspections. (1) You must inspect your BOP system to ensure 
that the equipment functions properly. The BOP inspections must meet or 
exceed the provisions of Sections 17.10 and 18.10, Inspections, 
described in API RP 53, Recommended Practices for Blowout Prevention 
Equipment Systems for Drilling Wells (incorporated by reference as 
specified in Sec. 250.198). You must document the procedures used, 
record the results, and make them available to BOEMRE upon request. You 
must maintain your records on the rig for 2 years or from the date of 
your last major inspection, whichever is longer.
    (2) You must visually inspect your BOP system and marine riser at 
least once each day if weather and sea conditions permit. You may use 
television cameras to inspect this equipment. The District Manager may 
approve alternate methods and frequencies to inspect a marine riser.
    (h) BOP maintenance. You must maintain your BOP system to ensure 
that the equipment functions properly. The BOP maintenance must meet or 
exceed the provisions of Sections 17.11 and 18.11, Maintenance; and 
Sections 17.12 and 18.12, Quality Management, described in API RP 53, 
Recommended Practices for Blowout Prevention Equipment Systems for 
Drilling Wells (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 
250.198). You must document the procedures used, record the results, and 
make available to BOEMRE upon request. You must maintain your records on 
the rig for 2 years or from the date of your last major inspection, 
whichever is longer.
    (i) BOP test records. You must record the time, date, and results of 
all pressure tests, actuations, crew drills, and

[[Page 166]]

inspections of the BOP system, system components, and marine riser in 
the driller's report. In addition, you must:
    (1) Record BOP test pressures on pressure charts;
    (2) Have your onsite representative certify (sign and date) BOP test 
charts and reports as correct;
    (3) Document the sequential order of BOP and auxiliary equipment 
testing and the pressure and duration of each test. You may reference a 
BOP test plan if it is available at the facility;
    (4) Identify the control station or pod used during the test;
    (5) Identify any problems or irregularities observed during BOP 
system and equipment testing and record actions taken to remedy the 
problems or irregularities;
    (6) Retain all records including pressure charts, driller's report, 
and referenced documents pertaining to BOP tests, actuations, and 
inspections at the facility for the duration of the completion activity; 
and
    (7) After completion of the well, you must retain all the records 
listed in paragraph (i)(6) of this section for a period of 2 years at 
the facility, at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility, or 
at another location conveniently available to the District Manager.
    (j) Alternate methods. The District Manager may require, or approve, 
more frequent testing, as well as different test pressures and 
inspection methods, or other practices.

<R05>
Sec. 250.518  What are the requirements for casing pressure management?

    Once you install your wellhead, you must meet the casing pressure 
management requirements of API RP 90 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in Sec. 250.198) and the requirements of Sec. Sec. 250.519 
through 250.530. If there is a conflict between API RP 90 and the casing 
pressure requirements of this subpart, you must follow the requirements 
of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 250.519  How often do I have to monitor for casing pressure?

    You must monitor for casing pressure in your well according to the 
following table:

Sec. 250.520  When do I have to perform a casing diagnostic test?

    (a) You must perform a casing diagnostic test within 30 days after 
first observing or imposing casing pressure according to the following 
table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    you must perform a casing diagnostic
        If you have a * * *                     test if * * *
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) fixed platform well,..........  the casing pressure is greater than

                                     measured at the subsea wellhead.
(3) hybrid well,..................  a riser or the production casing
                                     pressure is greater than 100 psig
                                     measured at the surface.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) You are exempt from performing a diagnostic pressure test for 
the production casing on a well operating under active gas lift.


<R05>
Sec. 250.521  How do I manage the thermal effects caused by initial production 

on a newly completed or recompleted well?

    A newly completed or recompleted well often has thermal casing 
pressure during initial startup. Bleeding casing pressure during the 
startup process is considered a normal and necessary operation to manage 
thermal casing pressure; therefore, you do not need to evaluate these 
operations as a casing diagnostic test. After 30 days of continuous 
production, the initial production startup operation is complete and you 
must perform casing diagnostic testing as required in Sec. Sec. 250.520 
and 250.522.


<R05>
Sec. 250.522  When do I have to repeat casing diagnostic testing?

    Casing diagnostic testing must be repeated according to the 
following table:

<R05>
Sec. 250.523  How long do I keep records of casing pressure and diagnostic tests?

    Records of casing pressure and diagnostic tests must be kept at the 
field office nearest the well for a minimum of 2 years. The last casing 
diagnostic test for each casing or riser must be retained at the field 
office nearest the well until the well is abandoned.


<R05>
Sec. 250.524  When am I required to take action from my casing diagnostic test?

    You must take action if you have any of the following conditions:
    (a) Any fixed platform well with a casing pressure exceeding its 
maximum allowable wellhead operating pressure (MAWOP);
    (b) Any fixed platform well with a casing pressure that is greater 
than 100 psig and that cannot bleed to 0 psig through a \1/2\-inch 
needle valve within 24 hours, or is not bled to 0 psig during a casing 
diagnostic test;
    (c) Any well that has demonstrated tubing/casing, tubing/riser, 
casing/casing, riser/casing, or riser/riser communication;
    (d) Any well that has sustained casing pressure (SCP) and is bled 
down to prevent it from exceeding its MAWOP, except during initial 
startup operations described in Sec. 250.521;
    (e) Any hybrid well with casing or riser pressure exceeding 100 
psig; or
    (f) Any subsea well with a casing pressure 100 psig greater than the

component. You must conduct the low-pressure test before the high-
pressure test. For purposes of this section, BOP system components 
include ram-type BOP's, related control equipment, choke and kill lines, 
and valves, manifolds, strippers, and safety valves. Surface BOP systems 
must be pressure tested with water.
    (1) Low pressure tests. All BOP system components must be 
successfully tested to a low pressure between 200 and 300 psi. Any 
initial pressure equal to or greater than 300 psi must be bled back to a 
pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the 
initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero before 
starting the test.

[[Page 175]]

    (2) High pressure tests. All BOP system components must be 
successfully tested to the rated working pressure of the BOP equipment, 
or as otherwise approved by the District Manager. The annular-type BOP 
must be successfully tested at 70 percent of its rated working pressure 
or as otherwise approved by the District Manager.
    (3) Other testing requirements. Variable bore pipe rams must be 
pressure tested against the largest and smallest sizes of tubulars in 
use (jointed pipe, seamless pipe) in the well.
    (b) The BOP systems shall be tested at the following times:
    (1) When installed;
    (2) At least every 7 days, alternating between control stations and 
at staggered intervals to allow each crew to operate the equipment. If 
either control system is not functional, further operations shall be 
suspended until the nonfunctional, system is operable. The test every 7 
days is not required for blind or blind-shear rams. The blind or blind-
shear rams shall be tested at least once every 30 days during operation. 
A longer period between blowout preventer tests is allowed when there is 
a stuck pipe or pressure-control operation and remedial efforts are 
being performed. The tests shall be conducted as soon as possible and 
before normal operations resume. The reason for postponing testing shall 
be entered into the operations log.
    (3) Following repairs that require disconnecting a pressure seal in 
the assembly, the affected seal will be pressure tested.
    (c) All personnel engaged in well-workover operations shall 
participate in a weekly BOP drill to familiarize crew members with 
appropriate safety measures.
    (d) You may conduct a stump test for the BOP system on location. A 
plan describing the stump test procedures must be included in your Form 
MMS-124, Application for Permit to Modify, and must be approved by the 
District Manager.
    (e) You must test the coiled tubing connector to a low pressure of 
200 to 300 psi, followed by a high pressure test to the rated working 
pressure of the connector or the expected surface pressure, whichever is 
less. You must successfully pressure test the dual check valves to the 
rated working pressure of the connector, the rated working pressure of 
the dual check valve, expected surface pressure, or the collapse 
pressure of the coiled tubing, whichever is less.
    (f) You must record test pressures during BOP and coiled tubing 
tests on a pressure chart, or with a digital recorder, unless otherwise 
approved by the District Manager. The test interval for each BOP system 
component must be 5 minutes, except for coiled tubing operations, which 
must include a 10 minute high-pressure test for the coiled tubing 
string. Your representative at the facility must certify that the charts 
are correct.
    (g) The time, date, and results of all pressure tests, actuations, 
inspections, and crew drills of the BOP system, system components, and 
marine risers shall be recorded in the operations log. The BOP tests 
shall be documented in accordance with the following:
    (1) The documentation shall indicate the sequential order of BOP and 
auxiliary equipment testing and the pressure and duration of each test. 
As an alternate, the documentation in the operations log may reference a 
BOP test plan that contains the required information and is retained on 
file at the facility.
    (2) The control station used during the test shall be identified in 
the operations log. For a subsea system, the pod used during the test 
shall be identified in the operations log.
    (3) Any problems or irregularities observed during BOP and auxiliary 
equipment testing and any actions taken to remedy such problems or 
irregularities shall be noted in the operations log.
    (4) Documentation required to be entered in the operation log may 
instead be referenced in the operations log. All records including 
pressure charts, operations log, and referenced documents pertaining to 
BOP tests, actuations, and inspections, shall be available for MMS 
review at the facility for the duration of well-workover activity. 
Following completion of the well-workover activity, all such records 
shall be retained for a period of 2 years

[[Page 176]]

at the facility, at the lessee's filed office nearest the OCS facility, 
or at another location conveniently available to the District Manager.
    (h) Stump test a subsea BOP system before installation. You must:
    (1) Test all ROV intervention functions on your subsea BOP stack 
during the stump test. You must also test at least one set of rams 
during the initial test on the seafloor. You must submit test procedures 
with your APM for District Manager approval. You must:
    (i) Ensure that the ROV hot stabs are function tested and are 
capable of actuating, at a minimum, one set of pipe rams and one set of 
blind-shear rams and unlatching the LMRP;
    (ii) Document all your test results and make them available to 
BOEMRE upon request; and
    (2) Function test autoshear and deadman systems on your subsea BOP 
stack during the stump test. You must also test the deadman system 
during the initial test on the seafloor. You must:
    (i) Submit test procedures with your APM for District Manager 
approval.
    (ii) Document the results of each test and make them available to 
BOEMRE upon request.
    (3) Use water to stump test a subsea BOP system. You may use 
drilling or completion fluids to conduct subsequent tests of a subsea 
BOP system.

Sec. 250.801  Subsurface safety devices.

    (a) General. All tubing installations open to hydrocarbon-bearing 
zones shall be equipped with subsurface safety devices that will shut 
off the flow from the well in the event of an emergency unless, after 
application and justification, the well is determined by the District 
Manager to be incapable of natural flowing. These devices may consist of 
a surface-controlled subsurface safety valve (SSSV), a subsurface-
controlled SSSV, an injection valve, a tubing plug, or a tubing/annular 
subsurface safety device, and any associated safety valve lock or 
landing nipple.
    (b) Specifications for SSSV's. Surface-controlled and subsurface-
controlled SSSV's and safety valve locks and landing nipples installed 
in the OCS shall conform to the requirements in Sec. 250.806 of this 
part.
    (c) Surface-controlled SSSV's. All tubing installations open to a 
hydrocarbon-bearing zone which is capable of natural flow shall be 
equipped with a surface-controlled SSSV, except as specified in 
paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section. The surface controls may 
be located on the site or a remote location. Wells not previously 
equipped with a surface-controlled SSSV and wells in which a surface-
controlled SSSV has been replaced with a subsurface-controlled SSSV in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be equipped with 
a surface-controlled SSSV when the tubing is first removed and 
reinstalled.
    (d) Subsurface-controlled SSSV's. Wells may be equipped with 
subsurface-controlled SSSV's in lieu of a surface-controlled SSSV 
provided the lessee demonstrates to the District Manager's satisfaction 
that one of the following criteria are met:
    (1) Wells not previously equipped with surface-controlled SSSV's 
shall be so equipped when the tubing is first removed and reinstalled,
    (2) The subsurface-controlled SSSV is installed in wells completed 
from a single-well or multiwell satellite caisson or seafloor 
completions, or
    (3) The subsurface-controlled SSSV is installed in wells with a 
surface-controlled SSSV that has become inoperable and cannot be 
repaired without removal and reinstallation of the tubing.
    (e) Design, installation, and operation of SSSV's. The SSSV's shall 
be designed, installed, operated, and maintained to ensure reliable 
operation.
    (1) The device shall be installed at a depth of 100 feet or more 
below the seafloor within 2 days after production is established. When 
warranted by conditions such as permafrost, unstable bottom conditions, 
hydrate formation, or paraffins, an alternate setting depth of the 
subsurface safety device may be approved by the District Manager.
    (2) Until a subsurface safety device is installed, the well shall be 
attended in the immediate vicinity so that emergency actions may be 
taken while the well is open to flow. During testing and inspection 
procedures, the well shall not be left unattended while open to 
production unless a properly operating subsurface-safety device has been 
installed in the well.
    (3) The well shall not be open to flow while the subsurface safety 
device is removed, except when flowing of the well is necessary for a 
particular operation such as cutting paraffin, bailing sand, or similar 
operations.
    (4) All SSSV's must be inspected, installed, maintained, and tested 
in accordance with American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 
14B, Recommended Practice for Design, Installation, Repair, and 
Operation of Subsurface Safety Valve Systems (incorporated by reference 
as specified in Sec. 250.198).
    (f) Subsurface safety devices in shut-in wells. New completions 
(perforated but not placed on production) and completions shut in for a 
period of 6 months shall be equipped with either (1) a pump-through-type 
tubing plug; (2) a surface-controlled SSSV, provided the surface control 
has been rendered inoperative; or (3) an injection valve capable of 
preventing backflow. The setting

[[Page 179]]

depth of the subsurface safety device shall be approved by the District 
Manager on a case-by-case basis, when warranted by conditions such as 
permafrost, unstable bottom conditions, hydrate formations, and 
paraffins.
    (g) Subsurface safety devices in injection wells. A surface-
controlled SSSV or an injection valve capable of preventing backflow 
shall be installed in all injection wells. This requirement is not 
applicable if the District Manager concurs that the well is incapable of 
flowing. The lessee shall verify the no-flow condition of the well 
annually.
    (h) Temporary removal for routine operations. (1) Each wireline- or 
pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device may be removed, without 
further authorization or notice, for a routine operation which does not 
require the approval of a Form MMS-124, Application for Permit to 
Modify, in Sec. 250.601 of this part for a period not to exceed 15 
days.
    (2) The well shall be identified by a sign on the wellhead stating 
that the subsurface safety device has been removed. The removal of the 
subsurface safety device shall be noted in the records as required in 
Sec. 250.804(b) of this part. If the master valve is open, a trained 
person shall be in the immediate vicinity of the well to attend the well 
so that emergency actions may be taken, if necessary.
    (3) A platform well shall be monitored, but a person need not remain 
in the well-bay area continuously if the master valve is closed. If the 
well is on a satellite structure, it must be attended or a pump-through 
plug installed in the tubing at least 100 feet below the mud line and 
the master valve closed, unless otherwise approved by the District 
Manager.
    (4) The well shall not be allowed to flow while the subsurface 
safety device is removed, except when flowing the well is necessary for 
that particular operation. The provisions of this paragraph are not 
applicable to the testing and inspection procedures in Sec. 250.804 of 
this part.
    (i) Additional safety equipment. All tubing installations in which a 
wireline- or pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device is installed 
after the effective date of this subpart shall be equipped with a 
landing nipple with flow couplings or other protective equipment above 
and below to provide for the setting of the SSSV. The control system for 
all surface-controlled SSSV's shall be an integral part of the platform 
Emergency Shutdown System (ESD). In addition to the activation of the 
ESD by manual action on the platform, the system may be activated by a 
signal from a remote location. Surface-controlled SSSV's shall close in 
response to shut-in signals from the ESD and in response to the fire 
loop or other fire detection devices.
    (j) Emergency action. In the event of an emergency, such as an 
impending storm, any well not equipped with a subsurface safety device 
and which is capable of natural flow shall have the device properly 
installed as soon as possible with due consideration being given to 
personnel safety.

Sec. 250.803  Additional production system requirements.

    (a) For all production platforms, you must comply with the following 
production safety system requirements, in addition to the requirements 
of Sec. 250.802 of this subpart and the requirements of API RP 14C 
(incorporated by reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198).
    (b) Design, installation, and operation of additional production 
systems--(1) Pressure and fired vessels. Pressure and fired vessels must 
be designed, fabricated, and code stamped in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of Sections I, IV, and VIII of the American 
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
Pressure and fired vessels must have maintenance inspection, rating, 
repair, and alteration performed in accordance with the applicable 
provisions of API Pressure Vessel Inspections Code: In-Service 
Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration, API 510 (except Sections 5.8 
and 9.5) (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 250.198).
    (i) Pressure relief valves shall be designed, installed, and 
maintained in accordance with applicable provisions of sections I, IV, 
and VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The relief valves 
shall conform to the valve-sizing and pressure-relieving requirements 
specified in these documents; however, the relief valves, except 
completely redundant relief valves, shall be set no higher than the 
maximum-allowable working pressure of the vessel. All relief valves and 
vents shall be piped in such a way as to prevent fluid from striking 
personnel or ignition sources.
    (ii) Steam generators operating at less than 15 pounds per square 
inch gauge (psig) shall be equipped with a level safety low (LSL) sensor 
which will shut off the fuel supply when the water level drops below the 
minimum safe level. Steam generators operating at greater than 15 psig 
require, in addition to an LSL, a water-feeding device which will 
automatically control the water level.
    (iii) The lessee shall use pressure recorders to establish the new 
operating pressure ranges of pressure vessels at any time when there is 
a change in operating pressures that requires new settings for the high-
pressure shut-in sensor and/or the low-pressure shut-in sensor as 
provided herein. The pressure-recorder charts used to determine current 
operating pressure ranges shall be maintained at the lessee's field 
office nearest the OCS facility or at other locations conveniently 
available to the District Manager. The high-pressure shut-in sensor 
shall be set no higher than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, 
above the highest operating pressure of the vessel. This setting shall 
also be set sufficiently below (5 percent or 5 psi, whichever is 
greater) the relief valve's set pressure to assure that the pressure 
source is shut in before the relief valve activates. The low-pressure 
shut-in sensor shall activate no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi, 
whichever is greater, below the lowest pressure in the operating range. 
The activation of low-pressure sensors on pressure vessels which operate 
at less than 5 psi shall be approved by the District Manager on a case-
by-case basis.
    (2) Flowlines. (i) You must equip flowlines from wells with high- 
and low-pressure shut-in sensors located in accordance with section A.1 
and Figure A1 of API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in 
Sec. 250.198). The lessee shall use pressure recorders to establish the 
new operating pressure ranges of flowlines at any time when there is a 
significant change in operating pressures. The most recent pressure-
recorder charts used to determine operating pressure ranges shall be 
maintained at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility or at 
other locations conveniently available to the District Manager. The 
high-pressure shut-in sensor(s) shall be set no higher than 15 percent 
or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above the highest operating pressure of 
the line. But in all cases, it shall be set sufficiently below the 
maximum shut-in wellhead pressure or the

[[Page 182]]

gas-lift supply pressure to assure actuation of the SSV. The low-
pressure shut-in sensor(s) shall be set no lower than 15 percent or 5 
psi, whichever is greater, below the lowest operating pressure of the 
line in which it is installed.
    (ii) If a well flows directly to the pipeline before separation, the 
flowline and valves from the well located upstream of and including the 
header inlet valve(s) shall have a working pressure equal to or greater 
than the maximum shut-in pressure of the well unless the flowline is 
protected by one of the following:
    (A) A relief valve which vents into the platform flare scrubber or 
some other location approved by the District Manager. The platform flare 
scrubber shall be designed to handle, without liquid-hydrocarbon 
carryover to the flare, the maximum-anticipated flow of liquid 
hydrocarbons which may be relieved to the vessel.
    (B) Two SSV's with independent high-pressure sensors installed with 
adequate volume upstream of any block valve to allow sufficient time for 
the valve(s) to close before exceeding the maximum allowable working 
pressure.
    (iii) If you are installing flowlines constructed of unbonded 
flexible pipe on a floating platform, you must:
    (A) Review the manufacturer's Design Methodology Verification Report 
and the independent verification agent's (IVA's) certificate for the 
design methodology contained in that report to ensure that the 
manufacturer has complied with the requirements of API Spec 17J 
(incorporated by reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198);
    (B) Determine that the unbonded flexible pipe is suitable for its 
intended purpose on the lease or pipeline right-of-way;
    (C) Submit to the MMS District Manager the manufacturer's design 
specifications for the unbonded flexible pipe; and
    (D) Submit to the MMS District Manager a statement certifying that 
the pipe is suitable for its intended use and that the manufacturer has 
complied with the IVA requirements of API Spec 17J (incorporated by 
reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198).
    (3) Safety sensors. All shutdown devices, valves, and pressure 
sensors shall function in a manual reset mode. Sensors with integral 
automatic reset shall be equipped with an appropriate device to override 
the automatic reset mode. All pressure sensors shall be equipped to 
permit testing with an external pressure source.
    (4) ESD. The ESD must conform to the requirements of Appendix C,

which have erosion-control programs in effect and the results of the 
programs, shall be maintained by the lessee for a period of 2 years and 
shall be made available to MMS upon request.
    (c) General platform operations. (1) Surface or subsurface safety 
devices shall not be bypassed or blocked out of service unless they are 
temporarily out of service for startup, maintenance, or testing 
procedures. Only the minimum number of safety devices shall be taken out 
of service. Personnel shall monitor the bypassed or blocked-out 
functions until the safety devices are placed back in service. Any 
surface or subsurface safety device which is temporarily out of service 
shall be flagged.
    (2) When wells are disconnected from producing facilities and blind 
flanged, equipped with a tubing plug, or the master valves have been 
locked closed, you are not required to comply with the provisions of API 
RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 250.198) or this 
regulation concerning the following:
    (i) Automatic fail-close SSV's on wellhead assemblies, and
    (ii) The PSH and PSL shut-in sensors in flowlines from wells.
    (3) When pressure or atmospheric vessels are isolated from 
production facilities (e.g., inlet valve locked closed or inlet blind-
flanged) and are to remain isolated for an extended period of time, 
safety device compliance with API RP 14C or this subpart is not 
required.
    (4) All open-ended lines connected to producing facilities and wells 
shall be plugged or blind-flanged, except those lines designed to be 
open-ended such as flare or vent lines.
    (d) Welding and burning practices and procedures. All welding,

(PVP), MMS will cancel the approved platform application 1 year after 
the approval has been granted if the platform has not been installed. If 
MMS cancels the approval, you must resubmit your platform application 
and receive MMS approval if you still plan to install the platform.
    (2) For platforms subject to the PVP, cancellation of an approval 
will be on an individual platform basis. For these platforms, MMS will 
identify the date when the installation approval will be cancelled (if 
installation has not occurred) during the application and approval 
process. If MMS cancels your installation approval, you must resubmit 
your platform application and receive

[[Page 189]]

MMS approval if you still plan to install the platform.

<R05>
Sec. 250.906  What must I do to obtain approval for the proposed site of my platform?

    (a) Shallow hazards surveys. You must perform a high-resolution or 
acoustic-profiling survey to obtain information on the conditions 
existing at and near the surface of the seafloor. You must collect 
information through this survey sufficient to determine the presence of 
the following features and their likely effects on your proposed 
platform:
    (1) Shallow faults;
    (2) Gas seeps or shallow gas;
    (3) Slump blocks or slump sediments;
    (4) Shallow water flows;
    (5) Hydrates; or
    (6) Ice scour of seafloor sediments.
    (b) Geologic surveys. You must perform a geological survey relevant 
to the design and siting of your platform. Your geological survey must 
assess:

[[Page 193]]

    (1) Seismic activity at your proposed site;
    (2) Fault zones, the extent and geometry of faulting, and 
attenuation effects of geologic conditions near your site; and
    (3) For platforms located in producing areas, the possibility and 
effects of seafloor subsidence.
    (c) Subsurface surveys. Depending upon the design and location of 
your proposed platform and the results of the shallow hazard and 
geologic surveys, the Regional Supervisor may require you to perform a 
subsurface survey. This survey will include a testing program for 
investigating the stratigraphic and engineering properties of the soil 
that may affect the foundations or anchoring systems for your facility. 
The testing program must include adequate in situ testing, boring, and 
sampling to examine all important soil and rock strata to determine its 
strength classification, deformation properties, and dynamic 
characteristics. If required to perform a subsurface survey, you must 
prepare and submit to the Regional Supervisor a summary report to 
briefly describe the results of your soil testing program, the various 
field and laboratory test methods employed, and the applicability of 
these methods as they pertain to the quality of the samples, the type of 
soil, and the anticipated design application. You must explain how the 
engineering properties of each soil stratum affect the design of your 
platform. In your explanation you must describe the uncertainties 
inherent in your overall testing program, and the reliability and 
applicability of each test method.
    (d) Overall site investigation report. You must prepare and submit 
to the Regional Supervisor an overall site investigation report for your 
platform that integrates the findings of your shallow hazards surveys 
and geologic surveys, and, if required, your subsurface surveys. Your 
overall site investigation report must include analyses of the potential 
for:
    (1) Scouring of the seafloor;
    (2) Hydraulic instability;
    (3) The occurrence of sand waves;
    (4) Instability of slopes at the platform location;
    (5) Liquifaction, or possible reduction of soil strength due to 
increased pore pressures;
    (6) Degradation of subsea permafrost layers;
    (7) Cyclic loading;
    (8) Lateral loading;
    (9) Dynamic loading;
    (10) Settlements and displacements;
    (11) Plastic deformation and formation collapse mechanisms; and
    (12) Soil reactions on the platform foundations or anchoring 
systems.


<R05>
Sec. 250.907  Where must I locate foundation boreholes?

    (a) For fixed or bottom-founded platforms and tension leg platforms, 
your maximum distance from any foundation pile to a soil boring must not 
exceed 500 feet.
    (b) For deepwater floating platforms which utilize catenary or taut-
leg moorings, you must take borings at the most heavily loaded anchor 
location, at the anchor points approximately 120 and 240 degrees around 
the anchor pattern from that boring, and, as necessary, other points 
throughout the anchor pattern to establish the soil profile suitable for 
foundation design purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 250.908  What are the minimum structural fatigue design requirements?

    (a) API RP 2A-WSD, Recommended Practice for Planning, Designing and 
Constructing Fixed Offshore Platforms (incorporated by reference as 
specified in 30 CFR 250.198), requires that the design fatigue life of 
each joint and member be twice the intended service life of the 
structure. When designing your platform, the following table provides 
minimum fatigue life safety factors for critical structural members and 
joints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The documents incorporated by reference in Sec. 250.901 may 
require larger safety factors than indicated in paragraph (a) of this 
section for some key components. When the documents incorporated by 
reference require a larger safety factor than the chart in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the requirements of the incorporated document will 
prevail.

                      Platform Verification Program


<R05>
Sec. 250.909  What is the Platform Verification Program?

    The Platform Verification Program is the MMS approval process for 
ensuring that floating platforms; platforms of a new or unique design; 
platforms in seismic areas; or platforms located in deepwater or 
frontier areas meet stringent requirements for design and construction. 
The program is applied during construction of new platforms and major 
modifications of, or repairs to, existing platforms. These requirements 
are in addition to the requirements of the Platform Approval Program 
described in Sec. Sec. 250.904 through 250.908 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 250.910  Which of my facilities are subject to the Platform Verification Program?

    (a) All new fixed or bottom-founded platforms that meet any of the 
following five conditions are subject to the Platform Verification 
Program:
    (1) Platforms installed in water depths exceeding 400 feet (122 
meters);
    (2) Platforms having natural periods in excess of 3 seconds;
    (3) Platforms installed in areas of unstable bottom conditions;
    (4) Platforms having configurations and designs which have not 
previously been used or proven for use in the area; or
    (5) Platforms installed in seismically active areas.
    (b) All new floating platforms are subject to the Platform 
Verification Program to the extent indicated in the following table:

    (c) If a platform is originally subject to the Platform Verification 
Program, then the conversion of that platform at that same site for a 
new purpose, or making a major modification of, or major repair to, that 
platform, is also

[[Page 195]]

subject to the Platform Verification Program. A major modification 
includes any modification that increases loading on a platform by 10 
percent or more. A major repair is a corrective operation involving 
structural members affecting the structural integrity of a portion or 
all of the platform. Before you make a major modification or repair to a 
floating platform, you must obtain approval from both the MMS and the 
USCG.
    (d) The applicability of Platform Verification Program requirements 
to other types of facilities will be determined by MMS on a case-by-case 
basis.

Sec. 250.917  What are the CVA's primary duties during the fabrication phase?

    (a) The CVA must use good engineering judgement and practices in 
conducting an independent assessment of the fabrication activities. The 
CVA must monitor the fabrication of the platform or major modification 
to ensure that it has been built according to the approved design and 
the fabrication plan. If the CVA finds that fabrication procedures are 
changed or design specifications are modified, the CVA must inform you. 
If you accept the modifications, then the CVA must so inform the 
Regional Supervisor.
    (b) Primary duties of the CVA during the fabrication phase include

          Inspection, Maintenance, and Assessment of Platforms


<R05>
Sec. 250.919  What in-service inspection requirements must I meet?

    (a) You must submit a comprehensive in-service inspection report 
annually by November 1 to the Regional Supervisor that must include:
    (1) A list of fixed and floating platforms you inspected in the 
preceding 12 months;
    (2) The extent and area of inspection for both the above-water and 
underwater portions of the platform and the pertinent components of the 
mooring system for floating platforms;
    (3) The type of inspection employed (e.g., visual, magnetic 
particle, ultrasonic testing);
    (4) The overall structural condition of each platform, including a 
corrosion protection evaluation; and
    (5) A summary of the inspection results indicating what repairs, if 
any, were needed.
    (b) If any of your structures have been exposed to a natural 
occurrence (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, or tropical storm), the 
Regional Supervisor may require you to submit an initial report of all 
structural damage, followed by subsequent updates, which include the 
following:
    (1) A list of affected structures;
    (2) A timetable for conducting the inspections described in section 
14.4.3 of API RP 2A-WSD (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 
250.198); and

ability to withstand any anticipated environmental conditions, and any 
remediation plans. Under Sec. Sec. 250.900(b)(3) and 250.905, you must 
obtain approval from MMS before you make major repairs of any damage 
unless you meet the requirements of Sec. 250.900(c).

[73 FR 64547, Oct. 30, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 250.920  What are the MMS requirements for assessment of fixed platforms?

    (a) You must document all wells, equipment, and pipelines supported 
by the platform if you intend to use either the A-2 or A-3 assessment 
category. Assessment categories are defined in API RP 2A-WSD, Section 
17.3. If MMS objects to the assessment category you used for your 
assessment, you may need to redesign and/or modify the platform to 
adequately demonstrate that the platform is able to withstand the 
environmental loadings for the appropriate assessment category.
    (b) You must perform an analysis check when your platform will have 
additional personnel, additional topside facilities, increased 
environmental or operational loading, or inadequate deck height your 
platform suffered significant damage (e.g., experienced damage to 
primary structural members or conductor guide trays or global structural 
integrity is adversely affected); or the exposure category changes to a 
more restrictive level (see Sections 17.2.1 through 17.2.5 of API RP 2A-
WSD for a description of assessment initiators).
    (c) You must initiate mitigation actions for platforms that do not 
pass the assessment process of API RP 2A-WSD. You must submit 
applications for your mitigation actions (e.g., repair, modification, 
decommissioning) to the Regional Supervisor for approval before you 
conduct the work.
    (d) The MMS may require you to conduct a platform design basis check 
when the reduced environmental loading criteria contained in API RP 2A-
WSD Section 17.6 are not applicable.
    (e) By November 1, 2009, you must submit a complete list of all the 
platforms you operate, together with all the appropriate data to support 
the assessment category you assign to each platform and the platform 
assessment initiators (as defined in API RP 2A-WSD) to the Regional 
Supervisor. You must submit subsequent complete lists and the 
appropriate data to support the consequence-of-failure category every 5 
years thereafter, or as directed by the Regional Supervisor.
    (f) The use of Section 17, Assessment of Existing Platforms, of API 
RP 2A-WSD is limited to existing fixed structures that are serving their 
original approved purpose. You must obtain approval from the Regional 
Supervisor for any change in purpose of the platform, following the 
provisions of API RP 2A-WSD, Section 15, Re-use.

<R05>
Sec. 250.921  How do I analyze my platform for cumulative fatigue?

    (a) If you are required to analyze cumulative fatigue on your 
platform because of the results of an inspection or platform assessment, 
you must ensure that the safety factors for critical elements listed in 
Sec. 250.908 are met or exceeded.
    (b) If the calculated life of a joint or member does not meet the 
criteria of Sec. 250.908, you must either mitigate the load, strengthen 
the joint or member, or develop an increased inspection process.

             Subpart J_Pipelines and Pipeline Rights-of-Way


<R05>
Sec. 250.1000  General requirements.

    (a) Pipelines and associated valves, flanges, and fittings shall be 
designed, installed, operated, maintained, and abandoned to provide safe 
and pollution-free transportation of fluids in a manner which does not 
unduly interfere with other uses in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).
    (b) An application must be accompanied by payment of the service fee 
listed in Sec. 250.125 and submitted to the Regional Supervisor and 
approval obtained before:
    (1) Installation, modification, or abandonment of a lease term 
pipeline;
    (2) Installation or modification of a right-of-way (other than lease 
term) pipeline; or
    (3) Modification or relinquishment of a pipeline right-of way.

[[Page 201]]

    (c)(1) Department of the Interior (DOI) pipelines, as defined in 
Sec. 250.1001, must meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 250.1000 
through 250.1008.
    (2) A pipeline right-of-way grant holder must identify in writing to 
the Regional Supervisor the operator of any pipeline located on its 
right-of-way, if the operator is different from the right-of-way grant 
holder.
    (3) A producing operator must identify for its own records, on all 
existing pipelines located on its lease or right-of-way, the specific 
points at which operating responsibility transfers to a transporting 
operator.
    (i) Each producing operator must, if practical, durably mark all of 
its above-water transfer points by April 14, 1999 or the date a pipeline 
begins service, whichever is later.
    (ii) If it is not practical to durably mark a transfer point, and 
the transfer point is located above water, then the operator must 
identify the transfer point on a schematic located on the facility.
    (iii) If a transfer point is located below water, then the operator 
must identify the transfer point on a schematic and provide the 
schematic to MMS upon request.
    (iv) If adjoining producing and transporting operators cannot agree 
on a transfer point by April 14, 1999, the MMS Regional Supervisor and 
the Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 
Regional Director may jointly determine the transfer point.
    (4) The transfer point serves as a regulatory boundary. An operator 
may write to the MMS Regional Supervisor to request an exception to this 
requirement for an individual facility or area. The Regional Supervisor, 
in consultation with the OPS Regional Director and affected parties, may 
grant the request.
    (5) Pipeline segments designed, constructed, maintained, and 
operated under DOT regulations but transferring to DOI regulation as of 
October 16, 1998, may continue to operate under DOT design and 
construction requirements until significant modifications or repairs are 
made to those segments. After October 16, 1998, MMS operational and 
maintenance requirements will apply to those segments.
    (6) Any producer operating a pipeline that crosses into State waters 
without first connecting to a transporting operator's facility on the 
OCS must comply with this subpart. Compliance must extend from the point 
where hydrocarbons are first produced, through and including the last 
valve and associated safety equipment (e.g., pressure safety sensors) on 
the last production facility on the OCS.
    (7) Any producer operating a pipeline that connects facilities on 
the OCS must comply with this subpart.
    (8) Any operator of a pipeline that has a valve on the OCS 
downstream (landward) of the last production facility may ask in writing 
that the MMS Regional Supervisor recognize that valve as the last point 
MMS will exercise its regulatory authority.
    (9) A pipeline segment is not subject to MMS regulations for design, 
construction, operation, and maintenance if:
    (i) It is downstream (generally shoreward) of the last valve and 
associated safety equipment on the last production facility on the OCS; 
and
    (ii) It is subject to regulation under 49 CFR parts 192 and 195.
    (10) DOT may inspect all upstream safety equipment (including 
valves, over-pressure protection devices, cathodic protection equipment, 
and pigging devices, etc.) that serve to protect the integrity of DOT-
regulated pipeline segments.
    (11) OCS pipeline segments not subject to DOT regulation under 49 
CFR parts 192 and 195 are subject to all MMS regulations.
    (12) A producer may request that its pipeline operate under DOT 
regulations governing pipeline design, construction, operation, and 
maintenance.
    (i) The operator's request must be in the form of a written petition 
to the MMS Regional Supervisor that states the justification for the 
pipeline to operate under DOT regulation.
    (ii) The Regional Supervisor will decide, on a case-by-case basis,

Sec. 250.1003  Installation, testing, and repair requirements for DOI pipelines.

    (a)(1) Pipelines greater than 8-5/8 inches in diameter and installed 
in water depths of less than 200 feet shall be buried to a depth of at 
least 3 feet unless they are located in pipeline congested areas or 
seismically active areas as determined by the Regional Supervisor. 
Nevertheless, the Regional Supervisor may require burial of any pipeline 
if the Regional Supervisor determines that such burial will reduce the 
likelihood of environmental degradation or that the pipeline may 
constitute a hazard to trawling operations or other uses. A trawl test 
or diver survey may be required to determine whether or not pipeline 
burial is necessary or to determine whether a pipeline has been properly 
buried.
    (2) Pipeline valves, taps, tie-ins, capped lines, and repaired 
sections that could be obstructive shall be provided with at least 3 
feet of cover unless the Regional Supervisor determines that such items 
present no hazard to trawling or other operations. A protective device 
may be used to cover an obstruction in lieu of burial if it is approved 
by the Regional Supervisor prior to installation.
    (3) Pipelines shall be installed with a minimum separation of 18 
inches at pipeline crossings and from obstructions.
    (4) Pipeline risers installed after April 1, 1988, shall be 
protected from physical damage that could result from contact with 
floating vessels. Riser protection on pipelines installed on or before 
April 1, 1988, may be required when the Regional Supervisor determines 
that significant damage potential exists.
    (b)(1) Pipelines shall be pressure tested with water at a stabilized 
pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at least 8 hours when 
installed, relocated, uprated, or reactivated after being out-of-service 
for more than 1 year.
    (2) Prior to returning a pipeline to service after a repair, the 
pipeline shall be pressure tested with water or processed natural gas at 
a minimum stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at 
least 2 hours.
    (3) Pipelines shall not be pressure tested at a pressure which 
produces a stress in the pipeline in excess of 95 percent of the 
specified minimum-yield strength of the pipeline. A temperature recorder 
measuring test fluid temperature synchronized with a pressure recorder 
along with deadweight test readings shall be employed for all pressure 
testing. When a pipeline is pressure tested, no observable leakage shall 
be allowed. Pressure gauges and recorders shall be of sufficient 
accuracy to verify that leakage is not occurring.
    (4) The Regional Supervisor may require pressure testing of 
pipelines to verify the integrity of the system when the Regional 
Supervisor determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
line has been damaged or weakened by external or internal conditions.
    (c) When a pipeline is repaired utilizing a clamp, the clamp shall 
be a full

[[Page 205]]

encirclement clamp able to withstand the anticipated pipeline pressure.

the pipeline's MAOP.
    (4) Crossing pipelines on production or manned nonproduction 
platforms which do not receive production from the platform shall be 
equipped with an SDV immediately upon boarding the platform. The SDV 
shall be operated by a PSHL on the departing pipelines and connected to 
the platform automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.
    (5) The Regional Supervisor may require that oil pipelines be 
equipped with a metering system to provide a continuous volumetric 
comparison between the input to the line at the structure(s) and the 
deliveries onshore. The system shall include an alarm system and shall 
be of adequate sensitivity to detect variations between input and 
discharge volumes. In lieu of the foregoing, a system capable of 
detecting leaks in the pipeline may be substituted with the approval of 
the Regional Supervisor.
    (6) Pipelines incoming to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with a 
block valve and an FSV. Bidirectional pipelines connected to a subsea 
tie-in shall be equipped with only a block valve.

only be equipped with an FSV installed immediately upstream of each 
casing annulus or the first inlet valve on the christmas tree.
    (8) Bidirectional pipelines shall be equipped with a PSHL and an SDV 
immediately upon boarding each platform.
    (9) Pipeline pumps must comply with section A7 of API RP 14C 
(incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 250.198). The setting 
levels for the PSHL devices are specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) If the required safety equipment is rendered ineffective or 
removed from service on pipelines which are continued in operation, an 
equivalent degree of safety shall be provided. The safety equipment 
shall be identified by the placement of a sign on the equipment stating 
that the equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service.

    An applicant, by accepting a right-of-way grant, agrees to comply 
with the following requirements:
    (a) The right-of-way holder shall comply with applicable laws and 
regulations and the terms of the grant.
    (b) The granting of the right-of-way shall be subject to the express 
condition that the rights granted shall not prevent or interfere in any 
way with the management, administration, or the granting of other rights 
by the United States, either prior or subsequent to the granting of the 
right-of-way. Moreover, the holder agrees to allow the occupancy and use 
by the United States, its lessees, or other right-of-way holders, of any 
part of the right-of-way grant not actually occupied or necessarily 
incident to its use for any necessary operations involved in the 
management, administration, or the enjoyment of such other granted 
rights.
    (c) If the right-of-way holder discovers any archaeological resource 
while conducting operations within the right-of-way, the right-of-way 
holder shall immediately halt operations

[[Page 209]]

within the area of the discovery and report the discovery to the 
Regional Director. If investigations determine that the resource is 
significant, the Regional Director will inform the right-of-way holder 
how to protect it.
    (d) The Regional Supervisor shall be kept informed at all times of 
the right-of-way holder's address and, if a corporation, the address of 
its principal place of business and the name and address of the officer 
or agent authorized to be served with process.
    (e) The right-of-way holder shall pay the United States or its 
lessees or right-of-way holders, as the case may be, the full value of 
all damages to the property of the United States or its said lessees or 
right-of-way holders and shall indemnify the United States against any 
and all liability for damages to life, person, or property arising from 
the occupation and use of the area covered by the right-of-way grant.
    (f)(1) The holder of a right-of-way oil or gas pipeline shall 
transport or purchase oil or natural gas produced from submerged lands 
in the vicinity of the pipeline without discrimination and in such 
proportionate amounts as the FERC may, after a full hearing with due 
notice thereof to the interested parties, determine to be reasonable, 
taking into account, among other things, conservation and the prevention 
of waste.
    (2) Unless otherwise exempted by FERC pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 
1334(f)(2), the holder shall--
    (i) Provide open and nondiscriminatory access to a right-of-way 
pipeline to both owner and nonowner shippers, and
    (ii) Comply with the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 1334(f)(1)(B) under 
which FERC may order an expansion of the throughput capacity of a right-
of-way pipeline which is approved after September 18, 1978, and which is 
not located in the Gulf of Mexico or the Santa Barbara Channel.
    (g) The area covered by a right-of-way and all improvements thereon 
shall be kept open at all reasonable times for inspection by the 
Minerals Management Service (MMS). The right-of-way holder shall make 
available all records relative to the design, construction, operation, 
maintenance and repair, and investigations on or with regard to such 
area.
    (h) Upon relinquishment, forfeiture, or cancellation of a right-of-
way grant, the right-of-way holder shall remove all platforms, 
structures, domes over valves, pipes, taps, and valves along the right-
of-way. All of these improvements shall be removed by the holder within 
1 year of the effective date of the relinquishment, forfeiture, or 
cancellation unless this requirement is waived in writing by the 
Regional Supervisor. All such improvements not removed within the time 
provided herein shall become the property of the United States but that 
shall not relieve the holder of liability for the cost of their removal 
or for restoration of the site. Furthermore, the holder is responsible 
for accidents or damages which might occur as a result of failure to 
timely remove improvements and equipment and restore a site. An 
application for relinquishment of a right-of-way grant shall be filed in 
accordance with Sec. 250.1019 of this part.

    (a) When you apply for, or are the holder of, a right-of-way, you 
must:
    (1) Provide and maintain a $300,000 bond (in addition to the bond 
coverage required in part 256) that guarantees compliance with all the 
terms and conditions of the rights-of-way you hold in an OCS area; and
    (2) Provide additional security if the Regional Director determines 
that a bond in excess of $300,000 is needed.
    (b) For the purpose of this paragraph, there are three areas:
    (1) The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Coast;
    (2) The areas offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, 
Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and
    (3) The area offshore the Coast of Alaska.

[[Page 210]]

    (c) If, as the result of a default, the surety on a right-of-way 
grant bond makes payment to the Government of any indebtedness under a 
grant secured by the bond, the face amount of such bond and the surety's 
liability shall be reduced by the amount of such payment.
    (d) After a default, a new bond in the amount of $300,000 shall be 
posted within 6 months or such shorter period as the Regional Supervisor 
may direct. Failure to post a new bond shall be grounds for forfeiture 
of all grants covered by the defaulted bond.

Sec. 250.1016  Granting pipeline rights-of-way.

    (a) In considering an application for a right-of-way, the Regional 
Supervisor shall consider the potential effect of the associated 
pipeline on the human,

[[Page 212]]

marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), 
property, and mineral resources in the entire area during construction 
and operational phases. The Regional Supervisor shall prepare an 
environmental analysis in accordance with applicable policies and 
guidelines. To aid in the evaluation and determinations, the Regional 
Supervisor may request and consider views and recommendations of 
appropriate Federal Agencies, hold public meetings after appropriate 
notice, and consult, as appropriate, with State agencies, organizations, 
industries, and individuals. Before granting a pipeline right-of-way, 
the Regional Supervisor shall give consideration to any recommendation 
by the intergovernmental planning program, or similar process, for the 
assessment and management of OCS oil and gas transportation.
    (b) Should the proposed route of a right-of-way adjoin and 
subsequently cross any State submerged lands, the applicant shall submit 
evidence to the Regional Supervisor that the State(s) so affected has 
reviewed the application. The applicant shall also submit any comment 
received as a result of that review. In the event of a State 
recommendation to relocate the proposed route, the Regional Supervisor 
may consult with the appropriate State officials.
    (c)(1) The applicant shall submit photocopies of return receipts to 
the Regional Supervisor that indicate the date that each lessee or 
right-of-way holder referenced in Sec. 250.1015(c) of this part has 
received a copy of the application. Letters of no objection may be 
submitted in lieu of the return receipts.
    (2) The Regional Supervisor shall not take final action on a right-
of-way application until the Regional Supervisor is satisfied that each 
such lessee or right-of-way holder has been afforded at least 30 days 
from the date determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in which to 
submit comments.
    (d) If a proposed right-of-way crosses any lands not subject to 
disposition by mineral leasing or restricted from oil and gas 
activities, it shall be rejected by the Regional Supervisor unless the 
Federal Agency with jurisdiction over such excluded or restricted area 
gives its consent to the granting of the right-of-way. In such case, the 
applicant, upon a request filed within 30 days after receipt of the 
notification of such rejection, shall be allowed an opportunity to 
eliminate the conflict.
    (e)(1) If the application and other required information are found 
to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the right-of-
way may be granted. The Regional Supervisor may prescribe, as conditions 
to the right-of-way grant, stipulations necessary to protect human, 
marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), 
property, and mineral resources located on or adjacent to the right-of-
way.
    (2) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a change in the 
application should be made, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the 
applicant that an amended application shall be filed subject to 
stipulated changes. The Regional Supervisor shall determine whether the 
applicant shall deliver copies of the amended application to other 
parties for comment.
    (3) A decision to reject an application shall be in writing and 
shall state the reasons for the rejection.

grant to expire.
    (b)(1) A right-of-way holder shall ensure that the right-of-way 
pipeline is constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the 
right-of-way as granted.
    (2) If, after constructing the right-of-way pipeline, it is 
determined that a deviation from the proposed right-of-way as granted 
has occurred, the right-of-way holder shall--
    (i) Notify the operators of all leases and holders of all right-of-
way grants

[[Page 213]]

in which a deviation has occurred, and within 60 days of the date of the 
acceptance by the Regional Supervisor of the completion of pipeline 
construction report, provide the Regional Supervisor with evidence of 
such notification; and
    (ii) Relinquish any unused portion of the right-of-way.
    (3) Substantial deviation of a right-of-way pipeline as constructed 
from the proposed right-of-way as granted may be grounds for forfeiture 
of the right-of-way.
    (c) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a significant change 
in conditions has occurred subsequent to the granting of a right-of-way 
but prior to the commencement of construction of the associated 
pipeline, the Regional Supervisor may suspend or temporarily prohibit 
the commencement of construction until the right-of-way grant is 
modified to the extent necessary to address the changed conditions.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1152  How do I conduct well tests?

    (a) When you conduct well tests you must:
    (1) Recover fluid from the well completion equivalent to the amount 
of fluid introduced into the formation during completion, recompletion, 
reworking, or treatment operations before you start a well test;
    (2) Produce the well completion under stabilized rate conditions for 
at least 6 consecutive hours before beginning the test period;
    (3) Conduct the test for at least 4 consecutive hours;
    (4) Adjust measured gas volumes to the standard conditions of 14.73 
pounds per square inch absolute (psia) and 60 [deg]F for all tests; and
    (5) Use measured specific gravity values to calculate gas volumes.
    (b) You may request approval from the Regional Supervisor to conduct 
a well test using alternative procedures if you can demonstrate test 
reliability under those procedures.
    (c) The Regional Supervisor may also require you to conduct the 
following tests and complete them within a specified time period:
    (1) A retest or a prolonged test of a well completion if it is 
determined to be necessary for the proper establishment of a Maximum 
Production Rate (MPR) or a Maximum Efficient Rate (MER); and
    (2) A multipoint back-pressure test to determine the theoretical 
open-flow potential of a gas well.
    (d) An MMS representative may witness any well test. Upon request, 
you must provide advance notice to the Regional Supervisor of the times 
and dates of well tests.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1153  When must I conduct a static bottomhole pressure survey?

    (a) You must conduct a static bottomhole pressure survey under the 
following conditions:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           If you have . . .               Then you must conduct . . .

Bottomhole Pressure Survey Report, showing a calculated bottomhole 
pressure or any measured data.

                         Classifying Reservoirs


<R05>
Sec. 250.1154  How do I determine if my reservoir is sensitive?

    (a) You must determine whether each reservoir is sensitive. You must 
classify the reservoir as sensitive if:
    (1) Under initial conditions it is an oil reservoir with an 
associated gas cap;
    (2) At any time there are near-critical fluids; or
    (3) The reservoir is undergoing enhanced recovery.
    (b) For the purposes of this subpart, near-critical fluids are:
    (1) Those fluids that occur in high temperature, high-pressure 
reservoirs where it is not possible to define the liquid-gas contact; or
    (2) Fluids in reservoirs that are near bubble point or dew point 
conditions.
    (c) The Regional Supervisor may reclassify a reservoir when 
available information warrants reclassification.
    (d) If available information indicates that a reservoir previously 
classified as non-sensitive is now sensitive, you must submit a request 
to the Regional Supervisor to reclassify the reservoir. You must include 
supporting information, as listed in the table in Sec. 250.1167, with 
your request.
    (e) If information indicates that a reservoir previously classified 
as sensitive is now non-sensitive, you may submit a request to the 
Regional Supervisor to reclassify the reservoir. You must include 
supporting information, as listed in the table in Sec. 250.1167, with 
your request.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1155  What information must I submit for sensitive reservoirs?

    You must submit to the Regional Supervisor an original and two 
copies of Form MMS-127; one of the copies must be a public information 
copy in accordance with Sec. Sec. 250.186 and 250.197, and marked 
``Public Information.'' You must also submit two copies of the 
supporting information, as listed in the table in Sec. 250.1167. You 
must submit this information:
    (a) Within 45 days after beginning production from the reservoir or 
discovering that it is sensitive;
    (b) At least once during the calendar year, but you do not need to 
resubmit unrevised structure maps (Sec. 250.1167(a)(2)) or previously 
submitted well logs (Sec. 250.1167(c)(1));
    (c) Within 45 days after you revise reservoir parameters; and
    (d) Within 45 days after the Regional Supervisor classifies the 
reservoir as sensitive under Sec. 250.1154(c).

                      Approvals Prior to Production


<R05>
Sec. 250.1156  What steps must I take to receive approval to produce within

500 feet of a unit or lease line?

    (a) You must obtain approval from the Regional Supervisor before you 
start producing from a reservoir within a well that has any portion of 
the completed interval less than 500 feet from a unit or lease line. 
Submit to MMS the service fee listed in Sec. 250.125, according to the 
instructions in Sec. 250.126, and the supporting information, as listed 
in the table in Sec. 250.1167, with your request. The Regional 
Supervisor will determine whether approval of your request will maximize 
ultimate recovery, avoid the waste of natural resources, or protect 
correlative rights. You do not need to obtain approval if the adjacent 
leases or units have the same unit, lease (record title and operating 
rights), and royalty interests as the lease or unit you plan to produce. 
You do not need to obtain approval if the adjacent block is unleased.
    (b) You must notify the operator(s) of adjacent property(ies) that 
are within 500 feet of the completion, if the adjacent acreage is a 
leased block in the Federal OCS. You must provide the Regional 
Supervisor proof of the date of the notification. The operators of the 
adjacent properties have 30 days after receiving the notification to 
provide the Regional Supervisor letters of acceptance or objection. If 
an adjacent operator does not respond within 30

[[Page 216]]

days, the Regional Supervisor will presume there are no objections and 
proceed with a decision. The notification must include:
    (1) The well name;
    (2) The rectangular coordinates (x, y) of the location of the top 
and bottom of the completion or target completion referenced to the 
North American Datum 1983, and the subsea depths of the top and bottom 
of the completion or target completion;
    (3) The distance from the completion or target completion to the 
unit or lease line at its nearest point; and
    (4) A statement indicating whether or not it will be a high-capacity 
completion having a perforated or open hole interval greater than 150 
feet measured depth.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1157  How do I receive approval to produce gas-cap gas from an oil

reservoir with an associated gas cap?

    (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional 
Supervisor:
    (1) Before producing gas-cap gas from each completion in an oil 
reservoir that is known to have an associated gas cap.
    (2) To continue production from a well if the oil reservoir is not 
initially known to have an associated gas cap, but the oil well begins 
to show characteristics of a gas well.
    (b) For either request, you must submit the service fee listed in 
Sec. 250.125, according to the instructions in Sec. 250.126, and the 
supporting information, as listed in the table in Sec. 250.1167, with 
your request.
    (c) The Regional Supervisor will determine whether your request 
maximizes ultimate recovery.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1158  How do I receive approval to downhole commingle hydrocarbons?

    (a) Before you perforate a well, you must request and receive 
approval from the Regional Supervisor to commingle hydrocarbons produced 
from multiple reservoirs within a common wellbore. The Regional 
Supervisor will determine whether your request maximizes ultimate 
recovery. You must include the service fee listed in Sec. 250.125, 
according to the instructions in Sec. 250.126, and the supporting 
information, as listed in the table in Sec. 250.1167, with your 
request.
    (b) If one or more of the reservoirs proposed for commingling is a 
competitive reservoir, you must notify the operators of all leases that 
contain the reservoir that you intend to downhole commingle the 
reservoirs. Your request for approval of downhole commingling must 
include proof of the date of this notification. The notified operators 
have 30 days after notification to provide the Regional Supervisor with 
letters of acceptance or objection. If the notified operators do not 
respond within the specified period, the Regional Supervisor will assume 
the operators do not object and proceed with a decision.

                            Production Rates


<R05>
Sec. 250.1159  May the Regional Supervisor limit my well or reservoir production rates?

    (a) The Regional Supervisor may set a Maximum Production Rate (MPR) 
for a producing well completion, or set a Maximum Efficient Rate (MER) 
for a reservoir, or both, if the Regional Supervisor determines that an 
excessive production rate could harm ultimate recovery. An MPR or MER 
will be based on well tests and any limitations imposed by well and 
surface equipment, sand production, reservoir sensitivity, gas-oil and 
water-oil ratios, location of perforated intervals, and prudent 
operating practices.
    (b) If the Regional Supervisor sets an MPR for a producing well 
completion and/or an MER for a reservoir, you may not exceed those rates 
except due to normal variations and fluctuations in production rates as 
set by the Regional Supervisor.

               Flaring, Venting, and Burning Hydrocarbons


<R05>
Sec. 250.1160  When may I flare or vent gas?

    (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional 
Supervisor to flare or vent natural gas at your facility, except in the 
following situations:

                                          separately from the hours
                                          under paragraph (a)(6) of this
                                          section.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Regardless of the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, 
you must not flare or vent gas over the volume approved in your 
Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or your Development 
and Production Plan (DPP).
    (c) The Regional Supervisor may establish alternative approval 
procedures to cover situations when you cannot contact the MMS office, 
such as during non-office hours.
    (d) The Regional Supervisor may specify a volume limit, or a shorter 
time limit than specified elsewhere in this part, in order to prevent 
air quality degradation or loss of reserves.
    (e) If you flare or vent gas without the required approval, or if 
the Regional Supervisor determines that you were negligent or could have 
avoided flaring or venting the gas, the hydrocarbons will be considered 
avoidably lost or wasted. You must pay royalties on the loss or waste, 
according to part 202 of this title. You must value any gas or liquid 
hydrocarbons avoidably lost or wasted under the provisions of part 206 
of this title.
    (f) Fugitive emissions from valves, fittings, flanges, pressure 
relief valves or similar components do not require approval under this 
subpart unless specifically required by the Regional Supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1161  When may I flare or vent gas for extended periods of time?

    You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor 
to flare or vent gas for an extended period of time. The Regional 
Supervisor will

[[Page 218]]

specify the approved period of time, which will not exceed 1 year. The 
Regional Supervisor may deny your request if it does not ensure the 
conservation of natural resources or is not consistent with national 
interests relating to development and production of minerals of the OCS. 
The Regional Supervisor may approve your request for one of the 
following reasons:
    (a) You initiated an action which, when completed, will eliminate 
flaring and venting; or
    (b) You submit to the Regional Supervisor an evaluation supported by 
engineering, geologic, and economic data indicating that the oil and gas 
produced from the well(s) will not economically support the facilities 
necessary to sell the gas or to use the gas on or for the benefit of the 
lease.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1162  When may I burn produced liquid hydrocarbons?

    (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional 
Supervisor to burn any produced liquid hydrocarbons. The Regional 
Supervisor may allow you to burn liquid hydrocarbons if you demonstrate 
that transporting them to market or re-injecting them is not technically 
feasible or poses a significant risk of harm to offshore personnel or 
the environment.
    (b) If you burn liquid hydrocarbons without the required approval, 
or if the Regional Supervisor determines that you were negligent or 
could have avoided burning liquid hydrocarbons, the hydrocarbons will be 
considered avoidably lost or wasted. You must pay royalties on the loss 
or waste, according to part 202 of this title. You must value any liquid 
hydrocarbons avoidably lost or wasted under the provisions of part 206 
of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1163  How must I measure gas flaring or venting volumes and 

liquid hydrocarbon burning volumes, and what records must I maintain?

    (a) If your facility processes more than an average of 2,000 bopd

Sec. 250.1164  What are the requirements for flaring or venting gas containing H2S?

    (a) You may not vent gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S, except for minor 
releases during maintenance and repair activities that do not result in 
a 15-minute time-weighted average atmosphere concentration of 
H<INF>2</INF>S of 20 ppm or higher anywhere on the platform.
    (b) You may flare gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S only if you meet the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 250.1160, 250.1161, 250.1163, and the 
following additional requirements:
    (1) For safety or air pollution prevention purposes, the Regional 
Supervisor may further restrict the flaring of gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF>S. The Regional Supervisor will use information provided in 
the lessee's H<INF>2</INF>S Contingency Plan (Sec. 250.490(f)), 
Exploration Plan, DPP, DOCD, and associated documents to determine the 
need for restrictions; and
    (2) If the Regional Supervisor determines that flaring at a facility 
or group of facilities may significantly affect the air quality of an 
onshore area, the Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct an air 
quality modeling analysis, under Sec. 250.303, to determine the 
potential effect of facility emissions. The Regional Supervisor may 
require monitoring and reporting, or may restrict or prohibit flaring, 
under Sec. Sec. 250.303 and 250.304.
    (c) The Regional Supervisor may require you to submit monthly 
reports of flared and vented gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S. Each report 
must contain, on a daily basis:
    (1) The volume and duration of each flaring and venting occurrence;
    (2) H<INF>2</INF>S concentration in the flared or vented gas; and
    (3) The calculated amount of SO<INF>2</INF> emitted.

manufacturer;
    (ii) Meters operate within the manufacturer's specifications for 
maximum and minimum flow rate for linear accuracy; and
    (iii) Meters are reproven when changes in metering conditions affect 
the meters' performance such as changes in pressure, temperature, 
density (water content), viscosity, pressure, and flow rate.
    (4) Ensure that sampling devices conform to the following:

of two consecutive runs (if a tank prover is used) or five out of six 
consecutive runs (if a mechanical-displacement prover is used) produce 
meter factor differences of no greater than 0.0002. Lessees must use the 
average of the two (or the five) runs that produced acceptable results 
to compute the master meter factor;
    (5) Install the master meter upstream of any back-pressure or 
reverse flow check valves associated with the operating meter. However,

steel (Cts);
    (2) The change in prover volume due to the effect of pressure on 
steel (Cps);
    (3) The change in liquid volume due to the effect of temperature on 
a liquid (Ctl); and
    (4) The change in liquid volume due to the effect of pressure on a 
liquid (Cpl).
    (h) What are the requirements for establishing and applying 
operating meter factors for liquid hydrocarbons? (1) If you use a 
mechanical-displacement prover, you must record proof runs until five 
out of six consecutive runs produce a difference between individual runs 
of no greater than .05 percent. You must use the average of the five 
accepted runs to compute the meter factor.
    (2) If you use a master meter, you must record proof runs until 
three consecutive runs produce a total meter factor difference of no 
greater than 0.0005. The flow rate through the meters during the proving 
must be within 10 percent of the rate at which the line meter will 
operate. The final meter factor is determined by averaging the meter 
factors of the three runs;
    (3) If you use a tank prover, you must record proof runs until two 
consecutive runs produce a meter factor difference of no greater than 
.0005. The final meter factor is determined by averaging the meter 
factors of the two runs; and
    (4) You must apply operating meter factors forward starting with the 
date of the proving.
    (i) Under what circumstances does a liquid hydrocarbon royalty meter 
need to be taken out of service, and what must I do? (1) If the 
difference between the meter factor and the previous factor exceeds 
0.0025 it is a malfunction factor, and you must:
    (i) Remove the meter from service and inspect it for damage or wear;
    (ii) Adjust or repair the meter, and reprove it;
    (iii) Apply the average of the malfunction factor and the previous 
factor to the production measured through the meter between the date of 
the previous factor and the date of the malfunction factor; and
    (iv) Indicate that a meter malfunction occurred and show all 
appropriate remarks regarding subsequent repairs or adjustments on the 
proving report.
    (2) If a meter fails to register production, you must:

[[Page 226]]

    (i) Remove the meter from service, repair and reprove it;
    (ii) Apply the previous meter factor to the production run between 
the date of that factor and the date of the failure; and
    (iii) Estimate and report unregistered production on the run ticket.
    (3) If the results of a royalty meter proving exceed the run 
tolerance criteria and all measures excluding the adjustment or repair 
of the meter cannot bring results within tolerance, you must:
    (i) Establish a factor using proving results made before any 
adjustment or repair of the meter; and
    (ii) Treat the established factor like a malfunction factor (see 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section).
    (j) How must I correct gross liquid hydrocarbon volumes to standard 
conditions? To correct gross liquid hydrocarbon volumes to standard 
conditions, you must:
    (1) Include Cpl factors in the meter factor calculation or list and 
apply them on the appropriate run ticket.
    (2) List Ctl factors on the appropriate run ticket when the meter is 
not automatically temperature compensated.
    (k) What are the requirements for liquid hydrocarbon allocation 
meters? For liquid hydrocarbon allocation meters you must:
    (1) Take samples continuously proportional to flow or daily (use the 
procedure in the applicable chapter of the API MPMS as incorporated by 
reference in 30 CFR 250.198;
    (2) For turbine meters, take the sample proportional to the flow 
only;
    (3) Prove operating allocation meters monthly if they measure 50 or 
more barrels per day per meter the previous month. When a force majeure 
event precludes the required monthly meter proving, meters must be 
proved within 15 days after being returned to service. The meters must 
be proved monthly thereafter; or
    (4) Prove operating allocation meters quarterly if they measure less 
than 50 barrels per day per meter the previous month. When a force 
majeure event precludes the required quarterly meter proving, meters 
must be proved within 15 days after being returned to service. The 
meters must be proved quarterly thereafter;
    (5) Keep a copy of the proving reports at the field location for 2 
years;
    (6) Adjust and reprove the meter if the meter factor differs from 
the previous meter factor by more than 2 percent and less than 7 
percent;
    (7) For turbine meters, remove from service, inspect and reprove the 
meter if the factor differs from the previous meter factor by more than 
2 percent and less than 7 percent;
    (8) Repair and reprove, or replace and prove the meter if the meter 
factor differs from the previous meter factor by 7 percent or more; and
    (9) Permit MMS representatives to witness provings.
    (l) What are the requirements for royalty and inventory tank 
facilities? You must:
    (1) Equip each royalty and inventory tank with a vapor-tight thief 
hatch, a vent-line valve, and a fill line designed to minimize free fall 
and splashing;
    (2) For royalty tanks, submit a complete set of calibration charts 
(tank tables) to the Regional Supervisor before using the tanks for 
royalty measurement;
    (3) For inventory tanks, retain the calibration charts for as long 
as the tanks are in use and submit them to the Regional Supervisor upon 
request; and
    (4) Obtain the volume and other measurement parameters by using 
correction factors and procedures in the API MPMS as incorporated by 
reference in 30 CFR 250.198.

    Source: 62 FR 5331, Feb. 5, 1997, unless otherwise noted. 
Redesignated at 63 FR 29479, May 29, 1998.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1300  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart explains how Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases are 
unitized. If you are an OCS lessee, use the regulations in this subpart 
for both competitive reservoir and unitization situations. The purpose 
of joint development and unitization is to:
    (a) Conserve natural resources;
    (b) Prevent waste; and/or
    (c) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1301  What are the requirements for unitization?

    (a) Voluntary unitization. You and other OCS lessees may ask the 
Regional Supervisor to approve a request for voluntary unitization. The 
Regional Supervisor may approve the request for voluntary unitization if 
unitized operations:
    (1) Promote and expedite exploration and development; or
    (2) Prevent waste, conserve natural resources, or protect 
correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, of a reasonably 
delineated and productive reservoir.
    (b) Compulsory unitization. The Regional Supervisor may require you 
and other lessees to unitize operations of a reasonably delineated and 
productive reservoir if unitized operations are necessary to:
    (1) Prevent waste;
    (2) Conserve natural resources; or
    (3) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.
    (c) Unit area. The area that a unit includes is the minimum number 
of leases that will allow the lessees to minimize the number of 
platforms, facility installations, and wells necessary for efficient 
exploration, development, and production of mineral deposits, oil and 
gas reservoirs, or potential hydrocarbon accumulations common to two or 
more leases. A unit may include whole leases or portions of leases.
    (d) Unit agreement. You, the other lessees, and the unit operator 
must enter into a unit agreement. The unit agreement must: allocate 
benefits to unitized leases, designate a unit operator, and specify the 
effective date of the unit agreement. The unit agreement must terminate 
when: the unit no longer produces unitized substances, and the unit 
operator no longer conducts drilling or well-workover operations (Sec. 
250.180) under the unit agreement, unless the Regional Supervisor orders 
or approves a suspension of production under Sec. 250.170.
    (e) Unit operating agreement. The unit operator and the owners of 
working interests in the unitized leases must enter into a unit 
operating agreement. The unit operating agreement must describe how all 
the unit participants will apportion all costs and liabilities incurred 
maintaining or conducting operations. When a unit involves one or more 
net-profit-share leases, the unit operating agreement must describe how 
to attribute costs and credits to the net-profit-share lease(s), and 
this part of the agreement must be approved by the Regional Supervisor. 
Otherwise, you must provide a copy of the unit operating agreement to 
the Regional Supervisor, but the Regional Supervisor does not need to 
approve the unit operating agreement.
    (f) Extension of a lease covered by unit operations. If your unit 
agreement expires or terminates, or the unit area adjusts so that no 
part of your lease remains within the unit boundaries, your lease 
expires unless:
    (1) Its initial term has not expired;
    (2) You conduct drilling, production, or well-reworking operations 
on your lease consistent with applicable regulations; or
    (3) MMS orders or approves a suspension of production or operations 
for your lease.

[[Page 230]]

    (g) Unit operations. If your lease, or any part of your lease, is 
subject to a unit agreement, the entire lease continues for the term 
provided in the lease, and as long thereafter as any portion of your 
lease remains part of the unit area, and as long as operations continue 
the unit in effect.
    (1) If you drill, produce or perform well-workover operations on a 
lease within a unit, each lease, or part of a lease, in the unit will 
remain active in accordance with the unit agreement. Following a 
discovery, if your unit ceases drilling activities for a reasonable time 
period between the delineation of one or more reservoirs and the 
initiation of actual development drilling or production operations and 
that time period would extend beyond your lease's primary term or any 
extension under Sec. 250.180, the unit operator must request and obtain 
MMS approval of a suspension of production under Sec. 250.170 in order 
to keep the unit from terminating.
    (2) When a lease in a unit agreement is beyond the primary term and 
the lease or unit is not producing, the lease will expire unless:
    (i) You conduct a continuous drilling or well reworking program 
designed to develop or restore the lease or unit production; or
    (ii) MMS orders or approves a suspension of operations under Sec. 
250.170.

Sec. 250.1302  What if I have a competitive reservoir on a lease?

    (a) The Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct development 
and production operations in a competitive reservoir under either a 
joint Development and Production Plan or a unitization agreement. A 
competitive reservoir has one or more producing or producible well 
completions on each of two or more leases, or portions of leases, with 
different lease operating interests. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
producible well completion is a well which is capable of production and 
which is shut in at the well head or at the surface but not necessarily 
connected to production facilities and from which the operator plans 
future production.
    (b) You may request that the Regional Supervisor make a preliminary 
determination whether a reservoir is competitive. When you receive the 
preliminary determination, you have 30 days (or longer if the Regional 
Supervisor allows additional time) to concur or to submit an objection 
with supporting evidence if you do not concur. The Regional Supervisor 
will make a final determination and notify you and the other lessees.
    (c) If you conduct drilling or production operations in a reservoir 
determined competitive by the Regional Supervisor, you and the other 
affected lessees must submit for approval a joint plan of operations. 
You must submit the joint plan within 90 days after the Regional 
Supervisor makes a final determination that the reservoir is 
competitive. The joint plan must provide for the development and/or 
production of the reservoir. You may submit supplemental plans for the 
Regional Supervisor's approval.
    (d) If you and the other affected lessees cannot reach an agreement 
on a joint Development and Production Plan within the approved period of 
time, each lessee must submit a separate plan to the Regional 
Supervisor. The Regional Supervisor will hold a hearing to resolve 
differences in the separate plans. If the differences in the separate 
plans are not resolved at the hearing and the Regional Supervisor 
determines that unitization is necessary under Sec. 250.1301(b), MMS 
will initiate unitization under Sec. 250.1304.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1303  How do I apply for voluntary unitization?

    (a) You must file a request for a voluntary unit with the Regional 
Supervisor. Your request must include:
    (1) A draft of the proposed unit agreement;
    (2) A proposed initial plan of operation;
    (3) Supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and
    (4) Other information that may be necessary to show that the 
unitization proposal meets the criteria of Sec. 250.1300.

[[Page 231]]

    (b) The unit agreement must comply with the requirements of this 
part. MMS will maintain and provide a model unit agreement for you to 
follow. If MMS revises the model, MMS will publish the revised model in 
the Federal Register. If you vary your unit agreement from the model 
agreement, you must obtain the approval of the Regional Supervisor.
    (c) After the Regional Supervisor accepts your unitization proposal, 
you, the other lessees, and the unit operator must sign and file copies 
of the unit agreement, the unit operating agreement, and the initial 
plan of operation with the Regional Supervisor for approval.
    (d) You must pay the service fee listed in Sec. 250.125 of this 
part with your request for a voluntary unitization proposal or the 
expansion of a previously approved voluntary unit to include additional 
acreage. Additionally, you must pay the service fee listed in Sec. 
250.125 with your request for unitization revision.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1304  How will MMS require unitization?

    (a) If the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization of 
operations within a proposed unit area is necessary to prevent waste, 
conserve natural resources of the OCS, or protect correlative rights, 
including Federal royalty interests, the Regional Supervisor may require 
unitization.
    (b) If you ask MMS to require unitization, you must file a request 
with the Regional Supervisor. You must include a proposed unit agreement 
as described in Sec. Sec. 250.1301(d) and 250.1303(b); a proposed unit 
operating agreement; a proposed initial plan of operation; supporting 
geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and any other information 
that may be necessary to show that unitization meets the criteria of 
Sec. 250.1300. The proposed unit agreement must include a counterpart 
executed by each lessee seeking compulsory unitization. Lessees who seek 
compulsory unitization must simultaneously serve on the nonconsenting 
lessees copies of:
    (1) The request;
    (2) The proposed unit agreement with executed counterparts;
    (3) The proposed unit operating agreement; and
    (4) The proposed initial plan of operation.
    (c) If the Regional Supervisor initiates compulsory unitization, MMS 
will serve all lessees of the proposed unit area with a proposed 
unitization plan and a statement of reasons for the proposed 
unitization.
    (d) The Regional Supervisor will not require unitization until MMS 
provides all lessees of the proposed unit area written notice and an 
opportunity for a hearing. If you want MMS to hold a hearing, you must 
request it within 30 days after you receive written notice from the 
Regional Supervisor or after you are served with a request for 
compulsory unitization from another lessee.
    (e) MMS will not hold a hearing under this paragraph until at least 
30 days after MMS provides written notice of the hearing date to all 
parties owning interests that would be made subject to the unit 
agreement. The Regional Supervisor must give all lessees of the proposed 
unit area an opportunity to submit views orally and in writing and to 
question both those seeking and those opposing compulsory unitization. 
Adjudicatory procedures are not required. The Regional Supervisor will 
make a decision based upon a record of the hearing, including any 
written information made a part of the record. The Regional Supervisor 
will arrange for a court reporter to make a verbatim transcript. The 
party seeking compulsory unitization must pay for the court reporter and 
pay for and provide to the Regional Supervisor within 10 days after the 
hearing three copies of the verbatim transcript.
    (f) The Regional Supervisor will issue an order that requires or 
rejects compulsory unitization. That order must include a statement of 
reasons for the action taken and identify those parts of the record 
which form the basis of the decision. Any adversely affected party may 
appeal the final order of the

annually on the date your appeal was filed. We will determine the 
additional estimated interest and notify you of the amount so you can 
amend your surety instrument.
    (c) You may submit a single surety instrument that covers multiple 
appeals. You may change the instrument to add new amounts under appeal 
or remove amounts that have been adjudicated in your favor or that you 
have paid, if you:

<R05>
Sec. 250.1496  How will BOEMRE determine if I am financially solvent?

    (a) The BOEMRE bond-approving officer will determine your financial 
solvency by examining your total net worth, including, as appropriate, 
the net worth of your affiliated entities.
    (b) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety 
under 30 CFR 250.1490 and 250.1491 for all orders you have appealed is 
greater than $300 million, you are presumptively deemed financially 
solvent, and we will not require you to post a bond or other surety 
instrument.
    (c) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety 
under 30 CFR 250.1490 and 250.1491 for all orders you have appealed is 
less than $300 million, you must submit the following to BOEMRE by one 
of the methods in Sec. 250.1495(a):
    (1) A written request asking us to consult a business-information, 
or credit-reporting service or program to determine your financial 
solvency; and
    (2) A nonrefundable $50 processing fee:
    (i) You must pay the processing fee to us following the requirements 
for making payments found in 30 CFR 250.126. You are required to use 
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for these payments;
    (ii) You must submit the fee with your request under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, and then annually on the date we first 
determined that you demonstrated financial solvency, as long as you are 
not able to demonstrate financial solvency under paragraph (a) of this 
section and you have active appeals.
    (d) If you request that we consult a business-information or credit-
reporting service or program under paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) We will use criteria similar to that which a potential creditor 
would use to lend an amount equal to the bond or other surety instrument 
we would require under 30 CFR 250.1490 and 250.1491;
    (2) For us to consider you financially solvent, the business-
information or credit-reporting service or program must demonstrate your 
degree of risk as low to moderate:
    (i) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-
information or credit-reporting service or program information 
demonstrates your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-
approving officer will not require you to post a bond or other surety 
instrument under 30 CFR 250.1490 and 250.1491;
    (ii) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-
information or credit-reporting service or program information does not 
demonstrate your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-
approving officer will require you to post a bond or other surety 
instrument under 30 CFR 250.1490 and 250.1491 or pay the obligation.

Sec. Sec. 250.1496(b) and (c) to evaluate your financial solvency at 
least annually on the date we first determined that you demonstrated 
financial solvency as long as you have active appeals and each time you 
appeal a new order.

[[Page 240]]

    (b) If you ask us to consult a business-information or credit-
reporting service or program under Sec. 250.1496(c), we will consult a 
service or program annually as long as you have active appeals and each 
time you appeal a new order.
    (c) If our bond-approving officer determines that you are no longer 
financially solvent, you must post a bond or other BOEMRE-specified 
surety instrument under Sec. Sec. 250.1490 and 250.1491.

Sec. 250.1605  Drilling requirements.

    (a) Lessees of OCS sulphur leases shall conduct drilling operations 
in accordance with Sec. Sec. 250.1605 through 250.1619 of this subpart 
and with other requirements of this part, as appropriate.
    (b) Fitness of drilling unit. (1) Drilling units shall be capable of 
withstanding the oceanographic and meteorological conditions for the 
proposed season and location of operations.
    (2) Prior to commencing operation, drilling units shall be made 
available for a complete inspection by the District Manager.
    (3) The lessee shall provide information and data on the fitness of 
the drilling unit to perform the proposed drilling operation. The 
information shall be submitted with, or prior to, the submission of Form 
MMS-123, Application for Permit to Drill (APD), in accordance with Sec. 
250.1617 of this subpart. After a drilling unit has been approved by an 
MMS district office, the information required in this paragraph need not 
be resubmitted unless required by the District Manager or there are 
changes in the equipment that affect the rated capacity of the unit.
    (c) Oceanographic, meteorological, and drilling unit performance 
data. Where oceanographic, meteorological, and drilling unit performance 
data are not otherwise readily available, lessees shall collect and 
report such data upon request to the District Manager. The type of 
information to be collected and reported will be determined by the 
District Manager in the interests of safety in the conduct of operations 
and the structural integrity of the drilling unit.
    (d) Foundation requirements. When the lessee fails to provide 
sufficient information pursuant to Sec. Sec. 250.211 through 250.228 
and 250.241 through 250.262 of this part to support a determination that 
the seafloor is capable of supporting a specific bottom-founded drilling 
unit under the site-specific soil and oceanographic conditions, the 
District Manager may require that additional surveys and soil borings be 
performed and the results submitted for review and evaluation by the 
District Manager before approval is granted for commencing drilling 
operations.
    (e) Tests, surveys, and samples. (1) Lessees shall drill and take 
cores and/or run well and mud logs through the objective interval to 
determine the presence, quality, and quantity of sulphur and other 
minerals (e.g., oil and gas) in the cap rock and the outline of the 
commercial sulphur deposit.
    (2) Inclinational surveys shall be obtained on all vertical wells at 
intervals not exceeding 1,000 feet during the normal course of drilling. 
Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be 
obtained on all directionally drilled wells at intervals not exceeding 
500 feet during the normal course of drilling and at intervals not 
exceeding 200 feet in all planned angle-change portions of the borehole.

[[Page 245]]

    (3) Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be 
obtained on both vertically and directionally drilled wells at intervals 
not exceeding 500 feet prior to or upon setting a string of casing, or 
production liner, and at total depth. Composite directional surveys 
shall be prepared with the interval shown from the bottom of the 
conductor casing. In calculating all surveys, a correction from the true 
north to Universal-Transverse-Mercator-Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north 
shall be made after making the magnetic-to-true-north correction. A 
composite dipmeter directional survey or a composite measurement while-
drilling directional survey will be acceptable as fulfilling the 
applicable requirements of this paragraph.
    (4) Wells are classified as vertical if the calculated average of 
inclination readings weighted by the respective interval lengths between 
readings from surface to drilled depth does not exceed 3 degrees from 
the vertical. When the calculated average inclination readings weighted 
by the length of the respective interval between readings from the 
surface to drilled depth exceeds 3 degrees, the well is classified as 
directional.
    (5) At the request of a holder of an adjoining lease, the Regional 
Supervisor may, for the protection of correlative rights, furnish a copy 
of the directional survey to that leaseholder.
    (f) Fixed drilling platforms. Applications for installation of fixed 
drilling platforms or structures including artificial islands shall be 
submitted in accordance with the provisions of subpart I, Platforms and 
Structures, of this part. Mobile drilling units that have their jacking 
equipment removed or have been otherwise immobilized are classified as 
fixed bottom founded drilling platforms.
    (g) Crane operations. You must operate a crane installed on fixed 
platforms according to Sec. 250.108 of this subpart.
    (h) Diesel-engine air intakes. Diesel-engine air intakes must be

<R05>
Sec. 250.1606  Control of wells.

    The lessee shall take necessary precautions to keep its wells under 
control at all times. Operations shall be conducted in a safe and 
workmanlike manner. The lessee shall utilize the best available and 
safest drilling technologies and state-of-the-art methods to evaluate 
and minimize the potential for a well to flow or kick. The lessee shall 
utilize personnel who are trained and competent and shall utilize and 
maintain equipment and materials necessary to assure the safety and 
protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the 
environment.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1607  Field rules.

    When geological and engineering information in a field enables a 
District Manager to determine specific operating requirements, field 
rules may be established for drilling, well completion, or well workover 
on the District Manager's initiative or in response to a request from a 
lessee; such rules may modify the specific requirements of this subpart. 
After field rules have been established, operations in the field shall 
be conducted in accordance with such rules and other requirements of 
this subpart. Field rules may be amended or canceled for cause at any 
time upon the initiative of the District Manager or upon the request of 
a lessee.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1608  Well casing and cementing.

    (a) General requirements. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the 
several casing strings in order of normal installation are:
    (i) Drive or structural,
    (ii) Conductor,
    (iii) Cap rock casing,
    (iv) Bobtail cap rock casing (required when the cap rock casing does 
not penetrate into the cap rock),

[[Page 246]]

    (v) Second cap rock casing (brine wells), and
    (vi) Production liner.
    (2) The lessee shall case and cement all wells with a sufficient 
number of strings of casing cemented in a manner necessary to prevent 
release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore (directly or 
indirectly) into the sea, protect freshwater aquifers from 
contamination, support unconsolidated sediments, and otherwise provide a 
means of control of the formation pressures and fluids. Cement 
composition, placement techniques, and waiting time shall be designed 
and conducted so that the cement in place behind the bottom 500 feet of 
casing or total length of annular cement fill, if less, attains a 
minimum compressive strength of 160 pounds per square inch (psi).
    (3) The lessee shall install casing designed to withstand the 
anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling 
loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations 
thereof. Safety factors in the drilling and casing program designs shall 
be of sufficient magnitude to provide well control during drilling and 
to assure safe operations for the life of the well.
    (4) In cases where cement has filled the annular space back to the 
mud line, the cement may be washed out or displaced to a depth not 
exceeding the depth of the structural casing shoe to facilitate casing 
removal upon well abandonment if the District Manager determines that 
subsurface protection against damage to freshwater aquifers and against 
damage caused by adverse loads, pressures, and fluid flows is not 
jeopardized.
    (5) If there are indications of inadequate cementing (such as lost 
returns, cement channeling, or mechanical failure of equipment), the 
lessee shall evaluate the adequacy of the cementing operations by 
pressure testing the casing shoe. If the test indicates inadequate 
cementing, the lessee shall initiate remedial action as approved by the 
District Manager. For cap rock casing, the test for adequacy of 
cementing shall be the pressure testing of the annulus between the cap 
rock and the conductor casings. The pressure shall not exceed 70 percent 
of the burst pressure of the conductor casing or 70 percent of the 
collapse pressure of the cap rock casing.
    (b) Drive or structural casing. This casing shall be set by driving, 
jetting, or drilling to a minimum depth of 100 feet below the mud line 
or such other depth, as may be required or approved by the District 
Manager, in order to support unconsolidated deposits and to provide hole 
stability for initial drilling operations. If this portion of the hole 
is drilled, a quantity of cement sufficient to fill the annular space 
back to the mud line shall be used.
    (c) Conductor and cap rock casing setting and cementing 
requirements. (1) Conductor and cap rock casing design and setting 
depths shall be based upon relevant engineering and geologic factors 
including the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, 
and water depths. The proposed casing setting depths may be varied, 
subject to District Manager approval, to permit the casing to be set in 
a competent formation or through formations determined desirable to be 
isolated from the wellbore by casing for safer drilling operations. 
However, the conductor casing shall be set immediately prior to drilling 
into formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon 
encountering such formations. Cap rock casing shall be set and cemented 
through formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon 
encountering such formations. Upon encountering unexpected formation 
pressures, the lessee shall submit a revised casing program to the 
District Manager for approval.
    (2) Conductor casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement 
that fills the calculated annular space back to the mud line. Cement 
fill shall be verified by the observation of cement returns. In the 
event that observation of cement returns is not feasible, additional 
quantities of cement shall be used to assure fill to the mud line.
    (3) Cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that 
fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet inside the 
conductor casing. When geologic conditions such as near surface 
fractures and faulting exist, cap rock casing shall be cemented with a

[[Page 247]]

quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to the mud 
line, unless otherwise approved by the District Manager. In brine wells, 
the second cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement 
that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet above the 
setting depth of the first cap rock casing.
    (d) Bobtail cap rock casing setting and cementing requirements. (1) 
Bobtail cap rock casing shall be set on or just in cap rock and lapped a 
minimum of 100 feet into the previous casing string.
    (2) Sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the 
top of the bobtail cap rock casing.
    (e) Production liner setting and cementing requirements. (1) 
Production liners for sulphur wells and bleedwells shall be set in cap 
rock at or above the bottom of the open hole (hole that is open in cap 
rock, below the bottom of the cap rock casing) and lapped into the 
previous casing string or to the surface. For brine wells, the liner 
shall be set in salt and lapped into the previous casing string or to 
the surface.
    (2) The production liner is not required to be cemented unless the 
cap rock contains oil or gas. If the cap rock contains oil or gas, 
sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the top of 
the production liner.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1609  Pressure testing of casing.

    (a) Prior to drilling the plug after cementing, all casing strings, 
except the drive or structural casing, shall be pressure tested. The 
conductor casing shall be tested to at least 200 psi. All casing strings 
below the conductor casing shall be tested to 500 psi or 0.22 psi/ft, 
whichever is greater. (When oil or gas is not present in the cap rock, 
the production liner need not be cemented in place; thus, it would not 
be subject to pressure testing.) If the pressure declines more than 10 
percent in 30 minutes or if there is another indication of a leak, the 
casing shall be recemented, repaired, or an additional casing string run 
and the casing tested again. The above procedures shall be repeated 
until a satisfactory test is obtained. The time, conditions of testing, 
and results of all casing pressure tests shall be recorded in the 
driller's report.
    (b) After cementing any string of casing other than structural, 
drilling shall not be resumed until there has been a timelapse of at 
least 8 hours under pressure for the conductor casing string or 12 hours 
under pressure for all other casing strings. Cement is considered under 
pressure if one or more float valves are shown to be holding the cement 
in place or when other means of holding pressure are used.

upper and lower kelly cocks, and drill-string safety valves shall be 
pressure tested to pipe-ram test pressures. Safety valves with proper 
casing connections shall be actuated prior to running casing.
    (d) BOP system shall be pressure tested as follows:
    (1) When installed;
    (2) Before drilling out each string of casing or before continuing 
operations in cases where cement is not drilled out;
    (3) At least once each week, but not exceeding 7 days between 
pressure tests, alternating between control stations. If either control 
system is not functional, further drilling operations shall be suspended 
until that system becomes operable. A period of more than 7 days between 
BOP tests is allowed when there is a stuck drill pipe or there are 
pressure control operations and remedial efforts are being performed, 
provided that the pressure tests are conducted as soon as possible and 
before normal operations resume. The date, time, and reason for 
postponing pressure testing shall be entered into the driller's report. 
Pressure testing shall be performed at intervals to allow each drilling 
crew to operate the equipment. The weekly pressure test is not required 
for blind and blind-shear rams;
    (4) Bind and blind-shear rams shall be actuated at least once every 
7 days. Closing pressure on the blind and blind-shear rams greater than

Sec. 250.1629  Additional production and fuel gas system requirements.

    (a) General. Lessees shall comply with the following production 
safety system requirements (some of which are in addition to those 
contained in Sec. 250.1628 of this part).
    (b) Design, installation, and operation of additional production 
systems, including fuel gas handling safety systems. (1) Pressure and 
fired vessels must be designed, fabricated, and code stamped in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of sections I, IV, and VIII of 
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code (incorporated by reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198). 
Pressure and fired vessels must have maintenance inspection, rating, 
repair, and alteration performed in accordance with the applicable 
provisions of API Pressure Vessel Inspections Code: In-Service 
Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration, API 510 (except Sections 5.8 
and 9.5) (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 250.198).
    (i) Pressure safety relief valves shall be designed, installed, and 
maintained in accordance with applicable provisions of sections I, IV, 
and VIII of the ANSI/ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated 
by reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198). The safety relief valves 
shall conform to the valve-sizing and pressure-relieving requirements 
specified in these documents; however, the safety relief valves shall be 
set no higher than the maximum-allowable working pressure of the vessel. 
All safety relief valves and vents shall be piped in such a way as to 
prevent fluid from striking personnel or ignition sources.
    (ii) The lessee shall use pressure recorders to establish the 
operating pressure ranges of pressure vessels in order to establish the 
pressure-sensor settings. Pressure-recording charts used to determine 
operating pressure ranges shall be maintained by the lessee for a period 
of 2 years at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility or at 
another location conveniently available to the District Manager. The 
high-pressure sensor shall be set no higher than 15 percent or 5 psi, 
whichever is greater, above the highest operating pressure of the 
vessel. This setting shall also be set sufficiently below (15 percent or 
5 psi, whichever is greater) the safety relief valve's set pressure to 
assure that the high-pressure sensor sounds an alarm before the safety 
relief valve starts relieving. The low-pressure sensor shall sound an 
alarm no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, below the 
lowest pressure in the operating range.
    (2) Engine exhaust. You must equip engine exhausts to comply with 
the insulation and personnel protection requirements of API RP 14C, 
section 4.2c(4) (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 
250.198). Exhaust piping from diesel engines must be equipped with spark 
arresters.
    (3) Firefighting systems. Firefighting systems must conform to 
subsection 5.2, Fire Water Systems, of API RP 14G, Recommended Practice 
for Fire Prevention and Control on Open Type Offshore Production 
Platforms (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 250.198), and 
must be subject to the approval of the District Manager. Additional 
requirements must apply as follows:
    (i) A firewater system consisting of rigid pipe with firehose 
stations shall be installed. The firewater system shall

[[Page 259]]

be installed to provide needed protection, especially in areas where 
fuel handling equipment is located.
    (ii) Fuel or power for firewater pump drivers shall be available for 
at least 30 minutes of run time during platform shut-in time. If 
necessary, an alternate fuel or power supply shall be installed to 
provide for this pump-operating time unless an alternate firefighting 
system has been approved by the District Manager;
    (iii) A firefighting system using chemicals may be used in lieu of a 
water system if the District Manager determines that the use of a 
chemical system provides equivalent fire-protection control; and
    (iv) A diagram of the firefighting system showing the location of 
all firefighting equipment shall be posted in a prominent place on the 
facility or structure.
    (4) Fire- and gas-detection system. (i) Fire (flame, heat, or smoke) 
sensors shall be installed in all enclosed classified areas. Gas sensors 
shall be installed in all inadequately ventilated, enclosed classified 
areas. Adequate ventilation is defined as ventilation that is sufficient 
to prevent accumulation of significant quantities of vapor-air mixture 
in concentrations over 25 percent of the lower explosive limit. One 
approved method of providing adequate ventilation is a change of air 
volume each 5 minutes or 1 cubic foot of air-volume flow per minute per 
square foot of solid floor area, whichever is greater. Enclosed areas 
(e.g., buildings, living quarters, or doghouses) are defined as those 
areas confined on more than four of their six possible sides by walls, 
floors, or ceilings more restrictive to air flow than grating or fixed 
open louvers and of sufficient size to allow entry of personnel. A 
classified area is any area classified Class I, Group D, Division 1 or 
2, following the guidelines of API RP 500 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in Sec. 205.198), or any area classified Class I, Zone 0, 
Zone 1, or Zone 2, following the guidelines of API RP 505 (incorporated 
by reference as specified in Sec. 205.198).
    (ii) All detection systems shall be capable of continuous 
monitoring. Fire-detection systems and portions of combustible gas-
detection systems related to the higher gas concentration levels shall 
be of the manual-reset type. Combustible gas-detection systems related 
to the lower gas-concentration level may be of the automatic-reset type.
    (iii) A fuel-gas odorant or an automatic gas-detection and alarm 
system is required in enclosed, continuously manned areas of the 
facility that are provided with fuel gas. Living quarters and doghouses 
not containing a gas source and not located in a classified area do not 
require a gas detection system.
    (iv) The District Manager may require the installation and 
maintenance of a gas detector or alarm in any potentially hazardous 
area.
    (v) Fire- and gas-detection systems must be an approved type, 
designed and installed according to API RP 14C, API RP 14G, and either 
API RP 14F or API RP 14FZ (the preceding four documents incorporated by 
reference as specified in Sec. 250.198).
    (c) General platform operations.Safety devices shall not be bypassed 
or blocked out of service unless they are temporarily out of service for 
startup, maintenance, or testing procedures. Only the minimum number of 
safety devices shall be taken out of service. Personnel shall monitor 
the bypassed or blocked out functions until the safety devices are 
placed back in service. Any safety device that is temporarily out of 
service shall be flagged by the person taking such device out of 
service.

    (8) After drilling. When you complete the test activities, you must 
permanently plug and abandon the boreholes of all deep stratigraphic 
tests in compliance with 30 CFR part 250. If the tract on which you 
conducted a deep stratigraphic test is leased to another party for 
exploration and development, and if the lessee has not disturbed the 
borehole, MMS will hold you and not the lessee responsible for problems 
associated with the test hole.
    (9) Deadline for completing a deep stratigraphic test. If your deep 
stratigraphic test well is within 50 geographic miles of a tract that 
MMS has identified for a future lease sale, as listed on the currently 
approved OCS leasing schedule, you must complete all drilling activities 
and submit the data and information to the Regional Director at least 60 
days before the first day of the month in which MMS schedules the lease 
sale. However, the Regional Director may extend your permit duration to 
allow you to complete drilling activities and submit data and 
information if the extension is in the national interest.
    (c) Group participation in test drilling. MMS encourages group 
participation for deep stratigraphic tests.
    (1) Purpose of group participation. The purpose is to minimize 
duplicative G&G activities involving drilling into the seabed of the 
OCS.
    (2) Providing opportunity for participation in a deep stratigraphic 
test. When you propose to drill a deep stratigraphic test, you must give 
all interested persons an opportunity to participate in the test 
drilling through a signed agreement on a cost-sharing basis. You may 
include a penalty for late participation of not more than 100 percent of 
the cost to each original participant in addition to the original share 
cost.
    (i) The participants must assess and distribute late participation 
penalties in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
    (ii) For a significant hydrocarbon occurrence that the Regional 
Director announces to the public, the penalty for subsequent late 
participants may be raised to not more than 300 percent of the cost of 
each original participant in addition to the original share cost.

[[Page 289]]

    (3) Providing opportunity for participation in a shallow test 
drilling project. When you apply to conduct shallow test drilling 
activities, you must, if ordered by the Regional Director or required by 
the permit, give all interested persons an opportunity to participate in 
the test activity on a cost-sharing basis. You may include a penalty 
provision for late participation of not more than 50 percent of the cost 
to each original participant in addition to the original share cost.
    (4) Procedures for group participation in drilling activities. You 
must:
    (i) Publish a summary statement that describes the approved activity 
in a relevant trade publication;
    (ii) Forward a copy of the published statement to the Regional 
Director;
    (iii) Allow at least 30 days from the summary statement publication 
date for other persons to join as original participants;
    (iv) Compute the estimated cost by dividing the estimated total cost 
of the program by the number of original participants; and
    (v) Furnish the Regional Director with a complete list of all 
participants before starting operations, or at the end of the 
advertising period if you begin operations before the advertising period 
is over. The names of any subsequent or late participants must also be 
furnished to the Regional Director.
    (5) Changes to the original application for test drilling. If you 
propose changes to the original application and the Regional Director 
determines that the changes are significant, the Regional Director will 
require you to publish the changes for an additional 30 days to give 
other persons a chance to join as original participants.
    (d) Bonding requirements. You must submit a bond under this part 
before you may start a deep stratigraphic test.
    (1) Before MMS issues a permit authorizing the drilling of a deep 
stratigraphic test, you must either:
    (i) Furnish to MMS a bond of not less than $200,000 that guarantees 
compliance with all the terms and conditions of the permit; or
    (ii) Maintain a $1 million bond that guarantees compliance with all 
the terms and conditions of the permit you hold for the OCS area where 
you propose to drill.
    (2) You must provide additional security to MMS if the Regional 
Director determines that it is necessary for the permit or area.
    (3) The Regional Director may require you to provide a bond, in an 
amount the Regional Director prescribes, before authorizing you to drill 
a shallow test well.
    (4) Your bond must be on a form approved by the Associate Director 
for Offshore Minerals Management.

                                             the permit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Permittees and third parties may apply to MMS for an extension 
of the 25-year proprietary term for geophysical information reprocessed 
20 or more years after MMS issued the germane permit. You must submit 
the application to MMS within 90 days after completion of the 
reprocessing, except during the initial 1-year grace period as provided 
in paragraph (b)(5) below. Filing locations are listed in Sec. 
251.5(d). Your application must include:

[[Page 294]]

    (i) Name and address of the permittee or third party;
    (ii) Product name;
    (iii) Identification of the geophysical information area;
    (iv) Identification of originating permit number and date;
    (v) Description of reprocessing performed;
    (vi) Identification of the date of completion of reprocessing the

application is accurate; and
    (viii) Signature and date.
    (3) With each new reprocessing of permitted data, you may apply for 
an extension of up to 5 years. However, the maximum proprietary term for 
geophysical information is 50 years after MMS issued the permit. Once 
the maximum term is reached, the MMS Regional Director will release the 
information to the public.
    (4) Geophysical information processed or reprocessed 20 or more 
years after MMS issued the germane permit and granted the extension will 
be subject to submission, inspection, and selection criteria under 30 
CFR 251.12 and reimbursement criteria identified under 30 CFR 251.13.
    (5) There will be a 1-year grace period, starting September 14, 
2009, to allow permittees and third parties sufficient time to meet the 
above requirements and to apply for all eligible extensions. During this 
time, MMS will not release geophysical information which was reprocessed 
20 or more years after the date that MMS issued the germane permit.
    (6) After September 14, 2010 MMS will resume releasing eligible 
reprocessed information. If an application for extension is not filed, 
not filed on time, or not approved by MMS, the original 25-year 
proprietary term applies to the release date of the reprocessed 
geophysical information.
    (7) If the data and information are related to a deep stratigraphic 
test, MMS will release them to the public at the earlier of the 
following times:
    (i) Twenty-five years after you complete the test; or
    (ii) If a lease sale is held after you complete a test well, 60 
calendar days after MMS issues the first lease, any portion of which is 
located within 50 geographic miles (92.7 kilometers) of the test.
    (8) MMS may allow limited inspection, but only by persons with a 
direct interest in related MMS decisions and issues in specific 
geographic areas, and who agree in writing to its confidentiality, of 
G&G data and information submitted under this part that MMS uses to:
    (i) Make unitization determinations on two or more leases;
    (ii) Make competitive reservoir determinations;
    (iii) Ensure proper plans of development for competitive reservoirs;
    (iv) Promote operational safety;
    (v) Protect the environment;
    (vi) Make field determinations; or
    (vii) Determine eligibility for royalty relief.
    (c) Procedure that MMS follows to disclose acquired data and 
information to a contractor for reproduction, processing, and 
interpretation. (1) When practical, the Regional Director will advise 
the person who submitted data and information under Sec. Sec. 251.11 or 
251.12 of the intent to disclose the data or information to an 
independent contractor or agent.
    (2) The person so notified will have at least 5 working days to 
comment on the action.
    (3) When the Regional Director advises the person who submitted the 
data and information, all other owners of the data or information will 
be considered to have been so notified.
    (4) Before disclosure, the contractor or agent must sign a written 
commitment not to sell, trade, license, or disclose data or information 
to anyone without the Regional Director's consent.
    (d) Sharing data and information with coastal States. (1) When MMS 
solicits nominations for leasing lands located within 3 geographic miles 
(5.6 kilometers) of the seaward boundary of any coastal State, the 
Regional Director, in accordance with 30 CFR 252.7 (a)(4) and (b) and 
subsections 8(g) and 26(e) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g) and 1352(e)), 
will provide the Governor with:

[[Page 295]]

    (i) All information on the geographical, geological, and ecological 
characteristics of the areas and regions MMS proposes to offer for 
lease;
    (ii) An estimate of the oil and gas reserves in the areas proposed 
for leasing; and
    (iii) An identification of any field, geological structure, or trap 
on the OCS within 3 geographic miles (5.6 kilometers) of the seaward 
boundary of the State.
    (2) After receiving nominations for leasing an area of the OCS 
within 3 geographic miles of the seaward boundary of any coastal State, 
MMS will carry out a tentative area identification according to 30 CFR 
part 256, subparts D and E. At that time, the Regional Director will 
consult with the Governor to determine whether any tracts further 
considered for leasing may contain any oil or gas reservoirs that 
underlie both the OCS and lands subject to the jurisdiction of the 
State.
    (3) Before a sale, if a Governor requests, the Regional Director, in 
accordance with 30 CFR 252.7(a)(4) and (b) and sections 8(g) and 26(e) 
of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g) and 1352(e)), will share with the Governor 
information that identifies potential and/or proven common hydrocarbon 
bearing areas within 3 geographic miles of the seaward boundary of that 
State.
    (4) Information received and knowledge gained by a State official 
under paragraph (d) of this section is subject to applicable 
confidentiality requirements of:
    (i) The Act; and

been submitted in good faith, shall be held responsible for any 
consequence of the use of or reliance upon such interpretation.
    (b)(1) Whenever a lessee or permittee provides any data or 
information, at the request of the Director and specifically for use in 
the OCS Oil and Gas Information Program in a form and manner of 
processing which is utilized by the lessee or permittee in the normal 
conduct of business, the Director shall pay the reasonable cost of 
reproducing the data and information if the lessee or permittee requests 
reimbursement. The cost shall be computed and paid in accordance with 
the applicable provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (2) Whenever a lessee or permittee provides any data or information, 
at the request of the Director and specifically for use in the OCS Oil 
and Gas Information Program, in a form and manner of processing not 
normally utilized by the lessee or permittee in the normal conduct of 
business, the Director shall pay the lessee or permittee, if the lessee 
or permittee requests reimbursement, the reasonable cost of processing 
and reproducing the requested data and information. The cost is to be 
computed and paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (c) Data or information requested by the Director shall be provided 
as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days following receipt of 
the Director's request, unless, for good reason, the Director authorizes 
a longer time period for the submission of the requested data or 
information.
    (d) The Director reserves the right to disclose any data or 
information acquired from a lessee or permittee to an independent 
contractor or agent for the purpose of reproducing, processing, 
reprocessing, or interpreting such data or information. When 
practicable, the Director shall notify the lessee(s) or permittee(s) who 
provided the data or information of the intent to disclose the data or 
information to an independent contractor or agent. The Director's notice 
of intent will afford the permittee(s) or lessee(s) a period of not less 
than 5 working days within which to comment on the intended action. When 
the Director so notifies a lessee or permittee of the intent to disclose 
data or information to an independent contractor or agent, all other 
owners of such data or information shall be deemed to have been notified 
of the Director's intent. Prior to any such disclosure, the contractor 
or agent shall be required to execute a written commitment not to 
disclose any data or information to anyone without the express consent 
of the Director, and not to make any disclosure or use of the data or 
information other than that provided in the contract. Contracts between 
the Minerals Management Service and independent contractors shall be 
available to the lessee(s) or permittee(s) for inspection. In the event 
of any unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information by the 
contractor or agent, or by an employee thereof, the responsible 
contractor or agent or employee thereof shall be liable for penalties 
pursuant to section 24 of the Act.
    (e)(1) After delivery of data or information in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section and upon receipt of a request for 
reimbursement and a determination by the Director that the requested 
reimbursement is proper, the lessee or permittee shall be reimbursed for 
the cost of reproducing the data or information at the lessee's or 
permittee's lowest rate or at the lowest commercial rate established in 
the area, whichever is less. Requests for reimbursement must be made 
within 60 days of the delivery date of the data or information requested 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (2) After delivery of data or information in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and upon receipt of a request for 
reimbursement and a determination by the Director that the requested 
reimbursement is proper, the

[[Page 299]]

lessee or permittee shall be reimbursed for the cost of processing or 
reprocessing and of reproducing the requested data or information. 
Requests for reimbursement must be made within 60 days of the delivery 
date of the data or information and shall be for only the costs 
attributable to processing or reprocessing and reproducing, as 
distinguished from the costs of data acquisition.
    (3) Requests for reimbursement are to contain a breakdown of costs 
in sufficient detail to allow separation of reproduction, processing, 
and reprocessing costs from acquisition and other costs.
    (f) Each Federal Department or Agency shall provide the Director 
with any data which it has obtained pursuant to section 11 of the Act 
and any other information which may be necessary or useful to assist the 
Director in carrying out the provisions of the Act.

eligibility of designated applicants for OSFR certification (OSFRC); and 
to establish a reference source of names, addresses, and telephone 
numbers of responsible parties for covered facilities and their 
designated agents, guarantors, and U.S. agents for service of process 
for claims associated with oil pollution from designated covered 
facilities. The requirement to provide the information is mandatory. No 
information submitted for OSFRC is confidential or proprietary.
    (c) An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.

assist MMS in making the determination. MMS may require you to submit 
other information before making a determination of OSFR applicability.


<R05>
Sec. 253.13  How much OSFR must I demonstrate?

    (a) The following general parameters apply to the amount of OSFR 
that you must demonstrate:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you are the designated applicant for     Then you must demonstrate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only one COF..............................  The amount of OSFR that
                                             applies to the COF.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than one COF.........................  The highest amount of OSFR
                                             that applies to any one of
                                             the COFs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) You must demonstrate OSFR in the amounts specified in this 
section:
    (1) For a COF located wholly or partially in the OCS you must 
demonstrate OSFR in accordance with the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The Director may determine that you must demonstrate an amount 
of OSFR greater than the amount in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section based on the relative operational, environmental, human health, 
and other risks that your COF poses. The Director may require an amount 
that is one or more levels higher than the amount indicated in paragraph 
(b)(1) or (2) of this section for your COF. The Director will not 
require an OSFR demonstration that exceeds $150 million.
    (4) You must demonstrate OSFR in the lowest amount specified in the 
applicable table in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) for a facility with a 
potential worst case oil-spill discharge of 1,000 bbls or less if the 
Director notifies you

[[Page 306]]

in writing that the demonstration is justified by the risks of the 
potential oil-spill discharge.


<R05>
Sec. 253.14  How do I determine the worst case oil-spill discharge volume?

    (a) To calculate the amount of OSFR you must demonstrate for a 
facility under Sec. 253.13(b), you must use the worst case oil-spill 
discharge volume that you determined under whichever of the following 
regulations applies:
    (1) 30 CFR part 254--Response Plans for Facilities Located Seaward 
of the Coast Line, except that the volume of the worst case oil-spill 
discharge for a well must be four times the uncontrolled flow volume 
that you estimate for the first 24 hours.
    (2) 40 CFR part 112--Oil Pollution Prevention; or
    (3) 49 CFR part 194--Response Plans for Onshore Oil Pipelines.
    (b) If you are a designated applicant and you choose to demonstrate 
$150 million in OSFR, you are not required to determine any worst case 
oil-spill discharge volumes, since that is the maximum amount of OSFR 
required under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 253.15  What are my general OSFR compliance responsibilities?

    (a) You must maintain continuous OSFR coverage for all your leases, 
permits, and RUEs with COFs for which you are the designated applicant.
    (b) You must ensure that new OSFR evidence is submitted before your 
current evidence lapses or is canceled and that coverage for your new 
COF is submitted before the COF goes into operation.
    (c) If you use self-insurance to demonstrate OSFR and find that you 
no longer qualify to self-insure the required OSFR amount based upon 
your latest audited annual financial statements, then you must 
demonstrate OSFR using other methods acceptable to MMS by whichever of 
the following dates comes first:
    (1) Sixty calendar days after you receive your latest audited annual 
financial statement; or
    (2) The first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of your 
fiscal year.
    (d) You may use a surety bond to demonstrate OSFR. If you find that 
your bonding company has lost its state license or has had its U.S. 
Treasury Department certification revoked, then you must replace the 
surety bond within 15 calendar days using a method of OSFR that is 
acceptable to MMS.
    (e) You must notify MMS in writing within 15 calendar days after a 
change occurs that would prevent you from meeting your OSFR obligations 
(e.g., if you or your indemnitor petition for bankruptcy under Chapters 
7 or 11 of Title 11, U.S.C.). You must take any action MMS directs to 
ensure an acceptable OSFR demonstration.
    (f) If you deny payment of a claim presented to you under Sec. 
253.60, then you must give the claimant a written explanation for your 
denial.

consecutive OSFR layers;
    (4) Each insurer's participation in the covered insurance risk must 
be on a proportional (quota share) basis, must be expressed as a 
percentage of a whole layer, and the certificate must not contain 
intermediate, horizontal layers;

[[Page 309]]

    (5) You may use an insurance deductible. If you use more than one 
insurance certificate, the deductible amount must apply only to the 
certificate that covers the base OSFR amount layer. To satisfy an 
insurance deductible, you may use only those methods that are acceptable 
as evidence of OSFR under this part; and
    (6) You must identify a U.S. agent for service of process on each 
insurance certificate you submit to MMS. The agent may be different for 
each insurance certificate.
    (d) You may submit to MMS a temporary insurance confirmation (fax 
binder) for each insurance certificate you use as OSFR evidence. Submit 
your fax binder on Form MMS-1019, and each form must include the 
signature of an underwriter for at least one of the participating 
insurers. MMS will accept your fax binder as OSFR evidence during a 
period that ends 90 days after the date that you need the insurance to 
demonstrate OSFR.


<R05>
Sec. 253.30  How can I use an indemnity as OSFR evidence?

    (a) You may use only one indemnity issued by only one indemnitor to 
satisfy all or part of your obligation to demonstrate OSFR.

    (c) Your indemnitor must complete a Form MMS-1018 and provide an 
indemnity that:
    (1) Includes all the information required by Sec. 253.41; and
    (2) Does not exceed the amounts calculated using the net worth or 
unencumbered assets tests specified under Sec. Sec. 253.21 through 
253.28.
    (d) You must submit your application to renew OSFR using an 
indemnity by the first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of 
your indemnitor's fiscal year. You may submit to MMS your initial 
application to demonstrate OSFR using an indemnity at any time.
    (e) Your indemnitor must identify a U.S. agent for service of 
process.


<R05>
Sec. 253.31  How can I use a surety bond as OSFR evidence?

    (a) Each bonding company that issues a surety bond that you submit 
to MMS as OSFR evidence must:
    (1) Be licensed to do business in the State in which the surety bond 
is executed;
    (2) Be certified by the U.S. Treasury Department as an acceptable 
surety for Federal obligations and listed in the current Treasury 
Circular No. 570;
    (3) Provide the surety bond on Form MMS-1020; and
    (4) Be in compliance with applicable statutes regulating surety 
company participation in insurance-type risks.
    (b) A surety bond that you submit as OSFR evidence must include all 
the information required by Sec. 253.41.


<R05>
Sec. 253.32  Are there alternative methods to demonstrate OSFR?

    The Director may accept other methods to demonstrate OSFR that 
provide equivalent assurance of timely satisfaction of claims. This may 
include pooling, letters of credit, pledges of treasury notes, or other 
comparable methods. Submit your proposal, together with all the 
supporting documents, to the Director at the address listed in Sec. 
253.45. The Director's decision whether to approve your alternative 
method to evidence OSFR is by this rule committed to the Director's sole 
discretion and is not subject to administrative appeal under 30 CFR part 
290 or 43 CFR part 4.


<R04>
         Subpart D_Requirements for Submitting OSFR Information


<R05>
Sec. 253.40  What OSFR evidence must I submit to MMS?

    (a) You must submit to MMS:
    (1) A single demonstration of OSFR that covers all the COFs for 
which you are the designated applicant;
    (2) A completed and unaltered Form MMS-1016;
    (3) MMS forms that identify your COFs (Form MMS-1021, Form MMS-
1022), and the methods you will use to demonstrate OSFR (Form MMS-1018, 
Form MMS-1019, Form MMS-1020). Forms are available from the address 
listed in Sec. 253.45;
    (4) Any insurance certificates, indemnities, and surety bonds used 
as OSFR evidence for the COFs for which you are the designated 
applicant;
    (5) A completed Form MMS-1017 for each responsible party, unless you 
are

[[Page 310]]

the only responsible party for the COFs covered by your OSFR 
demonstration; and
    (6) Other financial instruments and information the Director 
requires to support your OSFR demonstration under Sec. 253.32.
    (b) Each MMS form you submit to MMS as part of your OSFR 
demonstration must be signed. You also must attach to Form MMS-1016 
proof of your authority to sign.


<R05>
Sec. 253.41  What terms must I include in my OSFR evidence?

    (a) Each instrument you submit as OSFR evidence must specify:
    (1) The effective date, and except for a surety bond, the expiration 
date;
    (2) That termination of the instrument will not affect the liability 
of the instrument issuer for claims arising from an incident (i.e., oil-
spill discharge or substantial threat of the discharge of oil) that 
occurred on or before the effective date of termination;
    (3) That the instrument will remain in force until the termination 
date or until the earlier of:
    (i) Thirty calendar days after MMS and the designated applicant 
receive from the instrument issuer a notification of intent to cancel; 
or
    (ii) MMS receives from the designated applicant other acceptable 
OSFR evidence; or
    (iii) All the COFs to which the instrument applies are permanently 
abandoned in compliance with 30 CFR part 250 or equivalent State 
requirements;
    (4) That the instrument issuer agrees to direct action for claims 
made under OPA up to the guaranty amount, subject to the defenses in 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section and following the procedures in Sec. 
253.60 of this part;
    (5) An agent in the United States for service of process; and
    (6) That the instrument issuer will not use any defenses against a 
claim made under OPA except:
    (i) The rights and defenses that would be available to a designated 
applicant or responsible party for whom the guaranty was provided; and
    (ii) The incident (i.e., oil-spill discharge or a substantial threat 
of the discharge of oil) leading to the claim for removal costs or 
damages was caused by willful misconduct of a responsible party for whom 
the designated applicant demonstrated OSFR.
    (b) You may not change, omit, or add limitations or exceptions to 
the terms and conditions in an MMS form that you submit as part of your 
OSFR demonstration. If you attempt to do this, MMS will disregard the 
changes, omissions, additions, limitations, or exceptions and by 
operation of this rule MMS will consider the form to contain all the 
terms and conditions included on the original MMS form.


<R05>
Sec. 253.42  How can I amend my list of COFs?

    (a) If you want to add a COF that is not identified in your current 
OSFR demonstration, you must submit to MMS a completed Form MMS-1022. If 
applicable, you also must submit any additional indemnities, surety 
bonds, insurance certificates, or other instruments required to extend 
the coverage of your original OSFR demonstration to the COFs to be 
added. You do not need to resubmit previously accepted audited annual 
financial statements for the current fiscal year.
    (b) If you want to drop a COF identified in your current OSFR 
demonstration, you must submit to MMS a completed Form MMS-1022. You 
must continue to demonstrate OSFR for the COF until MMS approves OSFR 
evidence for the COF from another designated applicant, or OSFR is no 
longer required (e.g., until a well that is a COF is properly plugged 
and abandoned).


<R05>
Sec. 253.43  When is my OSFR demonstration or the amendment to my OSFR demonstration effective?

    (a) MMS will notify you in writing when we approve your OSFR 
demonstration. If we find that you have not submitted all the 
information needed to demonstrate OSFR, we may require you to provide 
additional information before we determine whether your OSFR evidence is 
acceptable.
    (b) Except in the case of self-insurance or an indemnity, MMS 
acceptance of OSFR evidence is valid until the surety bond, insurance 
certificate, or

[[Page 311]]

other accepted OSFR instrument expires or is canceled. In the case of 
self-insurance or indemnity, acceptance is valid until the first day of 
the 5th month after the close of your or your indemnitor's current 
fiscal year.

                   Subpart E_Revocation and Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 253.50  How can MMS refuse or invalidate my OSFR evidence?

    (a) If MMS determines that any OSFR evidence you submit fails to 
comply with the requirements of this part, we may not accept it. If we 
do not accept your OSFR evidence, then we will send you a written 
notification stating:
    (1) That your evidence is not acceptable;
    (2) Why your evidence is unacceptable; and
    (3) The amount of time you are allowed to submit acceptable evidence 
without being subject to civil penalty under Sec. 253.51.
    (b) MMS may immediately and without prior notice invalidate your 
OSFR demonstration if you:
    (1) Are no longer eligible to be the designated applicant for a COF 
included in your demonstration; or
    (2) Permit the cancellation or termination of the insurance policy, 
surety bond, or indemnity upon which the continued validity of the 
demonstration is based.
    (c) If MMS determines you are not complying with the requirements of 
this part for any reason other than paragraph (b) of this section, we 
will notify you of our intent to invalidate your OSFR demonstration and 
specify the corrective action needed. Unless you take the corrective 
action MMS specifies within 15 calendar days from the date you receive 
such a notice, we will invalidate your OSFR demonstration.


<R05>
Sec. 253.51  What are the penalties for not complying with this part?

    (a) If you fail to comply with the financial responsibility 
requirements of OPA at 33 U.S.C. 2716 or with the requirements of this 
part, then you may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $27,500 per 
COF per day of violation (that is, each day a COF is operated without 
acceptable evidence of OSFR).
    (b) MMS will determine the date of a noncompliance. MMS will assess 
penalties in accordance with an OSFR penalty schedule using the 
procedures found at 30 CFR part 250, subpart N. You may obtain a copy of 
the penalty schedule from MMS at the address in Sec. 253.45.
    (c) MMS may assess a civil penalty against you that is greater or 
less than the amount in the penalty schedule after taking into account 
the factors in section 4303(a) of OPA (33 U.S.C. 2716a).
    (d) If you fail to correct a deficiency in the OSFR evidence for a 
COF, then the Director may suspend operation of a COF in the OCS under 
30 CFR 250.170 or seek judicial relief, including an order suspending 
the operation of any COF.

        Subpart F_Claims for Oil-Spill Removal Costs and Damages


<R05>
Sec. 253.60  To whom may I present a claim?

    (a) If you are a claimant, you must present your claim first to the 
designated applicant for the COF that is the source of the incident 
resulting in your claim. If, however, the designated applicant has filed 
a petition for bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. chapter 7 or 11, you may 
present your claim first to any of the designated applicant's 
guarantors.
    (b) If the claim you present to the designated applicant or 
guarantor is denied or not paid within 90 days after you first present 
it or advertising begins, whichever is later, then you may seek any of 
the following remedies that apply:

 insolvency or petition in      responsible parties for the COF; or
 bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C.    (ii) Initiate a lawsuit against the
 chapter 7 or 11.               designated applicant and/or any of the
                                responsible parties for the COF; or
                               (iii) Present your claim to the Fund
                                using the procedures at 33 CFR part 136.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) An assertion of            (i) Pursue any of the remedies in items
 insolvency or petition in      (1)(i) through (iii) of this table; or
 bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C.    (ii) Present your claim to any of the
 chapter 7 or 11.               designated applicant's guarantors; or
                               (iii) Initiate a lawsuit against any of
                                the designated applicant's guarantors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) If no one has resolved your claim to your satisfaction using the 
remedy that you elected under paragraph (b) of this section, then you 
may pursue another available remedy, unless the Fund has denied your 
claim or a court of competent jurisdiction has ruled against your claim. 
You may not pursue more than one remedy at a time.
    (d) You may ask MMS to assist you in determining whether a guarantor 
may be liable for your claim. Send your request for assistance to the 
address listed in Sec. 253.45. You must include any information you 
have regarding the existence or identity of possible guarantors.


<R05>
Sec. 253.61  When is a guarantor subject to direct action for claims?

    (a) If you are a guarantor, then you are subject to direct action 
for any claim asserted by:
    (1) The United States for any compensation paid by the Fund under 
OPA, including compensation claim processing costs; and
    (2) A claimant other than the United States if the designated 
applicant has:
    (i) Denied or failed to pay a claim because of being insolvent; or
    (ii) Filed a petition in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. chapters 7 or 
11.
    (b) If you participate in an insurance guaranty for a COF incident 
(i.e., oil-spill discharge or substantial threat of the discharge of 
oil) that is subject to claims under this part, then your maximum, 
aggregate liability for those claims is equal to your quota share of the 
insurance guaranty.


<R05>

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 254.1  Who must submit a spill-response plan?

    (a) If you are the owner or operator of an oil handling, storage, or 
transportation facility, and it is located seaward of the coast line, 
you must submit a spill-response plan to MMS for approval. Your spill-
response plan must demonstrate that you can respond quickly and 
effectively whenever oil is discharged from your facility. Refer to 
Sec. 254.6 for the definitions of ``oil,'' ``facility,'' and ``coast 
line'' if you have any doubts about whether to submit a plan.
    (b) You must maintain a current response plan for an abandoned 
facility until you physically remove or dismantle the facility or until 
the Regional Supervisor notifies you in writing that a plan is no longer 
required.
    (c) Owners or operators of offshore pipelines carrying essentially 
dry gas do not need to submit a plan. You must, however, submit a plan 
for a pipeline that carries:
    (1) Oil;
    (2) Condensate that has been injected into the pipeline; or
    (3) Gas and naturally occurring condensate.
    (d) If you are in doubt as to whether you must submit a plan for an 
offshore facility or pipeline, you should check with the Regional 
Supervisor.
    (e) If your facility is located landward of the coast line, but you 
believe your facility is sufficiently similar to OCS facilities that it 
should be regulated by MMS, you may contact the Regional Supervisor, 
offer to accept MMS jurisdiction over your facility, and request that 
MMS seek from the agency with jurisdiction over your facility a 
relinquishment of that jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 254.2  When must I submit a response plan?

    (a) You must submit, and MMS must approve, a response plan that 
covers each facility located seaward of the coast line before you may 
use that facility. To continue operations, you must operate the facility 
in compliance with the plan.
    (b) Despite the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, you may 
operate your facility after you submit your plan while MMS reviews it 
for approval. To operate a facility without an approved plan, you must 
certify in writing to the Regional Supervisor that you have the 
capability to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst 
case discharge or a substantial threat of such a discharge. The 
certification must show that you have ensured by contract, or other

[[Page 316]]

means approved by the Regional Supervisor, the availability of private 
personnel and equipment necessary to respond to the discharge. 
Verification from the organization(s) providing the personnel and 
equipment must accompany the certification. MMS will not allow you to 
operate a facility for more than 2 years without an approved plan.
    (c) If you have a plan that MMS already approved, you are not 
required to immediately rewrite the plan to comply with this part. You 
must, however, submit the information this regulation requires when 
submitting your first plan revision (see Sec. 254.30) after the 
effective date of this rule. The Regional Supervisor may extend this 
deadline upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 254.3  May I cover more than one facility in my response plan?

    (a) Your response plan may be for a single lease or facility or a 
group of leases or facilities. All the leases or facilities in your plan 
must have the same owner or operator (including affiliates) and must be 
located in the same MMS Region (see definition of Regional Response Plan 
in Sec. 254.6).
    (b) Regional Response Plans must address all the elements required 
for a response plan in Subpart B, Oil Spill Response Plans for Outer 
Continental Shelf Facilities, or Subpart D, Oil Spill Response 
Requirements for Facilities Located in State Waters Seaward of the Coast 
Line, as appropriate.
    (c) When developing a Regional Response Plan, you may group leases 
or facilities subject to the approval of the Regional Supervisor for the 
purposes of:
    (1) Calculating response times;
    (2) Determining quantities of response equipment;
    (3) Conducting oil-spill trajectory analyses;
    (4) Determining worst case discharge scenarios; and
    (5) Identifying areas of special economic and environmental 
importance that may be impacted and the strategies for their protection.
    (d) The Regional Supervisor may specify how to address the elements 
of a Regional Response Plan. The Regional Supervisor also may require 
that Regional Response Plans contain additional information if necessary 
for compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 254.4  May I reference other documents in my response plan?

    You may reference information contained in other readily accessible 
documents in your response plan. Examples of documents that you may 
reference are the National Contingency Plan (NCP), Area Contingency Plan 
(ACP), MMS environmental documents, and Oil Spill Removal Organization 
(OSRO) documents that are readily accessible to the Regional Supervisor. 
You must ensure that the Regional Supervisor possesses or is provided 
with copies of all OSRO documents you reference. You should contact the 
Regional Supervisor if you want to know whether a reference is 
acceptable.


<R05>
Sec. 254.5  General response plan requirements.

    (a) The response plan must provide for response to an oil spill from 
the facility. You must immediately carry out the provisions of the plan 
whenever there is a release of oil from the facility. You must also 
carry out the training, equipment testing, and periodic drills described 
in the plan, and these measures must be sufficient to ensure the safety 
of the facility and to mitigate or prevent a discharge or a substantial 
threat of a discharge.
    (b) The plan must be consistent with the National Contingency Plan 
and the appropriate Area Contingency Plan(s).
    (c) Nothing in this part relieves you from taking all appropriate 
actions necessary to immediately abate the source of a spill and remove 
any spills of oil.
    (d) In addition to the requirements listed in this part, you must 
provide any other information the Regional Supervisor requires for 
compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.


<R05>

    (b) An appropriate trajectory analysis specific to the area in which 
the facility is located. The analysis must identify onshore and offshore 
areas that a discharge potentially could affect. The trajectory analysis 
chosen must reflect the maximum distance from the facility that oil 
could move in a time period that it reasonably could be expected to 
persist in the environment.
    (c) A list of the resources of special economic or environmental 
importance that potentially could be impacted in the areas identified by 
your trajectory analysis. You also must state the strategies that you 
will use for their protection. At a minimum, this list must include 
those resources of special economic and environmental importance, if 
any, specified in the appropriate Area Contingency Plan(s).

contain and recover the discharge to the maximum extent practicable. 
This description must include the types, location(s) and owner, 
quantity, and capabilities of the equipment. You also must include the 
effective daily recovery capacities, where applicable. You must 
calculate the effective daily recovery capacities using the methods 
described in Sec. 254.44. For operations at a drilling or production 
facility, your scenario must show how you will cope with the initial 
spill volume upon arrival at the scene and then support operations for a 
blowout lasting 30 days.
    (2) A description of the personnel, materials, and support vessels 
that would be necessary to ensure that the identified response equipment 
is deployed and operated promptly and effectively. Your description must 
include the location and owner of these resources as well as the 
quantities and types (if applicable);
    (3) A description of your oil storage, transfer, and disposal 
equipment. Your description must include the types, location and owner, 
quantity, and capacities of the equipment; and
    (4) An estimation of the individual times needed for:
    (i) Procurement of the identified containment, recovery, and storage 
equipment;
    (ii) Procurement of equipment transportation vessel(s);
    (iii) Procurement of personnel to load and operate the equipment;
    (iv) Equipment loadout (transfer of equipment to transportation 
vessel(s));
    (v) Travel to the deployment site (including any time required for 
travel from an equipment storage area); and

one time.
    (b) In satisfying the triennial exercise requirement, you must, at a 
minimum, conduct:
    (1) An annual spill management team tabletop exercise. The exercise 
must test the spill management team's organization, communication, and 
decisionmaking in managing a response. You must not reveal the spill 
scenario to team members before the exercise starts.
    (2) An annual deployment exercise of response equipment identified 
in your plan that is staged at onshore locations. You must deploy and 
operate each type of equipment in each triennial period. However, it is 
not necessary to deploy and operate each individual piece of equipment.
    (3) An annual notification exercise for each facility that is manned 
on a 24- hour basis. The exercise must test the ability of facility 
personnel to communicate pertinent information in a timely manner to the 
qualified individual.
    (4) A semiannual deployment exercise of any response equipment which 
the MMS Regional Supervisor requires an owner or operator to maintain at 
the facility or on dedicated vessels. You must deploy and operate each 
type of this equipment at least once each year. Each type need not be 
deployed and operated at each exercise.
    (c) During your exercises, you must simulate conditions in the area 
of operations, including seasonal weather variations, to the extent 
practicable. The exercises must cover a range of scenarios over the 3-
year exercise period, simulating responses to large continuous spills, 
spills of short duration and limited volume, and your worst case 
discharge scenario.
    (d) MMS will recognize and give credit for any documented exercise 
conducted that satisfies some part of the required triennial exercise. 
You will receive this credit whether the owner or operator, an OSRO, or 
a Government regulatory agency initiates the exercise. MMS will give you 
credit for an actual spill response if you evaluate the response and 
generate a proper record. Exercise documentation should include the 
following information:

[[Page 324]]

    (1) Type of exercise;
    (2) Date and time of the exercise;
    (3) Description of the exercise;
    (4) Objectives met; and
    (5) Lessons learned.
    (e) All records of spill-response exercises must be maintained for 
the complete 3-year exercise cycle. Records should be maintained at the 
facility or at a corporate location designated in the plan. Records 
showing that OSRO's and oil spill removal cooperatives have deployed 
each type of equipment also must be maintained for the 3-year cycle.
    (f) You must inform the Regional Supervisor of the date of any 
exercise required by paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (4) of this section at 
least 30 days before the exercise. This will allow MMS personnel the 
opportunity to witness any exercises.
    (g) The Regional Supervisor periodically will initiate unannounced 
drills to test the spill response preparedness of owners and operators.
    (h) The Regional Supervisor may require changes in the frequency or 
location of the required exercises, equipment to be deployed and 
operated, or deployment procedures or strategies. The Regional 
Supervisor may evaluate the results of the exercises and advise the 
owner or operator of any needed changes in response equipment, 
procedures, or strategies.
    (i) Compliance with the National Preparedness for Response Exercise 
Program (PREP) Guidelines will satisfy the exercise requirements of this 
section. Copies of the PREP document may be obtained from the Regional 
Supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 254.43  Maintenance and periodic inspection of response equipment.

    (a) You must ensure that the response equipment listed in your 
response plan is inspected at least monthly and is maintained, as 
necessary, to ensure optimal performance.
    (b) You must ensure that records of the inspections and the 
maintenance activities are kept for at least 2 years and are made 
available to any authorized MMS representative upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 254.44  Calculating response equipment effective daily recovery capacities.

    (a) You are required by Sec. 254.26(d)(1) to calculate the 
effective daily recovery capacity of the response equipment identified 
in your response plan that you would use to contain and recover your 
worst case discharge. You must calculate the effective daily recovery 
capacity of the equipment by multiplying the manufacturer's rated 
throughput capacity over a 24-hour period by 20 percent. This 20 percent 
efficiency factor takes into account the limitations of the recovery 
operations due to available daylight, sea state, temperature, viscosity, 
and emulsification of the oil being recovered. You must use this 
calculated rate to determine if you have sufficient recovery capacity to 
respond to your worst case discharge scenario.
    (b) If you want to use a different efficiency factor for specific 
oil recovery devices, you must submit evidence to substantiate that 
efficiency factor. Adequate evidence includes verified performance data 
measured during actual spills or test data gathered according to the 
provisions of Sec. 254.45 (b) and (c).


<R05>
Sec. 254.45  Verifying the capabilities of your response equipment.

    (a) The Regional Supervisor may require performance testing of any 
spill-response equipment listed in your response plan to verify its 
capabilities if the equipment:
    (1) Has been modified;
    (2) Has been damaged and repaired; or
    (3) Has a claimed effective daily recovery capacity that is 
inconsistent with data otherwise available to MMS.
    (b) You must conduct any required performance testing of booms in 
accordance with MMS-approved test criteria. You may use the document 
``Test Protocol for the Evaluation of Oil-Spill Containment Booms,'' 
available from MMS, for guidance. Performance testing of skimmers also 
must be conducted in accordance with MMS approved test criteria. You may 
use the document ``Suggested Test Protocol for the Evaluation of Oil 
Spill Skimmers for the OCS,'' available from MMS, for guidance.

[[Page 325]]

    (c) You are responsible for any required testing of equipment 
performance and for the accuracy of the information submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 254.46  Whom do I notify if an oil spill occurs?

    (a) You must immediately notify the National Response Center (1-800-
424-8802) if you observe:
    (1) An oil spill from your facility;
    (2) An oil spill from another offshore facility; or
    (3) An offshore spill of unknown origin.
    (b) In the event of a spill of 1 barrel or more from your facility, 
you must orally notify the Regional Supervisor without delay. You also 
must report spills from your facility of unknown size but thought to be 
1 barrel or more.
    (1) If a spill from your facility not originally reported to the 
Regional Supervisor is subsequently found to be 1 barrel or more, you 
must then report it without delay.
    (2) You must file a written followup report for any spill from your 
facility of 1 barrel or more. The Regional Supervisor must receive this 
confirmation within 15 days after the spillage has been stopped. All 
reports must include the cause, location, volume, and remedial action 
taken. Reports of spills of more than 50 barrels must include 
information on the sea state, meteorological conditions, and the size 
and appearance of the slick. The Regional Supervisor may require 
additional information if it is determined that an analysis of the 
response is necessary.
    (c) If you observe a spill resulting from operations at another 
offshore facility, you must immediately notify the responsible party and 
the Regional Supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 254.47  Determining the volume of oil of your worst case discharge scenario.

    You must calculate the volume of oil of your worst case discharge 
scenario as follows:
    (a) For an oil production platform facility, the size of your worst 
case discharge scenario is the sum of the following:
    (1) The maximum capacity of all oil storage tanks and flow lines on 
the facility. Flow line volume may be estimated; and
    (2) The volume of oil calculated to leak from a break in any 
pipelines connected to the facility considering shutdown time, the 
effect of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces and 
other factors; and
    (3) The daily production volume from an uncontrolled blowout of the 
highest capacity well associated with the facility. In determining the 
daily discharge rate, you must consider reservoir characteristics, 
casing/production tubing sizes, and historical production and reservoir 
pressure data. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well 
flowing for 30 days as required by Sec. 254.26(d)(1).
    (b) For exploratory or development drilling operations, the size of 
your worst case discharge scenario is the daily volume possible from an 
uncontrolled blowout. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must 
consider any known reservoir characteristics. If reservoir 
characteristics are unknown, you must consider the characteristics of 
any analog reservoirs from the area and give an explanation for the 
selection of the reservoir(s) used. Your scenario must discuss how to 
respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by Sec. 
254.26(d)(1).
    (c) For a pipeline facility, the size of your worst case discharge 
scenario is the volume possible from a pipeline break. You must 
calculate this volume as follows:
    (1) Add the pipeline system leak detection time to the shutdown 
response time.
    (2) Multiply the time calculated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
by the highest measured oil flow rate over the preceding 12-month 
period. For new pipelines, you should use the predicted oil flow rate in 
the calculation.
    (3) Add to the volume calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
the total volume of oil that would leak from the pipeline after it is 
shut in. Calculate this volume by taking into account the effects of 
hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces, length of 
pipeline segment, tie-ins with other pipelines, and other factors.

[[Page 326]]

    (d) If your facility which stores, handles, transfers, processes, or 
transports oil does not fall into the categories listed in paragraph 
(a), (b), or (c) of this section, contact the Regional Supervisor for 
instructions on the calculation of the volume of your worst case 
discharge scenario.

Sec. 256.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of the regulations in this part is to establish the 
procedures under which the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) will 
exercise the authority to administer a leasing program for oil, gas and 
sulphur. The procedures under which the Secretary will exercise the 
authority to administer a program to grant rights-of-way, rights-of-use 
and easements are addressed in other parts.

[64 FR 72795, Dec. 28, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 256.2  Policy.

    The management of Outer Continental Shelf resources is to be 
conducted in accordance with the findings, purposes and policy 
directions provided by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments 
of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1332, 1801, 1802), and other Executive, legislative, 
judicial and Departmental guidance. The Secretary of the Interior shall 
consider available environmental information in making decisions 
affecting Outer Continental Shelf resources.


<R05>
Sec. 256.4  Authority.

    The outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) (43 U.S.C. 1331 et 
seq.) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue, on a 
competitive basis, leases for oil and gas, and sulphur, in submerged 
lands of the outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Act authorizes the 
Secretary to grant rights-of-way, rights-of-use and easements through 
the submerged lands of the OCS. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6213), prohibits joint bidding by major oil and gas 
producers.

<R05>
Sec. 256.52  Bond requirements for an oil and gas or sulphur lease.

    This section establishes bond requirements for the lessee of an OCS 
oil and gas or sulphur lease.
    (a) Before MMS will issue a new lease or approve the assignment of 
an existing lease to you as lessee, you or another record title owner 
for the lease must:
    (1) Maintain with the Regional Director a $50,000 lease bond that 
guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease; or
    (2) Maintain a $300,000 areawide bond that guarantees compliance 
with all the terms and conditions of all your oil and gas and sulphur 
leases in the area where the lease is located; or
    (3) Maintain a lease or areawide bond in the amount required in 
Sec. 256.53(a) or (b) of this part.
    (b) For the purpose of this section, there are three areas. The area 
offshore the Atlantic Coast is included in the Gulf of Mexico. Areawide 
bonds issued in the Gulf of Mexico will cover oil and gas or sulphur 
operations offshore the Atlantic Coast. The three areas are:
    (1) The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Coast.
    (2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, 
Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and
    (3) The area offshore the Coast of Alaska.
    (c) The requirement to maintain a lease bond (or substitute security 
instruments) under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and Sec. 256.53 (a) 
and (b) is satisfied if your operator provides a lease bond in the 
required amount that guarantees compliance with all the terms and 
conditions of the lease. Your operator may use an areawide bond under 
this paragraph to satisfy your bond obligation.
    (d) If a surety makes payment to the United States under a bond or 
alternative form of security maintained under this section, the surety's 
remaining liability under the bond or alternative form of security is 
reduced by the amount of that payment. See paragraph (e) of this section 
for the requirement to replace the reduced bond coverage.
    (e) If the value of your surety bond or alternative security is 
reduced because of a default, or for any other reason, you must provide 
additional bond coverage sufficient to meet the security required under 
this subpart within 6 months, or such shorter period of time as the 
Regional Director may direct.

[[Page 343]]

    (f) You may pledge U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) 
securities instead of a bond. The Treasury securities you pledge must be 
negotiable for an amount of cash equal to the value of the bond they 
replace.
    (1) If you pledge Treasury securities under this paragraph (f), you 
must monitor their value. If their market value falls below the level of 
bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional 
Treasury securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the 
required amount.
    (2) If you pledge Treasury securities, you must include authority 
for the Regional Director to sell them and use the proceeds when the 
Regional Director determines that you fail to satisfy any lease 
obligation.
    (g) You may pledge alternative types of security instruments instead 
of providing a bond if the Regional Director determines that the 
alternative security protects the interests of the United States to the 
same extent as the required bond.
    (1) If you pledge an alternative type of security under this 
paragraph, you must monitor the security's value. If its market value 
falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you 
must pledge additional securities to raise the value of the securities 
pledged to the required amount.
    (2) If you pledge an alternative type of security, you must include 
authority for the Regional Director to sell the security and use the 
proceeds when the Regional Director determines that you failed to 
satisfy any lease obligation.
    (h) If you fail to replace a deficient bond or to provide additional 
bond coverage upon demand, the Regional Director may:
    (1) Assess penalties under part 250, subpart N of this chapter;
    (2) Suspend production and other operations on your leases in 
accordance with Sec. 250.110 of this chapter; and
    (3) Initiate action to cancel your lease.

Sec. 256.53  Additional bonds.

    (a) This paragraph explains what bonds the lessee must provide 
before lease exploration activities commence.
    (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director a $200,000 bond that 
guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by 
the earliest of:
    (A) The date you submit a proposed Exploration Plan (EP) for 
approval;
    (B) The date you submit a request for approval of the assignment of 
a lease on which an EP has been approved; or
    (C) December 8, 1997, for any lease for which an EP has been 
approved.
    (ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $200,000 
lease exploration bond after you submit an EP but before he/she approves 
drilling activities under the EP.
    (iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph (a) by 
providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.
    (2) A $200,000 lease exploration bond pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section need not be submitted and maintained if the lessee 
either:
    (i) Furnishes and maintains an areawide bond in the sum of $1 
million issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with 
all the terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulphur leases held by 
the lease on the OCS for the area in which the lessee is situated; or
    (ii) Furnishes and maintains a bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (b) This paragraph explains what bonds you (the lessee) must provide 
before lease development and production activities commence.
    (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director a $500,000 bond that 
guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by 
the earliest of:
    (A) The date you submit a proposed Development and Production Plan 
(DPP) or Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) for 
approval;
    (B) The date you submit a request for approval of the assignment of 
a lease on which a DPP or DOCD has been approved; or
    (C) December 8, 1997, for any lease for which a DPP or DOCD has been 
approved.
    (ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $500,000 
lease

[[Page 344]]

development bond after you submit a DPP or DOCD, but before he/she 
approves the installation of a platform or the commencement of drilling 
activities under the DPP or DOCD.
    (iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph by 
providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.
    (2) The lessee need not submit and maintain a $500,000 lease 
development bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the 
lessee furnishes and maintains an areawide bond in the sum of $3 million 
issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with all the 
terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulphur leases held by the 
lessee on the OCS for the area in which the lease is situated.
    (c) When a lessee can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
authorized officer that wells and platforms can be abandoned and removed 
and the drilling and platform sites cleared of obstructions for less 
than the amount of lease bond coverage required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the authorized officer may accept a lease surety bond 
in an amount less than the prescribed amount but not less than the 
amount of the cost for well abandonment, platform removal, and site 
clearance.
    (d) The Regional Director may determine that additional security 
(i.e., security above the amounts prescribed in Sec. Sec. 256.52(a) and 
256.53 (a) and (b) of this part) is necessary to ensure compliance with 
the obligations under your lease and the regulations in this chapter.
    (1) The Regional Director's determination will be based on his/her 
evaluation of your ability to carry out present and future financial 
obligations demonstrated by:
    (i) Financial capacity substantially in excess of existing and 
anticipated lease and other obligations, as evidenced by audited 
financial statements (including auditor's certificate, balance sheet, 
and profit and loss sheet);
    (ii) Projected financial strength significantly in excess of 
existing and future lease obligations based on the estimated value of 
your existing OCS lease production and proven reserves of future 
production;
    (iii) Business stability based on 5 years of continuous operation 
and production of oil and gas or sulphur in the OCS or in the onshore 
oil and gas industry;
    (iv) Reliability in meeting obligations based on:
    (A) Credit rating(s); or
    (B) Trade references, including names and addresses of other 
lessees, drilling contractors, and suppliers with whom you have dealt; 
and
    (v) Record of compliance with laws, regulations, and lease terms.
    (2) You may satisfy the Regional Director's demand for additional 
security by increasing the amount of your existing bond or by providing 
a supplemental bond or bonds.
    (e) The Regional Director will determine the amount of supplemental 
bond required to guarantee compliance. The Regional Director will 
consider potential underpayment of royalty and cumulative obligations to 
abandon wells, remove platforms and facilities, and clear the seafloor 
of obstructions in the Regional Director's case-specific analysis.
    (f) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities either 
increase or decrease, the Regional Director may adjust the amount of 
supplemental bond required.
    (1) If the Regional Director proposes an adjustment, the Regional 
Director will:
    (i) Notify you and the surety of any proposed adjustment to the 
amount of bond required; and
    (ii) Give you an opportunity to submit written or oral comment on 
the adjustment.
    (2) If you request a reduction of the amount of supplemental bond 
required, you must submit evidence to the Regional Director 
demonstrating that the projected amount of royalties due the Government 
and the estimated costs of lease abandonment and cleanup are less than 
the required bond amount. If the Regional Director finds that the 
evidence you submit is convincing, he/she may reduce the amount of 
supplemental bond required.

Sec. 256.56  Lease-specific abandonment accounts.

    (a) The Regional Director may authorize you to establish a lease-
specific abandonment account in a federally insured institution in lieu

that, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, funds may 
not be withdrawn without the written approval of the Regional Director.
    (1) Funds in a lease-specific abandonment account must be payable 
upon demand to MMS and pledged to meet the lessee's obligations under

by MMS within the timeframe the Regional Director prescribes.
    (3) You must provide binding instructions under which the 
institution managing the account is to purchase Treasury securities 
pledged to MMS under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Any interest paid on funds in a lease-specific abandonment 
account

[[Page 346]]

will be treated as other funds in the account unless the Regional 
Director authorizes in writing the payment of interest to the party who 
deposits the funds.
    (c) The Regional Director may allow you to pledge Treasury 
securities that are made payable upon demand to the Regional Director to 
satisfy your obligation to make payments into a lease-specific 
abandonment account.
    (d) Before the amount of funds in a lease-specific abandonment 
account equals the maximum insurable amount as determined by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corporation, the institution managing the account must use the funds in 
the account to purchase Treasury securities pledged to MMS under 
paragraph (c) of this section. The institution managing the lease 
specific-abandonment account will join with the Regional Director to 
establish a Federal Reserve Circular 154 account to hold these Treasury 
securities, unless the Regional Director authorizes the managing 
institution to retain the pledged Treasury securities in a separate 
trust account. You may obtain a copy of the current Treasury Circular 
No. 154 from the Surety Bond Branch, Financial Management Service, 
Department of the Treasury, East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782.
    (e) The Regional Director may require you to create an overriding 
royalty or production payment obligation for the benefit of a lease-
specific account pledged for the abandonment and clearance of a lease.

production from a lease other than the lease bonded through the lease-
specific abandonment account.

under its guarantee of compliance with all the terms and conditions of 
your lease, the regulations in this chapter, and your guarantor's other

liabilities, taking into account liabilities under its guarantee of

Sec. 256.58  Termination of the period of liability and cancellation of a bond.

    This section defines the terms and conditions under which MMS will 
terminate the period of liability of a bond or cancel a bond. 
Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period during 
which obligations continue to accrue but does not relieve the surety of 
the responsibility for obligations that accrued during the period of 
liability. Canceling a bond relieves the surety of all liability. The 
liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include obligations 
that started to accrue prior to the beginning of the period of liability 
and had not been met and obligations that begin accruing during the 
period of liability.
    (a) When the surety under your bond requests termination:
    (1) The Regional Director will terminate the period of liability 
under your bond within 90 days after MMS receives the request; and
    (2) If you intend to continue operations, or have not met all end of 
lease obligations, you must provide a replacement bond of an equivalent 
amount.
    (b) If you provide a replacement bond, the Regional Director will 
cancel your previous bond and the surety that provided your previous 
bond will not retain any liability, provided that:
    (1) The new bond is equal to or greater than the bond that was 
terminated, or you provide an alternative form of security, and the 
Regional Director determines that the alternative form of security 
provides a level of security equal to or greater than that provided for 
by the bond that was terminated;
    (2) For a base bond submitted under Sec. 256.52(a) or under Sec. 
256.53(a) or (b), the surety issuing the new bond agrees to assume all 
outstanding liabilities that accrued during the period of liability that 
was terminated; and
    (3) For supplemental bonds submitted under Sec. 256.53(d), the 
surety issuing the new supplemental bond agrees to assume that portion 
of the outstanding liabilities that accrued during the period of 
liability which was terminated and that the Regional Director determines 
may exceed the coverage of the base bond, and of which the Regional 
Director notifies the provider of the bond.
    (c) This paragraph applies if the period of liability is terminated 
for a bond but the bond is not replaced by a bond of an equivalent 
amount. The surety that provided your terminated bond will continue to 
be responsible for accrued obligations:
    (1) Until the obligations are satisfied; and
    (2) For additional periods of time in accordance with paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (d) When your lease expires or is terminated, the surety that issued 
a bond will continue to be responsible, and the Regional Director will

security.
    (b) The Regional Director may pursue forfeiture of your bond without

rights owner, or other person authorized to perform lease obligations.
    (c) The Regional Director will:
    (1) Notify you, the surety on your bond or other form of security, 
and any third-party guarantor, of his/her determination to call for 
forfeiture of the bond, security, or guarantee under this section.
    (i) This notice will be in writing and will provide the reasons for 
the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited.
    (ii) The Regional Director must base the amount he/she determines is 
forfeited upon his/her estimate of the total cost of corrective action 
to bring your lease into compliance.
    (2) Advise you, your third-party guarantor, and any surety, that 
you, your guarantor, and any surety may avoid forfeiture if, within 5 
working days:
    (i) You agree to, and demonstrate that you will, bring your lease 
into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director 
prescribes;
    (ii) Your third-party guarantor agrees to, and demonstrates that it

Director prescribes, even if the cost of compliance exceeds the face 
amount of the bond or other surety instrument.

cause the forfeiture of any bonds and other security deposited as your 
guarantee of compliance with the terms and conditions of your lease and 
the regulations in this chapter.

[[Page 350]]

    (e) If the Regional Director determines that your bond and/or other 
security is forfeited, the Regional Director will:
    (1) Collect the forfeited amount; and
    (2) Use the funds collected to bring your leases into compliance and 
to correct any default.
    (f) If the amount the Regional Director collects under your bond and 
other security is insufficient to pay the full cost of corrective 
actions he/she may:
    (1) Take or direct action to obtain full compliance with your lease 
and the regulations in this chapter; and
    (2) Recover from you, any co-lessee, operating rights owner, and/or 
any third-party guarantor responsible under this subpart all costs in 
excess of the amount he/she collects under your forfeited bond and other 
security.
    (g) The amount that the Regional Director collects under your 
forfeited bond and other security may exceed the costs of taking the 
corrective actions required to obtain full compliance with the terms and 
conditions of your lease and the regulations in this chapter. In this 
case, the Regional Director will return the excess funds to the party 
from whom they were collected.

officially designated subdivision of a lease, only if:
    (1) You qualify to hold a lease under Sec. 256.35(b);
    (2) You provide the bond coverage required under subpart I of this 
part; and
    (3) The Regional Director approves the assignment.

cause a bid to be disqualified.
    (c) Any approved assignment shall be deemed to be effective on the 
first day of the lease month following its filing in the appropriate 
office of the MMS, unless at the request of the parties, an earlier date 
is specified in the approval.
    (d) You, as assignor, are liable for all obligations that accrue 
under your lease before the date that the Regional Director approves

Regional Director's approval of the assignment does not relieve you of 
accrued lease obligations that your assignee, or a subsequent assignee, 
fails to perform.
    (e) Your assignee and each subsequent assignee are liable for all 
obligations that accrue under the lease after the date that the Regional 
Director approves the governing assignment. They must:

regulations issued under the Act; and
    (2) Remedy all existing environmental problems on the tract, 
properly abandon all wells, and reclaim the lease site in accordance 
with part 250, subpart Q.
    (f) If your assignee, or a subsequent assignee, fails to perform any

Regional Director may require you to bring the lease into compliance to 
the extent that the obligation accrued before the Regional Director 
approved the assignment of your interest in the lease.

criteria specified in Sec. 256.35 of this part. When you submit an 
instrument to create or transfer an interest as an association, you must 
include a statement signed by the transferee about the transferee's 
citizenship and qualifications to own a lease.
    (4) Your instrument to create or transfer an interest must contain

instrument, a separate fee applies to each individual transfer of 
interest. For any document you are not required to file by these 
regulations but which you submit for record purposes, you must also pay 
electronically through Pay.gov the service fee listed in Sec. 256.63

lease, your assignee must furnish a bond in the amount prescribed in 
Sec. Sec. 256.52 and 256.53 of this part.

[[Page 352]]

lease, the assignee may, with the surety's consent, become a joint 
principal on the surety instrument that guarantees compliance with all 
the terms and conditions of the lease.
    (e) An heir or devisee of a deceased holder of a lease, or any 
interest therein, shall be recognized as the lawful successor to such 
lease or interest, if evidence of status as an heir or devisee is 
furnished in the form of:
    (1) A certified copy of an appropriate order or decree of the court

section, the heirs or devisees shall file statements that they are the 
persons named as successors to the estate with evidence of their 
qualifications as provided in Sec. 256.46 of this part.
    (g) In the event an heir or devisee is unable to qualify to hold the 
lease or interest, the heir or devisee shall be recognized as the lawful 
successor of the deceased and be entitled to hold the lease for a period

chapter with each prior lessee and with each operating rights owner 
holding an interest at the time the obligation accrued, unless this 
chapter provides otherwise.
    (2) Sublessees and operating rights owners are jointly and severally 
liable for the performance of each nonmonetary obligation under the 
lease and under the regulations in this chapter to the extent that:
    (i) The obligation relates to the area embraced by the sublease;
    (ii) Those owners held their respective interest at the time the 
obligation accrued; and
    (iii) This chapter does not provide otherwise.
    (i) Where the proposed assignment or transfer is by a person who, at 
the time of acquisition of an interest in the lease, was on the List of 
Restricted Joint Bidders, and that assignment or transfer is of less 
than the entire interest of the assignor or transferor, to a person or 
persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders, the assignor or 
transferor shall file a copy, prior to approval of the assignment, of 
all agreements applicable to the acquisition of that lease or a 
fractional interest.

drilled under the leased area from surface locations on adjacent or 
adjoining land not covered by the lease. In such circumstances, drilling 
shall be considered to have commenced on the leased area when drilling 
is commenced on the adjacent or adjoining land for the purpose of 
directional drilling under the leased area through any directional well 
surfaced on adjacent or adjoining land. Production, drillling or 
reworking of any such directional well shall be considered production or 
drilling or reworking operations on the leased area for all purposes of 
the lease.

provision of the act or lease or applicable regulations, if such failure 
to comply continues for 30 days after mailing of notice by registered or 
certified letter to the lease owner at the owner's record post office 
address. Any such cancellation is subject to judicial review as provided 
in section 23(b) of the Act.
    (b) Producing leases issued under the Act may be cancelled by the 
Secretary whenever the lessee fails to comply with any provision of the 
Act, applicable regulations or the lease only after judicial proceedings 
as prescribed by section 5(d) of the Act.
    (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, shall 
be canceled by the authorized officer upon proof that it was obtained by 
fraud or misrepresentation, and after notice and opportunity to be heard 
has been afforded to the lessee.
    (d) Pursuant to section 5(a) of the Act, the Secretary may cancel a 
lease when:
    (1) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause 
serious harm or damage to life, property, any mineral, national security 
or defense, or to the marine, coastal or human environment;
    (2) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
    (3) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of 
continuing such lease or permit in force. Procedures and conditions 
contained in 30 CFR 250.182 shall apply as appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 256.79  Effect of regulations on lease.

    (a) All regulations in this part, insofar as they are applicable, 
shall supersede the provisions of any lease which is maintained under 
section 6(a) of the Act. However, the provisions of a lease relating to 
area, minerals, rentals, royalties (subject to sections 6(a) (8) and (9) 
of the Act), and term (subject to section 6(a)(10) of the Act and, as to 
sulfur, subject to section 6(b)(2) of the Act) shall continue in effect, 
and, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency, shall take 
precedence over these regulations.
    (b) A lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act shall also be 
subject to all operating and conservation regulations applicable to the 
OCS. In addition, the regulations relating to geophysical and geological 
exploratory operations and to pipeline rights-of-way are applicable, to 
the extent that those regulations are not contrary to or inconsistent 
with the lease provisions relating to area, the minerals, rentals, 
royalties and term. The lessee shall comply with any provision of the 
lease as validated, the subject matter of which is not covered in the 
regulations in this part.

Sec. 256.80  Leases of other minerals.

    The existence of a lease that meets the requirements of section 6(a) 
of the Act shall not preclude the issuance of other leases of the same 
area for deposits of other minerals. However, no other lease of minerals 
shall authorize or permit the lessee thereunder unreasonably to 
interfere with or endanger operations under the existing lease. No 
sulphur leases shall be granted by the United States on any area while 
such area is included in a lease covering sulphur under section 6(b) of 
the Act.

                            Subpart M_Studies


<R05>
Sec. 256.82  Environmental studies.

    (a) The Director shall conduct a study of any area or region 
included in any lease sale in order to establish information needed for 
assessment and management of impacts on the human, marine and coastal 
environments which may be affected by OCS oil and gas activities in such 
area or region. Any study shall, to the extent practicable, be designed 
to predict environmental impacts of pollutants introduced into the 
environments and of the impacts of offshore activities on the seabed and 
affected coastal areas.
    (b) Studies shall be planned and carried out in cooperation with the 
affected States and interested parties and, to the extent possible, 
shall not duplicate studies done under other laws. Where appropriate, 
the Director shall, to the maximum extent practicable, enter into 
agreements with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 
executing the environmental studies responsibilities. By agreement, the 
Director may also utilize services, personnel or facilities of any 
Federal, State or local government agency in the conduct of such study.
    (c) Any study of an area or region required by paragraph (a) of this 
section for a lease sale shall be commenced not later than six months 
prior to holding a lease sale for that area. The Director may utilize 
information collected in any prior study. The Director may initiate 
studies for areas or regions not identified in the leasing program.
    (d) After the leasing and developing of any area or region, the 
Director shall conduct such studies as are deemed necessary to establish 
additional information and shall monitor the human, marine and coastal 
environments of such area or region in a manner designed to provide 
information which can be compared with the results of studies conducted 
prior to OCS oil and gas development. This shall be done to identify any 
significant changes in the quality and productivity of such 
environments, to establish trends in the areas studies, and to design 
experiments identifying the causes of such changes. Findings from such 
studies shall be used to recommend modifications in practices which are 
employed to mitigate the effects of OCS activities and to enhance the 
data/information base for predicting impacts which might result from a 
single lease sale or cumulative OCS activities.
    (e) Information available or collected by the studies program shall, 
to the extent practicable, be provided in a form and in a timeframe that 
can be used in the decision-making process associated with a specific 
leasing action or with longer term OCS minerals management 
responsibilities.

<R05>
Sec. 260.112  How do royalty suspension volumes apply to eligible leases?

    Royalty suspension volumes, as specified in section 304 of the Act, 
apply to eligible leases that meet the criteria in Sec. 260.113. For 
purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 260.113 through 260.117:

approved unit agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 260.113  When does an eligible lease qualify for a royalty suspension volume?

    (a) Your eligible lease will receive a royalty suspension volume as 
specified in the Act. The bidding system in Sec. 260.110(g) applies.
    (b) Your eligible lease may receive a royalty suspension volume only 
if your entire lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.

<R05>
Sec. 260.115  How long will a royalty suspension volume for an eligible lease be effective?

    A royalty suspension volume for an eligible lease will continue 
through the end of the month in which cumulative production from the 
leases in a field entitled to share the royalty suspension volume 
reaches that volume or the lease period ends.


<R05>
Sec. 260.116  How do I measure natural gas production on my eligible lease?

    You must measure natural gas production on your eligible lease 
subject to the royalty suspension volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic 
feet of natural gas, measured according to part 250, subpart L of this 
title, equals one barrel of oil equivalent.

                     Royalty Suspension (RS) Leases


<R05>
Sec. 260.120  How does royalty suspension apply to leases issued in a sale held after November 2000?

    We may issue leases with suspension of royalties for a period, 
volume or value of production, as authorized in section 303 of the Act. 
For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 260.121 through 260.124:
    (a) Any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing 
under the lease or the regulations (e.g., fuel

[[Page 362]]

gas) do not count against royalty suspension volumes; and
    (b) Production includes volumes allocated to a lease under an 
approved unit agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 260.121  When does a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000 get a royalty suspension?

    (a) We will specify any royalty suspension for your RS lease in the 
Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register for the sale 
in which you acquire the RS lease and will repeat it in the lease 
document. In addition:
    (1) Your RS lease may produce royalty-free the royalty suspension we 
specify for your lease, even if the field to which we assign it is 
producing.
    (2) The royalty suspension we specify in the Notice of OCS Lease 
Sale for your lease does not apply to any other leases in the field to 
which we assign your RS lease.
    (b) You may apply for a supplemental royalty suspension for a 
project under part 203 of this title, if your lease is located:
    (1) In the Gulf of Mexico, in water 200 meters or deeper, and wholly 
west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; or
    (2) Offshore of Alaska.
    (c) Your RS lease retains the royalty suspension with which we 
issued it even if we deny your application for more relief.

<R05>
Sec. 260.122  How long will a royalty suspension volume be effective for

a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000?

    (a) The royalty suspension volume for your RS lease will continue 
through the end of the month in which cumulative production from your 
lease reaches the applicable royalty suspension volume or the lease 
period ends.
    (b)(1) Notwithstanding any royalty suspension volume under this 
subpart, you must pay royalty at the lease stipulated rate on:
    (i) Any oil produced for any period stipulated in the lease during 
which the arithmetic average of the daily closing price on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for light sweet crude oil exceeds the 
applicable threshold price of $36.39 per barrel, adjusted annually after 
calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a 
different price threshold.
    (ii) Any natural gas produced for any period stipulated in the lease 
during which the arithmetic average of the daily closing price on the 
NYMEX for natural gas exceeds the applicable threshold price of $4.55 
per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation 
unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.
    (iii) Determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 
by adjusting the threshold price in the previous year by the percentage 
that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product, as 
published by the Department of Commerce, changed during the calendar 
year.
    (2) You must pay any royalty due under this paragraph, plus late 
payment interest under Sec. 218.54 of this title, no later than 90 days 
after the end of the period for which royalty is owed.
    (3) Any production on which you must pay royalty under this 
paragraph will count toward the production volume determined under 
Sec. Sec. 260.120 through 260.124.
    (c) If you must pay royalty on any product (either oil or natural 
gas) for any period under paragraph (b), you must continue to pay 
royalty on that product during the next succeeding period of the same 
length until the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX prices 
for that product for that period can be determined. If the arithmetic 
average of the daily closing prices for that product for that period is 
less than the threshold price stipulated in the lease, you are entitled 
to a credit or refund of royalties paid for that period with interest 
under applicable law.

<R05>
Sec. 260.123  How do I measure natural gas production for a lease issued in 

a sale held after November 2000?

    You must measure natural gas production subject to the royalty 
suspension volume for your lease as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of 
natural gas,

[[Page 363]]

measured according to part 250, subpart L of this title, equals one 
barrel of oil equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 260.124  How will royalty suspension apply if MMS assigns a lease

issued in a sale held after November 2000 to a field that has a pre-Act lease?

    (a) We will assign your lease that has a qualifying well (under part 
250, subpart A of this title) to an existing field or designate a new 
field and will notify you and other affected lessees and operating 
rights holders in the field of that assignment.
    (1) Within 15 days of the final notification, you or any of the 
other affected lessees or operating rights holders may file a written 
request with the Director for reconsideration, accompanied by a 
Statement of Reasons.
    (2) The Director will respond in writing either affirming or 
reversing the assignment decision. The Director's decision is the final 
action of the Department of the Interior and is not subject to appeal to 
the Interior Board of Land Appeals under part 290 of this title and 43 
CFR part 4.
    (b) If we establish a royalty suspension volume for a field as a 
result of an approved application for royalty relief submitted for a 
pre-Act lease under part 203 of this chapter, then:
    (1) Royalty-free production from your RS lease shares from and 
counts as part of any royalty suspension volume under Sec. 260.114(d) 
for the field to which we assign your lease; and
    (2) Your RS lease may continue to produce royalty-free up to the 
royalty suspension we specified for your lease, even if the field to 
which we assign your RS lease has produced all of its royalty suspension 
volume.
    (c) Your lease may share in a suspension volume larger than the 
royalty suspension with which we issued it and to the extent we grant a 
larger volume in response to an application by a pre-Act lease submitted 
under part 203 of this title. To share in any larger royalty suspension 
volume, you must file an application described in Sec. Sec. 203.71 and 
203.83. In no case will royalty-free production for your RS lease be 
less than the royalty suspension specified for your lease.

leading to the offer of OCS minerals for lease and notify the applicant 
of the action taken or inform the applicant of the reasons for not 
initiating steps leading to the offer of OCS minerals for lease.
    (c) Any interested party may at any time submit information to the 
Director concerning the scheduling of proposed lease sales of OCS 
minerals in any area of the OCS. Such information may include but not be 
limited to any of the following:
    (1) Benefits of conducting a lease sale in an area.
    (2) Costs of conducting a lease sale in an area.
    (3) Geohazards which could be encountered in an area.

Sec. 281.12  Request for OCS mineral information and interest.

    (a) When considering whether to offer OCS minerals for lease, the 
Secretary, upon the Department of the Interior's own initiative or as a 
result of a submission under Sec. 281.11, may request indications of 
interest in the leasing of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS 
minerals, or all OCS minerals in the area being considered for lease. 
Requests for information and interest

[[Page 381]]

shall be published in the Federal Register and may be published 
elsewhere.
    (b) States and local governments, industry, other Federal Agencies, 
and all interested parties (including the public) may respond to a 
request for information and interest. All information provided to the 
Secretary will be considered in the decision whether to proceed with 
additional steps leading to the offering of OCS minerals for lease.
    (c) The Secretary may request specific information concerning the 
offering of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS minerals, or all OCS 
minerals in a broad area for lease or the offering of one or more 
discrete tracts which represent a minable orebody. The Secretary's 
request may ask for comments on OCS areas which have been determined to 
warrant special consideration and analysis. Requests may be for comments 
concerning geological conditions or archaeological resources on the 
seabed; multiple uses of the area proposed for leasing, including 
navigation, recreation and fisheries; and other socioeconomic, 
biological, and environmental information relating to the area proposed 
for leasing.

<R05>
Sec. 281.13  Joint State/Federal coordination.

    (a) The Secretary may invite the adjacent State Governor(s) to join 
in, or the adjacent State Governor(s) may request that the Secretary 
join in, the establishment of a State/Federal task force or some other 
joint planning or coordination arrangement when industry interest exists 
for OCS mineral leasing or geological information appears to support the 
leasing of OCS minerals in specific areas. Participation in joint State/
Federal task forces or other arrangements will afford the adjacent State 
Governor(s) opportunity for access to available data and information 
about the area; knowledge of progress made in the leasing process and of 
the results of subsequent exploration and development activities; 
facilitate the resolution of issues of mutual interest; and provide a 
mechanism for planning, coordination, consultation, and other activities 
which the Secretary and the Governor(s) may identify as contributing to 
the leasing process.
    (b) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangement are to be 
constituted pursuant to such terms and conditions (consistent with 
Federal law and these regulations) as the Secretary and the adjacent 
State Governor(s) may agree.
    (c) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements will 
provide a forum which the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) may 
use for planning, consultation, and coordination on concerns associated 
with the offering of OCS minerals other than oil, gas, or sulphur for 
lease.
    (d) With respect to the activities authorized under these 
regulations each State/Federal task force may make recommendations to 
the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) concerning:
    (1) The identification of areas in which OCS minerals might be 
offered for lease;
    (2) The potential for conflicts between the exploration and 
development of OCS mineral resources, other users and uses of the area, 
and means for resolution or mitigation of these conflicts;
    (3) The economic feasibility of developing OCS mineral resources in 
the area proposed for leasing;
    (4) Potential environmental problems and measures that might be 
taken to mitigate these problems;
    (5) Development of guidelines and procedures for safe, 
environmentally responsible exploration and development practices; and
    (6) Other issues of concern to the Secretary and adjacent State 
Governor(s).
    (e) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements might also 
be used to conduct or oversee research, studies, or reports (e.g., 
Environmental Impact Statements).


<R05>
Sec. 281.14  OCS mining area identification.

    The Secretary, after considering the available OCS mineral resources 
and environmental data and information, the recommendation of any joint 
State/Federal task force established pursuant to Sec. 281.13 of this 
part, and the comments received from interested parties, shall select 
the tracts to be considered for offering for lease. The selected

[[Page 382]]

tracts will be considered in the environmental analysis conducted for 
the proposed lease offering.


<R05>
Sec. 281.15  Tract size.

    The size of the tracts to be offered for lease shall be as 
determined by the Secretary and specified in the leasing notice. It is 
intended that tracts offered for lease be sufficiently large to include 
potentially minable OCS mineral orebodies. When the presence of any 
minable orebody is unknown and additional prospecting is needed to 
discover and delineate OCS minerals, the size of tracts specified in the 
leasing notice may be relatively large.


<R05>
Sec. 281.16  Proposed leasing notice.

    (a) Prior to offering OCS minerals in an area for lease, the 
Director shall assess the available information including 
recommendations of any joint State/Federal task force established 
pursuant to Sec. 281.13 of this part to determine lease sale procedures 
to be prescribed and to develop a proposed leasing notice which sets out 
the proposed primary term of the OCS mineral leases to be offered; lease 
stipulations including measures to mitigate potentially adverse impacts 
on the environment; and such rental, royalty, and other terms and 
conditions as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice.
    (b) The proposed leasing notice shall be sent to the Governor(s) of 
any adjacent State(s), and a Notice of its availability shall be 
published in the Federal Register at least 60 days prior to the 
publication of the leasing notice.
    (c) Written comments of the adjacent State Governor(s) submitted 
within 60 days after publication of the Notice of Availability of the 
proposed leasing notice shall be considered by the Secretary.
    (d) Prior to publication of the leasing notice, the Secretary shall 
respond in writing to the comments of the adjacent State Governor(s) 
stating the reasons for accepting or rejecting the Governor's 
recommendations, or for implementing any alternative mutually acceptable 
approach identified in consultation with the Governor(s) as a means to 
provide a reasonable balance between the national interest and the well 
being of the citizens of the adjacent State.


<R05>
Sec. 281.17  Leasing notice.

    (a) The Director shall publish the leasing notice in the Federal 
Register at least 30 days prior to the date that OCS minerals will be 
offered for lease. The leasing notice shall state whether oral or sealed 
bids or a combination thereof will be used; the place, date, and time at 
which sealed bids shall be filed; and the place, date, and time at which 
sealed bids shall be opened and/or oral bids received. The leasing 
notice shall contain or reference a description of the tract(s) to be 
offered for lease; specify the mineral(s) to be offered for lease (if 
less than all OCS minerals are being offered); specify the period of 
time the primary term of the lease shall cover; and any stipulation(s), 
term(s), and condition(s) of the offer to lease (43 U.S.C. 1337(k)).
    (b) The leasing notice shall contain a reference to the OCS minerals 
lease form which shall be issued to successful bidders.
    (c) The leasing notice shall specify the terms and conditions 
governing the payment of the winning bid.


<R05>
Sec. 281.18  Bidding system.

    (a) The OCS minerals shall be offered by competitive, cash bonus 
bidding under terms and conditions specified in the leasing notice and 
in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
    (b)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of sealed bids, 
such bids received in response to the leasing notice shall be opened at 
the place, date, and time specified in the leasing notice. The sole 
purpose of opening bids is to publicly announce and record the bids 
received, and no bids shall be accepted or rejected at that time.
    (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject any and all sealed 
bids received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.
    (3) In the event the highest bids are tie bids when using sealed 
bidding procedures, the tied bidders may be permitted to submit oral 
bids to determine the highest cash bonus bidder.

[[Page 383]]

    (c)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of oral bids, oral 
bids shall be received at the place, time, and date and in accordance 
with the procedures specified in the leasing notice.
    (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject all oral bids 
received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.
    (d) When the leasing notice specifies the use of deferred cash bonus 
bidding, bids shall be received in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section, as appropriate. The high bid will be determined based 
upon the net present value of each total bid. The appropriate discount 
rate will be specified in the leasing notice. High bidders using the 
deferred bonus option shall pay a minimum of 20 percent of the cash 
bonus bid prior to lease issuance. At least a total of 60 percent of the 
cash bonus bid shall be due on or before the 5th anniversary of the 
lease, and payment of the remainder of the cash bonus bid shall be due 
on the 10th anniversary of the lease. The lessee shall submit a bond 
guaranteeing payment of the deferred portion of the bonus, in accordance 
with Sec. 281.33.


<R05>
Sec. 281.19  Lease term.

    An OCS mineral lease for OCS minerals other than sand and gravel 
shall be for a primary term of not less than 20 years as stipulated in 
the leasing notice. The primary lease term for each OCS mineral shall be 
determined based on exploration and development requirements for the OCS 
minerals being offered by the Secretary. An OCS mineral lease for sand 
and gravel shall be for a primary term of 10 years unless otherwise 
stipulated in the leasing notice. A lease will continue beyond the 
specified primary term for so long thereafter as leased OCS minerals are 
being produced in accordance with an approved mining operation or the 
lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of the lease and the 
regulations in this chapter under which a lessee can earn continuance of 
the OCS mineral lease in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 281.20  Submission of bids.

    (a) If the bidder is an individual, a statement of citizenship shall 
accompany the bid.
    (b) If the bidder is an association (including a partnership), the

either the minutes of the board of directors or of the bylaws indicating 
that the person signing has authority to do so, or a certificate to that 
effect signed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the corporation 
over the corporate seal, or appropriate reference to statements or 
records previously submitted to an MMS OCS office (including material 
submitted in compliance with prior regulations). Bidders are advised to 
keep their filings current.
    (3) The bid shall be executed in conformance with corporate 
requirements.
    (d) Bidders should be aware of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1860, 
which prohibits unlawful combination or intimidation of bidders.
    (e) When sealed bidding is specified in the leasing notice, a 
separate sealed bid shall be submitted for each bid unit that is bid 
upon as described in the leasing notice. A bid may not be submitted for 
less than a bidding unit identified in the leasing notice.

oral bid.


<R05>
Sec. 281.21  Award of leases.

    (a)(1) The decision of the Director on bids shall be the final 
action of the Department, subject only to reconsideration by the 
Secretary, pursuant to a written request in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. The delegation of review authority to the Office 
of Hearings and Appeals shall not be applicable to decisions on high 
bids for leases in the OCS.
    (2) Any bidder whose bid is rejected by the Director may file a 
written request for reconsideration with the Secretary within 15 days of 
notice of rejection, accompanied by a statement of reasons with a copy 
to the Director. The Secretary shall respond in writing either affirming 
or reversing the decision.
    (b) Written notice of the Director's action in accepting or 
rejecting bids shall be transmitted promptly to those bidders whose 
deposits have been held. If a bid is accepted, such notice shall 
transmit three copies of the lease form to the successful bidder. As 
provided in Sec. 281.26 of this part, the bidder shall, not later than 
the 10th business day after receipt of the lease, execute the lease, pay 
the first year's rental, and unless payment of a portion of the bid is 
deferred, pay the balance of the bonus bid. When payment of a portion of 
the bid is deferred, the successful bidder shall also file a bond to 
guarantee payment of the deferred portion as required in Sec. 281.33. 
Deposits shall be refunded on high bids subsequently rejected. When 
three copies of the lease have been executed by the successful bidder 
and returned to the Director, the lease shall be executed on behalf of 
the United States; and one fully executed copy shall be transmitted to 
the successful bidder.
    (c) If the successful bidder fails to execute the lease within the 
prescribed time or to otherwise comply with the applicable regulations, 
the successful bidder's deposit shall be forfeited and disposed of in 
the same manner as other receipts under the Act.
    (d) If, before the lease is executed on behalf of the United States, 
the land which would be subject to the lease is withdrawn or restricted 
from leasing, the deposit shall be refunded.
    (e) If the awarded lease is executed by an agent acting on behalf of 
the bidder, the bidder shall submit with the executed lease, evidence 
that the agent is authorized to act on behalf of the bidder.

become effective as of the first day of the month following the date 
leases are signed on behalf of the lessor except that, upon written 
request, a lease may be dated and become effective as of the first day 
of the month within which it is signed on behalf of the lessor.


<R04>
                   Subpart C_Financial Considerations


<R05>
Sec. 281.26  Payments.

    (a) For sealed bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage 
of the total amount bid is required to be submitted with the bid. The 
percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in 
the leasing notice. The remittance may be made in cash or by Federal 
Reserve check, commerical check, bank draft, money order, certified 
check, or cashier's check made payable to ``Department of the Interior--
MMS.'' Payment of this portion of the bonus bid may not be made by 
Electronic Funds Transfer.
    (b) For oral bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage of 
the total amount bid must be submitted to the official designated in the 
leasing notice following the completion of the oral bidding. The 
percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in 
the leasing notice. Payment of this portion of the bonus bid shall be 
made by Electronic Fund Transfer within the timeframe specified in the 
leasing notice.
    (c) The deposit received from high bidders will be placed in a 
Treasury account pending acceptance or rejection of the bid. Other bids 
submitted under

[[Page 385]]

paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the bidders. If the 
high bid is subsequently rejected, an amount equal to that deposited 
with the high bid will be returned according to applicable regulations.
    (d) The balance of the winning bonus bid and all rentals and 
royalties must be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
this part, the Leasing Notice, and Subchapter A of this chapter.
    (e) For each lease issued pursuant to this subpart, there shall be 
one person identified who shall be solely responsible for all payments 
due and payable under the provisions of the lease. The single 
responsible person shall be designated as the payor for the lease and 
shall be so identified on the Solid Minerals Production and Royalty 
Report (P & R) (MMS-4430) in accordance with Sec. 210.201 of this 
title. The designated person shall be responsible for all bonus, rental, 
and royalty payments.
    (f) Royalty shall be computed at the rate specified in the leasing 
notice, and paid in value unless the Secretary elects to have the 
royalty delivered in kind.
    (g) For leases which provide for minimum royalty payments, each 
lessee shall pay the minimum royalty specified in the lease at the end 
of each lease year beginning with the lease year in which production 
royalty is paid (whether the full amount specified in the lease or \1/2\ 
the amount specified in the lease pursuant to Sec. 281.28(b) on this 
part) of OCS minerals produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise 
disposed of) from the leasehold.
    (h) Unless stated otherwise in the lease, product valuation will be 
in accordance with the regulations of this chapter. The value used in 
the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director. The 
value, for royalty purposes, shall be the gross proceeds received by the 
lessee for produced substances at the point the product is produced and 
placed in its first marketable condition, consistent with prevailing 
practices in the industry. In establishing the value, the Director shall 
consider, in this order: (1) The price received by the lessee; (2) 
commodity and spot market transactions; (3) any other valuation method 
proposed by the lessee and approved by the Director; and (4) value or 
cost netback. For non-arm's length transactions, the first benchmark 
will only be accepted if it is not less than the second benchmark.
    (i) All payors must submit payments and payment forms and maintain 
auditable records in accordance with 30 CFR Chapter II, Subchapter A--
Minerals Revenue Management.

Sec. 281.27  Annual rental.

    (a) The annual lease rental shall be due and payable in accordance 
with the provisions of this section. No rental shall be due or payable 
under a lease commencing with the first lease anniversary date following 
the commencement of royalty payments on leasehold production computed on 
the basis of the royalty rate specified in the lease except that annual 
rental shall be due for any year in which production from the leasehold 
is not subject to royalty pursuant to Sec. 281.28.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice and 
subsequently issued lease, no annual rental payment shall be due during 
the first 5 years in the life of a lease.
    (c) The leasee shall pay an annual rental in the amount specified in 
the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease not later than the last 
day prior to the commencement of the rental year.
    (d) A rental adjustment schedule and amount may be specified in a 
leasing notice and subsequently issued lease when a variance is 
warranted by geologic, geographic, technical, or economic conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 281.28  Royalty.

    (a) The royalty due the lessor on OCS minerals produced (i.e., sold, 
transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from a lease shall be set 
out in a separate schedule attached to and made a part of each lease and 
shall be as specified in the leasing notice. The royalty due on 
production shall be based on a percentage of the value or amount of the 
OCS mineral(s) produced, a sum assessed per unit of product, or other 
such method as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice. When 
the

[[Page 386]]

royalty specified is a sum assessed per unit of product, the amount of 
the royalty shall be subject to an annual adjustment based on changes in 
the appropriate price index, when specified in the leasing notice. When 
the royalty is specified as a percentage of the value or amount of the 
OCS minerals produced, the Secretary will notify the lessee when and 
where royalty is to be delivered in kind.
    (b) When prescribed in the leasing notice and subsequently issued 
lease, royalty due on OCS minerals produced from a leasehold will be 
reduced for up to any 5 consecutive years, as specified by the lessee 
prior to the commencement of production, during the 1st through 15th 
year in the life of the lease. No royalty shall be due in any year of 
the specified 5-year period that occurs during the 1st through 10th 
years in the life of the lease, and a royalty of one-half the amount 
specified in the lease shall be due in any year of the specified 5-year 
period that occurs in the 11th through 15th year in the life of the 
lease. The lessee shall pay the amount specified in the lease rental for 
any royalty free year. The minimum royalty specified in the lease shall 
apply during any year of reduced royalty.


<R05>
Sec. 281.29  Royalty valuation.

    The method of valuing the product from a leasehold shall be in 
accordance with regulations of this chapter and procedures prescribed in 
the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease.


<R05>
Sec. 281.30  Minimum royalty.

    Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice, each lease issued 
pursuant to the regulations in this part shall require the payment of a 
specified minimum annual royalty beginning with the year in which OCS 
minerals are produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed 
of) from the leasehold except that the annual rentals shall apply during 
any year that royalty free production is in effect pursuant to Sec. 
281.28(b). Minimum royalty payments shall be offset by royalty paid on 
production during the lease year. Minimum royalty payments are due at 
the beginning of the lease year and payable by the end of the month 
following the end of the lease year for which they are due.


<R05>
Sec. 281.31  Overriding royalties.

    (a) Subject to the approval of the Secretary, an overriding royalty 
interest may be created by an assignment pursuant to section 8(e) of the 
Act. The Secretary may deny approval of an assignment which creates an 
overriding royalty on a lease whenever that denial is determined to be 
in the interest of conservation, necessary to prevent premature 
abandonment of a producing mine, or to make possible the mining of 
economically marginal or low-grade ore deposits. In any case, the total 
of applicable overriding royalties may not exceed 2.5 percent or one-
half the base royalty due the Federal Government, whichever is less.
    (b) No transfer or agreement may be made which creates an overriding 
royalty interest unless the owner of that interest files an agreement in 
writing that such interest is subject to the limitations provided in 
Sec. 281.30 of this part, paragraph (a) of this section, and Sec. 
281.32 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 281.32  Waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, minimum royalty or production royalty.

    (a) The Secretary may waive, suspend, or reduce the rental, minimum 
royalty, and/or production royalty prescribed in a lease for a specified 
time period when the Secretary determines that it is in the national 
interest, it will result in the conservation of natural resources of the 
OCS, it will promote development, or the mine cannot be successfully 
operated under existing conditions.
    (b) An application for waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, 
minimum royalty, or production royalty under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be filed in duplicate with the Director. The application 
shall contain the serial number(s) of the lease(s), the name of the 
lessee(s) of record, and the operator(s) if applicable. The application 
shall either:
    (1)(i) Show the location and extent of all mining operations and a 
tabulated statement of the minerals mined and subject to royalty for 
each of the last

[[Page 387]]

12 months immediately prior to filing the application:
    (ii) Contain a detailed statement of expenses and costs of operating 
the lease, the income from the sale of any lease products, and the 
amount of all overriding royalties and payments out of production paid 
to others than the United States; and
    (iii) All facts showing whether or not the mine(s) can be 
successfully operated under the royalty fixed in the lease; or
    (2) If no production has occurred from the lease, show that the 
lease cannot be successfully operated under the rental, royalty, and 
other conditions specified in the lease.
    (c) The applicant for a waiver, suspension, or reduction under this 
section shall file documentation that the lessee and the royalty holders 
agree to a reduction of all other royalties from the lease so that the 
aggregate of all other royalties does not exceed one-half the amount of 
the reduced royalties that would be paid to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 281.33  Bonds and bonding requirements.

    (a) When the leasing notice specifies that payment of a portion of 
the bonus bid can be deferred, the lessee shall be required to submit a 
surety or personal bond to guarantee payment of a deferred portion of 
the bid. Upon the payment of the full amount of the cash bonus bid, the 
lessee's bond will be released.
    (b) All bonds to guarantee payment of the deferred portion of the 
high cash bonus bid furnished by the lessee must be in a form or on a 
form approved by the Associate Director for Offshore Minerals 
Management. A single copy of the required form is to be executed by the 
principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an 
acceptable surety.
    (1) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies 
approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted. (See 
Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or 
replacement circulars.)
    (2) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to 
the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be 
accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to 
sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms 
and conditions of the lease.
    (c) Prior to the commencement of any activity on a lease(s), the 
lessee shall submit a surety or personal bond as described in Sec. 
282.40 of this title. Prior to the approval of a Delineation, Testing, 
or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to 
cover the operations and activities described in the proposed plan.

Sec. 281.42  Effect of assignment on particular lease.

    (a) When an assignment is made of all the record title to a portion 
of the acreage in a lease, the assigned and retained portions of the 
lease area become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such 
a case, the assignee becomes a lessee of the Government as to the 
segregated tract that is the subject of the assignment and is bound by 
the terms of the lease as though the lease had been obtained from the 
United States in the assignee's own name, and the assignment, after its 
approval, shall be the basis of a new record. Royalty, minimum royalty, 
and annual rental provisions of the lease shall apply separately to each 
segregated portion.
    (b) Each lease of an OCS mineral created by the segregation of a 
lease under paragraph (a) of this section shall continue in full force 
and effect for the remainder of the primary term of the original lease 
and so long thereafter as minerals are produced from the portion of the 
lease created by segregation in accordance with operations approved by 
the Director or the lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of 
the lease or regulations for earning the continuation of the lease in 
effect.


<R05>
Sec. 281.43  Effect of suspensions on lease term.

    (a) If the Director orders the suspension of either operations or 
production, or both, with respect to any lease in its primary term, the 
primary term of the lease shall be extended by a period of time 
equivalent to the period of the directed suspension.
    (b) If the Director orders or approves the suspension of either 
operations or

[[Page 389]]

production, or both, with respect to any lease that is in force beyond 
its primary term, the term of the lease shall not be deemed to expire so 
long as the suspension remains in effect.

any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued 
under the Act, the Secretary may cancel the lease only after judicial 
proceedings pursuant to section 5(d) of the Act, and the lessee shall 
not be entitled to compensation.
    (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, may be 
canceled by the Secretary upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or 
misrepresentation and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been 
afforded to the lessee.
    (d) The Secretary may cancel a lease in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Cancellation may occur at any time if the Secretary determines 
after a hearing that:
    (i) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause 
serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), 
to property, to any mineral (in areas leased or not leased), to the 
national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human 
environment;
    (ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
    (iii) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of 
continuing such lease in force;

such lease shall have been under suspension or temporary prohibition by 
the Secretary, with due extension of any lease term continuously for a 
period of 5 years, or for a lesser period upon request of the lessee; 
and
    (3) Cancellation shall entitle the lessee to receive such 
compensation as is shown to the Secretary as being equal to the lesser 
of:
    (i) The fair value of the canceled rights as of the date of 
cancellation, taking into account both anticipated revenues from the 
lease and anticipated costs, including costs of compliance with all 
applicable regulations and operating orders, liability for cleanup costs 
or damages, or both, and all other costs reasonably anticipated on the 
lease, or
    (ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenues from the lease 
(plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of 
reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct 
expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease 
and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to 
the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures 
from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case 
of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more 
partners to exercise due

[[Page 390]]

diligence, the innocent parties shall have the right to seek damages for 
such loss from the responsible party or parties and the right to acquire 
the interests of the negligent party or parties and be issued the lease 
in question.
    (iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of 
the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:
    (A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to 
section (5)(d) of the Act;
    (B) A Testing Plan or Mining Plan is disapproved because of the 
lessee's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 
applicable Federal Law; or
    (C) The lessee(s) of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with a 
provision of the Act, the lease, or regulations issued under the Act, 
and the noncompliance continues for a period of 30 days or more after 
the mailing of a notice of noncompliance by registered or certified 
letter to the lessee(s).

natural resources of the OCS or the prevention of waste. A mining unit 
may also include all or portions of one or more OCS mineral leases with 
all or portions of one or more adjacent State leases for minerals in a 
common orebody. A single unit operator shall be responsible for 
submission of required Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans covering 
OCS mineral operations for an approved mining unit.
    (2) Operations such as exploration, testing, and mining activities 
conducted in accordance with an approved plan on any lease or portion of 
a lease which is subject to an approved mining unit shall be considered 
operations on each of the leases that is made subject to the approved 
mining unit.
    (3) Minimum royalty paid pursuant to a Federal lease, which is 
subject to an approved mining unit, is creditable against the production 
royalties allocated to that Federal lease during the lease year for 
which the minimum royalty is paid.
    (4) Any OCS minerals produced from State and Federal leases which 
are subject to an approved mining unit shall be accounted for separately 
unless a method of allocating production between State and Federal

consider whether the plan is consistent with:
    (i) The provisions of the lease;
    (ii) The provisions of the Act;
    (iii) The provisions of the regulations prescribed under the Act;
    (iv) Other applicable Federal law; and
    (v) Requirements for the protection of the environment, health, and 
safety.
    (2) Within 30 days following the completion of an environmental 
assessment or other NEPA document prepared pursuant to the regulations 
implementing NEPA or within 30 days following the comment period 
provided in Sec. 282.4(b) of this part, the Director shall:
    (i) Approve any Delineation Plan which is consistent with the 
criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Require the lessee to modify any Delineation Plan that is 
inconsistent with the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or
    (iii) Disapprove a Delineation Plan when it is determined that an 
activity proposed in the plan would probably cause serious harm or 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life);

[[Page 396]]

to property; to natural resources of the OCS including mineral deposits 
(in areas leased or not leased); or to the marine, coastal, or human 
environment, and the proposed activity cannot be modified to avoid the 
conditions.
    (3) The Director shall notify the lessee in writing of the reasons 
for disapproving a Delineation Plan or for requiring modification of a 
plan and the conditions that must be met for plan approval.
    (c)(1) In the evaluation of a Testing Plan, the Director shall 
consider whether the plan is consistent with:
    (i) The provisions of the lease;
    (ii) The provisions of the Act;

probably cause serious harm and damage to life (including fish and other 
aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposit (in areas leased or 
not leased), to the national security or defense, or to the marine, 
coastal, or human environments;
    (B) That the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease 
to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and

[[Page 397]]

    (C) The advantages of disapproving the Mining Plan outweigh the

<R05>
Sec. 282.13  Suspension of production or other operations.

    (a) The Director may direct the suspension or temporary prohibition 
of production or any other operation or activity on all or any part of a 
lease when it has been determined that such suspension or temporary 
prohibition is in the national interest to:
    (1) Facilitate proper development of a lease including a reasonable 
time to develop a mine and construct necessary support facilities, or
    (2) Allow for the construction or negotiation for use of 
transportation facilities.
    (b) The Director may also direct or, at the request of the lessee, 
approve a suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other 
operation or activity, if:
    (1) The lessee failed to comply with a provision of applicable law, 
regulation, order, or the lease;
    (2) There is a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any 
mineral deposit, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
    (3) The suspension or temporary prohibition is in the interest of 
national security or defense;
    (4) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary for the 
initiation

[[Page 398]]

and conduct of an environmental evaluation to define mitigation measures 
to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.
    (5) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to 
facilitate the installation of equipment necessary for safety of 
operations and protection of the environment;
    (6) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to allow 
for undue delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits 
or consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or appeals;
    (7) The Director determines that continued operations would result 
in premature abandonment of a producing mine, resulting in the loss of 
otherwise recoverable OCS minerals;
    (8) The Director determines that the lessee cannot successfully 
operate a producing mine due to market conditions that are either 
temporary in nature or require temporary shutdown and reinvestment in 
order for the lessee to adapt to the conditions; or
    (9) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to comply 
with judicial decrees prohibiting production or any other operation or 
activity, or the permitting of those activities, effective the date set 
by the court for that prohibition.
    (c) When the Director orders or approves a suspension or a temporary 
prohibition of operation or activity including production on all of a 
lease pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the term of the 
lease shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time 
that the suspension or temporary prohibition is in effect, except that 
no lease shall be so extended when the suspension or temporary 
prohibition is the result of the lessee's gross negligence or willful 
violation of a provision of the lease or governing regulations.
    (d) The Director may, at any time within the period prescribed for a 
suspension or temporary prohibition issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, require the lessee to submit a Delineation, Testing, or 
Mining Plan for approval in accordance with the requirements for the 
approval of such plans in this part.
    (e)(1) When the Director orders or issues a suspension or a 
temporary prohibition pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
Director may require the lessee to conduct site-specific studies to 
identify and evaluate the cause(s) of the hazard(s) generating the 
suspension or temporary prohibition, the potential for damage from the 
hazard(s), and the measures available for mitigating the hazard(s). The 
nature, scope, and content of any study shall be subject to approval by 
the Director. The lessee shall furnish copies and all results of any 
such study to the Director. The cost of the study shall be borne by the 
lessee unless the Director arranges for the cost of the study to be 
borne by a party other than the lessee. The Director shall make results 
of any such study available to interested parties and to the public as 
soon as practicable after the completion of the study and submission of 
the results thereof.
    (2) When the Director determines that measures are necessary, on the 
basis of the results of the studies conducted in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and other information available to and 
identified by the Director, the lessee shall be required to take 
appropriate measures to mitigate, avoid, or minimize the damage or 
potential damage on which the suspension or temporary prohibition is 
based. When deemed appropriate by the Director, the lessee shall submit 
a revised Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan to incorporate the 
mitigation measures required by the Director. In choosing between 
alternative mitigation measures, the Director shall balance the cost of 
the required measures against the reduction or potential reduction in 
damage or threat of damage or harm to life (including fish and other 
aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or 
not leased), to the national security or defense, or to the marine, 
coastal, or human environment.
    (f)(1) If under the provisions of paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) 
of this section, the Director, with respect to any lease, directs the 
suspension of production or other operations on the entire

[[Page 399]]

leasehold, no payment of rental or minimum royalty shall be due for or 
during the period of the directed suspension and the time for the lessee 
specify royalty free period of a period of reduced royalty pursuant to 
Sec. 281.28(b) of this subchapter will be extended for the period of 
directed suspension. If under the provisions of paragraphs (b) (2), (3), 
and (4) of this section the Director, with respect to a lease on which 
there has been no production, directs the suspension of operations on 
the entire leasehold, no payment of rental shall be due during the 
period of the directed suspension.
    (2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director grants the 
request of a lessee for a suspension of production or other operations, 
the lessee's obligations to pay rental, minimum royalty, or royalty 
shall continue to apply during the period of the approved suspension, 
unless the Director's approval of the lessee's request for suspension 
authorizes the payment of a lesser amount during the period of approved 
suspension. If under the provision of this section, the Director grants 
a lessee's request for a suspension of production or other operations 
for a lease which includes provisions for a time period which the lessee 
may specify during which production from the leasehold would be royalty 
free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation pursuant to Sec. 
281.28(b) of this subchapter, the time during which production from a 
leasehold may be royalty free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation 
shall not be extended unless the Director's approval of the suspension 
specifies otherwise.
    (3) If the lease anniversary date falls within a period of 
suspension for which no rental or minimum royalty payments are required 
under paragraph (a) of this section, the prorated rentals or minimum 
royalties are due and payable as of the date the suspension period 
terminates. These amounts shall be computed and notice thereof given the 
lessee. The lessee shall pay the amount due within 30 days after receipt 
of such notice. The anniversary date of a lease shall not change by 
reason of any period of lease suspension or rental or royalty relief 
resulting therefrom.


<R05>
Sec. 282.14  Noncompliance, remedies, and penalties.

    (a)(1) If the Director determines that a lessee has failed to comply 
with applicable provisions of law; the regulations in this part; other 
applicable regulations; the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or 
Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and the Director 
determines that such noncompliance poses a threat of immediate, serious, 
or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine or the deposit being 
mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other resources, the 
Director shall order the lessee to take immediate and appropriate 
remedial action to alleviate the threat. Any oral orders shall be 
followed up by service of a notice of noncompliance upon the lessee by 
delivery in person to the lessee or agent, or by certified or registered 
mail addressed to the lessee at the last known address.
    (2) If the Director determines that the lessee has failed to comply 
with applicable provisions of law; the regulations in this part; other 
applicable regulations; the lease; the requirements of an approved 
Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or 
instructions, and such noncompliance does not pose a threat of 
immediate, serious, or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine 
or the deposit being mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other 
resources, the Director shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the 
lessee by delivery in person to the lessee or agent or by certified or 
registered mail addressed to the lessee at the last known address.
    (b) A notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect(s) the 
lessee has failed to comply with the provisions of applicable law; 
regulations; the lease; the requirements of an approved Delineation, 
Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and 
shall specify the action(s) which must be taken to correct the 
noncompliance and the time limits within which such action must be 
taken.
    (c) Failure of a lessee to take the actions specified in the notice 
of noncompliance within the time limit specified shall be grounds for a 
suspension

[[Page 400]]

of operations and other appropriate actions, including but not limited 
to the assessment of a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day for each 
violation that is not corrected within the time period specified (43 
U.S.C. 1350(b)).
    (d) Whenever the Director determines that a violation of or failure 
to comply with any provision of the Act; or any provision of a lease, 
license, or permit issued pursuant to the Act; or any provision of any 
regulation promulgated under the Act probably occurred and that such 
apparent violation continued beyond notice of the violation and the 
expiration of the reasonable time period allowed for corrective action, 
the Director shall follow the procedures concerning remedies and 
penalties in subpart N, Remedies and Penalties, of part 250 of this 
title to determine and assess an appropriate penalty.
    (e) The remedies and penalties prescribed in this section shall be 
concurrent and cumulative, and the exercise of one shall not preclude 
the exercise of the other. Further, the remedies and penalties 
prescribed in this section shall be in addition to any other remedies 
and penalties afforded by any other law or regulation (43 U.S.C. 
1350(e)).


<R05>
Sec. 282.15  Cancellation of leases.

    (a) Whenever the owner of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with 
any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued 
under the Act, and the default continues for a period of 30 days after 
mailing of notice by registered or certified letter to the lease owner 
at the owner's record post office address, the Secretary may cancel the 
lease pursuant to section 5(c) of the Act, and the lessee shall not be 
entitled to compensation. Any such cancellation is subject to judicial 
review as provided by section 23(b) of the Act.
    (b) Whenever the owner of any producing lease fails to comply with 
any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued 
under the Act, the Secretary may cancel the lease only after judicial 
proceedings pursuant to section 5(d) of the Act, and the lessee shall 
not be entitled to compensation.
    (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, may be 
canceled by the Secretary upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or 
misrepresentation and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been 
afforded to the lessee.
    (d) The Secretary may cancel a lease in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Cancellation may occur at any time if the Secretary determines 
after a hearing that--
    (i) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause 
serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), 
to property, to any mineral (in areas leased or not leased), to the 
national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human 
environment;
    (ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to

    (b) In all cases where there is more than one lease owner of record, 
one person shall be designated payor for the lease. The payor shall be 
responsible for making all rental, minimum royalty, and royalty 
payments.
    (c) In all cases where lease operations are not conducted by the 
sole lessee, a ``designation of operator'' shall be submitted to and 
accepted by the Director prior to the commencement of leasehold 
operations. This designation when accepted will be recognized as 
authority for the designee to act on behalf of the lessees and to 
fulfill the lessees' obligations under the Act, the lease, and the 
regulations of this part. All changes of address and any termination of 
a designation of operator shall be reported immediately, in writing, to 
the Director. In the case of a termination of a designation of operator 
or in the event of a controversy between the lessee and the designated 
operator, both the lessee and the designated operator will be 
responsible for the protection of the interests of the lessor.
    (d) When required by the Director or at the option of the lessee, 
the lessee shall submit to the Director the designation of a local 
representative empowered to receive notices, provide access to OCS 
mineral and environmental data and information, and comply with orders 
issued pursuant to the regulations of this part. If there is a change in 
the designated representative, the Director shall be notified 
immediately.
    (e) Before beginning operations, the lessee shall inform the 
Director in writing of any designation of a local representative under 
paragraph (d) of this section and the address of the mine office 
responsible for the exploration, testing, development, or production 
activities; the lessee's temporary and permanent addresses; or the name 
and address of the designated operator who will be responsible for the 
operations, and who will act as the local representative of the lessee. 
The

[[Page 402]]

Director shall also be informed of each change thereafter in the address 
of the mine office or in the name or address of the local 
representative.
    (f) The holder of a right of use and easement shall exercise its

regulations of this part.
    (g) A lessee shall submit reports and maintain records in accordance 
with Sec. 282.29 of this part.
    (h) When an oral approval is given by MMS in response to an oral 
request under these regulations, the oral request shall be confirmed in 
writing by the lessee or holder of a right of use and easement within 72 
hours.
    (i) The lessee is responsible for obtaining all permits and 
approvals from MMS or other Agencies needed to carry out exploration, 
testing, development, and production activities under a lease issued 
under part 281 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 282.21  Plans, general.

    (a) No exploration, testing, development, or production activities, 
except preliminary activities, shall be commenced or conducted on any 
lease except in accordance with a plan submitted by the lessee and 
approved by the Director. Plans will not be approved before completion 
of comprehensive technical and environmental evaluations to assure that 
the activities described will be carried out in a safe and 
environmentally responsible manner. Prior to the approval of a plan, the 
Director will assure that the lessee is prepared to take adequate 
measures to prevent waste; conserve natural resources of the OCS; and 
protect the environment, human life, and correlative rights. The lessee 
shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that the lease is 
in good standing, the lessee is authorized and capable of conducting the 
activities described in the plan, and that an acceptable bond has been 
provided.
    (b) Plans shall be submitted to the Director for approval. The 
lessee shall submit the number of copies prescribed by the Director. 
Such plans shall describe in detail the activities that are to be 
conducted and shall demonstrate that the proposed exploration, testing, 
development, and production activities will be conducted in an 
operationally safe and environmentally responsible manner that is 
consistent with the provisions of the lease, applicable laws, and 
regulations. The Governor of an affected State and other Federal 
Agencies shall be provided an opportunity to review and provide comments 
on proposed Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans and any proposal for 
a significant modification to an approved plan. Following review, 
including the technical and environmental evaluations, the Director 
shall either approve, disapprove, or require the lessee to modify its 
proposed plan.
    (c) Lessees are not required to submit a Delineation or Testing Plan 
prior to submittal of a proposed Testing or Mining Plan if the lessee 
has sufficient data and information on which to base a Testing or Mining 
Plan without carrying out postlease exploration and/or testing 
activities. A Mining Plan may include proposed exploration or testing 
activities where those activities are needed to obtain additional data 
and information on which to base plans for future mining activities. A 
Testing Plan may include exploration activities when those activities 
are needed to obtain additional data or information on which to base 
plans for future testing or mining activities.
    (d) Preliminary activities are bathymetric, geological, geophysical, 
mapping, and other surveys necessary to develop a comprehensive 
Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan. Such activities are those which 
have no significant adverse impact on the natural resources of the OCS. 
The lessee shall give notice to the Director at least 30 days prior to 
initiating the proposed preliminary activities on the lease. The notice 
shall describe in detail those activities that are to be conducted and 
the time schedule for conducting those activities.
    (e) Leasehold activities shall be carried out with due regard to 
conservation of resources, paying particular attention to the wise 
management of OCS mineral resources, minimizing waste of the leased 
resource(s) in mining and processing, and preventing damage to unmined 
parts of the mineral deposit and other resources of the OCS.

<R05>
Sec. 282.22  Delineation Plan.

    All exploration activities shall be conducted in accordance with a 
Delineation Plan submitted by the lessee and approved by the Director. 
The Delineation Plan shall describe the proposed activities necessary to 
locate leased OCS minerals, characterize the quantity and quality of the 
minerals, and generate other information needed for the development of a 
comprehensive Testing or Mining Plan. A Delineation Plan at a minimum 
shall include the following:
    (a) The OCS mineral(s) or primary interest.
    (b) A brief narrative description of the activities to be conducted 
and how the activities will lead to the discovery and evaluation of a 
commercially minable deposit on the lease.
    (c) The name, registration, and type of equipment to be used, 
including vessel types as well as their navigation and mobile 
communication systems, and transportation corridors to be used between 
the lease and shore.
    (d) Information showing that the equipment to be used (including the

the regulations in this part may be necessary, instructions for the 
filing of such forms or reports will be given by the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 282.30  Right of use and easement.

    (a) A right of use and easement that includes any area subject to a 
lease issued or maintained under the Act shall be granted only after the 
lessee has been notified by the requestor and afforded the opportunity 
to comment on the request. A holder of a right under a right of use and 
easement shall exercise that right in accordance with the requirements 
of the regulations in this part. A right of use and easement shall be 
exercised only in a manner which does not interfere unreasonably with 
operations of any lessee on its lease.
    (b) Once a right of use and easement has been exercised, the right 
shall continue, beyond the termination of any lease on which it may be 
situated, as long as it is demonstrated to the Director that the right 
of use and easement is being exercised by the holder of the right and 
that the right of use and easement continues to serve the purpose 
specified in the grant. If the right of use and easement extends beyond 
the termination of any lease on which the right may be situated or if it 
is situated on an unleased portion of the OCS, the rights of all 
subsequent lessees shall be subject to such right. Upon termination of a 
right of use and easement, the holder of the right shall abandon the 
premises in the same manner that a lessee abandons activities on a lease 
to the satisfaction of the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 282.31  Suspension of production or other operations.

    A lessee may submit a request for a suspension of production or 
other operations. The request shall include justification for granting 
the requested suspension, a schedule of work leading to the initiation 
or restoration of production or other operations, and any other 
information the Director may require.


<R04>
                           Subpart D_Payments


<R05>
Sec. 282.40  Bonds.

    (a) Pursuant to the requirements for a bond in Sec. 281.33 of this 
title, prior to the commencement of any activity on a lease, the lessee 
shall submit a surety or personal bond to cover the lessee's royalty and 
other obligations under the lease as specified in this section.
    (b) All bonds furnished by a lessee or operator must be in a form 
approved by the Associate Director for Offshore Minerals Management. A 
single copy of the required form is to be executed by the principal or, 
in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable 
surety.
    (c) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies 
approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted. (See 
Department of Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or 
replacement circulars.)
    (d) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to 
the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be 
accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to 
sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms 
and conditions of the lease.
    (e) A bond in the minimum amount of $50,000 to cover the lessee's 
obligations under the lease shall be submitted prior to the commencement 
of any activity on a leasehold. A $50,000 bond shall not be required on 
a lease if the lessee already maintains or furnishes a $300,000 bond 
conditioned on compliance with the terms of leases for OCS minerals 
other than oil, gas, and sulphur held by the lessee on the OCS for the 
area in which the lease is located. A bond submitted pursuant to Sec. 
256.58(a) of this chapter may be amended to include the aforementioned 
condition for compliance. Prior to approval of a Delineation, Testing, 
or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be

[[Page 412]]

adjusted, if appropriate, to cover the operations and activities 
described in the proposed plan.
    (f) For the purposes of this section there are three areas:
    (1) The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Ocean;
    (2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, 
Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and
    (3) The area offshore the coast of Alaska.
    (g) A separate bond shall be required for each area. An operator's 
bond may be submitted for a specific lease(s) in the same amount as the 
lessee's bond(s) applicable to the lease(s) involved.
    (h) Where, upon a default, the surety makes a payment to the United 
States of an obligation incurred under a lease, the face amount of the 
surety bond and the surety's liability thereunder shall be reduced by 
the amount of such payment.
    (i) After default, the principal shall, within 6 months after notice 
or within such shorter period as may be fixed by the Director, either 
post a new bond or increase the existing bond to the amount previously 
held. In lieu thereof, the principal may, within that time, file 
separate or substitute bonds for each lease. Failure to meet these 
requirements may result in a suspension of operations including 
production on leases covered by such bonds.
    (j) The Director shall not consent to termination of the period of 
liability of any bond unless an acceptable alternative bond has been 
filed or until all the terms and conditions of the lease covered by the 
bond have been met.

<R05>
Sec. 282.41  Method of royalty calculation.

    In the event that the provisions of royalty management regulations 
do not apply to the specific commodities produced under regulations in 
this part, the lessee shall comply with procedures specified in the 
leasing notice.

<R05>
Sec. 285.111  When and how does MMS charge me processing fees on a case-by-case basis?

    (a) The MMS will charge a processing fee on a case-by-case basis 
under the procedures in this section with regard to any application or 
request under this part if we decide at any time that the preparation of 
a particular document or study is necessary for the application or 
request and it will have a unique processing cost, such as the 
preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact 
Statement (EIS).
    (1) Processing costs will include contract oversight and efforts to 
review and approve documents prepared by contractors, whether the 
contractor is paid directly by the applicant or through MMS.
    (2) We may apply a standard overhead rate to direct processing 
costs.

[[Page 423]]

    (b) We will assess the ongoing processing fee for each individual 
application or request according to the following procedures:
    (1) Before we process your application or request, we will give you 
a written estimate of the proposed fee based on reasonable processing 
costs.
    (2) You may comment on the proposed fee.
    (3) You may:
    (i) Ask for our approval to perform, or to directly pay a contractor 
to perform, all or part of any document, study, or other activity 
according to standards we specify, thereby reducing our costs for 
processing your application or request; or
    (ii) Ask to pay us to perform, or contract for, all or part of any 
document, study, or other activity.
    (4) We will then give you the final estimate of the processing fee 
amount with payment terms and instructions after considering your 
comments and any MMS-approved work you will do.
    (i) If we encounter higher or lower processing costs than 
anticipated, we will re-estimate our reasonable processing costs 
following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and 
(b)(4) of this section, but we will not stop ongoing processing unless 
you do not pay in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (ii) Once processing is complete, we will refund to you the amount 
of money that we did not spend on processing costs.
    (5)(i) Consistent with the payment and billing terms provided in the 
final estimate, we will periodically estimate what our reasonable 
processing costs will be for a specific period and will bill you for 
that period. Payment is due to us 30 days after you receive your bill. 
We will stop processing your document if you do not pay the bill by the 
date payment is due.
    (ii) If a periodic payment turns out to be more or less than our 
reasonable processing costs for the period, we will adjust the next 
billing accordingly or make a refund. Do not deduct any amount from a 
payment without our prior written approval.
    (6) You must pay the entire fee before we will issue the final 
document or take final action on your application or request.
    (7) You may appeal our estimated processing costs in accordance with 
the regulations in 43 CFR part 4. We will not process the document 
further until the appeal is resolved, unless you pay the fee under 
protest while the appeal is pending. If the appeal results in a decision 
changing the proposed fee, we will adjust the fee in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If we adjust the fee downward, we 
will not pay interest.


<R05>
Sec. 285.112  Definitions.

    Terms used in this part have the meanings as defined in this 
section:
    Affected local government means with respect to any activities 
proposed, conducted, or approved under this part, any locality--
    (1) That is, or is proposed to be, the site of gathering, 
transmitting, or distributing electricity or other energy product, or is 
otherwise receiving, processing, refining, or transshipping product, or 
services derived from activities approved under this part;
    (2) That is used, or is proposed to be used, as a support base for 
activities approved under this part; or
    (3) In which there is a reasonable probability of significant effect 
on land or water uses from activities approved under this part.
    Affected State means with respect to any activities proposed, 
conducted, or approved under this part, any coastal State--
    (1) That is, or is proposed to be, the site of gathering, 
transmitting, or distributing energy or is otherwise receiving, 
processing, refining, or transshipping products, or services derived 
from activities approved under this part;
    (2) That is used, or is scheduled to be used, as a support base for 
activities approved under this part; or
    (3) In which there is a reasonable probability of significant effect 
on land or water uses from activities approved under this part.
    Alternate Use refers to the energy- or marine-related use of an 
existing OCS facility for activities not otherwise authorized by this 
subchapter or other applicable law.

[[Page 424]]

    Alternate Use RUE means a right-of-use and easement issued for 
activities authorized under subpart J of this part.
    Archaeological resource means any material remains of human life or 
activities that are at least 50 years of age and that are of 
archaeological interest (i.e., which are capable of providing scientific 
or humanistic understanding of past human behavior, cultural adaptation, 
and related topics through the application of scientific or scholarly 
techniques, such as controlled observation, contextual measurement, 
controlled collection, analysis, interpretation, and explanation).
    Best available and safest technology means the best available and 
safest technologies that MMS determines to be economically feasible 
wherever failure of equipment would have a significant effect on safety, 
health, or the environment.
    Best management practices mean practices recognized within their 
respective industry, or by Government, as one of the best for achieving 
the desired output while reducing undesirable outcomes.
    Certified Verification Agent (CVA) means an individual or 
organization, experienced in the design, fabrication, and installation 
of offshore marine facilities or structures, who will conduct specified 
third-party reviews, inspections, and verifications in accordance with 
this part.
    Coastline means the same as the term ``coast line'' in section 2 of 
the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301(c)).
    Commercial activities mean, for renewable energy leases and grants, 
all activities associated with the generation, storage, or transmission 
of electricity or other energy product from a renewable energy project 
on the OCS, and for which such electricity or other energy product is 
intended for distribution, sale, or other commercial use, except for 
electricity or other energy product distributed or sold pursuant to 
technology-testing activities on a limited lease. This term also 
includes activities associated with all stages of development, including 
initial site characterization and assessment, facility construction, and 
project decommissioning.
    Commercial lease means a lease issued under this part that specifies 
the terms and conditions under which a person can conduct commercial 
activities.
    Commercial operations mean the generation of electricity or other 
energy product for commercial use, sale, or distribution on a commercial 
lease.
    Decommissioning means removing MMS-approved facilities and returning 
the site of the lease or grant to a condition that meets the 
requirements under subpart I of this part.
    Director means the Director of MMS of the U.S. Department of the 
Interior, or an official authorized to act on the Director's behalf.
    Distance means the minimum great circle distance.
    Eligible State means a coastal State having a coastline (measured 
from the nearest point) no more than 15 miles from the geographic center 
of a qualified project area.
    Facility means an installation that is permanently or temporarily 
attached to the seabed of the OCS. Facilities include any structures; 
devices; appurtenances; gathering, transmission, and distribution 
cables; pipelines; and permanently moored vessels. Any group of OCS 
installations interconnected with walkways, or any group of 
installations that includes a central or primary installation with one 
or more satellite or secondary installations, is a single facility. The 
MMS may decide that the complexity of the installations justifies their 
classification as separate facilities.
    Geographic center of a project means the centroid (geometric center 
point) of a qualified project area. The centroid represents the point 
that is the weighted average of coordinates of the same dimension within 
the mapping system, with the weights determined by the density function 
of the system. For example, in the case of a project area shaped as a 
rectangle or other parallelogram, the geographic center would be that 
point where lines between opposing corners intersect. The geographic

<R05>
Sec. 285.210  How does MMS initiate the competitive leasing process?

    The MMS may publish in the Federal Register a public notice of 
Request for Interest to assess interest in leasing all or part of the 
OCS for activities authorized in this part. The MMS will consider 
information received in response to a Request for Interest to determine 
whether there is competitive interest for scheduling sales and issuing 
leases. We may prepare and issue a national, regional, or more specific 
schedule of lease sales pertaining to one or more types of renewable 
energy.


<R05>
Sec. 285.211  What is the process for competitive issuance of leases?

auction in the Federal Register. For each lease

[[Page 432]]

sale, we will publish a Proposed Sale Notice and a Final Sale Notice. 
Individual lease sales will include steps such as:
    (a) Call for Information and Nominations (Call). The MMS will 
publish in the Federal Register Calls for Information and Nominations 
for leasing in specified areas. The comment period following issuance of 
a Call will be 45 days. In this document, we may:
    (1) Request comments on areas which should receive special 
consideration and analysis;
    (2) Request comments concerning geological conditions (including 
bottom hazards); archaeological sites on the seabed or nearshore; 
multiple uses of the proposed leasing area (including navigation, 
recreation, and fisheries); and other socioeconomic, biological, and 
environmental information; and
    (3) Suggest areas to be considered by the respondents for leasing.
    (b) Area Identification. The MMS will identify areas for 
environmental analysis and consideration for leasing. We will do this in 
consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, States, local 
governments, affected Indian tribes, and other interested parties.
    (1) We may consider for lease those areas nominated in response to 
the Call for Information and Nominations, together with other areas that 
MMS determines are appropriate for leasing.
    (2) We will evaluate the potential effect of leasing on the human, 
marine, and coastal environments, and develop measures to mitigate 
adverse impacts, including lease stipulations.
    (3) We will consult to develop measures, including lease 
stipulations and conditions, to mitigate adverse impacts on the 
environment; and
    (4) We may hold public hearings on the environmental analysis after 
appropriate notice.
    (c) Proposed Sale Notice. The MMS will publish the Proposed Sale 
Notice in the Federal Register and send it to the Governor of any 
affected State and the executive of any local government that might be 
affected. The comment period following issuance of a Proposed Sale 
Notice will be 60 days.
    (d) Final Sale Notice. The MMS will publish the Final Sale Notice in 
the Federal Register at least 30 days before the date of the sale.


<R05>
Sec. 285.212  What is the process MMS will follow if there is reason to 

believe that competitors have withdrawn before the Final Sale Notice is issued?

    The MMS may decide to end the competitive process before the Final 
Sale Notice if we have reason to believe that competitors have withdrawn 
and competition no longer exists. We will issue a second public notice 
of Request for Interest and consider comments received to confirm that 
there is no competitive interest.
    (a) If, after reviewing comments in response to the notice of 
Request for Interest, MMS determines that there is no competitive 
interest in the lease area, and one party wishes to acquire a lease, we 
will discontinue the competitive process and will proceed with the 
noncompetitive process set forth in Sec. 285.231(d) through (i). Under 
the noncompetitive process, the acquisition fee specified in Sec. 
285.502(a) must be submitted with the Site Assessment Plan (SAP) or GAP.
    (b) If, after reviewing comments in response to the notice of 
Request for Interest, MMS determines that competitive interest in the 
lease area continues to exist, we will continue with the competitive 
process set forth in Sec. 285.211 through 285.225.

resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, 
coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of 
historical or archaeological significance, MMS may include with its 
notice of noncompliance an order directing you to take immediate 
remedial action to alleviate threats and to abate the violation and, 
when appropriate, a cessation order.
    (f) The MMS may assess civil penalties, as authorized by section 24 
of the OCS Lands Act, if you fail to comply with any provision of this 
part or any term of a lease, grant, or order issued under the authority 
of this part, after notice of such failure and expiration of any 
reasonable period allowed for corrective action. Civil penalties will be 
determined and assessed in accordance with the procedures set forth in

lease or grant when you fail to comply with an applicable law; 
regulation; order; or provision of a lease, grant, plan, or other MMS

Sec. 285.405  How do I designate an operator?

    (a) If you intend to designate an operator who is not the lessee or

Sec. 285.610(a)(3)), COP (under Sec. 285.626(b)(2)), or GAP (under 
Sec. 285.645(b)(3)), as applicable. If no operator is designated in a 
SAP, COP, or GAP, MMS will deem the lessee or grant holder to be the 
operator.
    (b) An operator must be designated in any SAP, COP, or GAP if there 
is more than one lessee or grant holder for any individual lease or 
grant.
    (c) Once approved in your plan, the designated operator is 
authorized to act on your behalf and required to perform activities 
necessary to comply with the OCS Lands Act, the lease or grant, and the 
regulations in this part.
    (d) You, or your designated operator, must immediately provide MMS 
with a written notification of change of address of the lessee or 
operator.
    (e) If there is a change in the designated operator, you must 
provide written notice to MMS and identify the new designated operator 
within 72 hours on a form approved by MMS. The lessee(s) or grantee(s) 
is the operator and responsible for compliance until MMS approves 
designation of the new operator.
    (f) Designation of an operator under any lease or grant issued under 
this part does not relieve the lessee or grant holder of its obligations 
under this part or its lease or grant.
    (g) A designated operator performing activities on the lease must 
comply with all regulations governing those activities and may be held 
liable or penalized for any noncompliance during the time it was 
operator, notwithstanding its subsequent resignation.


<R05>
Sec. 285.406  Who is responsible for fulfilling lease and grant obligations?

    (a) When you are not the sole lessee or grantee, you and your co-
lessee(s) or co-grantee(s) are jointly and severally responsible for 
fulfilling your obligations under the lease or grant and the provisions 
of this part, unless otherwise provided in these regulations.
    (b) If your designated operator fails to fulfill any of your 
obligations under the lease or grant and this part, MMS may require you 
or any or all of your co-lessees or co-grantees to fulfill those 
obligations or other operational obligations under the OCS Lands Act, 
the lease, grant, or the regulations.
    (c) Whenever the regulations in this part require the lessee or 
grantee to conduct an activity in a prescribed manner, the lessee or 
grantee and operator (if one has been designated) are jointly and 
severally responsible for complying with the regulations.

in accordance with the regulations at Sec. 218.51 of this chapter.
    (d) The MMS will not charge an operating fee for the authorized sale 
of power from a limited lease.


<R05>
Sec. 285.506  What operating fees must I pay on a commercial lease?

    If you are generating electricity, you must pay operating fees on 
your commercial lease when you begin commercial generation, as described 
in Sec. 285.503.
    (a) The MMS will determine the annual operating fee for activities 
relating to the generation of electricity on your lease based on the 
following formula,


F = M * H * c * P * r, where:

    (1) F is the dollar amount of the annual operating fee;
    (2) M is the nameplate capacity expressed in megawatts;
    (3) H is the number of hours in a year, equal to 8,760, used to 
calculate an annual payment;
    (4) c is the ``capacity factor'' representing the anticipated 
efficiency of the facility's operation expressed as a decimal between 
zero and one;
    (5) P is a measure of the annual average wholesale electric power 
price expressed in dollars per megawatt hour, as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section; and
    (6) r is the operating fee rate expressed as a decimal between zero 
and one.
    (b) The annual operating fee formula relating to the value of annual 
electricity generation is restated as:

 
                                         M  (nameplate           H  (hours per           c  (capacity                                  r  (operating fee
    F  (annual operating fee)      =       capacity)       *         year)         *        factor)        *   P  (power price)    *         rate)
 
 
 

    (c) The MMS will specify operating fee parameters in the Final Sale 
Notice for commercial leases issued competitively and in the lease for 
those issued noncompetitively.
    (1) Unless MMS specifies otherwise, in the operating fee rate, (r) 
is 0.02 for each year the operating fee applies when you begin 
commercial generation of electricity. We may apply a different fee rate 
for new projects (i.e., a new generation based on new technology) after 
considering factors such as program objectives, state of the industry, 
project type, and project potential. Also, we may agree to reduce or 
waive the fee rate under Sec. 285.510.
    (2) The power price (P), for each year when the operating fee 
applies, will be determined annually. The process by which the power 
price will be determined will be specified in the Final Sale Notice and/
or in the lease. The MMS:
    (i) Will use the most recent annual average wholesale power price in 
the State in which a project's transmission cables make landfall, as 
published by the DOE, Energy Information Administration (EIA), or other 
publicly available wholesale power price indices; and
    (ii) May adjust the published average wholesale power price to 
reflect documented variations by State or within a region and recent 
market conditions.
    (3) The MMS will select the capacity factor (c) based upon 
applicable analogs drawn from present and future domestic and foreign 
projects that operate in comparable conditions and on comparable scales.

[[Page 452]]

    (i) Upon the completion of the first year of commercial operations 
on the lease, MMS may adjust the capacity factor as necessary (to 
accurately represent a comparison of actual production over a given

the most recent year that MMS adjusts the capacity factor.
    (iii) The process by which MMS will adjust the capacity factor, 
including any calculations (incorporating an average capacity factor 
reflecting actual operating experience), will be specified in the lease. 
The operator or lessee may request review and adjustment of the capacity 
factor under Sec. 285.510.
    (4) Ten days after the anniversary date of when you began to

         Financial Assurance Requirements for Commercial Leases


<R05>
Sec. 285.515  What financial assurance must I provide when I obtain my commercial lease?

    (a) Before MMS will issue your commercial lease or approve an 
assignment of an existing commercial lease, you (or, for an assignment, 
the proposed assignee) must guarantee compliance with all terms and 
conditions of the lease by providing either:
    (1) A $100,000 minimum, lease-specific bond; or
    (2) Another approved financial assurance instrument guaranteeing 
performance up to $100,000, as specified in Sec. Sec. 285.526 through 
285.529.
    (b) You meet the financial assurance requirements under this subpart 
if your designated lease operator provides a $100,000 minimum, lease-
specific bond or other approved financial assurance that guarantees 
compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease.
    (1) The dollar amount of the minimum, lease-specific financial 
assurance in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of this section will be adjusted 
to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers (CPI-
U) or a substantially equivalent index if the CPI-U is discontinued; and
    (2) The first CPI-U-based adjustment can be made no earlier than the 
5-year anniversary of the adoption of this rule. Subsequent CPI-U-based 
adjustments may be made every 5 years thereafter.

your commercial lease are as follows:

[[Page 454]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29AP09.111

with all terms and conditions of the lease. You may provide a new bond 
or increase the amount of your existing bond, to satisfy any additional 
financial assurance requirements.

assurance may be required in an amount determined by MMS before FERC 
issues a license.


<R05>
Sec. 285.517  How will MMS determine the amounts of the supplemental and

decommissioning financial assurance requirements associated with commercial leases?

    (a) The MMS will base the determination for the amounts of the SAP, 
COP, and decommissioning financial assurance requirements on estimates 
of the cost to meet all accrued lease obligations.
    (b) We determine the amount of the supplemental and decommissioning 
financial assurance requirements on a case-by-case basis. The amount of 
the financial assurance must be no less than the amount required to meet 
all lease obligations, including:
    (1) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the 
Government over the next 12 months;
    (2) Any past due rent and other payments;
    (3) Other monetary obligations; and

increase or decrease, we may adjust the amount of supplemental or the 
decommissioning financial assurance.
    (1) If we propose adjusting your financial assurance amount, we will 
notify you of the proposed adjustment and give you an opportunity to 
comment; and
    (2) We may approve a reduced financial assurance amount if you

greater than the sum of:
    (i) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the 
Government over the next 12 months;
    (ii) Any past due rent and other payments;
    (iii) Other monetary obligations; and
    (iv) The estimated cost of facility decommissioning.

progress on my limited lease or grant?

    (a) The MMS may require you to increase the level of your financial 
assurance as activities progress on your limited lease or grant. We will 
base the determination for the amount of financial assurance 
requirements on our estimate of the cost to meet all accrued lease or 
grant obligations, including:
    (1) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the 
Government over the next 12 months;
    (2) Any past due rent and other payments;
    (3) Other monetary obligations; and
    (4) The estimated cost of facility decommissioning.

            Requirements for Financial Assurance Instruments


<R05>
Sec. 285.525  What general requirements must a financial assurance instrument meet?

    (a) Any bond or other acceptable financial assurance instrument that 
you provide must:
    (1) Be payable to MMS upon demand; and
    (2) Guarantee compliance of all lessees, grant holders, operators, 
and payors with all terms and conditions of the lease or grant, any 
subsequent approvals and authorizations, and all applicable regulations.
    (b) All bonds and other forms of financial assurance must be on or 
in a form approved by MMS. You may submit this on an approved form that 
you have reproduced or generated by use of a computer. If the document 
you submit omits any terms and conditions that are included on the MMS-
approved form, your bond is deemed to contain the omitted terms and 
conditions.
    (c) Surety bonds must be issued by an approved surety listed in the 
current Treasury Circular 570, as required by 31 CFR 223.16. You may 
obtain a copy of

[[Page 456]]

Circular 570 from the Treasury Web site at http://www.fms.treas.gov/
c570/.
    (d) Your surety bond cannot exceed the underwriting limit listed in 
the current Treasury Circular 570, except as permitted therein.
    (e) You and a qualified surety must execute your bond. When the 
surety is a corporation, an authorized corporate officer must sign the 
bond and attest to it over the corporate seal.
    (f) You may not terminate the period of liability of your bond or 
cancel your bond, except as provided in this subpart. Bonds must 
continue in full force and effect even though an event has occurred that 
could diminish or terminate a surety's obligation under State law.
    (g) Your surety must notify you and MMS within 5 business days 
after:
    (1) It initiates any judicial or administrative proceeding alleging 
its insolvency or bankruptcy; or
    (2) The Treasury decertifies the surety.


<R05>
Sec. 285.526  What instruments other than a surety bond may I use to 

meet the financial assurance requirement?

    (a) You may use other types of security instruments, if MMS 
determines that such security protects MMS to the same extent as the 
surety bond. The MMS will consider pledges of the following:
    (1) U.S. Department of Treasury securities identified in 31 CFR part 
225;
    (2) Cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the 
financial assurance, to be deposited and maintained in a Federal 
depository account of the U.S. Treasury by MMS;
    (3) Certificates of deposit or savings accounts in a bank or 
financial institution organized or authorized to transact business in 
the United States with:
    (i) Minimum net assets of $500,000,000; and
    (ii) Minimum Bankrate.com Safe & Sound rating of 3 Stars, and 
Capitalization, Assets, Equity and Liquidity (CAEL) rating of 3 or less;
    (4) Negotiable U.S. Government, State, and municipal securities or 
bonds having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount 
of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors 
Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities 
brokerage firm for the benefit of the MMS;
    (5) Investment-grade rated securities having a Standard and Poor's 
rating of AAA or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized 
securities rating service having a market value of not less than the 
required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a 
Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a 
licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of MMS; and
    (6) Insurance, if its form and function is such that the funding or 
enforceable pledges of funding are used to guarantee performance of 
regulatory obligations in the event of default on such obligations by 
the lessee. Insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of ``superior'' or 
an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized insurance rating 
service.
    (b) If you use a Treasury security:
    (1) You must post 115 percent of your financial assurance amount;
    (2) You must monitor the collateral value of your security. If the 
collateral value of your security as determined in accordance with the 
31 CFR part 203 Collateral Margins Table (which can be found at http://
www.treasurydirect.gov) falls below the required level of coverage, you 
must pledge additional security to provide 115 percent of the required 
amount; and
    (3) You must include with your pledge authority for us to sell the 
security and use the proceeds if we determine that you have failed to 
comply with any of the terms and conditions of your lease or grant, any 
subsequent approval or authorization, or applicable regulations.
    (c) If you use the instruments described in paragraphs (a)(4) or 
(a)(5) of this section, you must provide MMS by the end of each calendar 
year a certified statement describing the nature and market value of the 
instruments maintained in that account, and including any current 
statements or reports furnished by the brokerage firm to the lessee 
concerning the asset value of the account.

[[Page 457]]


<R05>
Sec. 285.527  May I demonstrate financial strength and reliability to 

meet the financial assurance requirement for lease or grant activities?

    The MMS may allow you to use your financial strength and reliability 
to meet financial assurance requirements. We will make this 
determination based on audited financial statements, business stability, 
reliability, and compliance with regulations.
    (a) You must provide the following information if you want to 
demonstrate financial strength and reliability to meet your financial 
assurance requirements:
    (1) Audited financial statements (including auditor's certificate, 
balance sheet, and profit and loss sheet) that show you have financial 
capacity substantially in excess of existing and anticipated lease and 
other obligations;
    (2) Evidence that shows business stability based on 5 years of 
continuous operation and generation of renewable energy on the OCS or 
onshore;
    (3) Evidence that shows reliability in meeting obligations based on 
credit ratings or trade references, including names and addresses of 
other lessees, contractors, and suppliers with whom you have dealt; and
    (4) Evidence that shows a record of compliance with laws, 
regulations, and lease, ROW, or RUE terms.
    (b) If we approve your request to use your financial strength and 
reliability to meet your financial assurance requirements, you must 
submit annual updates to the information required by paragraph (a) of 
this section. You must submit this information no later than March 31 of 
each year.
    (c) If the annual updates to the information required by paragraph 
(a) of this section do not continue to demonstrate financial strength 
and reliability or MMS has reason to believe that you are unable to meet 
the financial assurance requirements of this section, after notice and 
opportunity for a hearing, MMS will terminate your ability to use 
financial strength and reliability for financial assurance and require 
you to provide another type of financial assurance. You must provide 
this new financial assurance instrument within 90 days after we 
terminate your use of financial strength and reliability.


<R05>
Sec. 285.528  May I use a third-party guaranty to meet the financial 

assurance requirement for lease or grant activities?

    (a) You may use a third-party guaranty if the guarantor meets the 
criteria prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and submits an 
agreement meeting the criteria prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section. The agreement must guarantee compliance with the obligations of 
all lessees and operators and grant holders.
    (b) The MMS will consider the following factors in deciding whether 
to accept an agreement:
    (1) The length of time that your guarantor has been in continuous 
operation as a business entity. You may exclude periods of interruption 
that are beyond the guarantor's control by demonstrating, to the 
satisfaction of the Director, that the interruptions do not affect the 
likelihood of your guarantor remaining in business during the SAP, COP, 
and decommissioning stages of activities covered by the indemnity 
agreement.
    (2) Financial information available in the public record or 
submitted by your guarantor in sufficient detail to show us that your 
guarantor meets the criterion stated in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section. Such detail includes:
    (i) The current rating for your guarantor's most recent bond 
issuance by a generally recognized bond rating service such as Moody's 
Investor Service or Standard and Poor's Corporation;
    (ii) Your guarantor's net worth, taking into account liabilities for 
compliance with all terms and conditions of your lease, regulations, and 
other guarantees;
    (iii) Your guarantor's ratio of current assets to current 
liabilities, taking into account liabilities for compliance with all 
terms and conditions of your lease, regulations, and other guarantees; 
and
    (iv) Your guarantor's unencumbered domestic fixed assets.
    (3) If the information in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not 
publicly available, your guarantor must submit the information in the 
following table,

[[Page 458]]

to be updated annually within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year (FY) 
or as otherwise prescribed.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29AP09.112

    (4) Your guarantor's total outstanding and proposed guarantees must 
not exceed 25 percent of its unencumbered domestic net worth.
    (c) Your guarantor must submit an agreement executed by the 
guarantor and all parties bound by the agreement. All parties are bound 
jointly and severally and must meet the qualifications set forth in 
Sec. 285.107.
    (1) When any party is a corporation, two corporate officers 
authorized to execute the guaranty agreement on behalf of the 
corporation must sign the agreement.
    (2) When any party is a partnership, joint venture, or syndicate, 
the guaranty agreement must bind each party who has a beneficial 
interest in your guarantor and provide that, upon MMS demand under your 
guaranty, each party is jointly and severally liable for compliance with 
all terms and conditions of your lease(s) or grant(s) covered by the 
agreement.
    (3) When forfeiture of the guaranty is called for, the agreement 
must provide that your guarantor will either bring your lease(s) or 
grant(s) into compliance or provide, within 7 days, sufficient funds to 
permit MMS to complete corrective action.
    (4) The guaranty agreement must contain a confession of judgment, 
providing that, if we determine that you are, or your operator or 
operating rights owner is, in default, the guarantor must not challenge 
the determination and must remedy the default.
    (5) If you fail, or your operator or operating rights owner fails, 
to comply with any law, term, or regulation, your guarantor must either 
take corrective action or provide, within 7 days or other agreed upon 
time period, sufficient funds for MMS to complete corrective action. 
Such compliance must not reduce your guarantor's liability.
    (6) If your guarantor wants to terminate the period of liability, 
your guarantor must notify you and us at least 90 days before the 
proposed termination date, obtain our approval for termination of all or 
a specified portion of the guarantee for liabilities arising after that 
date, and remain liable for all your work performed during the period 
the agreement is in effect.
    (7) Each guaranty submitted pursuant to this section is deemed to 
contain all the above terms, even if they are not actually in the 
agreement.
    (d) Before the termination of your guaranty, you must provide an 
acceptable replacement in the form of a bond or other security.


<R05>
Sec. 285.529  Can I use a lease- or grant-specific decommissioning account

to meet the financial assurance requirements related to decommissioning?

    (a) In lieu of a surety bond, MMS may authorize you to establish a 
lease-, ROW grant-, or RUE grant-specific decommissioning account in a 
federally-insured institution. The funds may not be withdrawn from the 
account without our written approval.
    (1) The funds must be payable to MMS and pledged to meet your lease 
or

[[Page 459]]

grant decommissioning and site clearance obligations; and
    (2) You must fully fund the account within the time MMS prescribes 
to cover all costs of decommissioning including site clearance. The MMS 
will estimate the cost of decommissioning, including site clearance.
    (b) Any interest paid on the account will be treated as account 
funds unless we authorize in writing that any interest be paid to the 
depositor.
    (c) We may allow you to pledge Treasury securities, payable to MMS 
on demand, to satisfy your obligation to make payments into the account. 
Acceptable Treasury securities and their collateral value are determined 
in accordance with 31 CFR part 203, Collateral Margins Table (which can 
be found at http://www.treasurydirect.gov).
    (d) We may require you to commit a specified stream of revenues as 
payment into the account so that the account will be fully funded, as 
prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The commitment may 
include revenue from other operations.

                     Changes in Financial Assurance


<R05>
Sec. 285.530  What must I do if my financial assurance lapses?

    (a) If your surety is decertified by the Treasury, becomes bankrupt 
or insolvent, or if your surety's charter or license is suspended or 
revoked, or if any other approved financial assurance expires for any 
reason, you must:
    (1) Inform MMS within 3 business days about the financial assurance 
lapse; and
    (2) Provide new financial assurance in the amount set by MMS, as 
provided in this subpart.
    (b) You must notify MMS within 3 business days after you learn of 
any action filed alleging that you, your surety, or third-party 
guarantor, is insolvent or bankrupt.


<R05>
Sec. 285.531  What happens if the value of my financial assurance is reduced?

    If the value of your financial assurance is reduced below the 
required financial assurance amount because of a default or any other 
reason, you must provide additional financial assurance sufficient to 
meet the requirements of this subpart within 45 days or within a 
different period as specified by MMS.


<R05>
Sec. 285.532  What happens if my surety wants to terminate the period of liability of my bond?

    (a) Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period 
during which surety liability continues to accrue. The surety continues 
to be responsible for obligations and liabilities that accrued during 
the period of liability and before the date on which MMS terminates the 
period of liability under paragraph (b) of this section. The liabilities 
that accrue during a period of liability include:
    (1) Obligations that started to accrue before the beginning of the 
period of liability and have not been met; and
    (2) Obligations that began accruing during the period of liability.
    (b) Your surety must submit to MMS its request to terminate the 
period of liability under its bond and notify you of that request. If 
you intend to continue activities, or have not met all obligations of 
your lease or grant, you must provide a replacement bond or alternative 
form of financial assurance of equivalent or greater value. The MMS will 
terminate that period of liability within 90 days after MMS receives the 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 285.533  How does my surety obtain cancellation of my bond?

    (a) The MMS will release a bond or allow a surety to cancel a bond, 
and will relieve the surety from accrued obligations only if:
    (1) The MMS determines that there are no outstanding obligations 
covered by the bond; or
    (2) The following occurs:
    (i) The MMS accepts a replacement bond or an alternative form of 
financial assurance in an amount equal to or greater than the bond to be 
cancelled to cover the terminated period of liability;
    (ii) The surety issuing the new bond has expressly agreed to assume 
all outstanding liabilities under the original bond that accrued during 
the period of liability that was terminated; and
    (iii) The surety issuing the new bond has agreed to assume that 
portion of the outstanding liabilities that accrued

[[Page 460]]

during the terminated period of liability that exceeds the coverage of 
the bond prescribed under Sec. Sec. 285.515, 285.516, 285.520, or 
285.521, and of which you were notified.
    (b) When your lease or grant ends, your surety(ies) remain(s) 
responsible, and MMS will retain any financial assurance as follows:
    (1) The period of liability ends when you cease all operations and 
activities under the lease or grant, including decommissioning and site 
clearance;
    (2) Your surety or collateral financial assurance will not be 
released until 7 years after the lease ends, or a longer period as 
necessary to complete any appeals or judicial litigation related to your 
bonded obligation, or for MMS to determine that all of your obligations 
under the lease or grant have been satisfied; and
    (3) The MMS will reduce the amount of your bond or return a portion 
of your financial assurance if we determine that we need less than the 
full amount of the bond or financial assurance to meet any possible 
future obligations.

responsible, and MMS will retain any pledged security as shown in the 
following table:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29AP09.113


<R05>
Sec. 285.535  Why might MMS call for forfeiture of my bond?

    (a) The MMS may call for forfeiture of all or part of the bond, 
pledged security, or other form of guaranty if:
    (1) After notice and demand for performance by MMS, you refuse or 
fail, within the timeframe we prescribe, to comply with any term or 
condition of your lease or grant, other authorization or approval, or 
applicable regulations; or
    (2) You default on one of the conditions under which we accepted 
your bond.

[[Page 461]]

    (b) We may pursue forfeiture without first making demands for 
performance against any co-lessee or holder of an interest in your ROW 
or RUE, or other person approved to perform obligations under your lease 
or grant.


<R05>
Sec. 285.536  How will I be notified of a call for forfeiture?

    (a) The MMS will notify you and your surety, including any provider 
of financial assurance, in writing of the call for forfeiture and 
provide the reasons for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited. 
We will base the amount upon an estimate of the total cost of corrective 
action to bring your lease or grant into compliance.
    (b) We will advise you and your surety that you may avoid forfeiture 
if, within 10 business days:
    (1) You agree to and demonstrate in writing to MMS that you will 
bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe we 
prescribe, and you do so; or
    (2) Your surety agrees to and demonstrates that it will bring your 
lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe we prescribe, even 
if the cost of compliance exceeds the face amount of the bond.


<R05>
Sec. 285.537  How will MMS proceed once my bond or other security is forfeited?

    (a) If MMS determines that your bond or other security is forfeited, 
we will collect the forfeited amount and use the funds to bring your 
lease or grant(s) into compliance and correct any default.
    (b) If the amount collected under your bond or other security is 
insufficient to pay the full cost of corrective action, MMS may take or 
direct action to obtain full compliance and recover all costs in excess 
of the forfeited bond from you or any co-lessee or co-grantee.
    (c) If the amount collected under your bond or other security 
exceeds the full cost of corrective action to bring your lease or 
grant(s) into compliance, we will return the excess funds to the party 
from whom the excess was collected.

Sec. Sec. 285.538-285.539  [Reserved]

                       Revenue Sharing With States


<R05>
Sec. 285.540  How will MMS equitably distribute revenues to States?

    (a) The MMS will distribute among the eligible coastal States 27 
percent of the following revenues derived from qualified projects, where 
a qualified project and qualified project area is determined in Sec. 
285.541 and an eligible State is determined in Sec. 285.542, with each 
term defined in Sec. 285.112. Revenues subject to distribution to 
eligible States include all bonuses, acquisition fees, rentals, and 
operating fees derived from the entire qualified project area and 
associated project easements not limited to revenues attributable to the 
portion of the project area within 3 miles of the seaward boundary of a 
coastal State. The revenues to be shared do not include administrative 
fees such as service fees and those assessed for civil penalties and 
forfeiture of bond or other surety obligations.
    (b) The project area is the area included within a single lease or 
grant. For each qualified project, MMS will determine and announce the 
project area and its geographic center at the time it grants or issues a 
lease, easement, or right-of-way on the OCS. If a qualified project 
lease or grant's boundaries change significantly due to actions pursuant 
to Sec. Sec. 285.435 or 285.436, MMS will re-evaluate the project area 
to determine whether the geographic center has changed. If it has, MMS 
will re-determine State eligibility and shares accordingly.
    (c) To determine each eligible State's share of the 27 percent of 
the revenues for a qualified project, MMS will use the inverse distance 
formula, which apportions shares according to the relative proximity of 
the nearest point on the coastline of each eligible State to the 
geographic center of the qualified project area. If S<INF>i</INF> is 
equal to the nearest distance from the geographic center of the project 
area to the i = 1, 2, ... nth eligible State's coastline, then eligible 
State i would be entitled to the fraction F<INF>i</INF> of the 27-
percent aggregate revenue share due to all the eligible States according 
to the formula:

F<INF>i</INF> = (1/S<INF>i</INF>) / ([Sigma] <INF>i=1</INF> ... 
    <INF>n</INF> (1/S<INF>i</INF>)).

[[Page 462]]


<R05>
Sec. 285.541  What is a qualified project for revenue sharing purposes?

    A qualified project for the purpose of revenue sharing with eligible 
coastal States is one authorized under subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands 
Act, which includes acreage within the area extending 3 nautical miles 
seaward of State submerged lands. A qualified project is subject to 
revenue sharing with those States that are eligible for revenue sharing 
under Sec. 285.542. The entire area within a lease or grant for the 
qualified project, excluding project easements, is considered the 
qualified project area.


<R05>
Sec. 285.542  What makes a State eligible for payment of revenues?

    A State is eligible for payment of revenues if any part of the 
State's coastline is located within 15 miles of the announced geographic 
center of the project area of a qualified project. A State is not 
eligible for revenue sharing if all parts of that State's coastline are 
more than 15 miles from the announced geographic center of the qualified 
project area. This is the case even if the qualified project area is 
located wholly or partially within an area extending 3 nautical miles 
seaward of the submerged lands of that State or if there are no States 
with a coastline less than 15 miles from the announced geographic center 
of the qualified project area.


<R05>
Sec. 285.543  Example of how the inverse distance formula works.

    (a) Assume that the geographic center of the project area lies 12 
miles from the closest coastline point of State A and 4 miles from the 
closest coastline point of State B. The MMS will round dollar shares to 
the nearest whole dollar. The proportional share due each State would be 
calculated as follows:
    (1) State A's share = [(\1/12\) / (\1/12\ + \1/4\)] = \1/4\.
    (2) State B's share = [\1/4\) / (\1/12\ + \1/4\)] = \3/4\.
    (b) Therefore, State B would receive a share of revenues that is 
three times as large as that awarded to State A, based on the finding 
that State B's nearest coastline is one-third the distance to the 
geographic center of the qualified project area as compared to State A's 
nearest coastline. Eligible States share the 27 percent of the total 
revenues from the qualified project as mandated under the OCS Lands Act. 
Hence, if the qualified project generates $1,000,000 of Federal revenues 
in a given year, the Federal Government would distribute the States' 27-
percent share as follows:
    (1) State A's share = $270,000 x \1/4\ = $67,500.
    (2) State B's share = $270,000 x \3/4\ = $202,500.

decommissioning obligations for facilities on their grant, including all 
obstructions, as the obligations accrue and until each obligation is 
met.


<R05>
Sec. 285.901  When do I accrue decommissioning obligations?

    You accrue decommissioning obligations when you are or become a 
lessee or grant holder, and you either install, construct, or acquire by 
an MMS-approved assignment a facility, cable, or pipeline, or you create 
an obstruction to other uses of the OCS.

[[Page 501]]


<R05>
Sec. 285.902  What are the general requirements for decommissioning for 

facilities authorized under my SAP, COP, or GAP?

    (a) An Alternate Use RUE must be issued on a competitive basis 
unless MMS determines, after public notice of the proposed Alternate Use 
RUE, that there is no competitive interest.
    (b) We will issue a public notice in the Federal Register to 
determine if there is competitive interest in using the proposed 
facility for alternate use activities. The MMS will specify a time 
period for members of the public to express competitive interest.
    (c) If we receive indications of competitive interest within the 
published timeframe, we will proceed with a competitive offering. As 
part of such competitive offering, each competing applicant must submit 
a description of the types of activities proposed for the existing 
facility, as well as satisfactory evidence that the competing applicant 
qualifies to hold a lease or grant on the OCS, as required in Sec. Sec. 
285.106 and 285.107, by a date we specify. We may request additional 
information from competing applicants, as necessary, to adequately 
evaluate the competing proposals.
    (d) We will evaluate all competing proposals to determine whether:
    (1) The proposed activities are compatible with existing activities 
at the facility; and
    (2) We have the expertise and resources available to regulate the 
activities effectively.
    (e) We will evaluate all proposals under the requirements of NEPA, 
CZMA, and other applicable laws.
    (f) Following our evaluation, we will select one or more acceptable 
proposals for activities involving the alternate use of an existing OCS 
facility, notify the competing applicants, and submit each acceptable 
proposal to the lessee and owner of the existing OCS facility. If the 
lessee and owner of the facility agree to accept a proposal, we will 
proceed to issue an Alternate Use RUE. If the lessee and owner of the 
facility are unwilling to accept any of the proposals that we deem 
acceptable, we will not issue an Alternate Use RUE.

    For your appeal to be filed, MMS must receive all of the following 
within 60 days after you receive the decision or order:
    (a) A written Notice of Appeal together with a copy of the decision 
or order you are appealing in the office of the OMM officer that issued 
the decision or order. You cannot extend the 60-day period for that 
office to receive your Notice of Appeal; and
    (b) A nonrefundable processing fee of $150 paid with the Notice of 
Appeal.
    (1) You must pay electronically through Pay.gov at: https://
www.pay.gov/paygov/, and you must include a copy of the Pay.gov 
confirmation receipt page with your Notice of Appeal.

Sec. 290.7  Do I have to comply with the decision or order while my appeal is pending?

    (a) The decision or order is effective during the 60-day period for 
filing an appeal under Sec. 290.3 unless:
    (1) OMM notifies you that the decision or order, or some portion of 
it, is suspended during this period because there is no likelihood of 
immediate and irreparable harm to human life, the environment, any 
mineral deposit, or property; or
    (2) You post a surety bond under 30 CFR 250.1409 pending the appeal 
challenging an order to pay a civil penalty.
    (b) This section applies rather than 43 CFR 4.21(a) for appeals of 
OMM orders.
    (c) After you file your appeal, IBLA may grant a stay of a decision 
or order under 43 CFR 4.21(b); however, a decision or order remains in 
effect until IBLA grants your request for a stay of the decision or 
order under appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 290.8  How do I exhaust my administrative remedies?

    (a) If you receive a decision or order issued under chapter II,

and Minerals Management or the IBLA makes a decision or order 
immediately effective notwithstanding an appeal.

    (b) If you are a party and fail to provide information MMS requires 
under paragraph (a) of this section, MMS may:
    (1) Assess civil penalties under 30 CFR part 250, subpart N;

information MMS requires under paragraph (a) of this section, MMS may 
assess civil penalties under 30 CFR part 250, subpart N.


<R05>
Sec. 291.111  How does MMS treat the confidential information I provide?

    (a) Any person who provides documents under this part in response to 
a request by MMS to inform a decision on whether open access or 
nondiscriminatory access was denied may claim that some or all of the 
information contained in a particular document is confidential. If you 
claim confidential treatment, then when you provide the document to MMS 
you must:
    (1) Provide a complete unredacted copy of the document and indicate 
on that copy that you are making a request for confidential treatment 
for some or all of the information in the document.
    (2) Provide a statement specifying the specific statutory 
justification for nondisclosure of the information for which you claim 
confidential treatment. General claims of confidentiality are not 
sufficient. You must furnish sufficient information for MMS to make an 
informed decision on the request for confidential treatment.
    (3) Provide a second copy of the document from which you have 
redacted the information for which you wish to claim confidential 
treatment. If you do not submit a second copy of the document with the 
confidential information redacted, MMS may assume that there is no 
objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety.
    (b) In making data and information you submit available to the 
public, MMS will not disclose documents exempt from disclosure under the 
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and will follow the procedures 
set forth in the implementing regulations at 43 CFR part 2 to give 
submitters an opportunity to object to disclosure.
    (c) MMS retains the right to make the determination with regard to 
any claim of confidentiality. MMS will notify you of its decision to 
deny a claim, in whole or in part, and, to the extent permitted by law, 
will give you an opportunity to respond at least 10 days before its 
public disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 291.112  What process will MMS follow in rendering a decision on whether 

a grantee or transporter has provided open and nondiscriminatory access?

    MMS will begin processing a complaint upon receipt of a processing 
fee or granting a waiver of the fee. The MMS Director will review the 
complaint, answer, and other information, and will serve all parties 
with a written decision that:
    (a) Makes findings of fact and conclusions of law; and
    (b) Renders a decision determining whether the complainant has been 
denied open and nondiscriminatory access.


<R05>
Sec. 291.113  What actions may MMS take to remedy denial of open and nondiscriminatory access?

    If the MMS Director's decision under Sec. 291.112 determines that 
the grantee or transporter has not provided open access or 
nondiscriminatory access, then the decision will describe the actions 
MMS will take to require the grantee or transporter to remedy the denial 
of open access or nondiscriminatory access. The remedies MMS would 
require

[[Page 514]]

must be consistent with MMS's statutory authority, regulations, and any 
limits thereon due to Congressional delegations to other agencies. 
Actions MMS may take include, but are not limited to:
    (a) Ordering grantees and transporters to provide open and 
nondiscriminatory access to the complainant;
    (b) Assessing civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day under 30 CFR 
part 250, subpart N, for failure to comply with an MMS order to provide 
open access or nondiscriminatory access. Penalties will begin to accrue 
60 days after the grantee or transporter receives the order to provide 
open and nondiscriminatory access if it has not provided such access by 
that time. However, if MMS determines that requiring the construction of 
facilities would be an appropriate remedy under the OCSLA, penalties 
will begin to accrue 10 days after conclusion of diligent construction 
of needed facilities or 60 days after the grantee or transporter 
receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access, 
whichever is later, if it has not provided such access by that time;
    (c) Requesting the Attorney General to institute a civil action in 
the appropriate United States District Court under 43 U.S.C. 1350(a) for 
a temporary restraining order, injunction, or other appropriate remedy 
to enforce the open and nondiscriminatory access requirements of 43 
U.S.C. 1334(e) and (f)(1)(A); or
    (d) Initiating a proceeding to forfeit the right-of-way grant under 
43 U.S.C. 1334(e).

Sec. 291.114  How do I appeal to the IBLA?

    Any party, except as provided in Sec. 291.115(b), adversely 
affected by a decision of the MMS Director under this part may appeal to 
the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) under the procedures in 43 CFR 
part 4, subpart E.


<R05>
Sec. 291.115  How do I exhaust administrative remedies?

    (a) If the MMS Director issues a decision under this part but does

Sec. 402.11  Technology-development project applications.

    (a) Grant awards will be used to support those portions of the 
program for which the principal purpose is other than as described in 
Sec. 402.11(b). Program announcements and applications will be governed 
by the same procedures provided in Sec. 402.10.
    (b) If it is determined that the principal purpose of a planned 
award (or awards) is to acquire goods or services for the direct benefit 
or use of the Government, the action must be regarded as a procurement 
contract. A competitive solicitation prepared in accordance with 
applicable acquisition regulations will be issued to interested parties. 
Notification of the availability of any contract solicitation will be 
published in the Commerce Business Daily, unless waived in accordance 
with Sec. 5.202 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Contracts 
may be awarded without full and open competition only if justified in 
accordance with FAR subpart 6.3.

engineering personnel. Utilizing the criteria for evaluation identified 
in the applicable announcement, each reviewer will assign a technical 
score.
    (2) Grant applications with low technical ratings will be screened 
out, and the remaining grant applications will be rank-ordered by review 
panels.
    (3) USGS program officials will compile a single, consolidated rank-
ordered list of the grant applications based on technical scoring, 
program needs and published priorities, and the available Federal funds.
    (b) Contracts. Proposals for contract awards will be evaluated by a 
USGS panel. Contracts will be awarded according to procedures contained 
in the FAR, the Department of the Interior Acquisition Regulation, and 
in acquisition policy releases issued by the Department and by the USGS.
